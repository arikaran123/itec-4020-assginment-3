PRESSER:  For purposes of our written record --     9           I am Stefan Presser --     10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You better identify yourself.    11                    MR. PRESSER:  I am Stefan Presser of the American    12           Civil Liberties Union.  At this time plaintiffs would call    13           Barry Steinhardt, who is the associate director of the    14           American Civil Liberties Union, to the witness stand.  And as    15           he makes his way forward we would also introduce -- or ask    16           permission to introduce his signed declaration of March 27th,    17           which was filed with this Court on March 28th, as the direct    18           testimony.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have any objection?    20                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honors, Craig Blackwell again.    21           Yes, the Government has a partial objection to the    22           introduction of Mr. Steinhardt's affidavit.  There are    23           certain paragraphs in the affidavit that report the substance    24           of telephone conversations and meetings between Mr.    25           Steinhardt and members of two commercial entities, New Media                                                                           159     1           Publishing and First Data Security.  I believe the paragraphs     2           are 26, 27, 28, 29, 32 and 33, they're out-of-court     3           statements offered for their truth and they are classic     4           hearsay.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll accept it for what it's     6           worth, consistent with our ruling throughout.  But continue     7           to object, to the extent that you haven't, so it's on the     8           record.     9                    BARRY STEINHARDT, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.    10                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, you may be seated.     11           Please state and spell your name.    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it's Barry, B-a-r-r-y,    13           Steinhardt, S-t-e-i-n-h-a-r-d, as in David, -t, as in Tom.    14                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION    15           BY MR. BLACKWELL:      16           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Steinhardt.  Could you state for the    17           record your position at the ACLU?    18           A   Associate director of the national office of the ACLU.    19           Q   And you're also an attorney, correct?    20           A   That's correct, yes.    21           Q   The ACLU has two Internet sites, right?    22           A   No, the ACLU has one Internet site, we also have -- we    23           are also an information provider on America Online.    24           Q   And your Internet site, it's a Worldwide Website,    25           correct?                                                                           160     1           A   Yes.     2           Q   And it's open to anyone with access to the Internet?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   You're site on America Online is open only to America     5           Online subscribers, correct?     6           A   That's correct, yes.     7           Q   The material that the ACLU posts on its Website and     8           America Online sites deal with civil liberties issues,     9           correct?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 149, which should    12           be in the binder in front of you?    13           A   Okay.    14           Q   That's the ACLU's home page on its Internet Worldwide    15           Website?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   Now --    18           A   Rather, it's its home page as it appeared at the time    19           when this was downloaded, because the home page changes from    20           time to time.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Please talk a little more clearly.     22           Sorry.    23                    THE WITNESS:  Rather, it's its home -- that is the    24           home page as it existed at the time this particular image was    25           downloaded, we do change the home page from time to time.                                                                           161     1           BY MR. BLACKWELL:       2           Q   Has it changed since it was downloaded as it was     3           reflected by Exhibit 149?     4           A   Yes, it has.     5           Q   In what sense?     6           A   There is a second -- underneath the image, "Will justice     7           prevail," where it says, "Tune in to debates," there is a     8           second link; I don't remember precisely what that link is,     9           but I noticed looking last night that there was a single link    10           that had been added.    11           Q   But everything else is the same?    12           A   For the most part, yes.    13           Q   Okay.  Now, on the right-hand side of the center icon    14           there are numerous topics that make up the ACLU's content    15           that it posts on the site, correct?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   And the topics include, I'll name a few, separation of    18           church and state?    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   Criminal justice?    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   Cyberliberties?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   Free speech?    25           A   Yes.                                                                           162     1           Q   Lesbian and gay rights?     2           A   Yes.     3           Q   Students rights?     4           A   Yes.     5           Q   And the rest of them are reflected there in that column     6           on the right?     7           A   Yes, they are.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me just for a minute.  To     9           put the minds of those of you in the courtroom at ease as to    10           what's going on, we have just received word that there may be    11           a fire, but it's not in this building.    12                    (Laughter.)    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the Marshals are here and    14           presumably they'll come -- since they're not angry at all of    15           us, presumably they'll come and get us or advise us if    16           anything happens that we should know about it.  So, although    17           it's a little -- you may have some concern or wonder.  I'm    18           sorry to interrupt, Mr. Blackwell, but I saw Mr. Coppolino    19           turn around.    20                    (Laughter.)    21                    MR. BLACKWELL:  I hope he's watching my back.    22                    THE COURT:  He's watching all of you, my guess is.    23                    (Laughter.)    24           BY MR. BLACKWELL:      25           Q   Mr. Steinhardt, the material that the ACLU posts on its                                                                           163     1           Worldwide Website and America Online sites are in the ACLU's     2           view educational, correct?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   And also in the ACLU's view the materials are     5           informational?     6           A   The -- yes, but we don't control all of the postings to     7           our AOL site.     8           Q   To the extent the ACLU posts content, it's in its view     9           educational or informational -- and/or?    10           A   Related to civil liberties, yes.    11           Q   On the America Online site, but not on the Website, the    12           ACLU also permits users to post messages on bulletin boards,    13           correct?    14           A   That's correct.    15           Q   And there are about a dozen bulletin board topics?    16           A   There are actually, since we spoke at the deposition I    17           checked, there are 20 of them.    18           Q   20 topics?    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   And the topics of the bulletin boards are designated by    21           the ACLU, correct?    22           A   That's correct, yes.    23           Q   And those topics also relate to civil liberties issues?    24           A   That's correct.    25           Q   Which correspond roughly to the topics that are on the                                                                           164     1           right-hand side of Exhibit 149?     2           A   Roughly speaking, yes.     3           Q   Now, on the America Online site and, again, but not on     4           the Website, the ACLU also has so-called auditorium events,     5           correct?     6           A   That is correct, although we do publish the transcripts     7           of some of those auditorium events on the Website.     8           Q   But the events themselves happen only on the America     9           Online site, correct?    10           A   At this point, yes.    11           Q   Could you briefly explain for the Court what the    12           auditorium events are?    13           A   An auditorium event would be a session where a guest    14           speaker would be brought in and would take questions from    15           both a host, who is generally an ACLU staff person, and from    16           subscribers through America Online who would post those    17           questions by electronic mail essentially and then the    18           responses would appear, they are real-time conversations that    19           take place.    20           Q   Now, the guests for these events are chosen by the ACLU,    21           correct?    22           A   That's correct, yes.    23           Q   And the guest is responding to questions posed by America    24           Online users?    25           A   Yes.                                                                           165     1           Q   Now, there is a moderator for these events who is an ACLU     2           employee who chooses what questions to pass on to the     3           speaker, correct?     4           A   It's either an ACLU employee or a volunteer who has been     5           trained to be a moderator.     6           Q   But the point is that the moderator passes -- chooses     7           which questions to pass to the speaker, right?     8           A   Yes.     9           Q   And the users that are participating in the auditorium    10           events see only the question that the speaker answers,    11           correct?    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   Now, the guests for these forums are nationally-known    14           personalities who speak on civil liberties-type issues,    15           right?    16           A   That's generally true, yes.    17           Q   I'm sorry?    18           A   That is generally true, yes.    19           Q   Guests have included the former Surgeon General of the    20           United States, Dr. Jocelyn Elders, correct?    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   Who spoke, among other things, about the reasons why she    23           was dismissed by President Clinton?    24           A   Yes, she spoke specifically about her references to    25           masturbation, yes.                                                                           166     1           Q   And users participating in the forum discussed the     2           appropriateness of the President's response to her comments     3           about masturbation?     4           A   Yes, they did, both there and in bulletin boards     5           following Dr. Elders' appearance in this auditorium.     6           Q   And you're concerned that those discussions about     7           masturbation in the context of Dr. Elders' firing by     8           President Clinton may be covered by the Communications     9           Decency Act, correct?    10           A   Well, there is language in certainly many of the bulletin    11           board postings that's very similar to that which caused the    12           FCC to bring action against Pacifica and Infinity    13           Broadcasting.  So, yes, to the extent to which it is the    14           Government's position that it is the same standard I am very    15           concerned, yes.    16           Q   You're concerned about the Elders comments?    17           A   I am less concerned about the auditorium event than I am    18           concerned about the bulletin boards where individual America    19           Online subscribers discussed Dr. Elders' appearance and, in    20           particular, masturbation and used street language, yes.    21           Q   Now, also on the America Online site, but not on the    22           Website, the ACLU has a chat room?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   Where users can discuss current events, right?    25           A   Yes.                                                                           167     1           Q   And react to the events in other civil liberties issues?     2           A   Yes.     3           Q   And sometimes the ACLU sets topics for discussion in the     4           chat room, correct?     5           A   Yes.     6           Q   And, again, those topics would be civil liberties issue     7           oriented?     8           A   Yes.     9           Q   Mr. Steinhardt, could you turn to Defense Exhibit 155?    10                    (Pause.)    11           A   Okay.    12           Q   Now, the ACLU has posted on line the complete text of the    13           United States Supreme Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica,    14           right?    15           A   That's correct.    16           Q   And this is a downloaded version of that on-line posting,    17           correct?    18           A   Yes.    19           Q   Now, the full text of the opinion includes the Carlin    20           monologue that was at issue --    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   -- as part of the Supreme Court's opinion?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   And the ACLU is concerned that by virtue of posting the    25           Supreme Court's decision in Pacifica it may be subject to                                                                           168     1           liability under the Communications Decency Act, correct?     2           A   Well, we have chosen to draw attention to those words as     3           part of the -- part of the decision, yes, and they also     4           reappear certainly in the America Online bulletin boards.     5           Q   But you're specifically concerned about the Pacifica     6           decision to the extent it repeats the Carlin monologue in the     7           Supreme Court's decision, correct?     8           A   It got Pacifica in a certain amount of trouble, yes.     9           Q   So, you are concerned?    10           A   Yes, certainly.    11           Q   Now, if you could turn to Exhibit 158?  The ACLU has also    12           posted on line an abridged version, I guess, of the amicus    13           brief it filed in the United States Supreme Court in the    14           Pacifica case, right?    15           A   Yes.  It's actually the introductory portions of the    16           brief, yes.    17           Q   Right.  And this is what Exhibit 158 is, a downloaded    18           version of that?    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   And in that brief the ACLU sets forth the so-called seven    21           dirty words from the Carlin monologue, right?    22           A   That's correct.    23           Q   And, again, the ACLU is concerned that by virtue of    24           posting on line the brief that it filed in the United States    25           Supreme Court in the Pacifica case it may be subject to                                                                           169     1           liability under the Communications Decency Act, right?     2           A   Yes.  Again, we are concerned that by having drawn     3           attention to that particular portion of the brief we may be     4           subject to the Communications Decency Act, yes.     5           Q   By drawing attention you mean having referenced the     6           Carlin monologue in your Supreme Court brief?     7           A   Well, we have as part of our Website a feature which     8           allows individuals who are -- who visit our Website to in     9           effect guess at the seven dirty words and then we take them,    10           after they submit their answers we take them to the Pacifica    11           decision.  So, yes, we have gone about -- attempt -- we do    12           that for a purpose, the purpose is to illustrate that there    13           is a changing view of what is a filthy word or what is an    14           indecent word and that not everyone -- that everyone has a    15           different understanding of that.  But, yes, we have chosen to    16           draw attention to those seven words in the decision as    17           opposed to other portions of the decision.    18           Q   Now, the feature you're describing is in Exhibit 156 and    19           157 of the Defendants' Exhibit notebook, right?    20           A   Give me one second, please... yes.    21           Q   And you're not specifically concerned that those two    22           exhibits are in fact covered by the Communications Decency    23           Act, right?    24           A   Not the two exhibits themselves.    25           Q   Now, the ACLU has also posted on line an abridged version                                                                           170     1           of the brief it filed in the U. S. Supreme Court in the Cohen     2           v. California case, correct?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   Is that at Exhibit 160, Defense Exhibit?     5           A   That's correct, yes.     6           Q   Now, again, the ACLU is concerned that this brief it     7           filed in the Cohen case in the U. S. Supreme Court may be     8           covered by the Communications Decency Act, correct?     9           A   Yes.    10           Q   Now, the ACLU does not post or otherwise include in its    11           on-line materials sexually-explicit pictures, does it?    12           A   Well, not at this point, but that's simply because what    13           we post relates to generally current controversies that are    14           involved in.  So, for example, had this Website been up a few    15           years ago when the Mapplethorpe exhibit, which was a matter    16           that we worked on, was very much a live controversy we would    17           not have hesitated to post those images, which as I recall    18           were both were sexual nature and also some of them excretory.    19           Q   You mean posting images of Robert Mapplethorpe's    20           pictures?    21           A   Yes, yes, we would not hesitate to do that if it were    22           relevant to a current civil liberties controversy.    23           Q   But just so I can get an answer to the question, the ACLU    24           does not post sexually-explicit pictures at this point,    25           correct?                                                                           171     1           A   Our Website has only been up for about six weeks, we     2           haven't put any up yet, but we certainly don't have any     3           policy or intention not to.     4           Q   Okay.  And you also haven't posted pictures of sexual     5           acts, correct, of couples engaged in sexual acts?     6           A   No, but there are postings certainly to the AOL site     7           which are textual descriptions, yes.     8           Q   But you haven't posted pictures of couples engaged in     9           sexual acts?    10           A   No.    11           Q   And you also haven't posted pictures of excretory    12           activities, correct?    13           A   No, although some of the -- I should add that we have    14           links in our Website, also in AOL to some of the other    15           plaintiffs in this case who do have at least illustrations    16           which are sexual in nature.    17           Q   And which plaintiffs are you referring to?    18           A   Well, for example, Planned Parenthood of America has a    19           image on its Website which shows how to properly place a    20           condom on a penis, so that seems to be sexual in nature.    21                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Can I have one minute, your Honor?    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.    23                    (Pause.)    24           BY MR. BLACKWELL:      25           Q   You said your Website has only been up for six weeks?                                                                           172     1           A   Eight -- I'm sorry, if I think about it the date would be     2           seven or eight weeks since it's been publicly announced, yes.     3           Q   How about the AOL site?     4           A   Approximately a year.     5           Q   Now, individuals can apply for membership to the ACLU     6           through the ACLU's Worldwide Website, right?     7           A   Yes.     8           Q   And they can pay on-line with a credit card, correct?     9           A   Yes.    10           Q   In the next few months the ACLU is going to offer    11           merchandise for sale through its on-line site, right?    12           A   That's correct, yes.    13           Q   Things like books, posters, pamphlets, bumper stickers,    14           things like that, right?    15           A   That's pretty much the catalogue, yes.    16           Q   And users will be able to buy the merchandise with a    17           credit card?    18           A   Yes, they will.    19           Q   And the ACLU leases space on a secure server to handle    20           these credit card transactions, right?    21           A   Yes, we do.    22           Q   And by secure we mean that the information, the credit    23           card information that's transmitted is encrypted in some way?    24           A   That's correct, yes, although not everyone has a browser    25           which permits them to use a secure server, but about 70 or 80                                                                           173     1           percent do.     2           Q   Now, in your affidavit, Mr. Steinhardt -- do you have it     3           in front of you?     4           A   If you'll give me a moment... okay.     5           Q   Page 15, Paragraph 29.     6           A   Okay.     7           Q   You estimate there that assuming a level of traffic at     8           the ACLU Website equivalent to that of February, '96,     9           assuming that level of traffic at the site it would cost the    10           ACLU approximately $144,000 per month to verify credit card    11           information for visitors to the site, is that right?    12           A   Well, I assumed it for that month since we don't have a    13           great deal of experience so far with the Website, I'm not    14           prepared to estimate the average monthly usage, so that this    15           estimate is based on what it would have cost in that month.    16           Q   And the cost was 144,000, correct?    17           A   That's correct.    18           Q   Now, that figure assumes that the ACLU would be required    19           to verify credit card information for every visitor to the    20           Website, right?    21           A   It does.    22           Q   No matter what any particular visitor actually looks at    23           at the site, right?    24           A   We don't -- when a visitor enters the site we don't    25           necessarily know what their intention is, which pages they're                                                                           174     1           going to want to access.     2           Q   But the figure does -- would include an individual who     3           just goes to the home page and goes no further, correct?     4           A   That's correct.     5           Q   That person would be included in your $144,000 figure,     6           correct?     7           A   That's correct, but we have no idea -- no -- at the     8           outset when the person enters the home page whether or not     9           they intend to go to a different page.    10           Q   Not every visitor to the ACLU site presumably accesses    11           the posting of the Supreme Court's decision in Pacifica,    12           right?    13           A   No, although a large percentage in that initial month    14           did.    15           Q   Now, you have participated in the creation of a Web page?    16           A   I participated in the creation of the ACLU's Website,    17           yes.    18           Q   And you're generally familiar with HTML programming?    19           A   Generally.    20           Q   And that type of programming is becoming increasingly    21           easy to do, isn't it, in your --    22           A   In its simplest forms, yes.    23           Q   Now, the ACLU plans to offer in the near future audio    24           transmissions through its Website, correct?    25           A   Yes.                                                                           175     1           Q   And it plans to offer transmissions of things like     2           speeches and interviews, right?     3           A   That's correct, yes.     4           Q   And users will be able to hear actually the speech or     5           interview on their home computer, correct?     6           A   Yes.     7           Q   And the ACLU also plans to use audio capabilities for     8           their chat rooms?     9           A   At some point, yes.    10           Q   So, users will be able to through their home computers    11           hear themselves conversing in the chat room?    12           A   At some point, yes.    13           Q   And it also plans to offer in the near future video    14           transmissions through its Website, right?    15           A   Well, it depends how you define near future.  The three    16           things you have mentioned, the audio transmissions would be    17           first, and probably the video second, and ultimately the chat    18           rooms would feature some audio capability.    19           Q   But you do plan to offer video transmissions at some    20           point through the Website?    21           A   We're going to try to keep up with the technology as it    22           evolves, yes.    23           Q   And you're going to offer transmissions of things like    24           speeches and interviews?    25           A   Yes.                                                                           176     1           Q   I'm talking about video now?     2           A   Yes.     3           Q   And users will be able to see a video of a speech while     4           they're sitting at their home computer, right?     5           A   Well, it's my understanding that at the moment the     6           technology hasn't quite gotten there in terms of a good image     7           that's available immediately.  We experimented, for example,     8           on Martin Luther King Day with the possibility of showing a     9           portion of the "I Have a Dream" speech, but at some point,    10           yes, it will get there.    11           Q   It will get there.  And you expect to offer interactive    12           video features at some point as well, correct?    13           A   We haven't discussed that, I don't know.  I would -- I    14           don't know.    15           Q   Thank you, Mr. Steinhardt.    16                    MR. BLACKWELL:  I have no further questions at this    17           point.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.    19                    MR. PRESSER:  One or two, your Honor.    20                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION    21           BY MR. PRESSER:      22           Q   Mr. Steinhardt, in response to the Government's inquiries    23           concerning whether or not we presently portray pictures on    24           our Websites or on America Online you discussed that we might    25           to the extent that we were involved in particular cases, has                                                                           177     1           the American Civil Liberties Union recently been involved in     2           the Jake Baker case?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   Can -- for the record --     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What case?     6                    MR. PRESSER:  For the Jake Baker case, your Honor.     7           BY MR. PRESSER:       8           Q   And, for the record, can you describe for the Court what     9           that case entailed?    10           A   Jake Baker was a student at the University of Michigan    11           who was involved in two controversies, which -- arguably    12           which both -- both of which ultimately resulted in an    13           unsuccessful prosecution:  He both posted stories, they were    14           clearly fictional works, to some of the alt.sex bulletin    15           boards and he also engaged in what appeared to many of us to    16           have been a -- some fantasy conversations, E-mail    17           conversations, private conversations with another individual    18           who described himself as Arthur Ganda or Uganda, it was    19           probably a pseudonym.  Baker was prosecuted in Detroit on    20           charges essentially of conspiring to commit a kidnapping.     21           The ACLU did participate as amicus before the district court,    22           the district court dismissed the charges.    23           Q   Can I ask you to look at the Government's Exhibit 164 and    24           would you identify that document for me, sir?    25           A   Yes, this is a posting to one of our bulletin boards on                                                                           178     1           America Online in which the posters who described themselves,     2           if you look at the from section, it says from the ACLU.  That     3           is not the American Civil Liberties Union, that is another     4           group which stands for Always Causing Legal Unrest, which     5           regards itself as sort of a shadow of the ACLU, and we so far     6           have chosen not to enforce our trademark rights.  The -- and     7           what they have done, or an individual who says that he or she     8           represents them, is to post one of Jake Baker's stories to     9           the ACLU bulletin board.  It is -- we chose to -- and also in    10           the opening paragraph to criticize the ACLU, the American    11           Civil Liberties Union.  We chose to allow those -- that    12           posting to stand.    13           Q   And why did we do that?    14           A   Because we believe that everyone has a right to free,    15           speech even if we disagree with them, and it certainly would    16           have made a very contrary point had we taken that off.    17           Q   And what if any concerns as a result of this posting and    18           as a result of the passage of the law that is in question    19           here do we have about this posting and others of its ilk?    20           A   Well, this posting is a very explicit discussion of not    21           only sexual activity, but what I would describe as a rape,    22           and it is -- it initially at least is what resulted in Jake    23           Baker being investigated by the U. S. Attorney's Office in    24           Detroit.  So, this goes I think probably -- arguably goes    25           beyond indecency, but certainly could be regarded as -- by                                                                           179     1           some as indecent.     2           Q   Can I get you to look at Exhibits 162 and 163 of the     3           Government's submission?     4           A   Okay.     5           Q   Can you identify -- let's start with 162, can you     6           identify that document for the Court?     7           A   Again, 162 is a posting to one of our bulletin boards,     8           the subject line there, "recently TOSsed," which the letters     9           T-O-S are capitalized, I believe is a reference to America    10           Online's terms of service.  This was a section of the    11           bulletin board in which individuals discussed the America    12           Online terms of service and posted some of them, posted    13           material which either had been or they believe would have    14           been subject to the terms of service.  In 162 it's a poem    15           entitled "Jesus Wore High Tops," again it contains explicit    16           sexual language and descriptions.  And I believe you asked    17           about 163 as well?    18           Q   163, Mr. Steinhardt.    19           A   This is a post -- again, a posting, the subject of which,    20           "Our words are words."  I don't recall specifically which    21           topic area this was in, but I have a concern that the poem at    22           the bottom of the posting, which uses a number of words which    23           might be regarded as indecent, at least one of which I recall    24           is among the seven words in the Carlin case, that goes on to    25           Page 2, that those -- that the posting of this poem might be                                                                           180     1           regarded as an act of indecency.     2                    MR. PRESSER:  I have no further questions, your     3           Honor.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government have any     5           redirect?     6                    MR. BLACKWELL:  No, your Honor.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't have any question, do     8           you, I mean, as somebody who has litigated in this field for     9           a long time, that these last exhibits would be considered    10           patently offensive to some parts of the community?    11                    THE WITNESS:  I... I'm having difficulty    12           understanding precisely what the statute is attempting to    13           reach, but I certainly know that many -- there are many    14           communities in which these postings would be regarded as    15           patently offensive, yes.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  These particular ones?    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, leaving these aside, because I    19           guess my question was superseded by the last couple of    20           questions of Mr. Presser, I think it might be fair to say    21           that you are an expert in matters relating to free speech and    22           legal affairs relating to free speech in this country, do you    23           -- modesty not withstanding, would you accept that?    24                    (Laughter.)    25                    THE WITNESS:  I'm certainly familiar, very familiar,                                                                           181     1           yes, your Honor.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How realistic or maybe exaggerated     3           do you think your concern and the concern expressed     4           throughout is the concern that if you put Hamlet on line or     5           the Bible on line, which came up in some colloquy between the     6           Court and some witnesses for the plaintiff, that would     7           subject them, one, to being prosecuted and, two, to being     8           convicted?     9                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's been our experience as an    10           organization that represents many people who have been the    11           victims of what we regard as censorship that community    12           standards do vary and that not infrequently the kind of    13           material that the Court and I might view as artistic or as    14           having merit --    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, talk about yourself and the    16           Court will talk about itself.    17                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  The kind of material that    18           you referenced, your Honor, has been the subject of efforts    19           of censorship, that's the kind of material that has been    20           removed from high school libraries, that is the kind of    21           material that has been removed from public libraries or there    22           have been attempts to remove it from public libraries.  There    23           are many people out there who regard that kind of material as    24           indecent.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How much does it cost, I'm not sure                                                                           182     1           you can give us an answer, how much does it cost for the ACLU     2           to engage in litigation, were it required to, either on its     3           own behalf or on behalf of somebody else to -- well, like     4           this Jake somebody case --     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Baker.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- Baker case.     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we were actually amicus in that     8           case, but we have been direct in other cases, including the     9           time for example of a staff attorney on such a case, a case    10           like this one where we have several staff attorneys work --    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, this one you're a plaintiff    12           in.    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, but where we have represented    14           other parties we could -- including the time of staff    15           attorneys, the costs can be in the hundreds of thousands of    16           dollars.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In one case?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, cases often go on for an extended    19           period of time.  Our attorneys are underpaid compared perhaps    20           to the private bar, but they still -- those of us who are    21           employed in New York still make a fairly healthy salary.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, I was just reading your    24           declaration and --     25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  They don't think so.                                                                           183     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- understanding that your     2           admissions -- what was that?     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, that was whether they make a     4           healthy salary.     5                    (Laughter.)     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Counsel is not prepared to adopt that     7           part of the testimony.     8                    (Laughter.)     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I wanted the byplay on this    10           healthy salary to continue, but --    11                    (Laughter.)    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- that's all right.    13                    THE WITNESS:  You can tell, your Honor, I'm an    14           administrator.    15                    (Laughter.)    16                    MR. HANSEN:  Labor-management problem.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, Judge Buckwalter was    18           questioning.    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's all right.  I was reading    20           your declaration about the mission and the purpose of the    21           ACLU and that it's really contrary -- or that putting any of    22           these defenses into the use is contrary to your mission, I    23           believe you stated.  And you went on to state that if you    24           were forced to bear the cost of restrictions on the use of    25           the Website by the use of -- by a debit account or an adult                                                                           184     1           access code you would shut down the Website, for how long?     2                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, I would --     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I can't -- I mean, you would     4           certainly not envision that you couldn't come back and get     5           the Website up and running again --     6                    THE WITNESS:  If we were forced to go for example to     7           credit card verification of persons who use the Website we     8           simply could not bear the expense.     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You really do?  I mean, after a    10           period of time don't you think you could get the money needed    11           to do that sort of thing?    12                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we --    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I mean, at first, sure, it's    14           going to be an expense, but once you get the program    15           together...    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there would be ongoing expenses.    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You're certainly not going to --    18           want to close your Website entirely for that reason, would    19           you?    20                    THE WITNESS:  The problem, your Honor, is that there    21           would be ongoing expenses, both to verify new users who wish    22           to use the site and also to maintain a data base, a list --    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand that.    24                    THE WITNESS:  -- of registrants.  And our site has    25           proven to be so far relatively popular.  Given the cost                                                                           185     1           estimates that we have received, the yearly -- it's not     2           possible to know precisely, but the yearly costs could be     3           from our perspective extraordinary, it would dwarf the costs     4           that -- of the site so far.     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Extraordinary in what -- do you     6           have a percentage of your --     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, as I tried to illustrate in the     8           example that appears in Paragraph 29 of my affidavit, in the     9           first month alone just the transactional cost would have been    10           $134,000, by which I mean the cost of verifying that each of    11           those -- minimum of 67,000 persons who entered our site in    12           fact had a valid credit card, and that does not include any    13           costs that would have been imposed on us by the banks to do    14           that kind of verification, which is something that we cannot    15           estimate at this point because we have been unable to locate    16           a bank which will regularly engage in the verification of    17           non-financial transactions.    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I suppose if there is a market    19           for that type of thing wouldn't that -- a market for a bank    20           to devise a verification system or something like that, won't    21           the market forces more or less make that feasible in some    22           way?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it --    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Adam Smith thought.    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Adam Smith thought, yes, right.                                                                           186     1                    THE WITNESS:  If they do -- they don't exist now and     2           I don't know what they would -- I don't know what they would     3           cost.  I do know that they would cost something and I assume     4           they would probably be a flat fee rather than a percentage,     5           since there is nothing to take a percentage of, but I can't     6           speculate at this point, nor could those persons in the     7           credit card industry that I spoke with speculate about what     8           those costs would be, but they would be -- even assuming that     9           they were, say, a dollar, they would be more than we can bear    10           at this point, significantly more than our entire on-line    11           budget.    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  It just strikes me as    13           being maybe exaggerating the suggestion, close down your    14           Website forever and ever, I can't imagine in this world a    15           cyberspace that you would do that, that you wouldn't be able    16           to find a way to, you know, keep it going and incur -- and    17           some way make the money for those additional costs.  But I    18           understand the analysis you did seem to suggest at least    19           initially it might be difficult for you to do it.    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we have limited funds, as do all    21           non-profits, and we have to make decisions on how to spend    22           those funds.  We made a decision that the current expenditure    23           that we make on the Website and on the America Online site    24           delivers a sufficient amount of program for the amount of    25           expenditure.  This kind of expenditure at least at this point                                                                           187     1           would not be justified, we would find other things --     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  At least initially it appears     3           that way, okay.     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have a few -- are you done?  I'm     6           sorry.     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, I am, thank you.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A few questions about your     9           materials.  I noticed, I think it was on the Website, that    10           you had a request to your members to communicate with    11           Attorney General Reno about this law?    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you know, does she have an E-mail    14           address?    15                    (Laughter.)    16                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know if she has an E-mail    17           address, but I can't resist telling your Honor that we    18           actually at one point published a phone number which we    19           believed was just a general line going into the Justice    20           Department and at least on two occasions that I am aware of    21           Attorney General Reno herself answered those phone calls.    22                    (Laughter.)    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Not bad.  Well, what I'm getting as    24           is I noticed in Senator Leahy's supplemental declaration that    25           he has a Website, he has an E-mail address and he says he                                                                           188     1           conducts town meetings on the Internet.     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are you aware in the course of your     4           work as to whether other Representatives and Senators do the     5           same thing?     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I couldn't give you an exact     7           percentage at this point, but a significant number of members     8           of Congress have E-mail addresses, some have Websites.  When     9           we ask our members or users of these sites to communicate    10           with members of Congress we offer them several possibilities:     11           One, if their member has an E-mail address we provide them    12           with that E-mail address --    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I was going to -- you    14           give them the E-mail address?    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Or we -- or if they have a fax    16           number, they virtually all do, we would send them a fax.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So, as far as based on    18           your personal knowledge, Senator Leahy is not unique in that    19           respect?    20                    THE WITNESS:  I think it's far from unique, yes.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  With respect to    22           Paragraph 36 of your declaration, do I understand correctly    23           that your Website provides abortifacient information?    24                    THE WITNESS:  It provides links to such information,    25           yes.                                                                           189     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  About RU46 --     2                    THE WITNESS:  46.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- and that sort of thing?     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is that a recent service since     6           February 1, 1996, or is that older?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, on the Website it is, but in our     8           normal course of business litigating in this area we     9           certainly have provided information to both clients, the    10           general public providers, and they have provided information    11           to us, discussing abortifacients and discussing abortion    12           services in general.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, this is a service that you give    14           on an ongoing basis via the Internet?    15                    THE WITNESS:  Not only by the Internet, but    16           including the Internet, yes.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And, lastly, I don't know if    18           you've been here for our discussion about the PICS idea --    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  For --    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Assuming -- pardon me?    21                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, your Honor, go ahead.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Assuming a PICS rating system    23           becomes operational this summer, would the ACLU rate itself?    24                    THE WITNESS:  Well, as I understand the PICS    25           proposal or the PICS system, it's in effect an empty vessel                                                                           190     1           into which third-party rating systems can be put.  And self-     2           rating is not required by PICS, as I understand it, having     3           read their literature.  I don't think the ACLU would choose     4           to rate itself, but I am certain that there are others who     5           would.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, the reason I ask is because,     7           as I understand the stipulation and the testimony, that the     8           default is that if you don't rate yourself you're blocked,     9           isn't that what you have all agreed to by stipulation?  Well,    10           assume it is --    11                    THE WITNESS:  I have not read that particular    12           stipulation, so I don't know.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- therefore, you wouldn't be    14           accessed by -- if you don't rate yourself you won't be    15           accessed by those who block via PICS, correct?    16                    THE WITNESS:  I'm just not certain about the factual    17           predicate of that, I don't know the answer.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But your point, I take it you're    19           high enough in the hierarchy that you can say with some    20           authority that you would not rate yourself?    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I had not understood that point    22           that -- that we would be blocked if we failed to rate, but it    23           is my understanding of PICS that there are -- that the user    24           can employ any number --    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's one of them --                                                                           191     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is the default mode, that if you     3           don't rate, you're blocked, assume that's true.     4                    THE WITNESS:  Assuming that's true?     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.     6                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not high enough up to make that     7           decision on the spur of the moment.     8                    (Laughter.)     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If you were, though, what would it    10           be?    11                    THE WITNESS:  I can't answer that, I would have to    12           think about it, it's the first time --    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And if you had to rate yourself what    14           would you rate yourself, using the motion picture rating    15           system that we've been using here?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we think that we offer material    17           that's of important educational interest to minors, so I    18           suppose we would rate ourselves G, but I can imagine that    19           there are other third parties who would rate us X.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  NC-17.    21                    THE WITNESS:  NC-17.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, that's all I have.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I would imagine as a matter of    24           principle, couldn't one deduce from the history of the ACLU,    25           about which I don't know a lot, that you might object as a                                                                           192     1           matter of principle to rating yourselves, whether or not you     2           would rate yourselves G or anything else?     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we would object to being forced     4           to rate ourselves, yes.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we're going to find out more     6           about PICS, Mr. Coppolino promised us that he would educate     7           us on that in due course, I assume.  So, we'll have to put     8           that together with this.     9                    Do you have any more?    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I don't.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Counsel?    12                    MR. PRESSER:  Nothing further, your Honor.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Government?    14                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Nothing further, your Honor.    15                    (Witness excused.)    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do I understand, Mr. Coppolino, with    17           respect to the abortifacient provision, which I think is    18           1462(c)?    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, your Honor, 18 USC, I believe.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The Government -- that part at least    21           of the statute the Government is conceding is    22           unconstitutional?    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That's what I stated at the TRO    24           hearing and --    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You did?                                                                           193     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- Attorney General Reno has so     2           stated in a letter I believe to both Speaker Gingrich and     3           Vice President Gore, as President of the Senate.  I believe     4           those are in the record, if not I can provide them to the     5           Court.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but --     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we just wanted to --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I just want to confirm that for    10           purposes of the preliminary injunction -- I know it was for    11           the TRO, but for purposes of this hearing that that is not an    12           issue, because the Government concedes the point.    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We don't believe it is an issue    14           because -- we have stated that the provision in the Justice    15           Department's view is unconstitutional.  We also indicated,    16           however, at the TRO stage that because the Attorney General    17           has indicated that there would be no prosecutions there could    18           be no demonstration of irreparable harm, and that would be    19           our position as well at the PI stage and, therefore, no need    20           for an injunction on the statute at this stage.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  Anything else?    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess not.  We will then adjourn,    23           scheduled at the moment --    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, we'll recess --    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we'll recess --                                                                           194     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- until the 12th, but I believe     2           counsel would like to see me -- unless there is something     3           else from the plaintiffs now?     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you, Mr. Steinhardt, you     5           don't have to stay there.     6                    MR. ENNIS:  No, your Honors, let me simply state     7           that the plaintiffs do not rest because we are going to be     8           calling Mr. Vaysa (ph.) during the time allotted for the     9           Government's case, and there may be a couple of other    10           housekeeping details to take care of then, but that would    11           conclude our live witnesses.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, very good.  So, why don't    13           we meet in 15 minutes in the robing room for a status    14           conference, counsel?    15                    ALL COUNSEL:  Thank you, your Honor.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And we'll see you on the 12th at    17           9:30 for the Government's case.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Lawyers do not rest, period.    19                    (Laughter.)    20                    (Court adjourned at 2:54 o'clock p.m.)    21                                       * * * Back to Hearing Transcripts index Back to Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition Page WT02-B06-2IA095-001027-B016-81http://www.cdt.org:80/ciec/transcripts/April_1_index.html 205.177.10.31 19970215013316 text/html 1528HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:31:57 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Index of Testimony - 1 April 96 Index of Testimony - April 1, 1996                                                                            195     1                                     I N D E X     2           PLAINTIFFS' WITNESSES        DIRECT  CROSS  REDIRECT  RECROSS     3           William W.

BARON:  Yes.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Mr. Hansen, I was curious    18           myself.  Dr. Hoffman is offered as an expert in what area?     19           It doesn't say in her declaration.    20                    MR. HANSEN:  I apologize, your Honor.  Dr. Hoffman    21           is an expert in the marketing aspects of cyberspace and the    22           nature of cyberspace as it relates to marketing and usage.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So that would be in the    24           marketing of cyberspace and --    25                    MR. HANSEN:  And the nature of cyberspace.                                                                             5     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The nature of cyberspace.

BARON:  O for two on that.  Yes, my name is    18           Jason R. Baron, B-a-r-o-n, U.S. Department of Justice.  Than    19           you, your Honor.    20           BY MR. BARON:      21           Q   Professor Hoffman, you study strategic implications of    22           commercializing new communications media, do you not?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   Your CV which is I believe Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 in this    25           case lists no peer reviewed references concerning empirical                                                                             6     1           studies or surveys that you have conducted on the amount of     2           pornography on the Internet, is that right?     3           A   Yes, that's correct.     4           Q   Nor are there any references on your CV to any surveys at     5           all that you have conducted on the Internet, correct?     6           A   There's no peer reviewed published studies of any surveys     7           yet, that's correct.     8           Q   Or non-peer reviewed?     9           A   Yes.    10           Q   Studies that you have conducted?    11           A   Right, not yet, that's -- we're in the process of a paper    12           right now but it is not submitted for peer review.    13           Q   Your CV doesn't contain any references to studies you    14           have done concerning the extent of pornography in    15           communication media other than the Internet, is that correct?    16           A   That's correct.    17           Q   In fact, as you stated in your deposition this past    18           Monday, you are not interested in pornography as a research    19           area, correct?    20           A   Yes, that's correct.    21           Q   Would you turn to Paragraph 122 of your declaration which    22           has been submitted in this action?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   You state in this declaration that it is your, quote,    25           "impression," unquote, that there is a decreasing percentage                                                                             7     1           of the material in cyberspace that is sexually explicit, is     2           that correct?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   Let me turn to your deposition of Monday at Page 185.  In     5           response to a question, this was starting around Line 13, in     6           response to my question asking you that you will say that it     7           is your impression regarding the amount of sexually explicit     8           material in cyberspace, you answered: "Based on my own     9           experience," this is Line 15, "and observation and the    10           experience and observations of others who are Net veterans,    11           that is the conventional wisdom."    12                    Question:  "You're relying on conventional wisdom to    13           make those observations?"    14                    Answer:  "Yes, and experience."    15                    Question:  "And experience?"    16                    Answer:  "Yes."    17                    Question:  "Including your experience in looking at    18           particular sites on the Net?"    19                    Answer:  "Right."    20                    Question: "But not in a systematic matter?"    21                    Answer: "Correct."    22                    Question:  "Not in a scientific sample?"    23                    Answer:  "Right.  And using -- that's correct,    24           that's right."    25                    Question:  "These are impressions?"                                                                             8     1                    Answer:  "These are impressions."     2                    Question:  "Unquantified?"     3                    Answer:  "Unquantified."     4                    Did you state that testimony?     5           A   Yes, I did.  And I --     6                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.       7                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, I'd like the witness to be     8           able to finish her response to that question.  I believe she     9           thought that the question required or the answer required    10           elaboration.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Go ahead.    12                    THE WITNESS:  I've been studying the strategic    13           marketing implications of commercializing emerging media like    14           the World Wide Web on the Internet since 1983.  I've been co-    15           director of a sponsored research center since 1994, so for    16           the past three years I've been studying activity on the World    17           Wide Web.    18                    One of the papers that we have written, the    19           commercial scenarios paper, "Opportunities and Challenges"    20           which is published in a peer review journal, examines all of    21           the commercial Web sites for the purpose of categorizing    22           them.  In the process of preparing that paper and all the    23           other papers that we have published I have extensive    24           experience surfing the Web both professionally and personally    25           and my impressions are based on that professional experience.                                                                             9     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me, don't --       2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you can sit back.  You don't     3           need to get close to the microphone, it's extremely     4           sensitive.     5                    THE WITNESS:  Sorry, okay.     6           BY MR. BARON:        7           Q   Professor Hoffman, have you published any article on the     8           subject of anonymous remailing on the Internet?     9           A   No.    10           Q   Have you conducted any studies on anonymous remailing on    11           the Internet?    12           A   No.    13                    MR. BARON:  Your Honors, I would submit at this time    14           that Professor Hoffman is an expert with respect to the    15           commercialization of the Net and marketing questions.     16           However, to the extent she presents testimony today on her    17           impressions regarding pornography on the Internet, they are    18           as a lay person and not as an expert.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, well, that point is noted    20           and I'm sure you'll develop it further in your cross-    21           examination of Dr. Hoffman.    22                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But I take it, based on what you    24           said, you do not dispute that she is qualified as an expert    25           in the marketing of cyberspace and the nature of cyberspace,                                                                            10     1           at least commercial cyberspace?     2                    MR. BARON:  We don't dispute that.  Let me make it     3           very specific.  When I objected to her declaration, parsing     4           the declaration in terms of the area of her expertise and the     5           area that she's giving lay testimony we would submit that     6           Paragraphs 114 through 132 of her declaration are not expert     7           opinion.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  114 through 132.  Well, you can     9           certainly develop that in detail in your cross-examination if    10           you'd like, but I see your point.    11                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.    13           BY MR. BARON:      14           Q   Good morning, Professor Hoffman.    15           A   Good morning.    16           Q   You have studied the Internet from a marketing    17           perspective, correct?    18           A   Yes, from a marketing perspective and from a    19           communications perspective.    20           Q   And you specifically studied the commercialization of the    21           Net, correct?    22           A   One of my research interest has to do with the    23           commercialization of the World Wide Web on the Internet,    24           that's correct.  Another one of my research interests has to    25           do with how consumers behave in this environment and how                                                                            11     1           people communicate in this environment.     2           Q   And you've coined a few terms along the way, have you     3           not?     4           A   Yes.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Not acronyms, I hope.     6                    THE WITNESS:  No -- well, sort of.     7                    (Laughter.)     8                    MR. BARON:  In part, your Honors, in part.     9           BY MR. BARON:      10           Q   Would you turn to Page 25 -- sorry, Paragraph 25 of your    11           declaration and could you please explain to the Court what    12           you are referring to by the term in italics, "Hyper media    13           computer mediated environment (CME)"?    14           A   The term "hyper media computer mediated environment,    15           which I agree is a mouthful, which is why we've shortened it    16           to CME which is much easier to say has to do with the idea of    17           defining a new medium like the World Wide Web on the Internet    18           as a communications medium in which people can both provide    19           an access, multi-media content that is also hyperlinked.      20                    So in other words, from the demonstration we saw    21           yesterday, the information that's available on the Webpage is    22           what we would call hypermedia because there's sound    23           information there, there's textual information there, there's    24           information contained in the context of these hyperlinks or    25           hot links and all of this information is available in what we                                                                            12     1           call a distributed computer environment.       2                    So it's an environment in which people can     3           communicate with each other but that communication is     4           mediated or takes place through a computer.  So that's the     5           context or the sense in which we mean computer mediated     6           environment or CME because it's designed to illustrate the     7           idea that when people are communicating, the communication is     8           through the computer or when they're providing content     9           through the medium, that computer mediates the content or    10           mediates the way they access the content.  So, for example,    11           the point and click with the mouse movement or putting the    12           information on the computer.    13           Q   Would one example of sound on the Internet be Internet    14           Talk Radio?    15           A   Yes, that would be one example of audio or sound.  Now--    16           Q   And what's your understanding of Internet Talk Radio?    17           A   Well, in a -- in a non-technical sense?    18           Q   Yes.    19           A   My understanding of Internet Talk Radio is that it is an    20           application which is very much like radio but is served up or    21           facilitated in a computer environment so that information is    22           stored on someone's computer which is in the context of sound    23           and then a person can click on a link which has to do with    24           that talk radio and then listen to whatever has been    25           programmed by someone.                                                                            13     1           Q   Thank you.  If you could turn to Paragraph 44 of your     2           declaration, you have in italics the term "Telepresence     3           View," unquote, of mediated communication.  Could you inform     4           the Court what you're referring to there?     5           A   Yes.  First I should say I did not invent the term     6           "telepresence," that was attributed to Jonathan Steuer who     7           wrote his doctoral dissertation at Stanford on that topic.      8           However, it's a very interesting concept and the idea is that     9           there are two different ways that people can perceive that    10           they're in an environment.  One way is what we might call the    11           presence view, in other words, I perceive that I am in this    12           physical environment and so I have a presence of being here.     13           The other way is that I can have a telepresence view, in    14           other words, I can have a perception that I am in the    15           mediated environment, in other words, that I am involved in    16           what's happening on the World Wide Web.  And both of those    17           perceptions can take place when people are interacting in a    18           computer-mediated environment like the World Wide Web.    19           Q   Could you also turn to now Paragraph 73 of your    20           declaration, that's on Page 17, and --    21           A   I'm sorry, would you repeat the paragraph, please?    22           Q   Paragraph 73.     23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 17.    24           BY MR. BARON:      25           Q   And inform the Court what you mean by the concept of,                                                                            14     1           quote, "flow," f-l-o-w, unquote, in terms of an individual's     2           experience on the Net.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Why don't you put on that light, Mr.     4           Hansen, so she can see better?  That little light.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The thing under the green.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Known as a lamp.     7                    (Laughter.)     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's very old-fashioned.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  L-a-m-p stands for nothing.    10                    (Laughter.)    11                    MR. BARON:  Don't be so sure, your Honor.    12                    (Laughter.)    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Touche.    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, the concept of flow was first    15           developed by a psychologist who developed it in the context    16           of activities like, for example, rock climbing, playing    17           chess, dancing, listening to music and other sorts of    18           activities like that.  And the idea -- and we have extended    19           it to describe what happens in computer-mediated environments    20           when people are engaging in interactive relationships in    21           those environments.      22                    And it is a process or an experience that    23           individuals engage in and the first thing that happens is    24           people pay attention to what's going on in the environment,    25           then they have an experience of being totally immersed in the                                                                            15     1           environment which they perceive as being very enjoyable.     2                    As a consequence of engaging in this flow experience     3           a number of nice things happen.  For example, people report     4           increased learning in the environment, they report being very     5           satisfied by the experience in the environment, they engage     6           in more exploratory and participatory behaviors which means     7           they're more likely to try to explore and find out more     8           things in the environment and they perceive a sense of being     9           in control in the environment.    10                    So we have used the construct or the concept of flow    11           to describe how people experience being in an environment    12           like the World Wide Web.    13           BY MR. BARON:      14           Q   And finally, Professor Hoffman, in terms of definitions    15           what do you mean by these terms that you've referred to in    16           your writings as information bank or knowledge base for    17           future memory?  Are you familiar with those terms?    18           A   Yes, you're talking about the external memory concept    19           that we've developed, is that correct?    20           Q   I believe so.    21           A   The idea there is in an environment like the World Wide    22           Web there is a unique facility for people to be able to    23           remember things without having to write them down and that is    24           through the Bookmark facility which is a feature of browsers    25           like Netscape, for example.                                                                            16     1                    So as I am surfing, for example, through the World     2           Wide Web and I move through cyberspace clicking on links that     3           attract my interest or that I'd like to learn more about, if     4           I see something that I want to remember because I might want     5           to come back another time, I can store it in my Bookmark, as     6           we saw our demonstration yesterday.     7                    And in a marketing or consumer context that could     8           lead to what we call external memory because in a, for     9           example, a product purchase sense, if I see some information    10           about an automobile and I want to go back at another time,    11           maybe I'm interested in buying a Saab but today I'm just    12           going to surf but get some information about it but maybe    13           next week I want to go back because I don't remember where    14           that link was, but the Bookmark facility allows me to    15           remember without having to store it up here and we call that    16           external memory.    17           Q   Would it be fair to say --    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me.    19                    MR. BARON:  Oh, sorry.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is user net navigation as you use it    21           in here synonymous with surf?    22                    THE WITNESS:  One part, surfing is one part of the    23           network navigation or user navigation experience.  We    24           identify two types of network navigation, one which we call    25           experiential which is browsing or surfing just for fun, just                                                                            17     1           to sort of see what's out there and it's something we would     2           consider to be very ritualized, or in the psychological     3           parlance something we call hedonic which means it's fun and     4           we, you know, get a lot of pleasure from it.     5                    The other type of user navigation or network     6           navigation we refer to as goal directed and not that that     7           wouldn't be fun, but in other words, I have a purpose, I am     8           looking specifically for some information about Saabs today.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Got it, thank you.    10           BY MR. BARON:      11           Q   Would it be fair to say, Professor Hoffman, that your    12           work in this area involves how adults as opposed to children    13           experience the World Wide Web and the Internet?    14           A   Yes.    15           Q   There aren't any studies, are there, on whether children    16           have a similar flow experience in the context of a hypermedia    17           computer mediated environment, correct?    18           A   That's correct.    19           Q   And so far as you are aware there has been no scholarly    20           research done on children's ability to build an information    21           memory bank or bookmarks, as you said, based on experiences    22           good and bad while on the net, correct?    23           A   That's correct.    24           Q   Please tell the Court what you mean by Net surfing?     25           There was a question but why don't we go over it again.                                                                            18     1           A   By surfing I mean the process of, as I said before,     2           experiential behavior or activities on the World Wide Web by     3           browsing for information in which I have no particular goal     4           to find a particular piece of information and there's two     5           important components of the surfing process.  One could be     6           I'm surfing or browsing because I have an enduring or an     7           ongoing relationship with the computer, so it's the computer     8           itself that I'm interested in and I just surf every day     9           because I like the computer, for example.    10                    The other type of surfing or browsing behavior could    11           occur -- and these aren't mutually exclusive -- would be that    12           I have an enduring or an ongoing interest with the sorts of    13           things that I'm surfing for.  So those might be information    14           about automobiles or information about stocks, financial    15           information, information about companies, scholarly    16           information, you know, there's an entire gamut of things.    17                    And so maybe tomorrow I'm -- or today I would surf    18           for information and see what was the latest information in an    19           on-line magazine, for example, or I might want to find    20           something about my favorite writer, that sort of thing.  And    21           so it's not particularly direct and I'm not looking for    22           something specific, I just want to see what's out there in a    23           general sense.    24           Q   Would it be fair to say -- well, let me read you a    25           portion of your deposition and see whether you agree to it.                                                                             19     1           This is on this point.  I'm paraphrasing from Page 72, Line     2           3.  "If you are looking just to browse to just look for     3           something for fun, say, because you're interested in cars,     4           for example, but nothing specific, you might enter the word     5           cars and then tens of thousands of documents would appear and     6           you would choose one of those and you would click on it and     7           off, click on and off, and that would take you to a     8           particular Web site, whatever caught your fancy.  From there     9           you could click on something else and go somewhere else, you    10           can go using the back key, for example, or one of the browser    11           navigation aids, a Netscape."    12                    Tell the Court that in the deposition is a third    13           tense rather than first tense, but is that statement correct?    14           A   Yes, it's correct.    15           Q   Okay.  Thank you.  Now, children under the age of 18 Net    16           surf, don't they?    17           A   Yes.    18           Q   At the deposition this past Monday however you stated    19           that you know, quote, "next to nothing," unquote, about the    20           behavior of children on the Internet, correct?    21           A   That's correct.    22           Q   You haven't studied what kind of use children make of the    23           World Wide Web, correct?    24           A   That's correct.     25           Q   Or any of the other Internet applications including FTP,                                                                            20     1           Usenet, Gofer, et cetera, correct?     2           A   That's correct.     3           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 57, the books are     4           on your left at the bottom, and it's the second volume?  MR.     5           BARON:  It's in the second volume, your Honors.     6           BY MR. BARON:       7           Q   Do you see Exhibit 57?     8           A   Yes, I do.     9           Q   Could you describe for the Court what this is?    10           A   This is a -- we might call it a newsletter or a summary    11           example of some research that's being conducted at Carnegie    12           Mellon University under the name of Homenet and it's a five-    13           year or they're hoping five-year but right now it's multi-    14           year field trial of residential Internet use in the    15           Pittsburgh area.    16           Q   The Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie    17           Mellon is a respected research center and institution,    18           correct?    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   If you would turn to what is Subpart 4.4 on Page 3 of    21           this exhibit?    22           A   Yes.    23           Q   The subsection says "Teens Lead the Family," do you see    24           that?    25           A   Yes, I do.                                                                            21     1           Q   Is it correct to say that the study found that the     2           heaviest use -- users of the Net in 48 families studied were     3           teenage children?     4           A   Yes, that's correct.     5           Q   Do you rely on this study in your own research as what     6           you consider to be the first credible study of the     7           consumption experience in the home regarding the Internet?     8           A   Yes.  I use this study as background information for both     9           the empirical work that we're conducting and our theoretical    10           work because it is the first study that has actually put    11           computers in the home.  However, the study has to be    12           qualified on a number of important dimensions.  One is it's    13           taking place in the Pittsburgh area which is a major urban    14           center in the United States.  Another is that it only has 48    15           families and so that is an extremely small sample, so we have    16           to be very careful about drawing broad conclusions about    17           behavior.  However, I think the results are very interesting    18           and can be useful for suggesting some trends.    19                    Another qualification or limitation is that the    20           families were solicited on the basis of locating high school    21           students who were on the school papers at the high schools    22           that they attended so you would expect that these journalism    23           students in high school and being editors of the paper or    24           else writers for the paper would be lead users of the    25           computer.  So in that sense the results will suggest what's                                                                            22     1           happening with lead users or pioneers and are not indicative     2           of the general population.     3           Q   May I ask that you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 44 which     4           may be in the first volume by your side?  My apologies, I     5           think your exhibits are in both volumes so we're going to go     6           back and forth.      7           A   That's okay.     8                    (Pause.)     9           A   Okay.    10           Q   Do you recall my showing you what are statistics from the    11           Census Bureau?    12           A   Yes, I do.    13           Q   If you would turn to page 2 of the exhibit, do you see    14           the Table A, "Level of Access and Use of Computers: 1984,    15           1989 and 1993," where the numbers are in thousands?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   Maybe it would be helpful, can you summarize just what    18           this table is attempting to get at?    19           A   Yes.  This -- this is from the CPS or the current    20           population census from 1993, I believe, and what it is    21           attempting to show are the trends in access and use of    22           computers in the United States over the last decade or so for    23           children and for adults.  Would you like me to say more?    24           Q   You stated in your deposition that while you didn't    25           dispute these figures, to you they represented an upper                                                                            23     1           bound, correct?     2           A   Yes, that's correct.  I do research on the use and access     3           of the Internet and am engaged right now in an empirical     4           study of those aspects and in fact a very interesting     5           research question from my perspective is what it means to ask     6           someone if they have access to a computer and what are they     7           thinking when you ask them that question and what sort of     8           information do you get.  And also what does it mean when you     9           ask someone if they use a computer and what sort of    10           information you get.  And one conclusion we are coming to is    11           that the access question is an upper bound on use because it    12           tends to evoke an awareness type of response.    13                    When you ask someone if they have access to    14           something it seems to suggest in their minds, oh, well, I    15           know about it, I'm aware of it, yeah, I have access because    16           my neighbor down the street has a computer and so in that    17           sense I believe I might have access.    18                    The use question tends to be more, a little bit more    19           specific because now you're actually asking somebody do you    20           actually use a computer and so as you can see from the table    21           here for 1993 the access figures are higher than the use    22           figures.  And so you expect to see this winnowing down effect    23           as you get more specific in the type of usage questions you    24           ask someone and in fact I would expect -- and these data do    25           not show it because they're so aggregate -- that if we say                                                                            24     1           well, do you use a computer every day the number would be     2           much, much smaller.     3           Q   All right, well, thank you.  These --     4           A   You know, I have a point to make about this table which I     5           noticed which is -- I'm sorry, may I?     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, excuse me.       7                    (Discussion off the record.)     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, there's no objection.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I'm sure --    10                    MR. BARON:  I have no objection, your Honor.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You have an objection?    12                    MR. BARON:  I have no objection, your Honor.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, he has no objection.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, go ahead.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    16                    THE WITNESS:  I -- the point that I want to make, I    17           think, illustrates the difficulties involved in trying to    18           measure access and use of computer networks or use of    19           computers or use of the Internet.  For example, if you'll    20           look at column -- the first set of numbers under "Number" and    21           you'll see 1993, it says "Do you have access to a computer,"    22           it's for three to 17 year olds, and the number given is    23           17,829,000 people in the United States in 1993 between the    24           ages of three and 17 are estimated to have access.  And yet    25           and then you look at do you use a computer and you see that                                                                            25     1           12 million say they use a home computer, 28 million say they     2           use a computer at school and then 32 million say they use it     3           at anyplace and the figure seems somewhat out of whack     4           because it's so much higher that they would use it anyplace     5           and you wonder what those other places are, particularly for     6           three to 17 year olds.  And so it just reflects some of the     7           difficulties, I think, involved in trying to tap these --     8           using these sorts of statistics for anything more than     9           looking at trends, at least at this point in time.    10           BY MR. BARON:      11           Q   All right, well, thank you.  Now, you state in your    12           declaration that the Internet is unique, that it's very    13           different than other media, correct?    14           A   That's correct.    15           Q   As one of the ways that you pointed out that the Internet    16           is unique is that it's essentially a 24-hour a day, seven day    17           a week medium?    18           A   Yes, that's correct.    19           Q   URL's are always there in cyberspace, correct?    20           A   Well, they're there as long as the computer behind them    21           hasn't shut down, that's correct.    22           Q   Okay.  And one of the features you've emphasized here    23           today in your deposition that is how easy and sometimes how    24           fun it is to Net surf, correct?    25           A   Yes, that's correct.                                                                            26     1           Q   There's a popular search engine for Net surfing called     2           "Alta Vista," correct?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   Could you turn to Paragraph 66 of your declaration?      5           Paragraph 66 which is on Page 15 at the bottom, I'll read the     6           first two sentences:     7                    "The Web differs from broadcast media like     8           television and radio in two important respects.  First on the     9           Web individuals must seek out the information they want to    10           consume, individuals do not passively receive information nor    11           does information suddenly appear surprising them."    12                    That's your statement, correct?    13           A   Yes.    14           Q   Let's say a child or a teenager was performing a surf,    15           surfing the Net in response to let's say a book project in    16           school, okay?    17           A   Okay.    18           Q   Let's say the book that they were interested in learning    19           more about because either they had read the book or because    20           they had seen the book was Little Women by Louisa Mae Alcott,    21           okay?    22           A   Okay.    23           Q   What would the child or the adolescent do in terms of    24           surfing the Net in terms of a simple search using Yahoo or    25           Infoseek or Alta Vista or some other search engine, what                                                                            27     1           would they do?     2           A   Well, first of all, it would depend on the child.  If we     3           go back to the concept of flow for a moment, it's a very     4           important idea to recognize that in computer mediated     5           environments there is a competency issue that is introduced     6           that is not relevant in the physical world, particularly for     7           the use of other media.  And so this competency issue     8           involves the idea that people have a set of skills that they     9           have to bring to the environment in order to be able to    10           facilitate navigating through it.  And the environment itself    11           also presents challenges to the individual as they're trying    12           to navigate.    13                    And so what a child would do would depend on the age    14           of the child, the child's characteristics and particularly    15           their competency to navigate through this environment.    16           Q   Assuming that the child knew how to type words into a    17           browser or search engine?    18           A   So we're talking about a child that's literate, computer    19           literate --    20           Q   Right.    21           A   -- and old enough to understand the Netscape browsing    22           concept?    23           Q   Right.    24           A   And the concept of search agents?    25           Q   To search for Little Women what words do you put into the                                                                            28     1           browser or what do you type into Infoseek or Alta Vista?     2           A   If I were -- if I were instructing my child, for example,     3           on a book report -- my child is too young to do this but if     4           my child were older -- then we would go to Netscape, we would     5           go Alta Vista and then in advanced search cause I would help     6           him do this we would enter "Little" plus "Women" plus     7           "Louisa" plus "Mae" plus "Alcott."  Actually we would use the     8           "and" key and then we would get all of the documents from the     9           22 million documents that are referenced in Alta Vista, we    10           would get the documents that satisfy that criteria.  That's    11           what I would do with my child.    12           Q   Can you turn to what -- now we've marked this as Exhibit    13           13A and with the Court's indulgence, it does not have a    14           separate tab in these books, it's found as the second    15           document under Tab 13.    16                    (Pause.)    17           Q   Do you see that document?    18           A   Yes, I do.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's the one that has "Win a trip to    20           Hawaii" on it?    21                    MR. BARON:  Yes, correct, your Honor.    22                    (Laughter.)    23           BY MR. BARON:      24           Q   Are you generally familiar with this form of document as    25           produced by Infoseek?                                                                            29     1           A   Yes, I am.     2           Q   Would you take a look at the fifth entry on this     3           document?     4           A   Yes, I see it.     5           Q   This document was produced by typing in the words "Little     6           Women" correct?     7           A   Yes, that appears to be the case because at the top it     8           says "Search for" and then in the bold, the two words,     9           "Little Women" and that had produced a search for all    10           documents on the Internet that have the words "little" in    11           them or have the words "women" in them in the title in the    12           URL.      13           Q   And what does the fifth entry represent?    14           A   You want me to read it?    15           Q   Yes, please.    16           A   "See hot pictures of naked women," exclamation point.    17           Q   Isn't it possible, Professor Hoffman, that a child might    18           be surprised in stumbling across that entry in the context of    19           an on-line search?  Isn't it possible?    20           A   It's possible if the -- I -- it's possible that that    21           child would be surprised.    22           Q   Thank you.  Why don't we turn to the concept of hits when    23           you're conducting a search.    24           A   Okay.    25           Q   Could you explain to the Court what a hit is?                                                                            30     1           A   Yes, a hit is a measure, it's a, literally it's an entry     2           recorded in the server log of the computer that is the Web     3           server that says a file has been accessed when someone comes     4           to that particular page.  But the hits, there's quite a bit     5           of controversy about the hits because, for example, on the     6           home page for our center, Project 2000, when someone comes to     7           that front page or the front door of our virtual research     8           center, that counts as say ten hits.       9                    And the reason it counts as ten hits is because we    10           have an image map, in other words, we have a picture on the    11           front with some nice drawings on it and on the map itself you    12           can click in different places and go to my curriculum vitae,    13           go to Professor Novak's curriculum vitae, go to the Owens    14           School's home page.    15                    And so on and then there's a set of links that you    16           can go to our research papers, you can go to some other    17           people's research papers or whatever.      18                    In the process of serving up that front page, that    19           records approximately ten hits on my server log.  So the hit,    20           and that's the reason there's so much controversy over Web    21           measurement, hits are not an accurate measure of how many    22           people are coming to the Web site because depending on how    23           many images I have on my front page or how many links I    24           choose to put on the front page, I can inflate the number of    25           hits.                                                                            31     1                    But a hit literally is a file served on that     2           computer server.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let me interrupt you for a second.      4           What if you came in the back door?       5                    THE WITNESS:  You mean to another page?     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In other words, if you came in     7           through another link --     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- rather than hitting the front    10           page of your home page you found, for example, I mean what    11           Mrs. Duvall gave us yesterday with the fragile X, as I recall    12           it.    13                    THE WITNESS:  Right.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If you came in the back door to the    15           fragile X foundation that way, would that be a hit?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that would also be a hit.  So,    17           for example, fragile X has a home page but fragile X has many    18           sites that are enduring and have lots of content on them,    19           they might have thousands of pages.  Some very deep sites    20           might have 10,000 pieces of information.    21                    So each of those pages has a URL associated with it    22           and then if someone were to come in, as you say, through one    23           of these back doors because you knew the URL directly and you    24           went directly to that page rather than going through the    25           front door, that page itself could be served up at least as                                                                            32     1           one hit but again depends on how many things are on that     2           particular page.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So in Project 2000's count, if     4           someone comes in by what I call the back door and I think we     5           agree it's called the back door to, say, Page 17 --     6                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there's --     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- if there is a Page 17.     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, there's not really a concept of     9           Page 17 because one of the unique features of the Web is that    10           it's not a linear.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, I understand that, but if you    12           were to print it out in hard copy it would be Page 17, each    13           screen.    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, not necessarily because unless I    15           particularly marked it to say Page 17, but --    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.    17                    THE WITNESS:  But it's a page, it's another page.     18           Not the, you know, cause there's lot-- literally think of it    19           as a web and there's lots of different ways to meander    20           through either a particular site in a non-linear fashion or    21           through the entire Web.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, when you measure the hits,    23           whatever their --    24                    THE WITNESS:  Right.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- inaccuracy may be, that also                                                                            33     1           includes the back door --     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it does.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- accesses, correct?     4                    THE WITNESS:  In fact that's why we don't measure     5           hits and that's why there's been for particularly for     6           commercial purposes because this is a very hot topic with     7           advertisers right now and advertising agencies.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They want to know hits per thousand,     9           right?    10                    THE WITNESS:  Right, and it's been completely, I    11           mean there's very few firms now that either will sell space    12           on a Web site on the basis of hits or will even talk in the    13           context of hits because in the last year there's been so much    14           attention, people have done a lot of work including the    15           Project 2000 discussing why this is a very bad idea.    16                    So instead what people do, there are several things.     17           So hits are really the upper bound.  I mean there's no more    18           than the hits as the measure of what's happening on your Web    19           site, but it's a completely useless measure from my    20           perspective as a measure of activity from a consumer    21           perspective.    22                    The lower bound is what we call unique domains.  The    23           server log also records when someone comes to the site    24           there's their domain name attached to it.  So, for example,    25           if I'm visiting a Web site I have my own domain and IP                                                                            34     1           address because I have my own machine connected directly to     2           the Internet.  My address at Vanderbilt is     3           Collett.OGSM.Vanderbilt.EDU, so whenever I go somewhere with     4           my browser from my machine to another Web site anywhere in     5           the world, the server log of those sites that     6           Collett.OGSM.Vanderbilt.EDU went to the site.  It doesn't say     7           Donna Hoffman went because they don't necessarily know it's     8           me, they just know that machine went.  That is a domain.     9                    So the server log for a particular site will record    10           all those domains and it's very possible and very easy to    11           write computer programs to count how many domains came in a    12           day, in an hour to a page, to all the pages, to the home page    13           and so on and then throw out the ones that are multiples.    14                    So, for example, our site gets hit a lot by    15           Gateway.Senate.GOV and -- but if they come more than once,    16           first of all, I have no idea who it is, but if they come more    17           than once I'll discount it once and say I had a unique visit    18           today from Gateway.Senate.GOV and then I can count over time    19           how many of those unique domains I had in a single day.    20                    So the Project 2000 site gets anywhere from a    21           thousand to two thousand or so, maybe 1800, unique domain    22           visits a day.  It probably gets tens of thousands of hits,    23           but that's irrelevant. What's much more important to know is    24           how many lower bound people actually came to my site.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sorry to interrupt.                                                                            35     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I get just one little     2           clarification while we're doing it?  On this exhibit that     3           doesn't have a page -- well, it does, it's one of two in 13A     4           that you called our attention to, would any of these     5           references be a hit even if the user, searcher, surfer      6           didn't click on them, if the page has come up would these be     7           considered, would they all be considered hits or would none     8           of them be considered hits until the person wants to link     9           with the little hand?    10                    THE WITNESS:  Right.      11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, which one?  There's an    12           either/or--    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, they would not be -- they would    14           not be considered hits because for these search engines,    15           Infoseek is not a -- is a directory.  And so when I go to    16           Infoseek to search, for example, in this case or when he went    17           to search for Little Women, that created a hit on Infoseek    18           because somebody went to Infoseek and let's say you went and    19           you had a domain associated with your computer, which you    20           would, it would record that you were there.    21                    Now, this page is served up from Infoseek's    22           directory so there is no hit recorded for the WWW Women's    23           Sport Page by Amy Lewis and so on.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    25                    THE WITNESS:  However, if you then choose to click                                                                            36     1           on one of these links you will be taken to that site and that     2           would record a hit.     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And you would have     4           instructed your son, if you were helping your -- is it     5           correct that you would have instructed your son if you were     6           looking for Little Women to put "little" with an and?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would.  Well, first of all, I     8           probably wouldn't use Infoseek, I would use -- but whatever.      9           But even Infoseek, I believe, allows you to use term -- I am    10           blanking on the name, but symbols that allow you to refine    11           your search because I would know, being an experienced user    12           of the computer, that searching for the two words, "Little    13           Women" would produce many more things than I would be    14           interested in.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But is it true that a child might    16           not know?    17                    THE WITNESS:  It's true, but I think the reason is    18           that I would be with my child educating him on how to use the    19           computer and how to engage in these search processes, at    20           least until I felt he was -- knew how to do it on his own.    21                    So I would not let him sit there and do this.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But if your son were 12, let's say,    23           and by now an experienced surfer, isn't it a fair assumption,    24           as Chief Judge Sloviter is suggesting, that he would just    25           type in Little Women?  That is the natural search.                                                                            37     1                    THE WITNESS:  Actually, I believe that if he were 12     2           and an experienced surfer, particularly on the basis of my     3           tutelage, he would know that it would be a waste of time to     4           type in Little Women and because by then he would have moved     5           through the processes we described in our search and he would     6           have moved from being a browser to a more goal-directed user,     7           he would be much more experienced.       8                    And if he knew what he was looking for he would know     9           how to get to it.     10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the point is the more naive the    11           searcher, the more likely they are to pick up what Mr. Baron    12           has called your attention to, isn't that the point?    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe that's true, the more    14           experienced they are, the more likely they would be to not    15           know how to do sophisticated searches.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's particularly true of    17           children, isn't it, who don't have the benefit of a parent    18           who is an expert in this area?    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, that would be more true, yes,    20           that's true, but then there are also schools that instruct    21           children on how to use the computers in the Internet and how    22           to go through searching facilities and teach them the tools    23           necessary to use the Internet as a communications tool.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think Mr. Baron was probably    25           getting at the -- he was trying to get to the number of hits,                                                                            38     1           so while we'll let you go back to that then.     2                    MR. BARON:  Well, this is an interesting discussion,     3           but --     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, thank you.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We aim to please.     6                    (Laughter.)     7                    MR. BARON:  I want to add a layer of complexity to     8           the subject of hits and I was going to go off on a different     9           tangent which is to ask you to tell the Court what are "Bots"    10           and what are "Spiders."    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Bots?    12                    MR. BARON:  B-o-t-s.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's an acronym, right?    14                    THE WITNESS:  Not really.    15                    MR. BARON:  I'll let Professor Hoffman describe it.    16                    THE WITNESS:  Bots or Robots, Bots for short.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A contraction.    18                    THE WITNESS:  And Spiders and Intelligent Agents are    19           a class of software programs that are tools that enable    20           people to perform specific tasks on the World Wide Web, for    21           example, seek out specific types of information or URL's or    22           whatnot.    23           BY MR. BARON:      24           Q   Does Alta Vista employ a Bot?    25           A   Yes, I don't know if they call it a Bot or a Spider, but                                                                            39     1           Alta Vista employs software that allows it to traverse the     2           Web to find the URL's that exist on the Web so they can store     3           them in a database so that when you go there to search you     4           can find what you're looking for.     5           Q   And you stated in your deposition that you thought there     6           were about 10 to 20 directories and search engines that are     7           popularly used today, correct?     8           A   Yes, it's correct.  For example, if you go to the     9           Netscape Homepage and go to their Searchpage, Netscape which    10           is the most popular browser on the Internet for use in the    11           World Wide Web has a page which provides for its customers    12           the ability to go search.  And so they have a page with all    13           the search engines there and all the directories.  And I    14           think the directory page may list 10 to 15 directories or so    15           and the search engine page may list another 10 to 15 or so,    16           so maybe there's 10 to 20, maybe there's 30 and they're    17           changing all the time.    18                    There's probably about 250 directories and search    19           engines all over the Web but I don't think that they're all    20           equally popular.    21           Q   Well, you told me at your deposition, didn't you, that    22           for the 10 or 20 major ones that they're all employing Bots    23           or some other software to search the Web for URL's to    24           incorporate in their database, correct?    25           A   Yes, I told you that and also we have to make an                                                                            40     1           important distinction because some of the directories also     2           employ human beings who will go out and search for     3           information and then make a determination on whether it     4           should be included in their directory.       5                    And there's a very important distinction between a     6           search engine and a directory because search engines like     7           Alta Vista, for example, do not discriminate.  If it's on the     8           Web and they can find it, it will go in the database.  And     9           they currently catalogue 22 million unique URL's.      10                    So that's considered to be right now our best guess    11           at the universe of information available on the World Wide    12           Web.  They also catalogue about 11 billion words and that's    13           considered to be the universe of information right now on the    14           World Wide Web.      15                    However, a directory, for example, Magellan which is    16           also referred to as the McKinley Index, these are -- this is    17           a directory where people have made a choice about what URL's    18           to include and then they look at the site and then they rate    19           it using a star system where four stars is the best.    20                    So on these directories you find a much smaller    21           universe of URL's from which you can search.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And your testimony is that the best    23           guess at least at some recent time was that there are 22    24           million URL's out there or were?    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's not a guess, it's just that                                                                            41     1           we know that Alta Vista indexes 22 million unique URL's in     2           its database.  The thing that is interesting is last month     3           they indexed 21 million, so it's grown by one million unique     4           URL's in about the last four weeks.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What does a typical directory, how     6           many do they --     7                    THE WITNESS:  It -- it depends.  It might be 5,000,     8           it might be a few hundred, it might be 10,000.  They're     9           typically smaller, especially if they have to go through and    10           somebody has to like look at these things and make some    11           determination about them.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So the difference between the    13           directory and the search engine is the search engine    14           encompasses all?    15                    THE WITNESS:  It could, that could be a difference,    16           yes.  For like -- yes, for Alta Vista which is a search    17           engine or Lycos which is a search engine, right, those    18           encompass all, they do not discriminate.  If it's out there    19           and the software finds it, it will store it in a database.     20                    Yahoo, for example, to use a very prominent    21           difference, Yahoo is a directory and Yahoo catalogues, Yahoo    22           has a person, a human being who sits there and she decides    23           this URL will go in, this URL will not go in.  She also    24           decides how to catalogue them so the main distinction between    25           directories and search agents is a directory catalogues or                                                                            42     1           otherwise structures the information for you.       2                    So like if you go to Yahoo, you can look -- let's     3           say you're interested in information about sports.  There's a     4           sports heading and you can click there and there will be all     5           the links on sports.  And Alta Vista --     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just all the links that Yahoo gives     7           you?     8                    THE WITNESS:  All the links that Yahoo has     9           determined should be included in its directory under the    10           heading sports, yes.    11                    There's another well known directory open -- Yahoo,    12           like for example, I don't know how many URL's Yahoo has, it    13           has a lot, but as an example, in their company's directory    14           which is the commercial portion of Yahoo there's over 50,000.    15                    In -- but if I were to search for companies on Alta    16           Vista I would get millions, so it would be many more.  Open    17           Market, another popular directory, lists about 22,000    18           entries, so it's a little -- it's much smaller than Yahoo but    19           they go through a more detailed process in order to register    20           your information.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Alta Vista is growing at about    22           one million URL's a month?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, last month it grew one million    24           URL's.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Because it was cold and people had                                                                            43     1           nothing else to do.     2                    (Laughter.)     3           BY MR. BARON:       4           Q   Well, let me just ask a couple more questions about this     5           topic of search for hits.  Individuals are also employing     6           Spiders to go out and traverse the Web looking for     7           information, correct?     8           A   Yes.     9           Q   And the server log on a Web site records that access    10           having been made to that page, correct?    11           A   That's correct.    12           Q   For Spiders and for Bots?    13           A   The server log records whenever another computer comes to    14           its Web site so the Spider or this Intelligent Agent or the    15           software program had to come from somewhere just as if I were    16           visiting and the server log records that access as a domain    17           visit, yes.    18           Q   Even without any real human person looking at that site?    19           A   Yes, that's true.    20           Q   And the major directories or search engines, the ten or    21           twenty you've described or more, go out and search at least    22           one, once a day and probably much more often, correct?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   And they go back to sites that they've already visited to    25           see what's new, correct?                                                                            44     1           A   Yes, that's correct.     2           Q   Okay.  There are lots of directories out there in     3           cyberspace that have URL's, correct?     4           A   Well, yes, by definition if it's a directory on the Web     5           it must have a URL.     6           Q   You said in your deposition that there are hundreds if     7           not thousands of examples of individuals who have put     8           together indexes on particular topics of interest to other     9           individuals in cyberspace, correct?    10           A   Yes, that's correct.    11           Q   And one of the ways that directories come into being or    12           one of the ways that one can communicate in cyberspace is to    13           fill out forms, correct?    14           A   Uh --    15           Q   Why don't you explain to the Court what a form is, a Web    16           form?    17           A   A fillout form is a page on someone's Web site which has    18           the facility to take information from you if you would care    19           to give it.  So, for example, sort of a classic use of a    20           fillout form in a commercial context would be to give your    21           name, demographic information and maybe your credit card    22           number.  So there would be little spaces there for you to    23           type in your name, there might even be little sort of virtual    24           bubbles, if you will, that you could use a mouse to click and    25           say what gender you were and it would say male, female, maybe                                                                            45     1           a little button and you'd click whether you were a male or     2           female.  Then there would be another box to enter some     3           information that the firm might like to know about you and     4           that would be captured through what is called a fillout form.     5                    And there would be many other uses.  We use them on     6           the Project 2000 site to get information about people that     7           visit so we can put them on a mailing list, for example.     8           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 40?  You mentioned earlier Open     9           Market?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   Is this -- is Defendant's Exhibit 40 an example of an    12           Open Market page?    13           A   Yes, that's an example of an Open Market page.    14                    Excuse me, could I have more water, please?    15           Q   Oh, sure.    16                    (Pause.)    17           Q   Are you ready?    18           A   I'm ready.    19           Q   Professor Hoffman, you stated a few minutes ago in    20           testimony that Open Market has a, I believe I got this right,    21           a more detailed process for registering entries in their    22           directory, correct?    23           A   Yes, that's correct.    24           Q   Could you just explain for the Court what Exhibit 40    25           represents in terms of the commercial sites index listing                                                                            46     1           submission?     2           A   Yes, this is --     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Excuse me, I think counsel misspoke.      4           Do you mean to say Exhibit 41?     5                    MR. BARON:  No, I'm referring to Exhibit 40.     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, all right.       7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which is headed "Open Market's     8           Commercial Sites Index," correct?     9                    MR. BARON:  Correct.    10                    THE WITNESS:  And then it says "Commercial Sites    11           Index Listing Submission."    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, this is the page if you were to    14           go to the Open Market homepage or maybe someone told you this    15           URL directly and you entered it directly.  But in any event    16           let's just say you found your way to this page deliberately    17           because you knew it existed and you wanted to register your    18           commercial site with Open Market.      19                    You would have to go to this page, you would follow    20           the instructions on this page and, even though you can't see    21           it from this hard copy printing, it's a fillout form where    22           so, for example, see where it says "New Listing Update Old    23           Listing," those are choices and you would click on one of    24           those to indicate to Open Market whether you wanted to update    25           a listing you already had in their directory or you wanted to                                                                            47     1           enter a new listing.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you say you can't see it?      3           Isn't it on the next page?     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, I mean you can't tell from this     5           hard copy printout --     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, it's on this and the next page.     7                    THE WITNESS:   -- what it would really look like on     8           the World Wide Web on a computer because it would be     9           highlighted and it would be obvious that you would have, you    10           know, there would be an action required on your part which    11           would be to click.    12                    Then if you saw where it says "Listing name," that    13           would be a text box.  It hasn't come out here on the print,    14           on the printer, but there would be a -- that would be the    15           place where it would be obvious for you to type the name that    16           you wanted the listing to appear as in the directory, and so    17           on.    18                    And so you would go through this process on line,    19           filling out this fillout form, it would be stored directly in    20           their database, they might do some processing of it and then    21           they would -- I do not know if Open Market screens these or    22           makes some determination on what's appropriate or not.  I do    23           know that they have 22,000 or so listings and since that's    24           half the size of Yahoo's listings, I infer there may be some    25           sort of selection process involved or either that or not                                                                            48     1           everybody wants to list with Open Market.     2           BY MR. BARON:       3           Q   And when someone wants to list with Open Market, then     4           individuals in cyberspace can search against the Open Market     5           directory of the sites that are listed?     6           A   Yes, that's correct.     7           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 41?     8           A   Yes, I see it.     9           Q   Do you recall my showing you this page at your    10           deposition?    11           A   Yes, I do.    12           Q   Could you explain for the Court what this page    13           represents?    14           A   Yes.  This is -- this appears to represent someone typing    15           in on a previous page which asked you to search which gives    16           people the opportunity to search for particular listings in    17           the Open Market directory.  Someone has performed a search of    18           listings that contain the word p-o-r-n or porn.  And the    19           search appears to have returned 23 items.    20                    Now, I'm going to assume that because they're from A    21           to Z that that's an exhaustive list of the sites on Open    22           Market out of the 22,000 or so sites that contain the word    23           porn and that's 23 items.    24           Q   And could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 42?             25           A   Yes, I see that.                                                                            49     1           Q   What would this represent, this page?     2           A   Well, this appears to represent what would happen if the     3           person who had searched for porn clicked on the first entry     4           which was Triple A Adult Entertainment, then that would take     5           you directly to a page, it appears to be still on the Open     6           Market site which then gives you more information about the     7           Triple A Adult Entertainment commercial site and then     8           there's, that's obvious from underlining that that's a     9           Hypertext link, so if you then chose to go to the Triple A    10           Entertainment, Adult Entertainment site, you would click on    11           that link and then you would be what we call off site, you    12           would now be somewhere else in cyberspace.    13           Q   But the point here is that the Triple A Adult    14           Entertainment site has essentially gone through a    15           registration process with the Open Market directory, correct?    16           A   Yes, they have listed their business with the Open Market    17           commercial directory.    18           Q   All right, thank you.  Let me turn to a separate subject.     19           Is it -- is it your testimony, as you state in your    20           deposition, that there are approximately 12 to 15 million    21           subscribers to AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy?    22           A   Yes, and all of the commercial on-line services, not just    23           the top three, because Microsoft Network is rapidly    24           approaching one million subscribers by itself.    25           Q   You agree, do you not, that it is in the interest of the                                                                            50     1           marketplace to adopt parental controls?     2           A   Yes, I do.     3           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 48 which I believe would be in     4           the second volume?     5                    (Pause; discussion off the record.)     6           BY MR. BARON:       7           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit in your     8           deposition?     9           A   Yes, I do.    10           Q   Could you generally describe for the Court what it    11           represents in terms of a Web page?     12           A   Yes, it's an advertisement for an adult bulletin board.    13           Q   It appears to state that one calls a 900 number to get a    14           user name and a password and there will be a $20 charge on a    15           phone bill and then after you call that number --    16           A   Oh, right, yes, I'm sorry.  This is the other one you    17           showed me.  This is not an advertisement for an adult    18           bulletin board, this is a -- the homepage of a commercial Web    19           site that contains sexually explicit material and this is the    20           process by which they register you.  You must, rather than    21           using a fillout form, you go off line with a telephone number    22           and give your credit card information.    23           Q   Could you read for the Court in the small  print what it    24           says, starting with the word "due"?    25           A   "Due to the passage of the Telecommunication Act of                                                                            51     1           1995," -- which is wrong -- "which includes provisions     2           banning indecent material on the Internet, the material here     3           has been temporarily removed while we bring it into     4           compliance.  The member area is not affected."     5           Q   Do you have any idea what might have been on the site     6           prior to the words here?     7           A   No, I have no idea.     8           Q   Okay. It would have been a pornographic image?     9           A   It could have been a --    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Objection, she says she has no idea.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sustained.    12           BY MR. BARON:      13           Q   Okay.  Would you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 49?    14                    You stated at your deposition on Monday that you    15           were generally familiar with a site called Bianca's Smut    16           Shack, correct?    17           A   Yes, correct.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Bianca's what?    19                    MR. BARON:  Smut Shack, S-m-u-t.    20           BY MR. BARON:      21           Q   You would, turning from the material beyond the first    22           page, you would agree, would you not, that the text of the    23           materials on this site are sexually explicit?    24           A   You mean in general?    25           Q   The text of the various pages at the end of this exhibit,                                                                            52     1           correct?     2           A   Yes.     3           Q   Okay.  Now, just concentrating on the first page of the     4           exhibit, you see where it's titled "The Rules of the Game?"     5           A   Yes, I see that.     6           Q   Would you read for the Court in the third paragraph, can     7           you read to the Court what the third paragraph states?     8           A   The paragraph starting second?     9           Q   Yes.    10           A   "Second, Bianca Trol Productions recognizes its    11           responsibility under current U.S. law to take, 'in good    12           faith, reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under    13           the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors    14           to,' this site which may contain adult language and    15           situations.  We are also taking, 'appropriate measures to    16           restrict minors from such communications, including any    17           method which is feasible under available technology.'"    18           Q   Could you look at Point 2 which follows where it's    19           described as Technology Measure No. 1, and could you, after    20           you've had a moment to look at it, inform the Court what    21           Bianca is stating here?    22           A   Well, the site is stating that there is a way to block    23           people from coming to the site by means of blocking the IP    24           addresses which represent this particular site, so that you    25           can block at the user site by saying the -- by not allowing                                                                            53     1           the browser to go to sites that have particular IP or     2           Internet protocol addresses which are those numerical     3           addresses you see there, the 204.62.13.6, that's the locate--     4           that's the address of this particular site in cyberspace and     5           there's another address associated with it.  And if I know     6           the address, I can block it so that my particular computer     7           could not go to that address.     8           Q   You would agree, would you not, that Technology Measure     9           No. 2 is an effective measure with respect to blocking    10           individuals who access that ISP?    11           A   It's -- I agree that it's an effective measure of    12           blocking particular computers or people's access who use    13           those computers to particular sites, yes.    14           Q   Would you look at Technology Measure No. 2 which is    15           listed at Point 3?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   And inform the Court what the site is instructing to do?    18           A   Well, you can also do the reverse.  If you give your IP    19           address, if I were to send my -- my address to this    20           particular site, then it would also block me that way.  So I    21           would -- I could go there but it wouldn't let me in because    22           then it would know that I was coming in and say uh-oh, you    23           know, Professor Hoffman not allowed at this site, as    24           identified by my IP address on my computer.    25           Q   All right, thank you.  Your testimony and your                                                                            54     1           declaration-- that will be the end of the use of that -- your     2           testimony in your declaration is that the act in question     3           here, the Communications Decency Act, will have negative     4           consequences for the new medium of the Internet and     5           specifically the World Wide Web, correct?     6           A   Correct.     7           Q   You will -- you concede, will you not or you do concede,     8           do you not, that the exhibit that was 48 which was the     9           Cybersex City exhibit with the 1-900 number?    10           A   Mm-hmm.    11           Q   The fact that the material that's been removed with that    12           disclaimer about the Telecommunications Act, whatever that    13           material was, you would concede would you not that the    14           removal of that material does not have a profound adverse    15           consequence in terms of the growth of the Internet or the    16           ease of use of the World Wide Web, correct?    17           A   In that particular instance on that particular site I    18           would concede that, yes.    19           Q   You would also concede, would you not, Professor Hoffman,    20           that the site that's Bianca's Smut Shack's decision to    21           include a rules of the game homepage complete with tagging    22           and registration requirements as set forth in those two    23           technology measures will similarly not have a profound    24           adverse effect on the growth of the Web or the ease of use of    25           the Internet, correct?                                                                            55     1           A   On that particular site, that's correct.     2           Q   Could you explain for the Court what Anonymous Remailers     3           are?     4           A   Yes, Anonymous Remailers and their -- and a related     5           service called Pseudonymity Servers are computer services     6           that privatize your identity in cyberspace.  They allow     7           individuals to, for example, post content for example to a     8           Usenet News group or to send an E-mail without knowing the     9           individual's true identity.    10                    The difference between an Anonymous Remailer and a    11           Pseudonymity Server is very important because an Anonymous    12           Remailer provides what we might consider to be true anonymity    13           to the individual because there would be no way to know on    14           separate instances who the person was who was making the post    15           or sending the E-mail.    16                    But with a Pseudonymity Server, an individual can    17           have what we consider to be a persistent presence in    18           cyberspace, so you can have a pseudonym attached to your    19           postings or your E-mails, but your true identity is not    20           revealed.  And these mechanisms allow people to communicate    21           in cyberspace without revealing their true identities.    22           Q   I just have one question, Professor Hoffman, on this    23           topic.  You have not done any study or survey to sample the    24           quantity or the amount of anonymous remailing on the    25           Internet, correct?                                                                            56     1           A   That's correct.  I think by definition it's a very     2           difficult problem to study because these are people who wish     3           to remain anonymous and the people who provide these services     4           wish to remain anonymous.     5           Q   You would agree, Professor Hoffman, that the Alt Binary's     6           hierarchy of Usenet News groups contains pornographic     7           imagery, correct?     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Objection, I'm not sure the word     9           "pornographic" has any meaning in the legal meaning.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, does it to you?    11                    THE WITNESS:  I agree it contains sexually explicit    12           material, yes.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, overruled.    14           BY MR. BARON:      15           Q   You also agree, do you not, that pornographers are using    16           Usenet News groups to advertise, correct?    17           A   Yes.  But can I clarify that?    18           Q   Sure.    19           A   What I have seen on Usenet News groups is that operators    20           of adult bulletin boards are in some cases, although it's    21           sometimes difficult to tell because it could just as well be    22           individuals who have downloaded content and are re-posting it    23           on Usenet News, but there are cases of images from adult    24           bulletin boards which are re-posted on Usenet News groups and    25           there's some idea that the operators of the adult bulletin                                                                            57     1           boards are using this as a mechanism to advertise their     2           service.     3           Q   Now, we've already gone over Paragraph 122 of your     4           declaration where you said that it is your, quote,     5           "impression," unquote, that there is a decreasing percentage     6           of sexually specific material in cyberspace as a proportion     7           of the total amount of packet traffic or hosts or however one     8           counts the Internet in terms of how big it is, correct?     9           A   Well, I didn't, no, that's not correct.  My declaration    10           doesn't say that.  It says that it is my opinion based on my    11           experience and my research in this medium that when    12           considered as a percent of the total information, so I'm    13           thinking of it particularly in terms either of postings for    14           example on Usenet News groups or in terms of URL's, for    15           example, on that portion of the Internet known as the World    16           Wide Web that the amount of sexually explicit material    17           available is actually constant and so as a percent of total    18           is decreasing because the total amount of information on the    19           Internet is increasing at a very rapid rate.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So it's that deduction is behind    21           Paragraph 122?    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's correct.    23           BY MR. BARON:      24           Q   But you can't say, can you, Professor Hoffman, in terms    25           of packet traffic on the Internet whether the sexually                                                                            58     1           explicit material consists of 10,000 packets or a million     2           packets or a billion packets, correct?     3           A   No, I can't say that, no one can say that.     4           Q   You have given no absolute number in terms of what the     5           quantum of pornography or sexually explicit material is in     6           cyberspace, correct?     7           A   Correct.     8           Q   Could you turn to Paragraph 129 of your declaration?     9                    You state that digital Alta Vista's search engine    10           currently indexes over 21 million unique URL's and 10 billion    11           words on the World Wide Web?    12           A   Correct, except now it's -- I just checked yesterday,    13           it's now 22 million unique URL's and 11 million words -- 11    14           billion words, I'm sorry.    15           Q   All right.  Now, as a hypothetical if just one percent of    16           cyberspace on the Web contains sexually explicit material,    17           that would translate, under your new numbers, as 220,000    18           unique URL's and 110 million words by your calculation,    19           correct?  It's one percent of these figures.    20           A   If you assumed it was distributed uniformly that would be    21           a correct mathematical calculation, yes.    22           Q   Would you consider that to be a large amount under that    23           hypothetical?    24           A   I would not consider it to be a large amount as percent    25           of total.  I think it's very difficult to make absolute                                                                            59     1           statements about numbers unless they are referenced in a     2           framework.     3           Q   Well, you've testified that the Web is growing     4           phenomenally, right?     5           A   The Web as measured in the number of servers is growing,     6           is doubling approximately every two and a half months.  The     7           Internet as measured in the number of hosts computers     8           connected to it is doubling annually and has been so since     9           about 1981 or 1982.  So that we consider these to be    10           exponential and phenomenal rates of growth, yes.    11           Q   Well, given that phenomenal growth, just to be clear    12           about what your declaration is saying, a number can grow in    13           absolute numerical terms but still represent a smaller    14           percentage of a larger total if that total is growing    15           phenomenally, correct?    16           A   I don't understand what you just said.     17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can make that argument.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think we understand the basic laws    19           of mathematics.    20                    MR. BARON:  All right, I have no more questions,    21           your Honors.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, this is a good time to take    23           the ten-minute break and it will be a ten-minute break.    24                    THE COURT CLERK:  All right, please.    25                    (Court in recess; 10:45 to 11:00 o'clock a.m.)                                                                            60     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, we'll hear the plaintiffs on     2           redirect.     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.     4                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION     5           BY MR. HANSEN:       6           Q   Professor Hoffman, you had some discussion with the     7           Government concerning the definition of hits and unique     8           domains of methods of measuring the number of people who are     9           actually traveling in cyberspace.  Does the -- would you    10           explain again what a unique domain is?    11           A   Yes.  A unique domain is, very simply stated, the address    12           of the computer.  Every computer has associated with it a    13           particular address and that address can be in words, so, for    14           example, gateway.senate.gov, or it can be in numbers, the    15           numerical address or sometimes called the IP address, which    16           stands for Internet protocol.  However, the situation becomes    17           a little bit more confusing or complicated, because there are    18           various types of systems that computers can be assigned    19           addresses, which makes it very difficult to know what --    20           which particular computer might be coming to your site.  So,    21           for example the -- let's just take an example of AOL, the    22           commercial on-line service which is a gateway to the    23           Internet, the address for AOL is aol.com, that's a domain    24           name, and it has an IP address associated with it, which I    25           don't know what that is.  However, AOL has a series of                                                                            61     1           machines that it uses for its users to get onto the Internet     2           and they might be called, for example, aol1.aol.com,     3           aol2.aol.com, and so on.  But AOL has about five million     4           users, but AOL does not have five million unique domains, it     5           only has a much smaller number.  So, for example, on the     6           Project 2000 site we get many visits from AOL presumably, but     7           they only -- from people who use AOL as their gateway to surf     8           the net, but it shows up in our server log as, say,     9           aol1.aol.com and that's a hit, a visit.  What I don't know is    10           how many people were associated with that domain, because    11           when I count -- when I have a program that runs and goes    12           through the server log and counts up how many times    13           AOL1.AOL.com came I have no idea who it was behind that    14           machine or how many.  So, it could have been a child, it    15           could have been an adult, it could have been the same adult    16           on repeated occasions, because there might be ten listings in    17           the server log that say aol1.aol.com coming in, say, at 10:00    18           a.m., and then maybe at noon aol1.aol.com came in again, and    19           then at 4:00 p.m. in the log it might show aol1.aol.com    20           again, but I would have no way of knowing who it was or how     21           -- or anything.    22           Q   So, when you try to determine the number of unique    23           domains that have visited your Web site would that    24           underestimate or overestimate the number of actual people who    25           have come and looked at your Web site?                                                                            62     1           A   Well, it's clearly a lower bound, because what it really     2           estimates is the number of unique computers that came to the     3           site, it does not give anything but a lower bound on how many     4           -- on the minimum number of people who could have come.  And     5           in fact that's one of the impetuses for our research on     6           counting the number of users, because up until the time that     7           we started our research on Internet measurement people were     8           trying to estimate the number of computer users worldwide by     9           counting the number of machines connected to the Internet and    10           multiplying by a number.  So, for example, the rule of thumb    11           factor or the number was some number between five and ten,    12           because the conventional wisdom was many years ago or even    13           five years ago that there were about five to ten people    14           associated with each computer domain, but over time that's    15           clearly become untrue because -- for a number of reasons;    16           one, because of hosts like AOL, which have five million users    17           but only a very small and finite number of domains; hosts    18           like Compuserve, compuserve.com, for example; and through a    19           procedure called, for example, dynamic allocations, so at    20           Universities and other businesses IP addresses are assigned    21           dynamically on the moment you log in and those numbers can    22           change and are not necessarily the same number associated    23           with the same computer --    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  When you say dynamically, a word you    25           use fairly frequently in your declaration, what do you mean?                                                                            63     1                    THE WITNESS:  I mean at that moment, in real time,     2           so, in response to something happening in the environment.      3           In this context of dynamic allocation of IP addresses, that     4           means at the moment that someone needs to connect to the     5           Internet from, say, a computer in a computer lab at a     6           university that computer is assigned a free domain name and     7           IP address at that moment --     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  On the spot?     9                    THE WITNESS:  -- on the spot, right.  So, dynamic    10           means in real time something is happening.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And does the number come back, is    12           it used and then never used again?    13                    THE WITNESS:  No, it could be used again, but it    14           might be by another machine in the lab on another day,    15           another time, another moment, whatever.  So, the best you can    16           do if you're trying to count -- and the reason obviously I'm    17           interested in this is from a commercial perspective.  So,    18           it's very important to get as good a count as possible of the    19           people in front of the machines, not the machines.  And, so,    20           we have tried to move away or make arguments that we must    21           move away from counts of host and then multiplying by a    22           factor of five or ten, which is now meaningless because some    23           hosts are single-user hosts.  In other words, my machine,    24           collette.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu just has me on it, so that's    25           called a single-host machine or a single-user machine, but                                                                            64     1           other hosts, as I've already said, have thousands of people     2           associated with them.  So, what we have to do is count the     3           users.  So, the only way to know how many people are coming     4           to your site and, particularly because of other problems like     5           the spiders and Bots that go out searching and hit the site     6           and count as hits, the only way to know is to count the     7           people on the other side.     8           BY MR. HANSEN:       9           Q   And if we took your computer and ran the number of hits    10           that your computer received on a particular day, and then    11           also ran the number of unique domains that had been to your    12           site on a particular day, the number of actual human beings    13           would likely be somewhere between those two numbers?    14           A   Right, but in my particular case, on our server, much    15           closer to the number of unique domains and that's because we    16           do not serve, you know, tens of thousands of pages, we're a    17           research center site and we put up our research papers and we    18           have thousands of pages.  But a site like Pathfinder, for    19           example, Time Warner's site, which consists of many of its    20           on-line magazines and lots of content, they report that they    21           get like two million hits a week.  So that's clearly a    22           meaningless number from a commercial perspective, because all    23           it says is that many files and pictures and images are being    24           served up, but says very little about who is coming, how many    25           are coming, how often they're coming and to which pages                                                                            65     1           they're coming.     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how long they're on?     3                    THE WITNESS:  And -- exactly.  Duration, we believe,     4           is one of the critical variables for measuring the value of a     5           visit to a Web site in this environment and that hits are     6           meaningless, unique domains are a lower bound, but nothing     7           else and just useful as a starting point, and that the key     8           issues are visits and behavior in a network navigation     9           context, which includes duration in the Web site.    10           BY MR. HANSEN:      11           Q   Professor Hoffman, are hits meaningless in this context:     12           If you are at your Web site in Vanderbilt required to screen    13           every person who comes to your site and, indeed, every one of    14           the thousands -- each time anyone goes to any one of the    15           thousands of pages on your site and determine whether that    16           person is above the age of 18 or under the age of 18, is hits    17           a meaningless number in that context?    18           A   Completely meaningless.  Hits, even unique domains are    19           just completely meaningless, there is no way to determine    20           from the server log file, which contains information on the    21           hits and the unique domains, who is coming to my Web site.    22           Q   But you would nevertheless have to screen the -- the    23           number of times you would have to check to see if someone is    24           18 or not 18 would be roughly measured by the number of hits,    25           the number of actual times you would have to look and see is                                                                            66     1           that person 18 or not?     2           A   Yes, roughly speaking, by some -- divided by some factor     3           for how many hits were on a particular page, but, yes, if I -     4           - let's just say I have a thousand pages, for sake of     5           argument, on the Project 2000 site, every single one of those     6           pages of those 1,000 pages would have to have some sort of     7           screening device, otherwise I would not be able to prevent     8           them from coming to those pages or determining who was coming     9           to those pages.    10           Q   When you run the unique domain list of the number of    11           unique domains that have come to your site on a particular    12           day does it also show the country from which someone has come    13           to access your site?    14           A   Well, it could, it's -- it could in the sense that unique    15           domains have identifiers associated with them.  To understand    16           this idea we can introduce the notion of what we'll call the    17           top-level domain.  So, again, to use my example,    18           collette.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu, that's my entire address or    19           host name or domain name, the top level is edu and that    20           identifies my machine as coming from an educational    21           institution, because it has the .edu address.  Now, the most    22           common addresses in cyberspace are the .com for commercial,    23           that's the top level. So, aol.com or timewarner.com or    24           openmarket.com and so on.  Edu is the second most common,    25           followed by .net, which represent Internet service providers                                                                            67     1           and other gateways to the Internet.  There's .org for     2           nonprofit organizations, .gov, for government organizations.      3           So, the domain name here almost certainly has a .gov at the     4           end of it, and so on.  So, it is -- and then there are many     5           other domain names, like .ca at the top would represent     6           Canada, .es would represent Estonia and so on.  So, in theory     7           it is possible to run a program and count, using a table for     8           lookup, say, which would say, well, I know how many came from     9           Spain, I know how many came from Finland, I know how many    10           came from the Netherlands and so on, because in the    11           Netherlands they usually use a .nl as the top-level domain.     12           So, you can get -- but that only gives you an underestimate,    13           because increasingly the .com address is being used abroad    14           and that didn't used to be the case, but is now increasingly    15           the case, and the .com host is about 26 percent of all hosts    16           on the Internet.  So, right now the Internet has -- it was    17           just recently measured in January, it's measured every six    18           months by Mark Lottor, and his latest measurements show that    19           the Internet has 9.47 million hosts, about, give or take.  Of    20           those nine and a half million, let's round it for ease of    21           discussion, about 26 percent are .com, about 19 percent are    22           .edu, and we know that -- so that the .coms represent not    23           just U.S. commercial enterprise, but also overseas commercial    24           enterprise.    25           Q   And using this system --                                                                            68     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, what percentage are .org?     2                    THE WITNESS:  I think it's about three percent, a     3           little less than three percent.  The .net, .org and .gov are     4           all running a little below three percent.  If we look at a     5           host distribution by country, though, that was in -- the     6           latest measurements for that were taken in July of 1995.  So,     7           we don't have the figures for Mr. Lottor's most recent     8           calculations, because they haven't been done yet; however,     9           those distributions show that 60 percent of hosts were    10           thought to originate from the United States and 40 percent of    11           those hosts, and in July, '95 the hosts were running a little    12           over six and a half million, now it's almost ten million, so    13           it was about 60-40 U.S., non-U.S., and the distribution -- I    14           don't remember exactly, it was United States followed by --    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the source you're citing is    16           what?    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Lottor.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Lottor?    19                    THE WITNESS:  Lottor, L-o-t-t-o-r, Mark Lottor, he    20           runs a company called Network Wizards and as a service to the    21           Internet community he runs a program which counts the number    22           of hosts on the computer every six months.  I don't -- I    23           cannot find my... oh, here it is, I found it.  My listing is    24           United States had a little over 60 percent, followed by    25           Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, the                                                                            69     1           Netherlands, France, Finland and Sweden, and those are the     2           top ten.  Now, the distribution now is thought to be 60-40,     3           even though we don't know yet, but we believe it's moving     4           towards 60-40 and it was at 64-36.  So, it's clearly moving     5           toward parody and that seems -- is also borne out by counting     6           the number of networks connected to the Internet, which is     7           now moving toward a parody distribution of about 50-50,     8           meaning about 50 percent of networks connected to the net are     9           in the U.S. and about 50 percent of networks connected to the    10           Internet are non-U.S.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that also Mr. Lottor's work?    12                    THE WITNESS:  That is also Mr. Lottor's work, with    13           also John Quarterman, who provided some of these statistics    14           based on reanalyses of Mr. Lottor's data.    15           BY MR. HANSEN:      16           Q   Professor Hoffman, you were present in court yesterday    17           when Ms. Duvall did her demonstration?    18           A   Yes.    19           Q   And you saw her take us all to a site that was in London,    20           is that correct?    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   Is it fair to say that it takes just as many clicks to go    23           a site in London as it does to go to a site in Philadelphia?    24           A   Yes, or just as few, as the case may be.    25           Q   Now, I'd like you to -- I'd like to refer you back to                                                                            70     1           Defendant's Exhibit 13-A, which was the Little Women search.      2                    (Pause.)     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   Now, the particular entry on that page that you were     5           questioned about, the see-hot-pictures-of-naked-women page,     6           do you know whether that particular site if I clicked on it     7           would be blocked by Surf Watch?     8           A   I don't know.     9           Q   Let's look at Defendant's Exhibit 49, which was the --    10           which was Bianca's site which you were questioned about.    11                    (Pause.)    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   Now, Mr. Baron asked you to read Technology Measures 1    14           and 2, he didn't ask you to read Technology Measure 3, would    15           you read that?  It's Number 4, but Technology Measure 3,    16           would you read that one, please?    17           A   Yes, Technology Measure Number 3:  "We heartily support    18           all self-imposed Internet content selection solutions, such    19           as Surf Watch and PICS."    20           Q   Now, the three technology solutions that are suggested on    21           this site, do they have anything in common?    22           A   Yes, they're all user-oriented solutions, because their    23           activity and control all would reside in the hands of the    24           user or the people who are accessing the content or    25           interested in accessing the content.                                                                            71     1           Q   Does this site suggest any method by which the content     2           provider could insure that no one under the age of 18 was     3           visiting their site?     4           A   No, and I believe that's because no such solutions are     5           possible.  And in fact I think it's instructive that they are     6           requiring you to tell them when you don't wish to be able to     7           go there, because that's the only way that they can know is     8           if you tell them.     9           Q   Thank you.    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, given the objection that    11           was raised at the beginning of this, I just want to make sure    12           that her declaration went in as her direct testimony?    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Absolutely.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think so --    15                    MR. HANSEN:  Okay, thank you.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- if it didn't, it does now.    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have any --    19                    MR. BARON:  Subject to our objection, your Honor.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Pardon?    21                    MR. BARON:  Subject to our objection on the    22           paragraph.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you have any recross?                                                                            72     1                    MR. BARON:  No, your Honor.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Judge Buckwalter?     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I just have a very few questions.      4           Throughout your -- well, not throughout your declaration, but     5           in your declaration, as well as others, there's reference to     6           the Internet as being a truly democratic information flow and     7           I think you say in 24 a democratic form of communication,     8           what do you mean by that when you say that?     9                    THE WITNESS:  I mean that the Internet, particularly    10           as compared to traditional communication media and even some    11           other forms of new media, like other interactive media, is    12           truly a revolution in the sense that for the first time in    13           the history of communication media users or individuals can    14           provide content to the medium.  So, in addition to accessing    15           information or content they can also provide information to    16           the medium.  And the other unique feature is coupled with    17           this idea of interactivity, so that not only can you and I    18           communicate with each other through the medium, something we    19           call person interaction, but I can communicate directly with    20           the medium, something we call machine interactivity, and    21           that's the idea where I can both access content and provide    22           it.  So, for the first time there is an opportunity for all    23           people or any person who has access to the medium to put    24           their opinion on the medium or in essence to have a voice in    25           society as represented by the Internet.                                                                            73     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Without any government     2           interference, does that --     3                    THE WITNESS:  Without any --     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- have something to do with your     5           the -- the --     6                    THE WITNESS:  No, not really.  No, I meant it in the     7           sense that there was no -- no, I meant it more that the     8           medium does not discriminate on the basis of the individual's     9           either accessing or providing the content.  So, for example,    10           if I put a site up, which I did, the Project 2000 site, my    11           site has just as much chance or is just as likely to be    12           visited by people as a site by a communications conglomerate    13           like Time Warner, because there is nothing inherent in the    14           medium keeping someone from coming to Project 2000, there are    15           no barriers, there are no gateways, they don't have to pay to    16           get there --    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But there is a -- there is a Big    18           Brother overlooking the media -- or overlooking the Internet    19           in a sense, isn't there?  If it's not the government it's the    20           people who for example have the -- in these directories    21           you're talking about who make choices as to what goes in the    22           directory?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't look at that -- I don't    24           think of that as Big Brother --    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, no, I mean maybe not as Big                                                                            74     1           Brother, but there's somebody out there.  And on the on-line     2           discussion forums, for example, isn't there somebody who     3           steers the discussion in some way?     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, not necessarily.  On UseNet news     5           groups, there are two types of UseNet news groups, if that's     6           what you're referring to?     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, I mean --     8                    THE WITNESS:  And those -- there are moderated --     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- on some discussion forums    10           isn't there somebody who steers and focuses the discussion?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it depends what you mean by --    12           no, I am not aware of anyone --    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  It's not an open --    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- on un-moderated discussion lists    15           like UseNet news groups, for example, who steers or focuses    16           the discussion.  The people themselves determine the content    17           and the focus and the positioning of the discussion, but    18           there is no person on the shoulder of the UseNet news group    19           if it's un-moderated saying now we will talk about X and    20           tomorrow we will talk about Y.    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I only raise that question    22           because I was surfing or browsing magazines, which is what we    23           used to do --    24                    (Laughter.)    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- and The Atlantic magazine, in                                                                            75     1           this month's article -- that's on something called paper --     2                    (Laughter.)     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- raised this, suggesting that     4           the most popular on-line discussion forums tend to be not     5           purely democratic by quasi-authoritarian in spirit, with an     6           active systems operator who both steers and stimulates     7           debate.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Maybe you put on the record --     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  On the record, that's --    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- where you're --    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- the -- that's attributed to    12           James Fowell (ph.), the Washington editor of The Atlantic    13           magazine and it's their April issue.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And his position was that for the    16           time being that the editors and other data winnowers are    17           becoming important in this whole scheme of things, because    18           they do actually overlook the system in some way and --    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there is no question that there    20           are a number of gatekeepers, if you want to think of it from    21           that perspective.    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Gatekeepers, okay.  Well, that's    23           the terminology, I --    24                    THE WITNESS:  However, they are definitely not, at    25           least from my perspective -- or have a Big Brother component                                                                            76     1           to them.  And particularly on the UseNet news groups, just to     2           use that example, it really -- if they're not moderated     3           people are free to say and post and do what they like, if     4           other people don't like it then they will respond by saying,     5           I don't like that, a process we sometimes refer to as     6           flaming.  But the whole behavior on the group is very organic     7           with no one necessarily determining now we will do this and     8           then we will do that.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What does organic mean in that    10           context?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it flows -- it evolves    12           naturally, there is no one in charge of the process, it is    13           allowed to grow and flow naturally as events unfold.    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Like a conversation at a cocktail    15           party.    16                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly.  Now, there are     17           gatekeepers --    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But it's not that exactly though,    19           is it?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think it's more like that --    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, okay, we won't debate that.    22                    THE WITNESS:  -- than like the way that you    23           proposed, because the Internet is composed of -- for example,    24           on UseNet news there are approximately 15,000 UseNet news    25           groups and, by and large, I would say that the behavior is                                                                            77     1           very open and democratic with access to all, you can say what     2           you like, other people can respond in kind or not, you are     3           not required to respond, and really there is no one in charge     4           in a broader sense.  The same is true on the Web, there are     5           many indexes, there are not just one index and that's it and     6           that's the only one you can list in and if you don't list     7           there, forget it, you're no one.     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand the point you're     9           trying to make.    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did you have any more questions?    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I think that's all then.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have a number of questions.  First    14           of all, these -- this hierarchy you referred to, the point    15           that .com means commercial, that .edu means education, these    16           are self-given names?    17                    THE WITNESS:  No, they are -- there is a    18           registration process that you have to go through for    19           addresses --    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I thought.    21                    THE WITNESS:  -- through an organization called    22           Internick (ph.) and domains have to be registered so that    23           they can be connected to the Internet.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And also so that they're not    25           duplicated?                                                                            78     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's the most important point,     2           so that you have a unique identifier in cyberspace for your     3           host computer to be connected to the Internet.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And so Internick, somebody at     5           Internick makes a judgment, correct?  For example, if my     6           daughter wanted to register and say I'm an edu somebody there     7           would say that's ridiculous, you're just a kid?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, there are specific rules for --     9           which are fairly broadly defined, but rules nonetheless    10           governing the use of the top-level domains, particular for    11           .com, .edu, .net, .org and .gov.  I think there are other    12           organizations besides Internick that register and the rules    13           are different, particularly for some of the European or    14           overseas addresses, because it could also be the case that it    15           might say .es, which stands for Estonia, but it's not    16           necessarily the case that those hosts originate in Estonia.     17           So, it's very complicated.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Referring now to your    19           declaration, in Paragraph 31, Footnote 1 there has a number    20           of statistics and the footnote begins by saying, "The most    21           recent figures, decisionmakers are using for business    22           planning and research purposes," do you see that?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And then it makes reference to the    25           "so-called total core economy for electronic commerce on the                                                                            79     1           Internet will approach $45.8 billion by the year 2000," et     2           cetera.     3                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm, yes.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Where do those numbers come from?     5                    THE WITNESS:  The first source -- these all come     6           from analysts --     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Pardon me?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Analysts.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, Wall Street analysts?    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    12                    THE WITNESS:  Or research analysts who specialize in    13           the Internet.  I put them here just to -- first of all to    14           show the enormous range in the estimates, from very small to    15           very large, I think by and large reflecting that we really    16           don't know what's going to happen in the long run.  The first    17           estimate comes from Forrester Research, the second estimate I    18           believe comes from Alex Brown and Sons, and then the third    19           one comes from Hamberg & Quist (ph.), and these are different    20           analysts who are involved in assessing the business    21           opportunity for the Internet.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Who are advising -- for the purposes    23           of advising investors on where to put their money?    24                    THE WITNESS:  As one example, yes.  In the case of    25           Forrester Research no, they do -- their clients, they do                                                                            80     1           research for their clients on, say, strategic opportunities     2           on the Internet, in which case it's still important to know     3           from an investment perspective, say if I wish to open up a     4           commercial enterprise on line, you know, what -- you know,     5           how much money could I make, for example.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Page 10, Paragraph 40, just     7           so I'm absolutely sure I understand what you're saying here,     8           when you say, and now I'm quoting, "because network     9           navigation is nonlinear," when you use the word nonlinear    10           there what exactly do you mean?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly what I mean is that the    12           navigation process is not strict ordered and sequential.  So,    13           for example, it's not a rough linear menu, meaning things    14           fall in a line in order, first one, then you must go to two,    15           then you must go to three, then you must go to four, as if    16           they were literally ordered on a line and I had to proceed in    17           that fashion.  The network navigation experience on the    18           Worldwide Web is nonlinear in the sense that either I might    19           be presented with a set of choices on a Web page which are a    20           list, but I can go anywhere on the list I want, I don't have    21           to go in order, or, as increasingly is the case, they might    22           be presented to me graphically in means of different images    23           or maps or pictures, and I simply move my mouse and point to    24           the particular area on the map on which I want to go and then    25           I'm off.                                                                            81     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, that's very helpful,     2           thank you.  You also say on Page 21 in Paragraph 93, you make     3           what seems to me to be an extraordinary statement and I just     4           want to draw you out on it a little bit.  You referred to the     5           -- I assume the Internet and the capacity for many-to-many     6           decentralized communication at --     7                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, would you repeat the     8           paragraph, please?     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  93.    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You refer to it as, quote, "the most    12           important innovation to human society since the development    13           of the printing press," close-quote.  Now, that's a pretty    14           extravagant statement, wouldn't you agree?    15                    THE WITNESS:  I do -- yes, but I do believe --    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But do you stand by it, or is it    17           just --    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe that the Internet is    19           the most important communications innovation to human society    20           since the development of the printing press.  So --    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because?    22                    THE WITNESS:  Because it allows for -- because of    23           it's many-to-many nature it allows for a level of    24           communication and interactivity among human beings which is    25           unprecedented in our society, and it also allows for                                                                            82     1           individuals in our society to have the opportunity to     2           contribute information in a mechanism that was never before     3           possible.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  In Paragraph 101 on Page     5           22 you make the statement, "The act will have a negative     6           impact on commercialization, because many providers will     7           either exit the market or simply never enter."  I'm not quite     8           sure why you say that.     9                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I believe there is already a lot    10           of evidence that the act will have negative consequences on    11           commercialization of the Internet.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What evidence are you aware of in    13           your area of expertise?    14                    THE WITNESS:  From commercial providers and other    15           people who are considering becoming commercial providers who    16           are very concerned about the impact of the act either on    17           their business or on potential for their business.  And --    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you know that?    19                    THE WITNESS:  How do I know --    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you know that they're    21           concerned?    22                    THE WITNESS:  Because they have told me.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And they have told you that    24           they haven't entered the business or --    25                    THE WITNESS:  They have told me that they're                                                                            83     1           considering -- I have had conversations with providers who     2           are considering exiting the business, providers who already     3           have, for example, removed material because they are     4           uncertain of its impact on people, and people who were     5           thinking of getting on line and are now very concerned.  For     6           example, women who are considering getting into commercial     7           enterprises.  I participated in a forum on Compuserve in a     8           section devoted to women and business, and I was presented as     9           an expert that the women could interact with -- or men too,    10           but it largely drew women who were very interested in    11           starting up enterprises that in some way involved the    12           Internet.  And for women the Internet can represent a very    13           interesting business opportunity because it presents the    14           potential to work at home, for example, so you could still be    15           involved in the rearing of your children and you could still    16           potentially run a very profitable business yet out of your    17           house, which is another example of how it's democratic    18           because the entry barriers are very low, you don't need a lot    19           of capital investment in order to set up a site on the    20           Worldwide Web.  However, the women are very concerned about    21           not only the technical issues involved or some of the more    22           maybe conceptual issues with how would I use this medium, but    23           also the legal issues of what will it mean for me, this is    24           now too complicated, I won't be able to figure it out, you    25           know, I'm just not going to get involved in this.  And, so, I                                                                            84     1           do see in my work an enormous amount of concern on the part     2           of providers or potential providers, and in fact I would     3           suggest that the concern is even more potent for the small     4           providers.  And, so, from the perspective of, say, the small     5           business or an individual business person or what we might     6           refer to as a mom-and-pop that the fear is very real.  It     7           might be less of a concern for Time Warner who may feel, oh,     8           well, we will have the legal resources to deal with these     9           issues as they arise, but for small providers that's not the    10           case.  And, so, in that sense the democratic, open, low-    11           barrier nature of the net becomes at risk.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And lastly, just to make sure    13           I understand your testimony, Paragraphs 107 through 111, the    14           figures in those paragraphs, do they all come from Mr.    15           Lottor?    16                    THE WITNESS:  No, they come from a number of    17           different sources.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, could you briefly    19           summarize for us where they come from?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  The source in Paragraph 107 --    21           well, actually I should clarify that most of these numbers if    22           we were to trace them back come from Mark Lottor's analysis    23           of host counts on the Worldwide Web, the data are then    24           reanalyzed by primarily two different individuals, the first    25           individual is Tony Rutkowski, he was --                                                                            85     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you spell that, please?     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, R-u-t-k-o-w-s-k-i.  He was     3           formerly the director of the Internet Society and he is now     4           with General Magic, a software company in California.  And     5           Mr. Rutkowski performs reinterpretations or reanalyses or re-     6           parsings of Mr. Lottor's data, which is just presented in a     7           tabular form, it is not particularly interesting from a     8           commercial perspective.  And, so, these data come from him or     9           from Mr. Quarterman, who runs a strategic consulting firm for    10           Internet use in Austin and also performs reanalyses for    11           strategic purposes.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, are those in articles that have    13           been published?    14                    THE WITNESS:  No, they're on the Internet, they are    15           not in -- do not appear in peer-reviewed journals.  These    16           numbers change the next day.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Dr. Hoffman, do the -- let    19           me take you to the concept of flow that you talk about in    20           your declaration and a little bit in your examination here    21           today.  Do the experts in the field of psychology accept the    22           concept of flow?  In other words, is it a recognized concept    23           by respected scientists in the field?  I'm not sure that's    24           exactly the Daubert standard, but we'll --    25                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, the answer is yes.  The                                                                            86     1           concept was developed by a psychologist, Mahayli Gezens (ph.)     2           Mahayli, and he has done some work on his own, with his wife     3           and many other co-authors, all of it published in peer-     4           reviewed, refereed scholarly journals in the psychological     5           literature.  And he has actually written several popular     6           books on the topic, one of the best known is Flow:  The     7           Psychology of Optimal Experience, which is a book not exactly     8           for the lay person, but more popular than his other scholarly     9           work.  He has developed the concept in a very generic    10           context, in other words, that flow is a construct that    11           describes people's experiences in situations I described    12           previously, for example playing chess, rock climbing,    13           dancing, things of that nature.  Additionally, the concept    14           has achieved recognition in the organizational studies    15           literature by workers who are studying human-computer    16           interaction and believe that the concept also has merit and    17           utility there.  So, for --    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, was -- then is this concept    19           of flow as related to this interactive computer relationship,    20           is that also accepted in peer-review articles?    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, yes, I'm happy to say now that    22           it is, because that is our concept and our paper on that    23           topic will appear in July in the Journal of Marketing, which    24           is the top journal in the marketing field and is peer-    25           reviewed, refereed and double-blind.                                                                            87     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, but if you remove the     2           concept of flow or you set it aside and this state called the     3           pleasure of intrinsically motivated experiential flow state,     4           all of which I gather means that people feel good --     5                    THE WITNESS:  Right.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- when they use a computer, so     7           that -- when it goes back and forth, you know --     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes -- or -- well, yes.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  But if you set that concept    10           aside at the moment would you still reach the bottom line,    11           which I gather is the bottom line of some of your    12           declaration, that it's important for users to be able to jump    13           from hypertext link -- one hypertext link to another in a    14           seamless fashion because it facilitates the use of the    15           Internet or Worldwide Web as a goal-directed approach, by    16           which I understand you are saying that this is a way of    17           getting information, if you want information, it's the same    18           as going to a library; a different method of going, but it's    19           still important because it facilitates that kind of research,    20           let us say.  Is that basically what it comes down to?    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's -- no, that's exactly    22           correct because, as we state in our research papers, the flow    23           experience is not necessarily achievable by every person who    24           gets on line --    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I can understand that.                                                                            88     1                    (Laughter.)     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, there might be -- I assume     3           there might be frustrations as well.     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes -- no, in fact we -- the reason     5           that the flow concept is of interest is because it allows us     6           to study precisely frustrations and the things that might     7           keep people from having a good time or enjoying themselves.      8           Nevertheless, whether we could get into flow or not on any     9           particular occasion or whether even I could ever get into    10           flow, because we believe some people will never get there,    11           the concept of network --    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's like nirvana maybe.    13                    (Laughter.)    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's related to peak experience,    15           but not the same, yes.  Whether we --    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I'm more interested in the    17           concept of getting information, which I think --    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we -- I completely believe that    19           the --     20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- is an entirely different    21           concept.    22                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, network navigation, the    23           process exists regardless of whether you will achieve flow or    24           be in the flow state or not during that process.  And network    25           navigation is the process of self movement or direction                                                                            89     1           through cyberspace and that process is impeded or is     2           potentially impeded by the idea of a necessity to register or     3           to say, here I am now at yet another site, because     4           potentially then I no longer can move seamlessly through     5           cyberspace.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And then when you say seam -- what     7           do you mean by seamlessly?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Seamlessly meaning from click to     9           click.  There is a lot of evidence that the explosive growth    10           of the Worldwide Web is due to word of mouth, which means    11           that people see how exciting it is and then they tell someone    12           else.  And the nature of that excitement comes from being    13           able to one minute I'm in Paris, the next I'm in Finland.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but if you set aside    15           excitement, because I must -- I mean, set aside that concept    16           and go to the information-retrieval sort of concept, then you    17           would put seamless -- is it fair -- because I'm just trying    18           to understand what you're saying in language I can    19           understand, is it fair that you analogize seamlessness to    20           walking into a public library without having to register?    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, exactly.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, then I understand.  Thank    23           you.    24                    Did our questions elicit -- evoke any questions by    25           counsel?                                                                            90     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But you're saying that from, as it     2           were, a marketing analysis point of view that the     3           seamlessness of going from hyperlink to hyperlink is itself     4           what has attracted so many people to use this innovation?     5                    THE WITNESS:  Well, not even from a marketing point     6           of view, I'm suggesting from a human communication point of     7           view.  So, it's much broader than from a commercial     8           perspective, because we also study the behavioral aspects of     9           being in cyberspace.  And it is this ability to move    10           seamlessly through the Worldwide Web that we believe has    11           contributed to its explosive growth, yes.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, you're saying they get a high    13           when they can jump from one link to another like I or Judge    14           Dalzell or Judge Buckwalter might get a high just by going    15           into a library and being able --    16                    (Laughter.)    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- being able to look at the books?    18                    (Laughter.)    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Other people might not, but we    20           might.    21                    THE WITNESS:  But some people will, that's right.     22           And notice that your high of being able to look at the books    23           is very nonlinear.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's more than a high, isn't it?     25           I mean, it's a little more mundane than a high, it's just                                                                            91     1           easy, it's just easy?     2                    THE WITNESS:  It's easy, yes, it's easy; you might     3           get high, you might not, but it's easy.     4                    (Laughter.)     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron, I apparently evoked some     6           questions -- or maybe Judge Dalzell did from you.     7                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION     8           BY MR. BARON:       9           Q   Professor Hoffman, in response to Judge Dalzell's    10           questions you mentioned some out-of-court statements of women    11           being concerned or others being concerned about the effect of    12           the act and you hearing them say that to you, correct?    13           A   Yes.    14           Q   And you stated that some of these women or others    15           represent mom-and-pop businesses or small business providers,    16           correct?    17           A   Yes.    18           Q   Do any of these mom-and-pop businesses or small business    19           providers, are they in the business of providing sexually    20           explicit materials?    21           A   I don't know, I mean, some of them might be.  Some of    22           these conversations take place on an on-line community called    23           "the Well" and, while I know the people's names, I don't    24           necessarily know the nature of their business.    25           Q   You can't give any concrete examples of the nature of the                                                                            92     1           businesses where people are concerned about the effect of the     2           Communications Decency Act?     3           A   You mean do I know the particular lines of work?  Well,     4           in the case of people that are thinking about getting into     5           the business they are very vague in the sense that they are     6           thinking of providing some sort of information.  And in fact     7           a lot of times we get calls from people who would like us to     8           consult on projects in which they say what would the     9           opportunities be and, so, part of the work is to try to    10           identify, here are some opportunities for providing    11           information in cyberspace that might be profitable.  In other    12           cases, like, for example, there are people who sell T-shirts    13           on line, things of that nature, people who sell posters.  I'm    14           trying to think of ones that I know about, things -- those    15           are what I would consider small providers or mom-and-pops,    16           people selling catalogues to information, stuff like that.    17                    MR. BARON:  I have nothing further.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Hansen?    19                            FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION    20           BY MR. HANSEN:      21           Q   Professor Hoffman, I would first like to follow up on    22           Judge Buckwalter's question about moderated news groups.  Do    23           you know what percentage of UseNet news groups are moderated    24           in the way Mr. Fowell was suggesting in the Atlantic article?    25           A   No, I have no idea.                                                                            93     1           Q   Do you think that the percentage of moderated UseNet news     2           groups is a relatively small percentage?     3           A   I -- well, out of 15,000 I would guess that it is,     4           because I believe it to be the case that most of the news     5           groups on UseNet news are not moderated.     6           Q   I would also like to follow up just a second on the Chief     7           Judge's question when she asked you about is it like getting     8           into the library without having to check in at the front     9           desk.  Is the nature of the hyperlink process such that you    10           can go effortlessly from the fourth floor of Widener Library    11           in Boston to the third floor of Carnegie Mellon's library    12           in...    13                    UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Pittsburgh.    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Pittsburgh, I'm sorry.    15                    (Laughter.)    16           BY MR. HANSEN:      17           Q   In Pittsburgh without ever having to travel back and    18           forth, is that the nature of what hyperlinks are all about?    19           A   Yes.  And even more than that though, if we -- once we    20           went from a library in one city and one state to a library in    21           another city and another state through one click, it's also    22           the case that it would be as if every single book on every    23           single shelf you had to register, because every single page    24           would require some sort of registration process.  So, it    25           would be much more onerous than simply checking in at the                                                                            94     1           door, it would be every single book I wanted to select I     2           would have to go through a process to determine whether I     3           could select it or not.     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any more?  The Court would like the     6           plaintiffs at some appropriate time to annotate Dr. Hoffman's     7           declaration with the sources that she gave us in testimony,     8           because I think maybe many of us did not have an opportunity     9           to put them down.  Is there any objection to that?    10                    MR. BARON:  No, your Honor.    11                    MR. HANSEN:  We would be happy to do so, your Honor.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, thank you.  Thank you    13           very much.    14                    (Witness excused.)    15                    (Discussion held off the record.)

KAPPLER:  Good morning, your Honor, it's Ann    17           Kappler from Jenner and Block for the ALA plaintiffs.  Please    18           excuse my voice, I have a little cold.  At this time the    19           plaintiffs would like to call Robert Croneberger.    20                    THE COURT CLERK:  Good morning, sir.  Would you    21           please state and spell your name?    22                    THE WITNESS:  Robert, R-o-b-e-r-t, B., Croneberger,    23           C-r-o-n-e-b-e-r-g-e-r.    24                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please raise your right hand.    25                    ROBERT B. CRONEBERGER, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.                                                                            95     1                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you.  Please be seated.     2                    MS. KAPPLER:  At this time plaintiffs move into     3           evidence the supplemental declaration of Mr. Croneberger as     4           his direct trial testimony.  Mr. Croneberger executed the     5           supplemental declaration on March 19th and it was previously     6           submitted to this Court.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection?     8                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No objection.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then it will be accepted.    10                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor.  I would like    11           to make one correction, if I might, in Mr. Croneberger's    12           declaration, and this is a clerical error on the part of my    13           office.  In Paragraph 21 there is a reference to Plaintiffs'    14           Exhibit 203, this is his discussion of the RIM study as it    15           appears on their server, that should be a reference to    16           Exhibits 203 and 204.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    19                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you.  The Government has    20           previously --    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government have that    22           change?    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, thank you.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.    25                    MS. KAPPLER:  The Government has previously                                                                            96     1           indicated that they did not have any cross-examination for     2           Mr. Croneberger, so we are presenting Mr. Croneberger for the     3           Courts' questions.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but we're going to give the     5           Government a chance to say that.     6                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Actually the Government will have     7           cross-examination.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There you go.     9                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION    10           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:      11           Q   Good morning, Mr. Croneberger, how are you?    12           A   Good morning.  Fine, thank you.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you on the tape today?    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I will reintroduce myself.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  My name is Patricia Russotto, I'm an    17           attorney at the Department of Justice, representing the    18           Department of Justice in this action.    19           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:      20           Q   Now, Dr. Croneberger, you are director of the Carnegie    21           Library, correct?    22           A   That's correct.    23           Q   In Pittsburgh?    24           A   Yes.    25                    (Laughter.)                                                                            97     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll never forget it.     2                    THE WITNESS:  But not Carnegie Mellon Library.     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, I understand.     4           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:       5           Q   Now, the Carnegie Library has available on line a variety     6           of materials, is that right?     7           A   Correct.     8           Q   And included in the on-line materials that are available     9           you have a computerized card catalogue system, right?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   Which has all of the materials that are available in the    12           Carnegie Library collection -- well, I'll back off on that,    13           we went through this in your deposition.    14           A   Yes.    15           Q   It has about two million of the items that are available    16           in your collection, correct?    17           A   That's right, yes.    18           Q   And you also have available on line some of the full    19           texts of journal articles that the library subscribes to,    20           correct?    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   And would that also include -- do you also have some    23           books available in full text as well on line?    24           A   No, except through the Internet.    25           Q   Right, okay.  Now, your electronic card catalogue                                                                            98     1           contains information about these two million -- some two     2           million of the items that you have in your collection, right?     3           A   Yes.     4           Q   And some of the catalogue entries do contain references     5           to sex, right?     6           A   Yes.     7           Q   And some of them contain four-letter words, correct?     8           A   Correct.     9           Q   And what we would characterize as the seven dirty words,    10           for purposes of this examination, right?    11           A   Correct.    12           Q   And when these references to sex or these references to    13           the seven dirty words do appear in your card catalogue those    14           words are a part of the title of the work or part of a    15           content description of the work, is that right?    16           A   Yes.  It could possibly be headings or subject headings    17           or cross-references or footnotes that the cataloguers have    18           added, yes.    19           Q   Okay.  But some of these, for example, if we're talking    20           about the title of a book that appears in your card    21           catalogue, perhaps The Joy of Sex would be one where sex    22           comes up, right?    23           A   Correct.    24           Q   And I believe you also have in your collection    25           videotapes, right?                                                                            99     1           A   Correct.     2           Q   So, perhaps "Sex, Lies and Videotape" would be one of the     3           titles that would come up in your card catalogue, right?     4           A   Correct.     5           Q   And when we're talking about music, you have a collection     6           of CD's as well, correct?     7           A   Yes.     8           Q   And I believe you've gone through in your declaration     9           some examples of the types of CD's that would have some of    10           the seven dirty words either in the title or in the    11           description of the contents of the CD, correct?    12           A   Correct.    13           Q   But these all appear in a card catalogue, right?    14           A   That's right.    15           Q   And after finding a reference to these works in the card    16           catalogue the library patron generally has to then go    17           physically to your stacks and either select the book or pick    18           out the CD or take the videotape off the shelf to take it    19           home, right?    20           A   Yes.    21           Q   They don't just go directly from your electronic    22           catalogue to the text of whatever it is that they have    23           selected that they would like to take a look at, right?    24           A   Except in the case of on-line journals of course, yes.    25           Q   Right, okay.  Now, the catalogue entries themselves are                                                                           100     1           not actually prepared by Carnegie Library for the most part,     2           are they?     3           A   Not for the most part.     4           Q   For the most part you get them from the Library of     5           Congress, is that right?     6           A   Yes, we get them electronically through the Ohio Center     7           for Library Cataloguing, and they're downloaded that way     8           electronically.  Most of -- the majority of those entries, at     9           least the popular ones come directly from cataloguing from    10           the Library of Congress, which is loaded electronically into    11           the OCLC center.    12           Q   So, you get it electronically, it's already been prepared    13           and you get it electronically and simply insert it into your    14           catalogue system?    15           A   That's correct.    16           Q   Now --    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me a second.  Is it your    18           testimony that the Library of Congress gives the information    19           to this Ohio center and then the Ohio center puts it in    20           machine-readable form or --    21                    THE WITNESS:  No --    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- in electronic form?    23                    THE WITNESS:  No, the Library of Congress puts it--    24           transfers it electronically.  All -- many large libraries,    25           even I understand Harvard --                                                                           101     1                    (Laughter.)     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- contribute, as does the Carnegie     3           Library of Pittsburgh, to this electronic data base that's     4           gathered and collected in Ohio, and we all download, for a     5           fee, through this center electronically.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, the Library of Congress, as well     7           as --     8                    THE WITNESS:  They're one of the partners --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- other providers --    10                    THE WITNESS:  -- yes.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that's the central source is this    12           Ohio center?    13                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that Ohio University or    15           something, or University of Ohio?    16                    THE WITNESS:  It started at Ohio University, but it    17           has now split off into an independent organization and it    18           split off to provide that kind of electronic services.    19           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:      20           Q   Now, your card catalogue that you have on line, that can    21           be searched by key words, can't it?    22           A   Yes.    23           Q   And I believe that in Paragraph 32 of your declaration    24           you have indicated that you would have to hire some 180    25           additional staff in order to search all two million items                                                                           102     1           that are in your catalogue, correct?     2                    MR. MORRIS:  Could I give a copy of --     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Oh, I'm sorry.     4                    MR. MORRIS:  -- this declaration --     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, by all means.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And could you give a paragraph     8           citation?     9                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  It's Paragraph 32.    10                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.    11                    (Pause.)    12           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:      13           Q   So, you have said that you would have to hire about 180    14           additional staff in order to search all two million items in    15           your card catalogue, is that right?    16           A   Yes.  If we had to search them manually and if we had to    17           employ professionals or paraprofessionals, yes, that's    18           correct, of our current -- just of our current collections.    19           Q   Right, but you did say that you could do a key-word    20           search though through the card catalogue for words related to    21           sex or the seven dirty words, isn't that right?    22           A   That's correct.    23           Q   And if you do a key-word search then not all two million    24           of your catalogue entries are going to contain any reference    25           to sex or to the seven dirty words, are they?                                                                           103     1           A   Well, it entirely depends, certainly that's one of our     2           confusions under the Act, it entirely depends on what one     3           means by indecent or how it is described or what terminology     4           is being used or, indeed, to what level of extent the search     5           might be, that is, whether it's on content pages or whether     6           it's on chapters, it would be very difficult to know.     7           Q   Well, for example then a key-word search on the topic of     8           sex, for example, for everything that's in your card     9           catalogue, all the entries in your card catalogue that have    10           the word sex in them, a key-word search like that is not    11           likely, do you think, to turn up books about gardening, for    12           example?    13           A   I certainly wouldn't know, but I would doubt it.    14           Q   You do have books about gardening at the Carnegie    15           Library, right?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   And a key-word search for the term sex isn't going to    18           turn up books about physics?    19           A   Excuse me --    20           Q   Not very likely anyway?    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   You agree with that, that it's not likely to turn up    23           books about physics?    24           A   Well, it's likely to turn up -- obviously plants    25           proliferate and flowers grow, and it depends entirely upon                                                                           104     1           the kind of terminology you're using, sure.     2           Q   Okay.  Well, what about a biography of Abraham Lincoln,     3           do you think that would turn up in a key-word search using     4           the word sex?     5           A   I certainly have written -- I mean I certainly have read     6           some articles and some journal entries about Abraham     7           Lincoln's supposed or lack of sex life, yes.     8           Q   Okay.  What about books about travel, would they turn up,     9           do you think, in a book about -- in a key-word search for the    10           word sex?    11           A   Certainly possibly, but not likely.    12           Q   What about books about geology, for example, would they    13           turn up in a key-word search for the word sex?    14           A   Probably only if the rock is put together with roll and,    15           in that case, yes.    16                    (Laughter.)    17           Q   Okay.    18           A   I'm sorry, your Honors, I apologize.  Probably not.    19           Q   Probably not, thank you.    20                    (Laughter.)    21           Q   Well, would you agree that a key-word search for the word    22           sex is likely to turn up something less than all two million    23           of your card catalogue entries?    24           A   Yes, if that three-letter word were the only key word    25           being used, of course, yes.                                                                           105     1           Q   Well, would you agree also that a key-word search for the     2           seven dirty words are also likely to turn up something less     3           than all two million entries at the Carnegie Library?     4           A   Indeed.     5           Q   Now, I think you have also said, and I'm referring to     6           Paragraph 22 of your declaration, that you have the full text     7           of some magazine articles on line as well, correct?     8           A   Correct.     9           Q   And I believe the specific examples that you gave in your    10           declaration were Cosmopolitan, Vanity Fair and Playboy.  The    11           Cosmopolitan magazine that you have on line I'm assuming is    12           the same Cosmopolitan magazine that one can buy at the    13           grocery store check-out counter, is that right?    14           A   That's correct.    15           Q   And the same Vanity Fair is the same Vanity Fair that you    16           can pick up at the newsstand, right?    17           A   Yes.    18           Q   And Playboy is the same Playboy you would pick up    19           anywhere, I assume?    20           A   Yes.    21           Q   Do you carry the pictures from Playboy as well?    22           A   Not at the present time, the -- all of these on-line    23           magazines come through a commercial vendor called the    24           information access corporation and at the present time only    25           the abstracts and indexes for Playboy is part of that                                                                           106     1           licensing agreement that they have with IAC.     2           Q   I see.  So, someone who is accessing or trying to get on     3           line and get the text of a Playboy article wouldn't find the     4           pictures then?     5           A   Not through our on-line magazine access, correct.     6           Q   Now, referring to Paragraph 11 of your declaration, you     7           said that it is one of the missions of the Carnegie Library     8           to provide, quote, "the widest array of information to the     9           widest possible audience, both adults and minors," correct?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   But you don't provide your library patrons with every    12           type of information that might be available in the world, do    13           you?    14           A   No, of course not.    15           Q   You do exercise some discretion over what is selected to    16           become part of the collection at the Carnegie Library?    17           A   Yes.  And then those discretionary things are made up a    18           lot of different reasons and parameters, yes --    19           Q   Yes.    20           A   -- one of them is economics and one of them is -- all    21           different kinds of things, sure.    22           Q   And we talked about some of those when we took your    23           deposition on I believe it was Saturday, correct?    24           A   Right.    25           Q   And I believe that during your deposition you identified                                                                           107     1           some of those selection criteria as community standards and     2           value of the material, right?     3           A   Correct.     4           Q   And in fact I believe that you told me in your deposition     5           that you, quote, "try to" -- I will show you the page     6           reference actually before I quote this.     7                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  May I approach, your Honor?     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you may.     9                    (Pause.)    10           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:      11           Q   Well, let me ask you it a different way, since I do not    12           seem to have a copy --    13                    MR. MORRIS:  We have a copy of it.    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Do you have a copy of it?  Oh, thank    15           you.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.    17                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I apologize.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, it's consistent with the    20           relationship that we've noted throughout.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And commend.    22           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:      23           Q   I was referring to Page 35 of your deposition and it is    24           the end of one of your responses where you had said, quote,    25           that in fact when you select these materials you try to                                                                           108     1           reflect what you perceive to be the community standards of     2           your community, is that right?     3           A   Correct.     4           Q   So, that is a correct statement of one of the criteria     5           that you would use in selecting materials?     6           A   Yes.  And I think if I -- that I say in addition to that     7           statement right at the same time that it's not -- it isn't     8           and cannot ever be the only criteria and that -- I go on to     9           say that I have an informal definition of a public library as    10           a place with material that offends every one and that's our    11           task, our job.    12           Q   Right, I understand that, thank you.    13           A   Sure.    14           Q   But you don't have Penthouse and Playboy in your    15           collection, do you?    16           A   Well, we have Playboy, yes.    17           Q   But you don't have the magazine available in hard copy,    18           do you?    19           A   That's correct, we do not.    20           Q   You don't have Penthouse, right?    21           A   That's correct.    22           Q   And you don't have Hustler, correct?    23           A   That is correct.    24           Q   And among your video selections you don't have sexually    25           explicit adult films either, do you?                                                                           109     1           A   That's right, we do not.     2                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I don't have anything further, your     3           Honor.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Any redirect?     5                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor, yes.     6                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION     7           BY MS. KAPPLER:       8           Q   Mr. Croneberger, you mentioned that as currently now     9           provided Playboy appears in simply an abstract form that you    10           put it on line?    11           A   Correct.    12           Q   If the commercial provider who provided this information,    13           these journals to you were to provide Playboy in full text    14           would you post that magazine on line in full text?    15           A   Of course, certainly.    16           Q   And if it included Playboy magazine, delivered it to you    17           in full text including pictures, would you post it in that    18           form on line?    19           A   Yes, we would.    20           Q   Have you made a determination with your computer staff as    21           to whether you could use a simple key-word search in order to    22           ferret out the material that you post on line that might be    23           subject to the Act?    24           A   Yes, we have certainly discussed it at some length and we    25           think it's not feasible, it's simply not possible to do given                                                                           110     1           the nature of communication and the nature of words and the     2           difficulty of coming up with all of the parameters that seem     3           to be, at least to us, a part of this Act, it would be     4           extremely difficult to do, impossible to do.     5           Q   And I'd like --     6           A   Because we're talking -- I'm sorry, we're talking not     7           only about tables of contents, but we're also talking about     8           each edition of each magazine, each edition of each     9           periodical.    10           Q   And am I correct that if you were to devise some kind of    11           a key-word search do you feel you could assure yourself that    12           you had located every item that you posted on line that might    13           be subject to the Act?    14           A   No, we could not.    15                    MS. KAPPLER:  I have no further questions, your    16           Honor.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Any recross, Ms. Russotto?    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I'm sorry.    20                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  None, your Honor.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, a few questions.  You say that    22           about a third of the cardholders of your library are minors?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you also say that you have no    25           limitations in the library, those who actually go to the                                                                           111     1           library physically, that anyone of whatever age can go     2           anywhere?     3                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There is no restrictions based on     5           age?     6                    THE WITNESS:  Many libraries have different library     7           cards, one type of card for a minor and other for adults, we     8           do not do that and many libraries do not.  In a way it's very     9           deliberately -- taking a look at society as it evolves and as    10           it changes, on the one hand there's a great need for easy-to-    11           read material on the part of adults and so, in order to    12           promote access to that material for adults, many libraries,    13           particularly in branch libraries in urban areas are    14           interfiling adult and juvenile material together, so that    15           there is no stigma attached to the adult who wants to get    16           some easy-to-read information.  Conversely, the same thing    17           happens in the sense that many children are far more mature    18           in their reading levels than in the past and we openly    19           provide access to anything that that child wants.  We feel    20           very strongly that it's the parent's decision on what reading    21           level is available for a child.  So, if a child comes into    22           our library and wants to take out a seven-million-page legal    23           text that even adults can't understand, if that child -- we    24           certainly will try to steer that child to something far more    25           appropriate, but if that's not successful, if the child says                                                                           112     1           that's what he or she wants we certainly would give it to     2           them, yes.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And you say in Paragraph 16,     4           you list, shall we say, some colorful titles, and at the end     5           you say in the carryover from Page 6 to 7 that these are     6           popular titles in our collection, how do you know?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we certainly can electronically     8           just know how many times a particular book is checked out or     9           how many times a CD is checked out; we don't know who has    10           checked that out, but we know --    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, okay.  So, these -- for    12           example, these music titles, these are each CD's?    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's -- you're just keeping    15           track that way?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Right.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you know the next    18           sentence, "In fact the book by Ice T and the rap music CD's    19           are particular popular with teenagers," how do you know that?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there are two methods I guess,    21           one is the popularity in terms of waiting lists.  When we    22           don't have enough copies of material people sign up on a    23           reserve kind of basis and they're waiting to know.  It's    24           simply our experience -- those particular books or that    25           particular book was written with teenagers in mind and it has                                                                           113     1           a great deal to do with race relations in inner city areas     2           and it's a popular item among teenagers.  We have some staff     3           particularly at the main library who are called young adult     4           librarians and it's their task specifically to relate both in     5           terms of programs and collections to that population.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  And Paragraph 18,     7           talking about contemporary community standards, which Ms.     8           Russotto was getting at with you.     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You say, "I have no clear    11           understanding of what materials would be considered indecent    12           or patently offensive for minors by some communities."  Isn't    13           the only community you have to worry about the Three Rivers    14           area?    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't think so for a couple of    16           reasons.  In the first place, the -- we know that a city like    17           PIttsburgh -- well, that Pittsburgh has many different    18           communities within it, ethnic groups that have lived in a    19           particular neighborhood, third and fourth generations in the    20           same homes, we know that there's stability about those ethnic    21           neighborhoods.  We know that there are many different levels    22           of communities within the public housing communities, for    23           instance, in Pittsburgh.  We know that there are religious    24           organizations and religious groups who have one level of    25           standard which is terribly, terribly different from another                                                                           114     1           level of standard which also might be religious.  So, when we     2           talk about community standards, we serve communities.  But     3           even more so with the electronic information, and this is     4           precisely why I'm concerned about this Act, because our     5           material is now simply available around the world at any     6           time, both the on-line journals, the RIM study, the kinds of     7           projects that we're putting on line, like the early     8           photographs of Pittsburgh we're putting all on line linking     9           them with text, historic text, and then we're even adding    10           audio tapes, we're adding oral history tapes into that    11           segment, so that an old-time resident talks about the way a    12           neighborhood has changed over that period of time.  Now,    13           that's material that we're producing ourselves, so that we    14           become an on-line provider, a content provider, a distributor    15           and all of those kinds of things, that's happening more and    16           more with libraries.  And the kinds of things that we have in    17           our collections that we're making available to the world's    18           population, we for instance have that one exhibit I think    19           that we have about the RIM study, we have the number of    20           specific domains that have contacted that study over a    21           certain period of time.  So, it's not just our community or    22           the local folks.  For whatever reason, this Act specifically    23           says that -- libraries are mentioned in it as content    24           providers or as information providers and that gives me great    25           pause, because our collections are now available worldwide.                                                                           115     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Two other -- two last questions.      2           First of all, you are active, I surmise from your vitae, in     3           the American Library Association?     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are you in a position to answer this     6           question, therefore:  Is the use of on-line card catalogues     7           superseding the hard copy that I grew up with and --     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right, me too.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- I suspect you grew up with --    10                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is that the trend in public    12           libraries?    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, indeed, it is.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is it also a trend in public    15           libraries that where you have no copyright problems, e.g.    16           plays of Shakespeare, are those going full text on line in    17           libraries?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, they're on -- what was happening    19           is that there are providers on the Internet putting specific    20           titles like the works of Shakespeare on, so that not every    21           library does that individually, so that we all link    22           immediately to those kinds of things, those texts, and we all    23           can share them and all have them.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, you can hyperlink to that?    25                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.                                                                           116     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  My question, Mr. Croneberger, is,     3           as I understand your 18-page declaration, the two problems     4           you have with the Act -- and maybe you have more than that,     5           but two of them are that first of all it's technically     6           impossible to comply with it and, even if it were technically     7           possible, it would be financially impossible to comply with     8           it; and, secondly, the definitions are simply impossible, I     9           mean, you just can't ascertain what patently offensive and    10           indecent mean.  If you had all the money that you needed and    11           had -- that you wanted and if there were definitions of    12           indecent and patently offensive could you devise a system    13           that would prevent access to people under 18, given those     14           two --     15                    THE WITNESS:  You mean provide --    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Could you provide a system that    17           would prevent access for people under 18 of indecent and    18           patently offensive material?    19                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't think we could.    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Because why?    21                    THE WITNESS:  Because our definition of what that    22           might be -- I mean even --    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, no, no, I'm just --    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, you've given me the definition.    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- giving you a hypothesis, I                                                                           117     1           just want to know if it's possible given the --     2                    THE WITNESS:  Given the world's --     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- I mean, given that you have     4           all of the money you need and, secondly, given a definition     5           that we all agreed upon, could you devise a system then that     6           would prevent people under 18 from getting what we have     7           defined and agreed upon as indecent and patently offensive     8           material?     9                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly I could not, because I'm not    10           an expert of anything, but I think it could be done, but it    11           certainly would contradict the mission of public libraries in    12           the country.    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Oh, I agree, I agree with you, I    14           was just trying to find out whether you felt a system could    15           be --    16                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, sure, I would think so.    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- it is possible to do that.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't mean you necessarily    19           agree with him that -- well, on the bottom line?    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, right.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I wanted to make that clear,    22           that still hasn't been decided.    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, that hasn't been decided,    24           absolutely.    25                    (Laughter.)                                                                           118     1                    THE WITNESS:  I think part of our problem, if I may,     2           with that is simply that we have parents who are very     3           concerned about a child, a young child looking at a picture     4           book which may show a dog urinating against a fire hydrant     5           and to them that signifies the term indecent, or at the same     6           time another picture book, a very famous one called 'Twas the     7           Night Before Christmas, which at the end of the whole thing,     8           when Santa has gone around the world and done all of the     9           marvelous work he has done he is exhausted and takes a nip of    10           brandy before he crawls into bed for a long sleep, and    11           certainly we have parental objections to that sort of thing.     12           So that we're -- you know, we're concerned about a lot of    13           different levels of stuff here.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me -- Judge Buckwalter tells me    15           he's done, so I wanted to follow up, because that was my    16           question also.  And you'll have to bear with me on this    17           because I didn't expect to ask it, but late last night when I    18           was working here and reading some of this material, in    19           something that I read last night there was listed seven --    20           and I can't remember now whether it was -- and I can't bring    21           it up, so -- on the computer quickly, it was seven categories    22           of material and what I can't remember is whether this    23           material was the kind of thing that groups like Surf Watch    24           would get out or whether it came up in some other category,    25           but one of them was alcoholism and it dealt with where -- and                                                                           119     1           it made it -- it was kind of where you could get that.  And     2           at the same time it just happened to come to my mind that     3           what would Ray Milland and "The Lost Weekend" be, would you     4           feel that if that -- would you -- as a librarian feel that a     5           movie like that would then have to be removed from     6           availability to people under 18?     7                    THE WITNESS:  I think that's one of my primary     8           concerns, because we don't know, we would certainly be afraid     9           so.  We would be afraid that the parameters of the    10           terminology that might be searched if we're going into slang,    11           if we're going into who knows, foreign languages, if we're    12           going into visual images, our concern I think that library    13           feels and feel pretty strongly is that there is a great deal    14           of information that's terribly valuable.  If for instance we    15           removed everything under the word sex we miss all of the sex-    16           education material that's terribly important that teenagers    17           have access to, because that's who it was written for, or    18           that kind of material.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But going back to my question, on    20           the other hand there are materials -- well, are there    21           materials that deal with excessive alcoholism which you think    22           would be pretty clearly on the other side of the line like,    23           for example, "Leaving Las Vegas," or maybe you don't think    24           that that is on that side of the line?    25                    THE WITNESS:  I guess I don't -- the librarian part                                                                           120     1           of me doesn't want that line to exist, you see, because I     2           think that it's a parental decision.  I certainly know what     3           affects my 11-year-old and I know how to steer him, but I     4           think that if we as libraries are put in the position of     5           having to make those decisions for other people's children we     6           will fail miserably, we will not do well.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And if you were -- or felt obliged     8           to use something like Surf Watch or another group or     9           mechanism like that to exclude from availability to children    10           under 18 books or material that had, I think she said, the    11           hundred -- the list of hundred words, would that exclude much    12           of Shakespeare or some of Shakespeare?    13                    THE WITNESS:  And the Bible and on and on, I think.     14           Public libraries would love to have net-blocker software    15           available, so that we could loan them to parents free of    16           charge and have the parental responsibilities there.  It's    17           something that we do not think we can do, physically do or    18           legally do or technically do, inside a library.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But as an expert you agree that    20           net-blockers are available?    21                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, absolutely, and --    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And feasible?    23                    THE WITNESS:  And a wonderful parental-supervise    24           tool, absolutely.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I understand.  Thank you.                                                                            121     1           Did that evoke any more questions, any of ours?     2                    MS. KAPPLER:  No, your Honor.     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.       5                    (Witness excused.)     6                    (Discussion held off the record.)

MORRIS:  -- and --    15                    MR. BARON:  That's correct.    16                    MR. MORRIS:  -- and the plaintiffs, I would    17           anticipate perhaps 20 to 30 minutes of redirect at the most,    18           I would be surprised if it went longer than that.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Very good.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.

MORRIS:     7           Q   Mr. Bradner, I really just want to go back over a very     8           few points that you just talked about yesterday.  Mr. Baron     9           asked you about the Internet Protocol Version 6.  Can you    10           tell me, will the user of the Internet, typical user of the    11           Internet, notice a significant change in how the Internet    12           operates when Version 6, the next generation, is rolled out?    13           A   The IP Version 6 itself is just a replacement for the    14           wheels, the bit -- the packet format of the packets that go    15           across the net.  The applications do not change in general by    16           changing the underlayment which goes over.  There is a    17           possibility in the long term to get some increased    18           functionality to do with the ability to do real time    19           processing, telephone over the Internet kind of things, but    20           this is research work and development work yet to be done.     21           But basically the applications will remain the same    22           applications you're currently using, and you wouldn't see any    23           different -- the user would not see any difference.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So what is the change in some?    25                    THE WITNESS:  The change in some is that the                                                                           124     1           individual packet can address far more nodes, so therefore --     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, so it's the 32 to the 128     3           bits.     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     5           BY MR. MORRIS:     6           Q   And, Mr. Bradner, in your declaration submitted as direct     7           testimony here, you describe a number of structural and     8           operational issues raised by the Communications Decency Act.      9           Would those issues still be in play and still be raised under    10           Internet Protocol Version 6?    11           A   The issues here referred to are the inability of the    12           speaker or the poster of some information to be able to    13           determine whether the recipients are all qualified non-    14           minors, is that the --    15           Q   Right.    16           A   And no, they would not change.    17           Q   Okay, let me ask you, the inability of speakers that you    18           described in your direct testimony, would that significantly    19           change at all if you accepted Mr. Baron's proposal of placing    20           a tag in an HTML file or a tag in a URL?  Would the speaker's    21           ability to ensure that minors didn't have access to speech    22           significantly change?    23           A   I would not think it would make any difference to my    24           level of comfort that my speech was so protected, because in    25           order to agree that it was, I would have to hypothesize that                                                                           125     1           all of the possibly affected minors were using web browsers     2           which supported this tagging, and they all had been     3           configured to have that configura -- the exclusion features     4           turned on.  And I would think that that would be a bit of a     5           hard push to make the -- for me as a speaker to make that     6           assumption, particularly since the pervasiveness from what I     7           read of the statute which is tedious to read, though I've     8           read it a few times, it doesn't constrain me to insure only     9           within the United States.  So I would have -- since all of my    10           speech on news groups and things go worldwide, I would think    11           that I would have to be assured that worldwide that every    12           minor who happened to have -- might potentially have access    13           would have such a browser and have it configured in a way    14           which restricts access.  And I think that would be a very    15           difficult thing for me to assume, and I wouldn't want to    16           assume that.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How about if you limited it to the    18           United States?    19                    THE WITNESS:  It's still something where the    20           individual user, or the user's parent, if that be the case,    21           would have to insure that each individual minor who has    22           access through whatever means, through school, through    23           libraries or through the home, would have a compliant browser    24           and have that browser configured.  And there's no way for me    25           as a speaker to know whether that in fact is the case.  And                                                                           126     1           that's my -- the substance of my direct deposition was that,     2           that I as a speaker have no mechanism by which I can go out     3           and examine the capabilities and feature sets of what the     4           listeners are using to listen to my speech.  So I don't know     5           whether they would have that restriction in.  I could not     6           know whether they had that restriction in.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  While we're on that point, I'd like     8           to ask a question so that we don't have to come back to it.      9           On page 33 of your declaration, you, in discussing tagging,    10           you said it is impossible to imbed such flags or headers in    11           many of the documents made available by anonymous FTP gopher    12           and the Worldwide Web without rendering the files useless.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which paragraph was that?    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, it's on page 33.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, page 33.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, page 33.  Is that part --    17                    MR. MORRIS:  It's paragraph 79.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.  Is that part of the same    19           matter that you're talking about?    20                    THE WITNESS:  No.  This is a somewhat different    21           matter.  The matter I was just speaking of is whether I as    22           the speaker could tell whether a user was operating a browser    23           that would inhibit -- that would watch those tags.  What I'm    24           speaking of in the deposition here and I also spoke of    25           yesterday for a minute was that there are certain kinds of                                                                           127     1           files, whether there be voice files or picture files or     2           executables programs, computer programs, which you couldn't     3           actually go in and modify by adding some character stream     4           which would be these tags, without making them inoperative     5           just simply because they are a particular format.  And they     6           expect to be in that format and if they're not in that format     7           and the format would be destroyed by adding some tags, then     8           they wouldn't work.     9                    That doesn't mean that a new format couldn't be    10           derived.  But the existing ones would not work.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Technologically.    12                    THE WITNESS:  Technologically, yes.    13           BY MR. MORRIS:    14           Q   Yesterday, at least on our side of the table, a little    15           bit of confusion arose in terms of the definition and the    16           explanation of links on the Worldwide Web.  Could you just    17           take a moment and explain the relationship between a link,    18           kind of a link -- the linkee and the linker.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In simple language.  (Laughter.)    20                    No, I really think that it is necessary if Judges    21           are supposed to decide matters, then it is necessary for the    22           parties and the witnesses to present it in intelligible form.    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, that's a strong challenge, but I    24           will try.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, but it's a necessary one.                                                                           128     1                    THE WITNESS:  And if I fail, you will let me know, I     2           am sure.     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, yes, and the people for whom     4           you are testifying will know, so I think it's very important.     5                    THE WITNESS:  Basically the way I would refer to a     6           link in this context is simply a pointer.  It is a piece of     7           text, and it's just a character string, it happens to have     8           some format to it, but it's a character string which     9           specifies a particular computer on the Internet, and a    10           particular file within that computer that is being pointed    11           at.    12                    It also has some structure at the beginning which    13           says what program do you use to go point at that.  So I can    14           say, use the Web or use FTP or use Telnet or use some other    15           application-level program to go look at this file.  So the    16           file itself is -- although I used an example of one in my    17           deposition of E2EVF12.IP which is one of the data files    18           that's on my machine that's referring to the performance of    19           some network device.  That's a file name.    20                    The pointer to that would include the name of my    21           machine, that's at NDTL.HARVARD.EDU and then the path to that    22           file and then that file name itself.  So all it is is it's a    23           way to globally say this is the file that I'm interested in.     24           It's not relevant to where the viewer sits.  It is an    25           absolute reference to the particular piece of data, and the                                                                           129     1           particular piece of data is always a file of some kind,     2           although with a reference of what program to use to do that.     3                    Now, I think that the question you're asking is --     4           or the implication you're coming up with is do I have to     5           know, if I'm the provider of a file, if I have a file on my     6           computer, do I have to be involved with somebody pointing at     7           that file, and the answer is no.  I have no way of knowing     8           whether somebody has a URL, one of these pointers, which     9           refers to one of my files or refers to my computer.  It can    10           be -- other people do that.  I know they do, I don't know    11           who, but I do know that computer manu -- vendors of these    12           devices have given out pointers to their data within my    13           system.  But I don't know who did it.  I have no way of    14           knowing.  There's no involvement on my part.  It is simply    15           that somebody has said, if you're interested in finding out    16           about the performance of this product, here is the URL of the    17           file.  And so there is no relation, there is no implied    18           relationship between the pointer and the pointee, to use your    19           semi-technical words.     20                    Was that clear enough?    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, finally.  (Laughter.)    22           BY MR. MORRIS:    23           Q   Just as I understand it then, someone else, a company can    24           point to your computer and point to a file on your computer.     25           Do they have to point to your home page, or can they point to                                                                           130     1           other files on your computer?     2           A   As I mentioned yesterday, they can point to the specific     3           file that they're interested in, bypassing any structure that     4           I have, including my home page or any subsidiary pages or any     5           directory structure.  They specify the particular file that     6           they want people to look at.  It is irrelevant to what     7           sequence I might want them to go through, if I had a home     8           page and subsidiary pages, they would be bypassed entirely if     9           the pointer so chose.  If the pointers chose to specify a    10           particular data file, it would bypass all of that.    11           Q   And so if you placed some HTML flag or tag in your home    12           page, that would be bypassed by someone linking to one of    13           your lower pages?    14           A   That is correct.  This page, the home page, would not be    15           loaded, would not be observed, would not be accessed, would    16           no be hit, to use the parlance that was talked about this    17           morning by the person who was accessing the data file.  It    18           just wouldn't be seen.    19           Q   And say -- in a lower page, say you placed a flag in a    20           lower Web page, and that Web page included a reference to an    21           image on your computer.  You didn't place a flag on the image    22           because you had a flag on the page that gave immediate access    23           to the image.  Could someone link to that image without    24           linking to the page that you have intended to be the    25           presentation of that image?                                                                           131     1           A   Yes.  You can configure browsers such as Netscape such     2           that when you are selecting an image or something like that,     3           selecting a URL, it will show up in a screen, a little window     4           in the page.  So if you type that down, type down, write down     5           that information, you have the literal pointer to a file.      6           And if the file happens to be a picture file which is     7           imbedded in -- which I would normally embed in one of my     8           pages, then you can reference it directly.  It is just     9           another point to another file.  There is nothing special    10           about it in the context of the way things are organized on    11           the computer, it's just another file that happens to have a    12           pointer to it or more than one pointer to it, however many    13           pointers that people, including me or others, have created.    14           Q   Okay, there's been a fair bit of discussion today and    15           yesterday about the concept of a hit.  In terms of you as a    16           speaker being able to control access or screen access in some    17           way to who's getting your files, does the -- if someone comes    18           to your Web page and initiates ten hits by getting an HTML    19           file and a graphic image and an audio file, to keep content    20           from that person, would you need to screen just once, or    21           would you need to screen each request for each different    22           file?    23           A   Making the assumption which is implied in your question    24           that there is a way that I can identify the originating query    25           by using its IP address, and I want to somehow decide that                                                                           132     1           this person or this computer where the query is originating,     2           and that's what I'm using to filter on, then from the     3           server's point of view I would have to make a check for that     4           query every time a query -- a check for that address every     5           time a query came in and a query is a hit.  So for every hit,     6           my server would have to verify that address.     7           Q   So if a thousand people on a given day visited your site     8           and generated let's say 4,000 hits by looking around your     9           site, then do I understand that you would have to -- one    10           would have to screen 4,000 times or just 1,000 times?    11           A   The actual mechanism would require the screening 4,000    12           times.  Now, just the software puts things in the temporary    13           storage called cashing, such that the second look-up is    14           quicker than the first one, but it still has to look up each    15           one individually.    16           Q   Okay.  Let me just run over a few little loose ends on    17           some of the other areas that you were asked about yesterday.    18                    With listserves, can you just explain that there's    19           an individual or perhaps a company that decides to create a    20           mail exploding program, like Listserve or Major Domo.  and    21           then who actually speaks through that listserve?  Is it just    22           the company, just the individual who created the listserve,    23           or who speaks to that?    24           A   Most listserves are for discussion.  Some listserves are    25           for propogation of information like advertising.  In the                                                                           133     1           latter case then the organization that creates it, it's just     2           a mailing list for that organization, and in which case just     3           somebody from that organization speaks.  But for the vast     4           majority of listserves or mail exploders, it is a     5           communications mechanism between the people on that     6           listserve.  Anybody who sends mail to the listserve will --     7           the mail will be forwarded to all members of the listserve,     8           all addresses which are in the listserve.       9                    There are some listserves set up so that only people    10           who have subscribed can send mail to it, and others that are    11           set up so that anybody can send mail to it, but only people    12           who have subscribed will see that mail.  But there is in most    13           cases, although than the moderated listserves where the mail    14           will go to a moderator and then be forwarded, anybody who has    15           the address of the listserve can send mail to it and it will    16           be forwarded to all of the folks whose addresses are listed    17           in the list.    18           Q   So it's a fairly open means of communication.    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   Let's briefly discuss news groups, Usenet news groups.     21           There was actually a little uncertainty today, I believe you    22           probably were in the courtroom, about number of moderated    23           news groups.  Do you have any information that you could    24           provide the Court, any estimate of moderated news groups    25           versus unmoderated news groups?                                                                           134     1           A   I can only estimate based on when I ran the news server     2           at Harvard, which I stopped running about two years ago.  The     3           number of moderated news group was in the ten percent or     4           maybe a little bit less range.  My guess today, and this is     5           mostly a guess, would be that it would be a significantly     6           smaller amount.  As I think I've talked yesterday, news     7           groups and the number of people on the news groups are     8           growing quite rapidly, so the requirement of effort of a     9           moderator is also growing.  So that to find people who are    10           willing to wade through thousands of messages a day to decide    11           to forward them is getting harder and harder.  We don't have    12           that many masochists, I guess.  And therefore the number of    13           moderated news groups is dropping.  A number of news groups    14           that used to be moderated are no longer moderated because    15           they can't find somebody with the right degree of gumption to    16           moderate it.    17           Q   And moderators are usually volunteers?    18           A   In most cases where it's not a news group that's set up    19           by a particular organization to talk about their product,    20           they are volunteers, yes.    21           Q   Okay.  Yesterday there was also -- you were asked about    22           the creation of new news groups.  I believe you said the Alt    23           hierarchy was fairly free, people could create things    24           individually.  But the other hierarchies, could you explain    25           again who creates that?  Is there one entity or organization                                                                           135     1           that approves the creation of a new news group within a --     2           say, for example, the Biz hierarchy?     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The what?     4                    MR. MORRIS:  Biz, B-I-Z, as in business.     5                    THE WITNESS:  One of the hierarchies I mentioned     6           yesterday.  Somebody within a news group, taking for example     7           the one that I used yesterday, the REC.AUTO (ph) news group,     8           the traffic got large on the REC.AUTO news group, and a     9           number of people proposed to the news group that the news    10           group be broken up into subcategories for people of different    11           interests.  A discussion ensued amongst the people who    12           subscribe to the news group, and a proposal was worked out as    13           a democratic back and forth process and a suggestion was sent    14           off to a particular news group which is called NEWS.NEWS    15           GROUPS or something like that, which is a specific news group    16           set aside to discuss the creation of new news groups, and a    17           discussion occurred on there.  Then a call for a vote is    18           given.  And then whoever is doing the proposing for this news    19           groups, which is just somebody of interest, somebody who's    20           interested in it, collects up the E-mail votes that they get,    21           and posts a list of all of the votes.  It's this many votes    22           in favor of this proposed news group and this many votes    23           opposed, over some duration of time.    24                    If the votes are more than a certain amount, and it    25           used to be that you had to have 100 votes in favor and no                                                                           136     1           more than 25 against, -- I don't know what the numbers are     2           today, that was what it was three years ago, and I suspect     3           the numbers are much higher today -- then it's declared that     4           that news group is a legitimate news group.  And by declared,     5           it's just the yes, it met -- everybody agrees it met the     6           requirements so therefore it's legitimate, and whoever put in     7           the original proposal would then issue the news group     8           creation command and it would go off and create the propagate     9           the creation of news group.    10                    Then the one other thing is that, as I mentioned    11           yesterday, there are volunteers who maintain lists of    12           approved, in the sense of this process approved news groups,    13           within different portions of the hierarchy of the news    14           hierarchy, like within the Biz hierarchy, and a volunteer    15           will add it to their list.  Then this list is periodically    16           sent out and some news servers are configured to delete any    17           news group in a hierarchy that doesn't appear on the list.     18           So it's a democratic ad hoc process.    19           BY MR. MORRIS:    20           Q   Okay.  Briefly, could you just explain the process of    21           registering a domain name with the Internet, at least in the    22           United States, as I understand it.  Has your domain name been    23           registered with the Internet?  The NEWDEV.HARVARD.EDU(ph)?    24           A   No.  The domain name is divided up in different sections,    25           as was explained this morning about the .EDU and .HARVARD and                                                                           137     1           then NEWDEV is my particular machine.  The portion of the     2           domain name which is registered is the organization's domain     3           name.  So in this case it's HARVARD.EDU is what gets     4           registered.  Within HARVARD I have registered NEWDEV, but     5           this doesn't get registered with the Internet, it is entirely     6           within HARVARD.  I have a domain name of my own for my little     7           consulting company and I have registered that.  But the     8           computers within that I register with myself and I rarely     9           complain so I get them registered quickly.  (Laughter.)  But    10           that's only within my own domain.    11                    The domain in the simple case, it is something like    12           HARVARD.EDU, it would be a little more complicated if we have    13           a domain such as the .USTOPLEVEL domain which was also    14           mentioned this morning, that two-level country codes are one    15           of the types of top-level domains along with EDU and ORG.  In    16           the U.S. these are divided geographically.     17                    So for example the Web page that I mentioned    18           yesterday of IETF -- WWW.IETF.ORD is actually on a computer    19           that's run by a company in Western Virginia, and the    20           company's name is CNRI, Corporation for National Research    21           Initiatives.  And their domain name is CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.     22           And then there's computers within that.  So it's    23           IETF.CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.  The CNRI.RESTON.VA.US is what was    24           registered as the domain name but the machine within it is    25           not.                                                                           138     1           Q   Okay, just one last question.  Judge Buckwalter earlier     2           asked Dr. Croneberger if he had all the money in the world     3           and a clear definition of the patently offensive and     4           indecent, would it be possible to develop a system.  And I'd     5           be interested if you could tell the Court, is that possible?      6           Do you think that's possible?     7           A   As a theoretical exercise, I think it probably is     8           possible.  But for me as a speaker to be able to be insured     9           that this was being met, the only thing I can think of, and I    10           have thought about this a little bit, is we would have to    11           have a mechanism by which all of the listeners, in every    12           category, listeners to news groups, listeners to listserve,    13           listeners on the Web, all of the listeners, all of the people    14           retrieving information, would have to be able to provide some    15           form of identification.    16                    Now, the identification wouldn't have to be more    17           than a "Yes, I'm over 18" kind of identification, but in    18           order to insure that that's reliable, you would have to have    19           a mechanism by which you could create this identification    20           such that it couldn't be easily forged.  There is a concept    21           that is being worked on that is called Digital Signatures,    22           and the U.S. Post Office as an organization is looking into    23           doing an identification check at post offices whereby someone    24           would come in and identify themselves and they would get a    25           bit pattern, a digital signature, which they could then use                                                                           139     1           to identify themselves in commerce and in correspondence,     2           perhaps even at some point legal correspondence.  One could     3           in theory add to that identification some flag in there to     4           indicate whether they were over or under 18.       5                    But that would assume the mechanism were actually     6           installed and in place of going -- of people going to the     7           post office and getting these identities, and that you would     8           have to have the identity before you could surf the Web.      9           Without that kind of structure, without making the assumption    10           of something in place so that I could be sure that a    11           listserve could be created that would only accept    12           subscriptions from those over 18, and I could query that    13           listserve to be sure that it was one which was doing that, I    14           think it would be hard.    15                    But in theory I could imagine a scenario by which    16           this could be done, but it wouldn't take quite all the money    17           in the world, as in the proposition, but I would have fun if    18           it were a cost plus contract.  (Laughter.)    19                    MR. MORRIS:  We have no further questions.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Is there recross?    21                    MR. BARON:  Yes, your Honor.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron.    23                    MR. BARON:  Good afternoon, your Honors.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good afternoon.    25                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION                                                                           140     1           BY MR. BARON:     2           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Bradner.     3                    Mr. Bradner, I'm going to give you a hypothetical.      4           Let's assume you have a simple Worldwide Web Web site on a     5           Web server with a home page.  And the home page has a URL     6           associated with it.  And for purposes of this example, we'll     7           just name it this generic name.  The URL is     8           HTTP://WWW.WEBSITE.  Are you with me on that?     9           A   So far it's simple.    10           Q   Okay.  Now, let's assume that the home page also has    11           pointers to ten files on that Web site or Web server.  And    12           each of those files has a separate URL which is an extension    13           of the home pages URL.    14           A   Yes.    15           Q   And let's just for the purposes of this hypothetical say    16           that the URL for each of those ten files is    17           HTTP://WWW.WEBSITE/FILE1 and then iteratively FILE1...    18           through FILE10.  Still with me?    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   Now, you have admitted in your prior testimony that it is    21           a trivial matter for an owner of a Web site to imbed a tag or    22           label in HTML source code in the header of that source code    23           on the home page, correct?    24           A   On any particular page, whether it be the home page or    25           not, as long as it's an HTML page that would be easy to                                                                           141     1           augment it, yes.     2           Q   And as a technical matter, it would also be possible to     3           imbed a unique tag or label in HTML source code for each of     4           the files 1 through 10 with those separate URL extensions in     5           my hypothetical, correct?     6           A   I'm a little confused here, because to me you may be     7           mixing two things.  One is the files themselves, and I just     8           said that any file you could put -- any HTML file you could     9           put such a tag in.  And the URLs which are different things.     10           You could put tags in the URLs also.    11           Q   I'm not speaking about the tags in the URL, but the tags    12           in the files.  So each of those files with a separate URL    13           address would have HTML source code associated with that file    14           and a tag could be put in for file 1, file 2, iteratively,    15           file 10.    16           A   If indeed they were HTML files, yes.    17           Q   And the operation of that tag on any one of those files    18           on that site would, assuming that it's a tag that's set up to    19           be coordinated with parental blocking mechanisms, would    20           operate to block that URL extension, that particular file on    21           that Web site, that unique file, 1 through 10.    22           A   Assuming that it was A, as you speculate, set up to do    23           so, and B, that the user was using a browser so configured to    24           do that blocking, yes, all files are equivalent in that    25           context.                                                                           142     1           Q   And any browser set up to look at the URL for a     2           particular file 6 or file 8 or file 10 would be blocked if     3           there was that mechanism for tagging and the browser was set     4           to look?     5           A   Well, to be very specific, just to not be confusing here,     6           what would happen is in your scenario that the browser would     7           go off and it would retrieve the file, file 1, file 2,     8           whatever, it would retrieve that file.  It would actually go     9           off and start to retrieve the file, perhaps even retrieving    10           the whole file, then look at the HTML if it's an HTML file,    11           then make the decision.  So the fact that it has a URL is    12           independent.  It just happens that all files that are on Web    13           servers have either real or implied or constructed URLs    14           simply because as I just said, the URL is really just a way    15           to identify a file.  So we want to make sure that we're    16           talking about two different cases, because yesterday we were    17           talking about putting tags in URLs and we're talking about    18           putting tags in the files, and I want to be sure that we've    19           got those separated because they're different concepts.    20           Q   Okay.  And in paragraph 30 -- sorry, paragraph 79 of your    21           supplemental declaration at page 33, you mention the concept    22           executable programs.  Could you explain with some concrete    23           examples what executable programs are?    24           A   The example I used yesterday was a screen saver, which    25           would draw pretty pictures on your screen instead of burning                                                                           143     1           your logo into the screen when the screen's been idle for a     2           while.  Many of those exist on the net, and you can retrieve     3           them anonymously FTP or over the Web for free.  They are     4           there because the screen saver will come up and advertise     5           some product or it's just because somebody thought that the     6           picture they did was cute, or the function they did was cute.      7           It was an intellectual exercise or a class exercise.  So many     8           of these are out.  Hundreds of these screen savers exist and     9           you can go retrieve them, but they are binary files.    10           Q   Do they usually have a .EXE suffix?    11           A   The .EXE is for a particular kind of binary file that's    12           used on PCs.  There are other extensions for other kinds of    13           computers, for other types of binaries.    14           Q   Now, to the best of your knowledge, are any of the home    15           pages of any of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, do they    16           comprise executable programs or files?    17           A   Since I don't know the list of the plaintiffs by heart or    18           even by remembering having read it, the full list, it seems    19           to be quite an extensive list, I couldn't answer, but it    20           would seem to be unlikely that a home page would be a binary    21           per se, though possible, because it could be a graphical    22           image, but it wouldn't seem to be very likely.    23           Q   If one had an executable program in a file, is there    24           anything about that mere fact that it's an executable program    25           that would prevent the owner of the Web site from registering                                                                           144     1           or otherwise making known the page where the executable     2           program was to the many tens or hundreds or thousands of     3           directories in cyberspace or to any of the companies that     4           operate browsers or parental control mechanisms.  Is there     5           something special about executable programs?     6           A   An executable program when viewed by the Web is just     7           another page.  It happens that when the browser goes to try     8           and retrieve it, it uses a different retrieval mechanism than     9           it does when it's trying to retrieve text or HTML.  But it's    10           just another page, and one can -- and that page has a unique    11           URL, and yes, one could register in theory any URL pointing    12           to any file that was on any server, and there is nothing    13           special in that context about a binary, no.    14                    MR. BARON:  I have no further questions.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any more from the plaintiffs?    16                    MR. MORRIS:  No, your Honor.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Judge Dalzell.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.  I wonder in paragraphs 73    19           through 76 you talk a good deal about cashing, and I must say    20           I really don't follow it.  Would you just, using the standard    21           that Chief Judge Sloviter put so well, could you just    22           rehearse for us exactly what you mean by cashing?    23                    THE WITNESS:  That standard was that it should be    24           understandable?    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You'll forgive the expression, yes.                                                                           145     1                    (Laughter.)     2                    THE WITNESS:  Well, let's take the example I think I     3           used.  But the basic idea is you would like to minimize the     4           number of times that you go off and you retrieve something,     5           that you actually have to go to the actual server to retrieve     6           something.  Cashing is not a new concept.  It's used in     7           computers between the processor and disk so that if you want     8           to reload the same file off of disk between the processor and     9           memory if you want to reread some portion of memory into the    10           processor, instead of going to the relatively slow memory or    11           the relatively slow disk, it goes and gets it out of the    12           cash.    13                    In the case of cashing Web servers, which is what I    14           was speaking of in there, the same concept applies.  Many    15           universities, many organizations have as a function built    16           into their firewall or built into a device sitting between    17           their network and the rest of the Internet, they have an    18           ability to watch the HTML requests go by and see what comes    19           back and save a temporary copy of what comes back.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How temporary?    21                    THE WITNESS:  That's usually locally configurable    22           and it's frequently done based on how much disk space you    23           have.  Once you start getting low on disk space, you throw    24           away the things which haven't been accessed for the longest    25           period of time.  And --                                                                           146     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you give in paragraph 73 the     2           hypothetical of cashing when a user in Europe requests access     3           to a Worldwide Web page located in the United States?     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     5                    MR. MORRIS:  Your Honor, could I --     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, sure, sure.     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, do I understand correctly that     9           the first time that the European user accesses the American    10           information page, it is put somewhere in cyberspace on the    11           east side of the Atlantic?    12                    THE WITNESS:  In this particular hypothetical, to    13           use a word that was just being used at me, what would happen    14           is that the people who operated the transatlantic link, and    15           it happens that in the real world of data networking the    16           Europeans have to pay for their links into the U.S.  The U.S.    17           doesn't pay for the links because everybody thinks we're more    18           important and so far the Europeans have agreed with that.  I    19           think that may change in time, but they want to minimize the    20           utilization of that link.  They don't want to have it    21           retrieve the same file again and again and again from some    22           U.S. site.  So they would put on their end of the link a    23           cashing Web server.  So that when a request came in from    24           Europe, if it wasn't in the cash it would go do the request    25           across the Atlantic, across the relatively small and very                                                                           147     1           expensive link, retrieve that file and then store it in the     2           cashing Web server and pass a copy onto the requester.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But storing it in the Web server in     4           your hypothetical in Europe?     5                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now let's reverse the hypothetical     7           because we're told a significant percentage of the sexually     8           explicit material comes from abroad.  I mean I know you're     9           not an expert on that, but that's what we're told.    10                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know from personal experience,    11           no.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, but that's what we're told.     13           Let's assume that's true, okay.    14                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So the American server, the American    16           user types in "sexy European girls," okay.  Now, that goes to    17           Europe, pulls it back and it's held for a time in somewhere    18           on this side at the west side of the Atlantic so that it    19           could be accessed again for some finite period of time?    20                    THE WITNESS:  The European, in this case because the    21           transatlantic link as operated -- as paid for by a European    22           company, if the European company put such a server on this    23           side in order to preserve the band width coming the other    24           direction, which they could easily do, then yes, it would be    25           stored for a time on this side and it would be identified by                                                                           148     1           the URL, that's basically -- URL being index into it.     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Same hypothetical except the     3           provider of the sexually explicit material is in Thailand.      4           Any difference in your answer?     5                    THE WITNESS:  It's probably more likely to have a     6           Web cashing server there because the transpacific links are     7           very, very expensive, million dollars a month for a good-     8           sized link from the U.S. to Japan, for example.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And who is paying for that link?    10                    THE WITNESS:  The Japanese Internet service    11           providers.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Collectively.    13                    THE WITNESS:  There are a number of different links.     14           I was quoted the million dollars a month quote by somebody    15           involved in the Asian-Pacific Network Information Center a    16           couple of months ago, and I'm not sure if that was from a    17           particular Internet provider in Japan, or whether that was    18           some conglomeration.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Judge Sloviter wants to ask about    20           cashing.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, given now that you have    22           explained cashing in terms that maybe we can understand,    23           thanks to Judge Dalzell and to your willingness to do so,    24           what happens, what is the effect?  Now that we know the    25           concept, what is its relevance to the issues before us in                                                                           149     1           this case?     2                    THE WITNESS:  The primary relevance, the reason that     3           I brought it up in the statement is that once this is cashed,     4           you know when someone asks to see it, the original server     5           does not see the request.  The original server's request --     6           the user's request is fulfilled by the cashing server and     7           that request is not passed on to the originating server, so     8           the originating server has no way of knowing who or how many     9           or anything else.  We were talking about hits earlier.  The    10           originating server would have no way of knowing how many    11           times this file was retrieved because it wouldn't get the    12           hits.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the file would be identified    14           though as coming from the original server?    15                    THE WITNESS:  It would -- remember that in the -- we    16           were talking -- I missed yesterday afternoon, but I was told    17           about your adventures in cyberspace --    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And never get it back.    19                    THE WITNESS:  Everything is just a URL.  There is    20           nothing particularly in that URL that tells you really where    21           it came from.  There's some names in it which if given some    22           work we could figure out where some particular site exists,    23           but we don't know where SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS.COM might be, the    24           server might be.  That actually might be in the U.S., it    25           might be in Europe, could be anywhere.  There's just the URL,                                                                           150     1           which is, as I explained a minute ago, it's the application     2           followed by a site name followed by a file name.  What is     3           saved in the server, in the cashing server, is the URL and     4           the file associated with it.  So that's all that's there.  We     5           don't have any way of tying anything else together than that.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So you don't -- you can't identify     7           either the pointer or the pointee, is that the point?     8                    THE WITNESS:  It's not so much that, it's that if     9           somebody in Europe were retrieving a data file from my    10           server, let's say one of my newspaper columns, and they    11           retrieved that, I would see a retrieval from the local end of    12           the -- the cashing server in Europe or in the U.S., however    13           it was done, I would see one retrieval from that.  There    14           could be many other people who might want to read it --    15           that's not borne out by what my editor says -- but there    16           might be other people.  I would never know whether anybody    17           else read it, retrieved it within the time period of how long    18           the cashing server kept it.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And would the cashing server know    20           how many people retrieved it?    21                    THE WITNESS:  As long as it in turn wasn't behind    22           another cashing server.  Because organizations put cashing    23           servers on their boundaries to minimize the link, the    24           utilization of their link to the rest of the Internet because    25           those links are expensive, and if they're keeping, retrieving                                                                           151     1           the same files, they're making use of the link that they     2           wouldn't otherwise need to.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You see, this is why I think this     4           may be important to our consideration.  Whoever it is who     5           created the Web page, let's say SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS, let's     6           hypothesize in Luxembourg, does not think or may not be     7           thinking about complying with Title V of the     8           Telecommunications Act of 1996, but the cash server in the     9           United States, as I understand your testimony, effectually    10           domesticates that Luxembourg Web page, does it not?    11                    THE WITNESS:  If indeed there is such a server    12           there, but again, it could be a server there, it could be a    13           server that's on the boundary of a corporation or a school.     14           There could be many servers up and down the line.  Each one    15           of those, if they're within the U.S. could yes, be    16           domesticating it.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could Mr. Coppolino and his troops    18           find that domestic cash server to prosecute them?  And if so,    19           how would they do it?    20                    THE WITNESS:  You can -- actually there's nothing in    21           the information that you retrieve when you -- when somebody    22           goes to retrieve it, there's nothing to indicate where that    23           came from.  So if indeed for example the servers have been    24           tweaked so that they didn't save copies of files from    25           SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS.COM, then you wouldn't as someone reading                                                                           152     1           from this side of the Atlantic, you wouldn't be able to tell     2           that it was or was not cashed anywhere along the line.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And there would be no way for me to     4           know that and therefore no way for Mr. Coppolino and his     5           troops to know that?     6                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  But nonetheless I would see     8           an untagged SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS; correct?     9                    THE WITNESS:  You could see that.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Even if all domestic information    11           providers agreed, yes, let's tag all our URLs, the folks in    12           Luxembourg don't give a darn what our law says, but    13           nonetheless their information may come to my son, who's ten.    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    16                    THE WITNESS:  The other worry that I have in that    17           actually is a little bit perhaps even the other way.  From    18           what I understand, we went through this process of the CD    19           providers agreeing to tag rap songs with parental guidance.     20           And the experience was that those CD's so tagged sold better    21           than the ones that were not.  (Laughter.)  I would have some    22           worry that people would actually, SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS.COM would    23           actually be quite happy to put tags on and then make sure    24           that there were browsers readily available that would seek    25           out sites that had such tags.                                                                           153     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, that's very helpful.  A couple     2           technical questions.  FTP and gopher.  Are they forms of     3           search engines?     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, they're just file retrieval     5           devices.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do they differ from a search     7           engine like Alta Vista (ph)?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Alta Vista builds up a database which     9           when you send a query to it, it looks into its local database    10           to see whether it has entries that match that query, and    11           return to you the pointers, URLs, that correspond to those    12           matches.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As I understand, FTP and gopher or    14           Alta Vista, if I type in Scott Bradner, they're all going to    15           go looking for anything mentioning you, won't they?    16                    THE WITNESS:  FTP -- no, FTP is an interactive    17           program with which you can tell it to retrieve a particular    18           file.  So if I gave you the name of a file on my machine,    19           there is a process by which you could interactively go    20           through and retrieve that one file.  It is not the kind of    21           thing -- FTP is not the kind of thing, nor is gopher the kind    22           of thing which by itself you can say, go find every file    23           which has Scott Bradner in it.  All it does is say, here is a    24           file name.  Here is a URL.  Here is the extended URL.  In the    25           case of FTP, you actually give it the machine name separately                                                                           154     1           and the file name separately, and you have to do all kinds of     2           --     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But in Alta Vista I could just     4           search Scott Bradner?     5                    THE WITNESS:  It has been done.  (Laughter.)     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm sure of that, maybe by people in     7           this room.  (Laughter.)     8                    Lastly, you talk in paragraphs 70 and 71 of your     9           declaration about common gateway interface or script, a CGI    10           script?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that you say is an option that    13           is at least possible on the Worldwide Web where the -- if you    14           had the resources you could screen out users?    15                    THE WITNESS:  It's basically -- and we were talking    16           this morning, we were talking about forms type interface    17           where you have little boxes to fill in, one of the things    18           that can happen when you fill in those little boxes is you    19           can fire up, you can start up a program and CGI is one of the    20           ways you can start up a program, which takes as its input    21           information in the boxes.    22                    So for example it could take as input somebody's    23           credit card number.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.    25                    THE WITNESS:  And then if mechanisms existed to                                                                           155     1           verify that credit card number purely electronically or over     2           the Net, it could go ahead and do that in theory.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, that's very good.  Thank you     4           very much.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'll ask a question while you're     6           thinking.     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, you go ahead.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When you used the term "trivial"     9           yesterday a number of times, and I'd have to go back and    10           retrieve and I don't have it all here and we don't have daily    11           transcripts so I don't know, do you mean by trivial, trivial    12           to somebody with your expertise, or technologically trivial,    13           or do you mean trivial because it doesn't take a lot of money    14           or because it doesn't -- I didn't quite understand what you    15           meant, and you used it at different times, so you may have    16           used it differently.    17                    THE WITNESS:  I believe most of the time that I used    18           it it was in response to a direct question from Mr. Baron who    19           used it in -- when we spoke last week.  But be that as it    20           may, I did use it and by that I really meant that it was    21           really easy to do, given -- I think in the deposition what I    22           said was -- or in the discussion we had last week, I said    23           something along the line of given a sample home page with a    24           fill in the blank of how you would designate naughty stuff    25           below, anybody could take that sample and modify it for their                                                                           156     1           own environment just trivially, because all it is is an     2           editing task.  It's just like editing a letter to one's     3           mother.  It's just characters.  And as long as you have a     4           model to follow and a set of instructions to follow, it's     5           easy to do.     6                    So I think in most of the contexts that I was     7           referring to yesterday, in that it's easy to do, not     8           necessarily for somebody with a great deal of expertise but     9           given the right environment, it would be easy for anybody to    10           do.  It would be difficult for me to do it today because I    11           don't happen to be an HTML expert.  I went out -- after our    12           discussion the other day I went out and bought a book because    13           he asked me some embarrassing questions I should have known    14           the answer to.  But it would take me some time and it would    15           be untrivial, both in terms of time and at my normal billing    16           rate expense for me to set up a home page to do this.  But if    17           I were given a sample home page with, if you fill in your    18           name here, everything will be fine, it would be truly trivial    19           to do.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I was thinking of carrying Judge    22           Sloviter's example being simple maybe to the ridiculous, I    23           hope not, but maybe my analogy would help me, when I was a    24           young man I wanted to be a user of the local bar when I was    25           in college.  But the provider (laughter) was by law forbidden                                                                           157     1           to serve me if I were under the age of, I think it was 21     2           back then.  Do I understand that it's somewhat analogous that     3           if the provider puts up a sign there that says no one under     4           21 allowed to drink that that's a tag?     5                    THE WITNESS:  That would be -- that would be an     6           equivalent to a tag, yes.     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That would be equivalent to a     8           tag.  And do I further understand that if that sign were in     9           Japanese, I wouldn't be configured to understand that tag or    10           -- is that what we mean by being configured?  Make the    11           assumption that I don't understand Japanese language, but --    12                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think that's a common    13           assumption in this room.    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes.    15                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly an assumption that falls    16           with me.  Actually what I think I was referring to was a    17           little bit different than that --    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.    19                    THE WITNESS:  -- in that it was more along the line    20           of yes, I guess, am I configured to be able to read and    21           understand that sign.    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Me, the user, I'm not configured,    23           so on --    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, can you read the sign.    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- that point, that tab would be                                                                           158     1           no good to me.     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right now, I'm configured to     4           understand English so the tab would be good.     5                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  That's what standards are useful     6           for.     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  However, it wouldn't be     8           sufficient to guarantee that I wouldn't get in the bar and     9           get a drink, right?    10                    THE WITNESS:  In the context of the law, I think    11           what we're to extend this simile to probably ridiculous    12           levels, it would appear to me that the provider of liquor to    13           that bar has to insure that the bar doesn't serve underage    14           people.  And that's the paradigm.  It would seem to follow    15           from the law that it's the provider of the materials that has    16           to insure, --    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.    18                    THE WITNESS:  And the liquor provider of the bar    19           can't be sure that they're checking IDs at the door and --    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  He can have a gateway though    21           which is the bouncer at the door who checks the ID or the    22           password of the --    23                    THE WITNESS:  But would the liquor provider have to    24           have that bouncer, or would the bar's owner have to --    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, under the example I'm                                                                           159     1           giving and the way it worked back then, the liquor provider     2           had to have the bouncer.  And isn't that what we're talking     3           about here under this law, that the Government is saying the     4           provider has to have the bouncer?     5                    THE WITNESS:  The liquor, the Jim Beam has to have     6           the bouncer, not the bar has to have the bouncer, and that's     7           the difference -- that's my extension of your scenario to     8           this law.     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  Now, extending my scenario    10           further, are you saying that that's very difficult to --    11                    THE WITNESS:  It's very difficult for Jim Beam to    12           know that the bouncer is there and to know the bouncer is    13           following the rules set which will result in underage people    14           not being allowed into the bar.    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  I don't want to go any    16           further with this, because it takes up too much time and    17           might not be particularly helpful, but thank you.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have one more basic question for    19           him.  While you were willing to do some explaining, and if    20           we've done this twice, let me know, but I was trying to    21           understand the use of the password system rather than the    22           anonymous system.  We haven't gone over that today, have we?    23                    THE WITNESS:  No, we haven't.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In different language -- which you    25           talked about in your declaration.                                                                           160     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I think you say that use of the     3           password system rather than the anonymous system     4           automatically would give the user access to the entire     5           system.     6                    THE WITNESS:  I do say that, yes.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  And if you would just quickly     8           explain that, if possible, and then tell us why couldn't the     9           access be restricted also?    10                    THE WITNESS:  What I was explaining there was the    11           existing software.  Certainly software can be changed to do    12           anything that you want it to do, given sufficient money and    13           motivation.  But the existing software for FTP which is what    14           I was specifically referring to, anonymous FTP when you log    15           in as anonymous, which is if you wanted to retrieve a file    16           from my system and I gave you the name of the file, you could    17           just go in using FTP, log in as anonymous, and then go to the    18           directory the file is in and retrieve it.    19                    But when you do that, the FTP server, the demon, the    20           server itself automatically restricts you to a subset of the    21           information that's available on my machine.  It's a    22           subportion of the directory tree.  So you can only see that,    23           and you cannot change directory out of that.  There's just --    24           the software prevents you from doing that.  It's called    25           rehoming.  It gives you a new home that's very, very                                                                           161     1           restricted.     2                    In the currently available software, the FTP demons,     3           that if you go and you log in as a regular user, which is     4           what you do when you're logging in with a user name and a     5           password, a legitimate one, my own user name and my own     6           password, for example, if I were to do that, then it gives me     7           access to the machine as if I had logged into the machine as     8           a terminal.  It gives me the same view of the machine.  And     9           that view of the machine is all of the files on the machine    10           with whatever protections those files have for every user.     11           So that if a file is publicly readable for all users, then it    12           would be publicly readable for the FTP who was coming in on a    13           log name and password basis.  If it's not publicly readable,    14           then it wouldn't be.    15                    What I was referring there was that it lays open for    16           potential abuse the entire structure of the server site.  In    17           my case --    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Of the server.  What was --    19                    THE WITNESS:  The server computer, the server site.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you concluded from that in    21           terms relevant to this case, because I'm not sure which side    22           that goes for, but what do you conclude from this?    23                    THE WITNESS:  There were two messages I was trying    24           to convey there.  One was that it would be an administrative    25           burden for me to maintain a log name and password file for                                                                           162     1           all of the very many people, individual users, who would want     2           to come and look at and retrieve information from my site.      3           So it's just purely an administrative nightmare to do that.      4           And the other is that it would pose to me a security risk to     5           make all of these files open, because I know that in my     6           machine as in almost all machines I have not been perfect in     7           setting the machine up, and I may have made some errors, and     8           some files which should have been protected are not     9           protected, or there is bugs in some of the software.  And    10           people could use the visibility they have into my machine to    11           circumvent the security on it.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you're not saying that software    13           couldn't be created that would do that, would take care of    14           this problem, --    15                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely not saying that.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- but it just hasn't been right    17           now.    18                    THE WITNESS:  It is not -- the current software does    19           not do this.  Future software wouldn't change the    20           administrative burden tremendously, but --    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, unless future it may do that,    22           too.    23                    THE WITNESS:  The future is unseeable.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.    25                    Mr. Baron?                                                                           163     1           BY MR. BARON:       2           Q   I have just a couple questions.  The record may be clear     3           on this point, Mr. Bradner, but we were talking about the     4           trivialness or the ease by which a tag can be put in HTML     5           source code.  And do I understand it from your testimony that     6           those individuals who know HTML source code who would be     7           designing Web pages, for that class of individuals it would     8           be an easy, straightforward trivial task to imbed a tag in a     9           header?    10           A   Actually I was going further than that and saying that if    11           you gave me a sample of what it's supposed to look like, even    12           if I don't know HTML, it would still be trivial.    13           Q   Okay.  And this is a very important point that your    14           Honors have raised about conventions and standards for    15           looking at tags and headers.  And so my question is that you    16           recall your testimony yesterday about Netscaping    17           approximately 80 percent of the browser market, correct?    18           A   As I recall my testimony yesterday was that Netscape    19           claimed to be 80 percent of the market.    20           Q   I stand corrected.  If -- and we spent a lot of time    21           yesterday at the beginning of your testimony talking about    22           the IETF and the fact that the Internet is a standards-rich    23           environment, do you recall that?    24           A   That's a standards development group rich environment.    25           Q   Okay, all right.  (Laughter.)                                                                           164     1           A   Which is slightly different.     2           Q   There are lots and lots of standards.     3           A   Yes, some of them conflicting.     4           Q   And draft standards, proposed standards, we covered all     5           that.     6           A   Consortium standards, the end of the month club.      7           (Laughter.)     8           Q   Now, if a Government agency or alternatively if in a     9           consortium of private parties got together and adopted a    10           convention or a standard for tagging in HTML code, that would    11           essentially operate, like the movie rating system, be an    12           adult tag, that is a technical matter, the browser market as    13           just is a matter of technical feasibility the browser market    14           represented by Netscape and Microsoft and others, could    15           certainly pick up that tag that would be adopted as a    16           standard or a convention, isn't that correct?    17           A   Yes, and they could even program the browsers to accept    18           more than one standard for the same sort of information.    19                    MR. BARON:  I have no further questions.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any further questions?    21                    MR. MORRIS:  No, your Honor.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.      23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But I want to follow up on that.     24           You said and Dr. Hoffman said that the Worldwide Web was not    25           created here, it came out of Czern (ph), right?                                                                           165     1                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And so what Mr. Baron just asked you     3           about hypothesizes that there is a plenary group that sets     4           standards and by setting standards, doesn't that then exclude     5           the possibility of new technologies such as the Worldwide Web     6           which arose spontaneously, not even in these shores?     7                    THE WITNESS:  That is a very insightful question.      8           (Laughter.)  That happens to be one of the subjects of the     9           meeting I was at yesterday and couldn't be here on.      10                    The tension between standards bodies is a very    11           serious issue.  I made light of it just a second ago, but it    12           is a very serious issue and there are many places in the    13           globe where the development of standards and the control of    14           the standards development process is seen as a strategic    15           necessity on the part of some governments.  And so the    16           defining of what standards to use, how to develop them and    17           what -- the level the mandating of those standards is seen as    18           strategic.    19                    And it is absolutely true that a too-strong    20           environment saying all standards must come from standards    21           group number two has a serious impact on innovation.  The Web    22           rose out of a hole.  The whole concept of the Web rose out of    23           a need that we didn't know we had.  We didn't know we had    24           this lack of ability to do easy browsing because we didn't    25           have the concept of easy browsing.  This was something that                                                                           166     1           sprung out of innovations on some parts of some individuals.      2           It was not part of a standards effort.  It was people doing     3           something.  It caught on because people wanted the -- saw it     4           as useful.     5                    There are other holes in the Net.  We don't know     6           what they are.  There are other needs that we don't know we     7           have.  And certainly being too reliant on "we only do those     8           things which are standard" will stifle that innovation and it     9           would be very bad for us.  We went through many years of    10           telecom where we did not have, let's say, rapid innovation    11           because of that kind of centralized standards development    12           constraint.    13                    So in the context though of what Mr. Baron was    14           asking, if a consortium were to develop a tagging structure,    15           it wouldn't have to be the same consortium that would develop    16           future extensions on HTML.  I met with somebody on Tuesday    17           where the IETF is going to actually have a document which is    18           the extensions on HTML and this is being put together with    19           the W3 consortium.  It's a nice conglomerate effort.    20                    But a group putting together a standard for labeling    21           within HTML or within URLs or within copies of any text that    22           happens to be around wouldn't necessarily have to cooperate    23           with any other standards body in doing so.  It could just    24           create it.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And indeed, isn't the whole point                                                                           167     1           that the very exponential growth and utility of the Internet     2           occurred precisely because governments kept their hands out     3           of this and didn't set standards that everybody had to     4           follow?     5                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's actually even a little bit     6           more contorted than that because the governments tried to.      7           The U.S. Government and many other governments attempted to     8           mandate a particular kind of protocol to be used on worldwide     9           data networks, and this is the OSI protocol suite.  The U.S.    10           Government mandated its use within the U.S. Government and    11           with purchasing material with U.S. funds.  This was mandated    12           in many European countries and in Canada and many other    13           places around the world.    14                    That particular suite of protocols has failed to    15           achieve market success.  What achieved success was the very    16           chaos that the Internet is.  The strength of the Internet is    17           that chaos.  It's the ability to have the forum to innovate.     18           And certainly a strong standards environment fights hard    19           against innovation.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.    22                    I'm sure counsel would like to continue the    23           dialogue, but are you content to let it be at the moment?    24                    MR. MORRIS:  We are, your Honor.    25                    MR. BARON:  Yes, your Honor.                                                                           168     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess you are.  I'm not     2           (laughter)...     3                    We'll close now to resume on the 1st of April --     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  On the 1st at 9:30.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Although counsel is I gather going     6           to meet with Judge Dalzell.  Do they know that --     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could we do that at 3:00 o'clock in     8           the robing room, if that's convenient?     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay?  All right.  Thank you all    10           very much, and have a good week until then.    11                    THE CLERK:  All rise.    12                    (Proceedings concluded at 2:40 o'clock p.m.)    13               Back to Hearing Transcripts index Back to Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition WT02-B06-6IA095-001027-B016-232http://www.cdt.org:80/ciec/transcripts/Mar_22_index.html 205.177.10.31 19970215013440 text/html 1289HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:33:24 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Index of Testimony - 22 Mar 96 Index of Testimony - March 22, 1996                                                                            169     1                                     I N D E X     2           PLAINTIFFS' WITNESSES       DIRECT  CROSS  REDIRECT  RECROSS     3           Donna L.

This is the hearing    14           before the statutory Three-Judge Court on the request for a    15           preliminary injunction in the consolidated action of American    16           Civil Liberties Union and its co-plaintiffs versus Reno, No.    17           96-963, and American Library Association and its co-    18           plaintiffs versus Department of Justice, No. 96-1458.    19                    Judge Buckwalter and I want to thank Judge Dalzell    20           for his case management of all preliminary matters and all    21           three Judges want to thank the parties for their concerted    22           efforts to expedite the proceedings by entering into    23           stipulations and we want to thank the plaintiffs for    24           presenting their testimony in chief by affidavits which are    25           available for public and press view.                                                                             4     1                    We -- now, there have been various requests for     2           photographing the proceedings and I thought it might be, we     3           thought it might be appropriate to make a statement at the     4           inception.     5                    In September 1994 the Judicial Conference of the     6           United States voted not to permit the taking of photographs     7           and radio and television coverage of proceedings in the     8           United States District Courts, whether those proceedings are     9           civil or criminal.    10                    When the Judicial Conference voted last week to    11           permit each Court of Appeals to decide whether and under what    12           circumstances to permit the taking of photographs and radio    13           and television arguments of appellate arguments it reiterated    14           its prior policy with respect to the District Courts.    15                    This proceeding is a three-judge District Court    16           proceeding.  I am a member of the Judicial Conference of the    17           United States and Chief Judge Cahn of the Eastern District of    18           Pennsylvania is a member of the Judicial Conference.    19                    Whatever the views of individual members of the    20           Eastern District on the issue of cameras in the Federal    21           courtroom or the collective views on that issue of that    22           District Court which was one of the pilot courts during the    23           project and whatever the personal views of the Judges on this    24           panel on that issue, we will abide by the vote of the    25           Judicial Conference of the United States, whether binding or                                                                             5     1           hortatory.     2                    We are privileged to be part of the great     3           institution that is the Federal Judiciary of the United     4           States.     5                    Okay, we will proceed with cross-examination of the     6           plaintiff's witness by the Government and we ask the     7           Government at the inception is there any -- we understand     8           that the first witness is -- and we'll ask the Government,     9           whom are you calling?  The Government.    10                    (Laughter.)    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court of Appeals, go ahead.    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry, your Honor, your    13           question?    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your first witness?    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Would be Scott Bradner, I believe,    16           your Honor.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And do you accept Mr.    18           Bradner as an expert?    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, we do, your Honor.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.  Then proceed.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:   Oh, yes, Mr. Coppolino, just one    22           housekeeping, important housekeeping matter.  We were most    23           grateful to the parties for the extensive stipulations that    24           were submitted that will probably save us a week of testimony    25           but there was -- and I don't criticize you for this -- there                                                                             6     1           was a qualification at the beginning of the stipulating     2           having to do with the fact that discovery of the plaintiff's     3           case was not concluded and therefore it says that no party     4           waives its right to submit information inconsistent with its     5           terms should it learn thereof through discovery, disclosure     6           or other investigation.     7                    Now, I take it that by April 1st, that is to say     8           when the plaintiffs complete their case, that the Government     9           will be in a position to tell us yea or nay whether it indeed    10           accepts every paragraph of those stipulations.    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I believe I can    12           represent that the purpose of the stipulation on the part of    13           both parties was to indicate that it was applicable to the    14           entire PI hearing.  And I believe that the specific purpose    15           being addressed here is that as the case proceeds beyond the    16           PI stage of the merits and discovery is taken at that time    17           which indicates that some of the statements in here are    18           incorrect or inaccurate upon further testing that at that    19           point these particular stipulations would not apply.    20                    That's my understanding.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So therefore you can    22           represent to us now that for purposes of this preliminary    23           injunction hearing that we may take the stipulation without    24           qualification.    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes.                                                                             7     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine, that's very helpful.      2           Thank you.     3                    Okay, do you want to -- it's Mr. Bradner, is it?     4                    MR. MORRIS:  Yes, your Honor, my name is John     5           Morris, co-counsel for the ALA plaintiffs and plaintiffs call     6           as their first witness Scott O. Bradner.

Bradner.     7                    MR. KMETZ:  Your Honor, Mr. Jason Baron will be     8           handling the cross-examination.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And it's our understanding that    10           there will be only one lawyer per witness.    11                    MR. KMETZ:  That would be our understanding as well.    12                    MR. MORRIS:  That's certainly our understanding.  If    13           the Court would indulge at the conclusion of any redirect we    14           might have, I will confer just momentarily among ourselves to    15           make sure that we're all on the same page.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We don't mind your conferring as    17           long as you don't mind our conferring --    18                    (Laughter.)    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- because a three-judge court is    20           something new for all of us, three-judge District Court.    21                    THE COURT CLERK:  Sir, will you state and spell your    22           full name for the record?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Scott Bradner, S-c-o-t-t     24           B-r-a-d-n-e-r.    25                    THE COURT CLERK:  Will you place your left hand on                                                                             8     1           the Bible and raise your right hand?     2                    SCOTT BRADNER, Plaintiffs' Witness, Affirmed.     3                    MR. MORRIS:  And at this point the plaintiffs would     4           move into admission the evidence of the previously filed     5           declaration of Mr. Bradner as sworn to on the 19th of this     6           month as his trial testimony.     7                    And Mr. Bradner is available for examination by the     8           Government and certainly any questions the Court may have,     9           I'm sure he'd be happy to respond to.    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Is there any objection    11           to--     12                    MR. BARON:  No objection, your Honor.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- accepting that as evidence,    14           fine.  Proceed.    15                    MR.

In the Court of Appeals    23           we always identify ourselves, we ask the counsel to identify    24           themselves for the record.  Maybe that would be a good idea.    25                    MR. BARON:  My apologies, your Honor.                                                                             9     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's all right.     2                    MR. BARON:  I'm Jason R. Baron, B-a-r-o-n, counsel     3           to the U.S. Department of Justice.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.     5                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.     6           BY MR. BARON:       7           Q   Mr. Bradner, you state in your declaration that you are     8           co-area director of something called the IETF.  Could you, in     9           a nutshell, tell us what the IETF is and what does it do?    10           A   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a self-organizing    11           group which developed out of some U.S. Federal Government    12           networking initiatives many years ago and it is the group    13           which now is primarily responsible for developing standards    14           for use in the Internet protocol which is the basis upon    15           which the Internet runs.    16           Q   The IETF has been in existence for about ten years,    17           correct?    18           A   That is correct.  I'd be clear that it predates my    19           involvement so I'm taking that from what others have said.    20           Q   Okay.  Would it be fair to say that the IETF defines    21           standards for the Internet Protocol suite?    22           A   That is -- yes, it would be fair to say that.    23           Q   Could you explain for the Court what is the Internet    24           Protocol, otherwise known as IP?    25           A   The Internet itself consists of many networks connected                                                                            10     1           together by other networks.  The Internet Protocol is that     2           part of the protocol suite, that part of the language which     3           is used on the network which allows a piece of information     4           called a packet on one network to find its way to identify a     5           separate network and find its way to that separate network.      6           So the IP is the Internet Protocol that allows movement of     7           data between networks.     8           Q   Different protocols make up IP suite, correct?     9           A   That is correct.    10           Q   Can you name a few for the Court?    11           A   Well, the underlying protocol is the Internet Protocol or    12           IP.  Riding on top of that are protocols such as TCP, the    13           Transmission Control Protocol, UDP, the Unreliable Datagram    14           Protocol, ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol.     15           Riding on top of TCP are protocols such as Telnet on the    16           World Wide Web, HTTP Protocols.  It's a layer cake of various    17           different concoctions.    18           Q   Well, we'll get into some of those in a few minutes.  Who    19           comprises the IETF?    20           A   As I said, the IETF is a self-organized group, we have    21           meetings three times a year.  The membership is those who    22           attend the meetings and those who are on the mailing lists.     23           There are some 80 or so working groups, each of the working    24           groups maintains a mailing list and anybody who joins any of    25           those mailing lists is de facto part of the IETF.                                                                             11     1                    There is an organizational structure within the IETF     2           which divides the working groups up into areas and then the     3           area, each area is managed by one or more, one or two area     4           directors.     5           Q   We're going to get into that as well.  People doing the,     6           quote, "standards work," unquote, on the IETF, are they     7           normally paid by corporations and businesses?     8           A   Or they are paid by corporations or businesses or     9           universities or their private consultants.    10           Q   Okay.  Could you explain to the Court what an RFC is?    11           A   RFC came from the original process of asking for    12           comments, it stood for request for comments, asking for    13           comments on thoughts on how to do some proposal.  It is    14           progressed past that point now and RFC stands for RFC.  It no    15           longer is a vehicle for comments.  There is a new vehicle for    16           the comments which are called Internet drafts and they pre--    17           precede RFC's, but RFC's are the basic standardization    18           document series for the IETF.    19           Q   RFC's exist that define a standards process for the    20           Internet, correct?    21           A   There are a series of RFC's which have progressively    22           defined the standards process.    23           Q   And some of the RFC's establishing a standards process    24           for the Internet are well established, correct?    25           A   There is -- the original standards process was defined in                                                                            12     1           RFC-1310, that has been superseded by RFC-1602 which has been     2           in effect for a few years, I don't remember exactly what.      3           And within one of the working groups within the IETF is     4           called the Poise Working Group -- and don't ask me what that     5           stands for cause I don't know -- and that is in the process     6           of refining a third revision of the standards process.  It's     7           now known as 1602 BIS because it has not gotten its own RFC     8           number yet.  That should happen within a few weeks.     9           Q   You're editing at least one RFC at the present time    10           having to do with Internet standards, correct?    11           A   I am editing two of them; co-editing one and editing    12           another one.    13           Q   Now, you mentioned an area within IETF, what is an area    14           within the IETF?    15           A   An area is a grouping of working groups, normally trying    16           to make the -- it's normally tried to be done in a way which    17           is logical so that the working groups which are working on    18           security-related matters are grouped in the security area.     19           Working groups that are working on network management related    20           efforts are in the network management area.    21           Q   Would it be fair to say that the area of operational    22           requirements that you are co-area director of has to do with    23           developing standards for the next generation of software for    24           the Internet?    25           A   No, it would not be.  The operational requirements area                                                                            13     1           is a little bit of a confusion point on the IETF in that one     2           of the things that we feel we must have is some kind of     3           feedback from the operation of a protocol to the protocol     4           developers and the operational requirements area does two     5           things: one, tries to make sure that when standards are     6           developed they can be done so, the resultant standards can     7           actually be operated in the real world rather than just in     8           the theoretical world.  And then, second of all, if indeed     9           when these standards are deployed that there is any lessons    10           to be learned which should go back to the standards    11           developers that they are fed back.    12                    I think what you may be referring to is the ad hoc    13           or the temporary IP Next Generation or IPNG area which is,    14           was working on and is currently working on extending for the    15           new generation of the IP protocol itself.    16           Q   Well, you have also been the co-area director of the IP    17           Next Generation area, correct?    18           A   That's correct.    19           Q   It sounds a little bit like Star Trek; what does that    20           area consist of?    21           A   It was purposely it sounds a little like Star Trek,    22           actually.    23                    (Laughter.)    24           A   It consists of the -- Allison Menkin and I were asked by    25           the -- by Phil Gross, the chair of the IETF, to put together                                                                            14     1           a temporary area to -- to group together all of the     2           activities involved, all of the proposals for a successor     3           protocol to IP to deal with scaling issues and the like and     4           to resolve the question of what should be "The Proposal" out     5           of the IETF-4 and IP Next Generation.  There were a number of     6           proposals on the books when we were assigned the task of     7           forming this temporary area, we have made a recommendation on     8           what the next generation should be, that recommendation has     9           been accepted and the area right now is closing down because    10           it's very close to have finished publishing the initial set    11           of RFC's, the initial set of standards for IP Next    12           Generation.    13           Q   Would it be fair to say, to summarize what you've just    14           said, that the IP Next Generation group is working on a new    15           generation of the IP Protocol itself?    16           A   That is correct.    17           Q   Does it have -- does the IP Next Generation group have    18           recommendations regarding a specific architecture of the    19           packet traffic on the Internet, including the format of the    20           packet?    21           A   It has a recommendation on the format of the packet    22           itself that's actually the basic recommendation is the format    23           of the packet traffic itself.  You used the word    24           "architecture" in your question and that's potentially    25           confusing because architecture could mean the way the                                                                            15     1           networks are put together, it could mean the concept of how     2           the packets are flowed through the network, it could mean a     3           number of different things, so I would prefer to say that     4           we've defined the packet format itself and we have looked at     5           architecture in various areas but not come to a specific     6           recommendation on architecture.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sir, when you -- excuse me.  When     8           you use the word "architecture" and it's in all -- a number     9           of the declarations, there's no -- that's not a term of art    10           that means one thing in this area?    11                    THE WITNESS:  It means -- it means one thing for    12           each of the areas that it's in.  And it's as a security    13           architecture which ties together a unified view of how one    14           should do security.    15                    There is a routing architecture which ties together    16           a unified view of how one should do routing which is the    17           keeping track of where networks are.  So there are a number    18           of architectures depending on what particular topic we're on.     19           There isn't an overall architecture because at the moment    20           it's too complex a network with too many functions going on.     21           You have to look at the individual functions and do an    22           architecture on those.    23                    We have done some work in that area, there is an    24           architecture for security, an IP Next Generation Security    25           which is now the general IP Security architecture and we have                                                                            16     1           looked at architecture in other areas, but it's difficult to     2           do to unify all of the thoughts together.     3                    One of our recommendations in the -- in our     4           recommendation for IP Next Generation was to appoint an     5           individual to be an architect for IP Next Generation.      6           Unfortunately, there aren't many people who could do that     7           task and fewer of them with enough time to do it.  So we in     8           the -- as Allison and I have acted as architects to make sure     9           that there's a consistent view of what IPNG, IP Next    10           Generation looks like across the various activities creating    11           protocols for it, the TCP Next Generation, the ICNP Next    12           Generation, the routing, security, all of these different    13           working groups working on different aspects of it, we're    14           trying to keep their view of what IP Next Generation looks    15           like as consistent.    16                    So we in that context are acting as architects, but    17           it's architects is one of those words which depends on the    18           beholder.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Depends on?    20                    THE WITNESS:  On the beholder.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  But you consider yourself    22           one?    23                    THE WITNESS:  In a real sense, no, I do not.     24           Architects tend to be more visionary than I tend to be in    25           this environment, intend to be more on intuitive feeling of                                                                            17     1           how the incredibly complicated world of the networking fits     2           together and what the implications are of making a change     3           some place.      4                    I think that I can understand architecture, but I     5           would not go so far as to say that I am an architect in the     6           context of, for example, Dave Clark of MIT, Dr. Dave Clark,     7           who is -- who was the original IP architect and the one who--     8           and the person that unfortunately didn't have enough time to     9           be the IP Next Generation architect.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But, for example, in the stipulation    11           and we hear a lot about the packet switching, for example.     12           Now, would that be like, to continue the metaphor, a brick    13           that is commonly used in all forms of architecture?    14                    THE WITNESS:  It's -- maybe it's more of a fact of    15           life of the forms of architecture, but --    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because that's unchanging, the    17           packet switching concept, that's not going to change?    18                    THE WITNESS:  One of the areas that we specifically    19           addressed in working on IP Next Generation was what are the    20           paradigms which we want to follow in IP Next Generation and    21           one of them was we wanted to preserve what is called the    22           Datagram mode which is the packet mode.    23                    The alternative to that is circuit switching like a    24           telephone where you do a call setup, you do initialization    25           and all of the traffic flows down a particular path.                                                                            18     1                    The original IP that designed when it was originally     2           designed was designed to deal with adverse events.  The     3           colloquial story is it was designed to deal with atomic war     4           which is an adverse event.  And --     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think we can agree on that.     6                    (Laughter.)     7                    THE WITNESS:  And so the ability for IP to survive     8           that kind of environment, the kind of hostile environment we     9           felt was very important to maintain, Datagram mode means that    10           the individual units of the data that move over the network    11           which are packets have full identify-- source identifiers and    12           destination identifiers in each packet and are separately    13           routed, separately handled by the computers which comprise    14           the network, therefore being resilient to individual failure.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that is -- but that is not    16           subject to change right now, that's not in the NG, the IPNG?    17                    THE WITNESS:  We specifically, specifically chose to    18           require the support for Datagram mode in IPNG.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.  Sorry to interrupt.    20           BY MR. BARON:      21           Q   Mr. Bradner, are all IETF documents public?    22           A   It is a -- it is a matter of pride and honor in the IETF    23           that all documents are public documents available for free    24           over the net.  We used the paradigm to develop the paradigm.    25           Q   And that includes all RFC drafts or proposals for                                                                            19     1           standards, right?     2           A   That is correct, they are called Internet Drafts and they     3           are publicly available.     4           Q   And they're put up on web sites and are available to the     5           world at large, correct?     6           A   That is correct.     7           Q   Can we pause here and define what a URL is for the Court?     8           A   URL is a term which means Uniform Resource Locator, a     9           pointer.  It's the best -- the best way to identi-- to    10           consider it is it's sort of like a combination of all of the    11           things you might have in a phone directory listing,    12           somebody's name and address, and it is where something is on    13           the Net, not relative to you but in an absolute sense.    14                    You don't go three buildings over to the left and    15           two stores down, it is here is the absolute location of    16           something ir-- independent of where you happen to be sitting    17           in the network.    18           Q   For the IETF itself, am I correct that the URL is    19           something known as HTTP://WWW.EFF.ORG?    20           A   That is incorrect.    21           Q   Oh.    22           A   Now, I'm sure that --    23           Q   Please correct me.    24           A   -- you -- you meant that to be incorrect.    25           Q   Oh, I see, yes, no, I'm sorry, I -- I did not have the                                                                            20     1           right URL.  Why don't you give the right URL?     2           A   HTTT -- HTTP://WWW.IETF.ORD.     3                    MR. BARON:  Yes, your Honors, I think I've been     4           reading the EFF site on the Web too much.     5           BY MR. BARON:       6           Q   Okay.  Could you explain what these domains in that URL     7           represent for the IETF URL?     8           A   The -- the part which is relative to the IETF is the     9           WWW.IETF.ORD.  The part which precedes that, HTTP, is the    10           protocol, the function in which one should retrieve, should    11           access this site.  Different options there are, for example,    12           FTP for File Transfer Protocol or Gofer, are different kinds    13           of concepts, different kinds of application programs to use    14           to access this site.    15                    In this particular case where you can access that    16           particular site with FTP with anonymous FTP or with the Web,    17           WWW, the URL you specified is one which is using the Web to    18           access this site.    19           Q   What's the difference between the current IP Version Four    20           and the Next Generation Version Six of the protocol?    21           A   How much detail would you like that answer in?    22           Q   Oh, just -- just sort of a summary for the Court.    23           A   The reason to undertake the effort, and it was some    24           significant effort to develop a new generation for IP    25           revolved around three basic issues:                                                                            21     1                    The first issue was that the IP address itself which     2           is the field, I mentioned in the packets themselves there is     3           this source identifier and a destination identifier, a source     4           address and a destination address.  In IP Version Four which     5           is the current version, those fields are 32 bits long, each     6           of which could in theory identify four billion individual     7           posts or computers on the Network, but because of address     8           assignment inefficiency we're beginning to run out of those     9           and we're beginning to run out at a rate which caused a great    10           deal of consternation, particularly in the press back in the    11           early 90's, '92 and '93, that investment in IP was probably    12           not a good idea because we were running out of addresses.     13           It's like going to the phone company and saying I'd like a    14           phone and they say they don't have a number.    15                    So the first thing was to try and fix the problem of    16           running out of addresses.  The second thing was to try and    17           fix the problem of that there was too much routing    18           information, this is the information within the computers    19           that tie the Internet together, they're called routers,    20           they're special purpose computers.  And in each one of those    21           computers in the backbone, in the more central locations    22           within the network must keep track of where every network in    23           the world is, every -- the network which is the one which    24           connects this computer here has to be kept track of by those    25           computers and the routers in the backbone.                                                                            22     1                    The size of the routing table, the size of that     2           information was growing faster than memory technology,     3           doubling every nine to ten months and memory technology was     4           doubling every 11 to 24 months and in the long run those two     5           lines will never intersect.  And so we had to do something.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, it's doubling every nine     7           to twelve months?     8                    THE WITNESS:  In nine --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's doubling every nine to --    10                    THE WITNESS:  The size of the Internet, yes.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Nine to twelve months?    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  It's been tending towards the    13           nine month area of doubling.    14                    And then the third area was want to be able to deal    15           with improving some aspects of the current Internet, security    16           aspects, real time or flow control or quality of service    17           metrics and things like that, so those were the three areas    18           which we were focusing on.    19                    In the first area the IP Version Four address, as I    20           said, is 32 bits long.  The IP Version Six which is what IP    21           Next Generation is, is 128 bits long.  Now, that's four times    22           the number of bits, but that's actually four billion times    23           four billion times four billion times the number of hosts.     24           That turns out to be a very large number, yet somebody    25           estimated that even under the absolute worst efficiency, the                                                                            23     1           least efficient method of allocating them it still works out     2           to 1500 computers per square meter of the earth's surface,     3           including the oceans.     4                    (Laughter.)     5                    THE WITNESS:  We think that we have -- we think that     6           we have aimed for the future in the expandability of this.     7                    (Laughter.)     8           BY MR. BARON:       9           Q   Sounds like a pervasive number of bits.    10           A   Okay.  The second, the second area was dealing with the    11           routing table space and we've made the addresses aggregatable    12           so that instead of having to articulate and list every    13           individual network, you can list a group of networks together    14           as one entry and this allows us to summarize the information    15           so that we don't have as many entries.    16                    And then the third one, which was the other aspects,    17           we've identified some strong security mechanisms and we have    18           a field in the packet header which will allow future use for    19           flow control, quality of service and metrics of that type.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask a lay question, very    21           basic?  If you go to this four times as many bits is it going    22           to increase four times everybody's address?    23                    THE WITNESS:  The -- that's a very good question and    24           actually that's something that a lot of people get confused.     25           There are two ways that you look at addresses on the                                                                            24     1           Internet.  One is that bit pattern, currently the 32 bits, so     2           the address of the computer sitting on my desk at Harvard is     3           128.103.65.15.  Now, I don't expect you to remember that, I'm     4           surprised that I do most of the time.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I don't intend to write to you     6           that way cause I wouldn't know how.     7                    (Laughter.)     8                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.  It's now in the record so     9           you could look it up, but that's not the way that you should    10           know about my computer.  You should know about my computer by    11           using its what is called domain name, which is a people    12           friendly name, and that name is NEWDEV, as in the New    13           Development Machine, dot Harvard dot EDU.  As long as you're    14           using that what is called the domain name, the size of the    15           actual address, the number of bits in the address is not    16           reflected back to something that the user has to deal with.     17           I would not want to try to remember the 128 bit version of    18           what my -- my computer's address is, but the domain name,    19           NEWDEV.Harvard.EDU will remain the same.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.    21                    Sorry.    22           BY MR. BARON:      23           Q   Mr. Bradner, you also said on something called the IESG,    24           the Internet Engineering Steering Group, correct?    25           A   That is correct.                                                                            25     1           Q   You've -- this is the Standards Approval Board of the     2           IETF, correct?     3           A   That is correct.     4           Q   Take us through, very briefly, if you would, the     5           standards track in terms of the three stages of standards,     6           proposed, draft and full?     7           A   Actually, I would like to start a little bit before that.      8           All documents which are going to be proposed for     9           consideration for standardization within the IETF must first    10           appear as one of the Internet drafts that you mentioned    11           earlier that are publicly available ideas.  And so somebody    12           who wishes to, somebody or some working group or some group    13           of individuals who wish to make a standard or have a document    14           considered to be a -- for standardization creates a Internet    15           draft.  Usually that is the product of a working group or is    16           that, you know, a working group is formed to look at that    17           proposal, but not always.    18                    After working group consideration, the working group    19           chair would propose to the area director within the area that    20           this document be considered by the IESG for the standards    21           process, for the standards track.    22                    The first step, the IESG then reviews that and does    23           an internal vote and approves or does not approve of the    24           document based on its technical quality, its clarity and all    25           of the other things that one should consider when approving a                                                                            26     1           standard.      2                    The first step in the standards process is, as you     3           mentioned, the proposed standard status.  A proposed standard     4           is a document which is felt to be useful, i.e. has a     5           constituency usually within a working group and within the     6           IETF itself, and that constituency believes that this is of     7           value to the community and that it has no known errors, no     8           known flaws.  If something is discovered in the process of     9           evaluation by the IESG or the working group which is a flaw,    10           then it should be returned to the working group and reworked.    11                    Six months after a document has been approved as a    12           proposed standard it can then be considered for being a draft    13           standard.  To achieve draft standard status, a document, a    14           specification must have multiple interoperable    15           implementations, you know, it's got to be proven to work, and    16           it's got to -- all of the individual aspects of it have to be    17           proven to work, all of the individual functions have to have    18           been shown to be implemented and interoperable.    19                    This is unlike some other standards bodies which    20           just say this is a good idea and it's a better idea now than    21           it used to be because we've thought about it longer.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could you give us an example?     23           Bring us down to earth, give us an example of a standard like    24           a proposed standard.  What are we talking about?    25                    THE WITNESS:  A proposed standard, for example --                                                                            27     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- an example of one is in the IE --     3           in the Inter-- in the IET -- IP Next Generation there is a     4           proposed standard which is the basic packet format and how     5           that packet is handled by routers as it goes through the     6           network.  It defines the fields in the packet, the 128-bit     7           addresses, what routers do when they encounter this packet,     8           how they process it, all of that kind of aspect, all of those     9           aspects surrounding defining a packet of IP Version Six IP    10           Next Generation and how to move it through the network are    11           part of a proposed standard.    12                    Another proposed standard would be -- well, a full    13           standard is Telnet which is a, Telnet is the remote access    14           protocol where you -- I can sit at this machine here and log    15           into as if I were local to my computer sitting back on my    16           desk at Harvard and that's a standard.    17                    So a proposed standard is: we think this is a good    18           idea, we don't see any problems with it; draft standard is    19           people have implemented it and it works and we don't see any    20           problems with it still and more than one is implemented and    21           they interoperate.  And then four months after a document has    22           been approved as a proposed standard, it can then be    23           considered for full standard and full standard has to have    24           the same implementation rules but it also has to be proven                                                                            28     1           that people want to use it so that there is significant     2           deployment.  So we don't make something a full standard     3           unless people are going to use it.     4           BY MR. BARON:       5           Q   It is true, is it not, that apart from the IETF and the     6           IESG, that there are other standards for the Internet that     7           come from submissions by outside individuals or groups,     8           correct?     9           A   There are, there are a number of bodies who make    10           specifications, most of them call them specifications for    11           some minutiae of legal ease that I don't quite understand,    12           rather than standards.  A number of --    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now you know how people feel if    14           they don't quite understand when somebody says something.  Go    15           ahead.    16                    (Laughter.)    17                    THE WITNESS:  I fully do understand, actually.  I am    18           a fish out of water here, so...    19                    There are many bodies who purport to make standards    20           or specifications that are for use on the Internet.  The IETF    21           is the longest established of these and the one which has the    22           most international flavor and the one which is the, well, I    23           think anyway, since I'm a member of it, has the most    24           credibility as an open forum for development of standards.     25           We allow literally anybody who wants to participate.                                                                            29     1                    Many of the other groups have a membership mechanism     2           where somebody purchases a membership or pays a membership     3           fee and at the access to the standards either during     4           development or when they're done are restricted, you have to     5           pay for them.  But there are a dozen or more different groups     6           developing specifications for protocols to be used over the     7           Internet, those groups are open, large consortia such as the     8           W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, or very focused ones such     9           as the Master Card and Visa just announced a payments    10           protocol to encrypt credit cards over the Net, and that is a    11           small consortium and they have come up with a standard.    12                    And so there's a wide range of standards.  Things in    13           the Internet as in things in real life are standards only in    14           the extent that people actually use what you've done.  We can    15           create something we say is a standard and if nobody uses it,    16           well, we're whistling in the wind but it's not really a    17           standard unless people use it.    18                    So the Web itself is something which did not develop    19           out of the IETF standards process, it developed out of    20           scientists wanting to avail the technology for use in over    21           the Internet and this was -- this was developed outside the    22           IETF, though now there's an activity within the IETF to    23           codify and clarify the Web standards, the HTTP Standards.     24           But, yes, there are many standards processes.    25           BY MR. BARON:                                                                              30     1           Q   There are 53 or so full standards that have made it     2           through this process?     3           A   Over the years, yes.     4           Q   These are common protocols --      5           A   Something around that number.     6           Q   These are common protocols in widespread use on the     7           Internet, correct?     8           A   They were at the time they were adopted.  Not all of them     9           are still in widespread use, some of them are quite historic.    10           Q   And there are some two dozen draft standards in the    11           works, correct?    12           A   Somewhere around that number, yes.    13           Q   And about two or three more dozen proposed standards,    14           correct?    15           A   That is correct.    16                    MR. BARON:  Your Honors, I'm going to, with the    17           Court's indulgence, approach the witness and provide him with    18           an exhibit.  We have provided --    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's in our binder?    20                    MR. BARON:  They're in black binders.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In the black binder.    22                    MR. BARON:  In the Defendant's Exhibits 1 through    23           45, for the Court.  I will hand the witness a volume as well.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And this is going to illustrate    25           everything he just said in black and white?                                                                            31     1                    (Laughter.)     2                    THE WITNESS:  In a little bit more detail, I think.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which exhibit is this again?     4           BY MR. BARON:       5           Q   I wanted to turn to Exhibit 6, Mr. Bradner, I wanted to     6           give a concrete example of something that the IETF is working     7           on.  You're familiar with this document, Mr. Bradner?     8           A   Make sure we're on the same page.  This is --     9           Q   It's --    10           A   -- the charter for the address auto configuration working    11           group?    12           Q   That's correct, marked as Defendant's Exhibit 6?    13           A   Yes.    14           Q   Your name appears on the first page of the document,    15           correct?    16           A   That is correct.    17           Q   Could you explain how this document which is with title    18           "Address Auto Configuration" will help unsophisticated    19           computer purchases -- purchasers like myself to essentially    20           plug and play when they buy computers?    21           A   The document itself won't help you a great deal.    22           Q   Okay.    23           A   But the -- this is, the document is a charter for a    24           working group within the IETF, within the IP Next Generation    25           area which is designed for to allow computers when they're                                                                            32     1           taken out of a shipping carton and plugged into the wall to     2           come up with that globally unique 128-bit address so that you     3           don't have to type it in.  You thought that remembering was     4           bad, defining the right one and typing it was going to be     5           awful.  So this is a mechanism by which the computer can     6           figure out a globally useful unique address and work with     7           other technologies, particularly what is called Dynamic Host     8           Configuration Protocol which is a way where a central     9           administrator can control what address some particular    10           computer gets.  This is one of the activities of the IP Next    11           Generation area.    12           Q   If I could re-formulate that, in other words, an    13           individual does not have to obtain an IP address from some    14           central source like Internet but an auto configuration will    15           assign a globally unique address, correct?    16           A   It will assign a globally unique address but within    17           constraints of and a range of addresses which has been    18           provided from some central source, either directly or    19           indirectly.  It doesn't just go pick a number out of the air,    20           it says that this network, this physical wire can have    21           addresses 1 through 99 within this sub, sub-grouping of    22           addresses and it will pick the one within that sub-group    23           which uniquely identifies this machine but it does not affect    24           what is called the high order bits or the more -- the more    25           general part of the address which is supplied to it from a                                                                            33     1           router on the local network, a computer on the local network.     2           Q   Am I correct in saying that each IP address is unique on     3           earth?     4           A   That is incorrect.     5           Q   Let me, maybe I misphrased something from your deposition     6           in the last week, let me quote from Page 55, Line 18.  I'd be     7           happy to supply the witness with a copy of the deposition     8           transcript.     9           A   You can read it and --    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would you like the written    11           deposition?    12                    THE WITNESS:  Well, why doesn't he read it, if I'm    13           still confused then I'll ask for a copy.    14           BY MR. BARON:      15           Q   I asked a question that went:  Question:  "In lay    16           person's terms it would mean that a person such as myself who    17           may have difficulty loading in software or loading in    18           whatever is required to put a computer -- to get it to go    19           would have an easier time."    20                    You answered at some length, but at one paragraph    21           you said "It will negotiate over the network for an address    22           automatically and" -- here's the key section -- "assign an    23           address which is globally unique and will uniquely locate    24           this computer on the global Internet."    25                    Did I misstate the point?                                                                            34     1           A   Your question was whether every IP address in the world     2           is unique and the answer is no.  The -- the answer to the     3           question on the address auto configuration is if the address     4           auto, the node which is being configured is part of a     5           network, part of a network which is directly connected on the     6           Internet, then, yes, it will come up with a globally unique     7           address.  But there are very many, thousands and thousands of     8           networks which are not connected to the global Internet and     9           they are using addresses which may be the same as somebody    10           else on the global Internet but it doesn't make any    11           difference because they're not part of the same picture.    12                    And then there's a whole 'nother class which is    13           getting increasingly common where an organization such as a    14           university or a corporation, more likely a corporation, picks    15           addresses which are convenient to it and then has what is    16           called a fire wall between itself and the rest of the    17           Internet and that fire wall translates the addresses which    18           are local within its own corporation to addresses which are    19           unique on the internet, but it does so not one address per    20           node within the corporation but one address per speaker.    21                    So if I am -- want to just talk within the    22           corporation, I never get an address which is unique on the    23           Internet.  If I want to go out and make a connection out on    24           the Internet then I will be assigned the next address in the    25           row of the ones available that are unique on the Internet.                                                                             35     1           Normally there are very much fewer addresses on the window of     2           the Internet than there are inside the corporation and the     3           addresses on the window are reassigned by dynamically every     4           time somebody connects and disconnects, makes a section     5           through this fire wall and disconnects.  This is because of     6           the pressure of addresses on the Internet, we are still in a     7           situation where the 32 bit IP Version Four address is under     8           some stress in terms of availability, so in order to make it     9           easier on corporations which may have very large internal    10           networks but may not be able to obtain an address, a globally    11           unique address, routable, globally unique address for every    12           one of their internal nodes, they get a small subsection,    13           maybe 500, maybe a thousand addresses which are reachable all    14           over the Internet to deal with the 100,000 internal    15           computers.  It just means they can only have a thousand    16           communications going on at once.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me ask, could I follow that    18           through?  I had a question on that as I read his original    19           affidavit.  Let me give you an example and see if it has any    20           relevance to this.    21                    The Federal Courts, the whole Federal Court system    22           is in this circuit interconnected on what we call CC Mail and    23           is in the process of becoming interconnected with Federal    24           Courts throughout the country.  But it's not currently on the    25           Internet for various reasons, although there may be, I                                                                            36     1           believe, several Internet addresses or -- I'm not sure that's     2           the right technical way to put it -- that Courts or libraries     3           within the Federal Court system are getting so that they can     4           get the information available generally without compromising     5           the security of the Federal Court communications.     6                    Now, is there a fire wall between -- is fire wall     7           the right term that insulates the Federal Courts from the     8           rest of the Internet?     9                    THE WITNESS:  It could be and isn't necessarily, it    10           could be simply that you have E-mail gateways such that    11           Electronic Mail, and CC Mail is a product name, by the way.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.    13                    THE WITNESS:  That Electronic Mail and CC Mail goes    14           to a computer which then reconverts it from the CC Mail    15           format into the Internet format so it can be forwarded out on    16           the Internet.  And then E-mail from the outside world can be    17           reformatted and forwarded inside, without having the ability,    18           for example, as I said Telnet, I could Telnet from here to my    19           desk at Harvard.  Without have-- the E-mail gateway would not    20           permit the passage of Telnet packets so that somebody from    21           outside couldn't try and connect up and use one of the    22           internal court machines.    23                    So there are different ways to get that isolation.     24           Fire Walls is one of them, Application Gateways is another    25           one.  The modern Fire Walls tend to be Application Gateways                                                                            37     1           built into a single box, a number of different application     2           gateways, a Telnet Gateway, an FDP Gateway, a Web Gateway,     3           and an E-mail Gateway all built into the same box and many of     4           them do this address translation.     5                    In your case it's more likely, speaking just as a     6           general indication, that the addresses inside are not even     7           translated to addresses outside, that the message is received     8           by the Gateway and retransmitted as if it were an entirely     9           new message using the address of the Gateway when it's going    10           out on the Internet, nothing related to the individual source    11           node where the message came from.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And there would be then, is it    13           correct that if you use such a gateway or whatever the    14           communication process is, there would be no way outside to    15           know what's really -- what's coming in inside or where it's    16           going inside?    17                    THE WITNESS:  That -- that actually is a key point.     18           We don't -- the Fire-- one of the aspects of Fire Walls is to    19           try and protect the knowledge of the structure of the inside    20           network from the outside, it's to hide the inside structure.    21           So from the outside, if I have an -- if I had your E-mail    22           address, I could send you E-mail but I wouldn't know how that    23           would get to you once it got past this gateway.  I wouldn't    24           know, wouldn't be able to determine from the outside anything    25           to do with the structure of the Court network nor what                                                                            38     1           computers were there, where you read your E-mail or anything.      2           It's one of the functions of Gateways is to protect the     3           internal structure from visibility.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So then it has at least two     5           objects.  One is because there are a multiplying number of     6           addresses and there are just or may not be enough addresses     7           and the other or many others are for other purposes?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.     10           BY MR. BARON:      11           Q   Just a couple more questions on standards.  You would    12           agree that a number of organizations are responsible for the    13           development of communications and operational standards and    14           protocols used on the Internet, correct?    15           A   A number of organizations believe they are, yes.     16           Q   The Internet wouldn't exist today as we know it without    17           some standards or some rules of the road, correct?    18           A   That is correct.    19           Q   And you recall saying in your deposition to me that we    20           are in a, quote, "standards development rich environment,"    21           unquote, on the Internet and you stand by that?    22           A   Yes, or sit by it or whatever.    23           Q   You stated in your supplemental declaration that you    24           have, quote, "A complete understanding of how communications    25           are accomplished on the Internet today, including                                                                            39     1           communications such as E-mail use, Net and World Wide Web,"     2           correct?  Why don't we break down the Internet and start with     3           World Wide Web since most of the plaintiffs in this case in     4           the lawsuit have Web pages.     5                    Mr. Bradner, can you describe for the Court what the     6           World Wide Web is?     7           A   The World Wide Web is basically two things:  it's the URL     8           that you mentioned earlier which is a pointer, a way to -- a     9           way to identify a particular location and piece of    10           information within that location on the Net and software that    11           interprets those pointers and goes off and retrieves the    12           documents that's been referenced by the URL.    13           Q   You testified at your deposition last Friday and I'm    14           paraphrasing this, but correct me if I misstate something,    15           that the World Wide Web is a concept more than anything else,    16           it is comprised of a number of servers which can provide    17           information about requests in the same general concept as    18           other servers, new servers, FTP servers and the like and a    19           descriptive language which allows you to embed in a piece of    20           text locators defined to point to other documents.    21                    Is that a good statement?    22           A   The World Wide Web uses a --    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You have to say yes or no so they    24           can get that.    25                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes, sorry.  Yes.                                                                            40     1                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.     2           BY MR. BARON:       3           Q   The World Wide Web uses a graphical user interface,     4           correct?     5           A   The -- the World Wide Web client applications that I have     6           seen use a graphical user interface.     7           Q   Why don't you describe for the Court what a graphical     8           user interface is?     9           A   The early computer interfaces tended to be character    10           lined, lined character type interfaces where you typed words    11           and commands like if you've used DOS, it's a DOS interface,    12           it's where your view of the Net or your view of the command    13           into the computer is one which is a character stream, you    14           type in words with varying degrees of meaningfulness and    15           asking it to do something.    16                    A graphical user interface tends to be a full screen    17           application where you have a -- an ability to, with a mouse    18           or with cursor, those little arrow keys on the keyboard,    19           locate something on the screen and tell it to activate a    20           program or to fetch a file or do something because you're    21           selecting something on the keyboard -- something on the    22           screen, rather than typing the name of something in on the    23           keyboard.    24           Q   The graphical user interface was designed to be user    25           friendly, correct?                                                                            41     1           A   The hope of the designers of graphical user interfaces is     2           that they're user friendly.  The definition of "user" and     3           "friendly" are to the mind of the beholder.     4                    (Laughter.)     5           Q   In fact, the Web's user interface was designed to allow     6           people with a wide variety of computer skills, indeed even     7           with some -- some with minimal computer skills to access vast     8           quantities of information, correct?     9           A   That is correct.     10           Q   And the language for creating Web pages on the World Wide    11           Web was designed in a way that makes pages easy to write,    12           makes it easy to put up pages on servers and makes it easy to    13           distribute information around the world, correct?    14           A   That is -- that was the statement of the people who    15           designed the language but I do notice that many of the books    16           on HTTP which is this language tend to be in the one to two-    17           inch or three-inch thick variety.  So again this might, it    18           somewhat depends on one's interpretation of the word "easy."    19           Q   HTTP or HTML?    20           A   Oh, HTML, sorry.  Right.  I get those --    21           Q   You stated last week in your deposition --    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  HTML.    23                    MR. BARON:  That was going to be my next question,    24           your Honor.    25           BY MR. BARON:                                                                              42     1           Q   Why don't you state for the Court what HTML is?     2           A   Hypertext Markup Language or something of that general     3           ilk.  There's --      4           Q   Were --     5           A   There's too many acronyms in this business.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  May I be the first to agree with     7           you?     8                    (Laughter.)     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I'll be the second.    10                    MR. BARON:  We're going to get to HTML, Judge    11           Dalzell.    12           BY MR. BARON:      13           Q   You stated last week in your deposition that you've    14           looked at thousands of Web pages and that there are probably    15           tens of thousands of Web pages in existence.  That's correct,    16           right?    17           A   Well, the tens of thousands would be a -- what I meant in    18           when we're speaking of that is there are tens of thousands of    19           locations where Web pages exist.  The actual number of Web    20           pages in the sense of a screen image that you could retrieve    21           is certainly in the millions.  I know I have on my own site    22           which is one server, one Web server with one home page, there    23           are thousands of screens that you can retrieve.  So if you're    24           talking about Web pages in terms of images on a screen, then    25           there are millions of them.                                                                            43     1           Q   Okay.  Now, apart from individuals --     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, you say you have a Web     3           page?     4                    THE WITNESS:  I have a Web server.  One of the     5           things that I do at Harvard is to run a test lab which     6           examines the performance of routers and things like, network     7           devices like that.  And I put all of the information that     8           I've gotten from this examination up on line for anybody to     9           take a look at and there is thousands of pages, mostly of    10           numbers and some of pictures of performance curves available    11           from the Web server which is running on the computer sitting    12           on my desk.    13           BY MR. BARON:      14           Q   Apart from individuals, Mr. Bradner, it would be a fair    15           statement to say that organizations including commercial    16           organizations such as companies selling potato chips or    17           pencils or cars use the Web as a way to provide information,    18           correct?    19           A   Correct.    20           Q   And to sell their products, correct?    21           A   At this point, more to provide information.  In the    22           future, in the near future I trust, more will be in the    23           business of selling their products over the Internet.  Right    24           now because of concerns of security and things of that    25           nature, few, relatively few companies are actually doing                                                                            44     1           retail over the Net, going and buying a bag of potato chips     2           over the Net is not something that is readily available today     3           although you can order a pizza if you happen to live in Santa     4           Clara, California.  Delivery is a big problem if you're doing     5           it from here, but --     6                    (Laughter.)     7           A   -- that -- soon you'll be able to do that.  So I'm just     8           nuancing on the word you use of selling because right at the     9           moment it's more providing information than it is selling.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because you can't close the sale?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Actually you can and you can by    12           putting your credit card number in and actually the credit    13           card transaction over the Internet today is more secure than    14           giving your credit card to the waitress at the local    15           restaurant, but there is a feeling that it is not as secure.     16           And so there aren't many --    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I thought there was a problem of    18           verification?    19                    THE WITNESS:  The -- it's the same --    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Or so we're told.    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's the same level of problem    22           of verification as what happens when someone calls up and    23           orders something from L.L. Bean over the telephone. L.L. Bean    24           has to go through a process with which they call up the    25           credit card company and say is this a valid credit card.                                                                            45     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is it not true that you still     2           have to go outside the Internet to do that process?     3                    THE WITNESS:  Today that is true.  I would hope that     4           in the relatively near future --     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Defined as?     6                    THE WITNESS:  Well, Master Card and Visa did define     7           a language for moving of information about credit cards over     8           the Net, they said it would be, that this definition would be     9           available I think this month or next month.  So in the next    10           six to nine months the function set to be able to send a    11           secure credit card to Master Card to ask whether it's a valid    12           card and whether the person has enough money to pay two    13           dollars or whatever your fee is going to be should be there,    14           but this is a projection rather than a statement from    15           knowledge of who is developing these.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How could phoning tell or assure    17           that it's a valid card?  It might show or how can phoning    18           assure that X, that Judge Dalzell who gives the card number    19           is in fact Judge Dalzell rather than Judge Buckwalter?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Actually, it does not.  And that's --    21           it does not now when you call up for one of these mail order    22           houses.  They do it on a basis generally of two things.  One    23           is that in general when you order something you order it,    24           particularly if it's going to be shipped to you, you order it    25           shipped to you so that in some cases like American Express,                                                                            46     1           if it's a valuable shipment, will verify it's being shipped     2           to the billing address.  And if it's not being shipped to the     3           billing address, you have to call them up and tell them no,     4           this is a special case and I want it to go someplace else.  I     5           know because I had to do that.     6                    Other credit card just ship -- know because they     7           have the shipping address of where it's going to, they have     8           an audit trail so in case somebody protests that this wasn't,     9           it wasn't me who placed this order, they can then do some    10           kind of tracking to try and figure out who it was who placed    11           the order.  And the same thing would be true over the    12           Internet.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But would that be time consuming or    14           now that we have computers could that be easy and    15           instantaneous?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, in a real way ordering something    17           over the Internet over ordering something from a mail order    18           house over the telephone isn't going to change any of the    19           mechanisms involved other than how do you do it.  You sit    20           there with a Web page and do some clicking on with your mouse    21           versus you call up on the telephone and tell the nice person    22           who answers the phone that you want an item on Page 67.    23                    The rest of this, what happens behind the scenes,    24           works the same way today.  There will be an increase in    25           efficiency when the verification process for verifying the                                                                            47     1           card, instead of requiring a separate communication normally     2           by a phone line with Master Card or Visa or American Express     3           could be done with electronic communication over the     4           Internet.     5                    That will be a change in efficiency, but it doesn't     6           change the basic functionality which is they're depending on     7           you or your knowledge of the credit card number as your     8           identifier to identify yourself and the fact that they can     9           trace where the order was sent to as sort of a second guess    10           to figure out what happened when something goes awry.    11           BY MR. BARON:      12           Q   Putting aside actually ordering merchandise by use of a    13           verified credit card via the Internet, it's certainly true,    14           isn't it the case that both individuals and companies can    15           have Web pages and that have a phone number on them or an 800    16           number or a toll free number for people to call to buy things    17           that they see advertised on the Net, isn't that correct?    18           A   Yes, that is true.    19           Q   Okay.  Before we get into what individuals and nonprofit    20           organizations other than corporations can or cannot do, let's    21           talk about some technical matters including some --    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean we haven't been?    23                    (Laughter.)    24                    MR. BARON:  Some more technical matters.    25           BY MR. BARON:                                                                              48     1           Q   Including some descriptive language used for the World     2           Wide Web.  Mr. Bradner, could you tell the Court what a Web     3           server is?     4           A   A Web server, a server in general in computer jargon is     5           software which is running on a computer which is waiting     6           patiently for a command to be sent to it over a network and     7           that command, if it's an FTP server, it would be an FTP     8           command, FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol.  If it's a     9           server which returns phone numbers it's going to be a phone    10           number query.  If it's a database server, so lots of    11           different servers, they have the same basic function which is    12           just software running in the computer waiting for a query.    13                    A Web server is one which is waiting for a query    14           which is in -- over the Net which is formed in Webese, in the    15           right format for a Web query.    16           Q   You told me last week that the World Wide Web is sewn    17           together with URL's, is that a fair statement?    18           A   Yes.  Sorry.    19           Q   Now, on a particular Web page there can be pointers to    20           other pages on the Web, correct?    21           A   Those are the URL's of which we were just speaking.    22           Q   And the pointers -- all right, they can be pointers to    23           other URL's.  And Web pages can also have --    24           A   The pointers are the URL's.    25           Q   Oh, the pointers are the URL's, okay, I stand corrected.                                                                             49     1           Web pages can also have pointers to files which contain audio     2           or sound, correct?     3           A   That is correct.      4           Q   In fact, Web pages can contain pointers to files in any     5           one of a number of forms containing any one of a number of     6           things such as text, sounds, still graphics or motion     7           graphics, correct?     8           A   That is correct.     9           Q   One can take a home movie on a Camcorder and digitize it    10           and transpose it in a way that would be viewable by clicking    11           on a pointer on a Web page, correct?    12           A   Assuming that the person who had the client who had the    13           Web browser had the right software installed which allowed    14           them to download and then view motion graphics and assuming    15           that the motion graphics were stored in a format compatible    16           with the browser that the individual had.  Both of those are    17           not assumptions you can make a hundred percent, but still    18           given that qualification, yes.    19           Q   Could you tell the Court what a browser is?    20           A   A browser is the jargon term for a Web client.  The    21           client is the software running on a user's computer to access    22           some server and a Web browser is the software running on the    23           user's computer to access a Web server.    24           Q   And what is a search engine?    25           A   A search engine in this -- in the context of the Web is a                                                                            50     1           piece of software which, when given a query, it's a database     2           query responder, it's a server for database queries, it --     3           you give it some information about something that you wish to     4           find and it goes to its database and tries to find it in that     5           database.     6                    Search engines have fine degrees of sophistication     7           of ability to take just single words or words in context or     8           concepts in the sense of you can give some search engines a     9           piece of text, a newspaper article, and say this is    10           interesting to me, find other things that look like this.     11           And it's quite -- some of them are very sophisticated.  They    12           look at their internal database to try and find other things,    13           other references in that database which are compatible with    14           the query that you gave it.     15           Q   Let's get to the heart of things, Mr. Bradner, by    16           discussing something called HTML.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before we do that maybe we should    18           let the witness have a break and we should all have a break.     19           Okay?    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I agree.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Ten minutes, I'm told.    22                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please rise.    23                    (Court in recess; 10:40 to 10:55 o'clock a.m.)    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, Mr. Baron.    25                    MR. BARON:  Excuse me, your Honor, we were just                                                                            51     1           taking care of some housekeeping functions.     2                    (Pause.)     3           BY MR. BARON:       4           Q   Mr. Bradner, we were about to discuss HTML, could you     5           tell the Court what HTML is?     6           A   It's a language, a descriptor language which is used to     7           define within a Web server how a document should appear on     8           the screen of the Web client, the browser.     9           Q   Perhaps an example of HTML code would be helpful here.     10           Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit that's marked 14 in the    11           black binder?    12                    (Pause.)    13           Q   Do you have that?    14           A   Yes, I do.    15           Q   Mr. Bradner, does this appear to you as the same exhibit    16           that I showed you at your deposition last Friday?    17           A   Yes.    18           Q   This represents the Worldwide Web home page of an    19           organization entitled Stop Prisoner Rape, which is one of the    20           plaintiffs in this lawsuit.  And you will note -- and you    21           would agree, would you not, Mr. Bradner, that the first four    22           pages represent Web pages in their usual format and behind    23           those four pages is a series of pages which represent the    24           same text but in HTML code format, is that correct?    25           A   That appears -- that is what it appears to be, yes.                                                                            52     1           Q   Looking at the immediate page behind the usual format Web     2           pages, the top of the page says --     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  These aren't paginated, are they?     4                    MR. BARON:  No, they are not, your Honor.     5                    (Discussion held off the record.)     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You're talking about the first page     7           following the conventional --     8                    MR. BARON:  That's correct, the --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- conventionally arranged text?    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, the one that says --    11                    MR. BARON:  That's correct and the --    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right, okay.    13                    MR. BARON:  That's correct, your Honor.    14           BY MR. BARON:      15           Q   You see the bracket HTML and bracket Head, correct, Mr.    16           Bradner?    17           A   Yes.    18           Q   The designation Head represents the head of this HTML    19           document, correct?    20           A   Yes.    21           Q   And you see the term Meta in the third and the fifth    22           line?    23           A   Yes.    24           Q   What does the Meta represent?    25           A   As I said in my deposition and when we talked last                                                                            53     1           Friday, I did not and do not represent myself as an expert in     2           HTML.  So, I would suggest that if you want to investigate     3           the details of HTML it would probably be better to ask     4           somebody who is.     5           Q   But looking at it you're certainly more expert than I,     6           that the key words here are words that are in a field in a     7           Meta tag in the header, correct?     8           A   Yes.     9           Q   Okay.  And there's a body to an HTML document, correct?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   And down at the bottom of this page there is a reference    12           to a URL.  The HTML source code includes references to    13           particular URL's as a usual course, correct?    14           A   Most of them do, yes.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh --    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The very bottom, the very bottom.    17                    MR. BARON:  The very bottom of the page, your Honor,    18           it says "Bracket A-HREF equals," and then A-URL, which    19           represents another Web site.    20                    THE WITNESS:  Actually all you can tell about that,    21           URL, is that it represents a particular document someplace    22           which may or may not be on another site.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Where does it says URL?    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He said that is the URL.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, okay.                                                                            54     1           BY MR. BARON:       2           Q   Yes, that's a better description, Mr. Bradner.  Now, in     3           your deposition last week you indicated that the type of     4           parental control rating scheme you preferred would be one in     5           which an individual's browser could be configured to send a     6           copy of a particular URL, including a URL in a document, to a     7           third-party rating service with a query to the rating     8           service, asking for information about the contents of the     9           URL, correct?    10           A   Actually, to be very precise, about the contents of the    11           file or document pointed to by the URL.    12           Q   Okay.  Now, this would be one of the methodologies    13           suggested by the PICS scheme, P-I-C-S, which is a parental    14           control rating scheme being worked on by the W-3 consortium    15           located at MIT, correct?    16           A   That's correct.    17           Q   And that's the scheme that's embodied in Defendant's    18           Exhibit 15, if you could turn to that, the document which    19           says, "PICS:  Internet access controls without censorship"?    20           A   Yes, this is a document you showed me last week.    21           Q   It is true, is it not, Mr. Bradner, that a browser under    22           this model of parental controls could look to the specific    23           header information in HTML source code for a tag or a label    24           that's put in the header by the content provider as part of    25           the overall rating scheme, isn't that correct?                                                                            55     1           A   To be clear, you had just asked me about my preference     2           for a third-party rating service, it appears that you're     3           asking me now about PICS as a general concept, I just want to     4           be sure what it is that you're asking me.     5           Q   Well, I'm asking PICS as a general concept.     6           A   Okay.  So, in PICS as a general concept you -- PICS     7           defines tags that you can place into a document, into the     8           header of a document, HTML document and other documents,     9           which can be used to convey information about the -- some    10           content of this document, that is correct.    11           Q   And on Exhibit 15 at Page 6 of 9, at the bottom left-hand    12           corner, that's where the pages are identified, the second    13           full paragraph, if you would read along with me --    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, where are you?    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 6 of 9.    16                    MR. BARON:  It's Exhibit 15 and it's Page 6 of 9,    17           you can see at the bottom left hand of the document.    18           BY MR. BARON:      19           Q   I'm going to concentrate on the second full paragraph,    20           starting with "Since," the word, "Since."  And the second    21           sentence says, "The first is to" -- the first methodology of    22           PICS, is that correct, Mr. Bradner?    23           A   That's actually a third sentence.    24           Q   Well, it says, "The first is to embed labels in HTML    25           documents.  This method will be helpful for those who wish to                                                                            56     1           label content they have created."  That's one of the     2           methodologies embodied in the PICS parental control rating     3           standard, correct?     4           A   That's one of the -- that's one of the methods in their     5           proposal, yes.     6           Q   Okay.  Indeed, you believe that as a technical matter one     7           can embed a character stream which could be interpreted by     8           browsers or other software if it is so desired, correct?     9           A   In certain documents, certain types of files and    10           documents that is correct, in other types of files and    11           documents it's incorrect.    12           Q   Well, it's your view, is it not, Mr. Bradner, that as a    13           technical matter of ease or difficulty that it is trivial to    14           embed a tag or a label in HTML source code, correct?    15           A   It's a matter of typing a few characters, so, yes, in    16           concept; in implementation, if you have thousands of pages of    17           source code then it might be a little difficult, but in    18           concept it's easy, you just type in the character string.    19           Q   You told me last Friday in your deposition that for your    20           own Web site, your own Web pages, the home page it would be    21           trivial to embed a tag, you could do it in five minutes,    22           correct?    23           A   Well, actually it's a little more -- I said a little bit    24           more than that.  My current Web server I do not happen to    25           have a document which is a home page.  The Web server points                                                                            57     1           to a part of my -- the directory tree in my computer and it     2           has automatically created a home page, because I haven't     3           gotten around to creating one myself.  So, it would take more     4           than five minutes, because I would have to create the     5           document in which to embed the string before embedding the     6           string and I couldn't tell how long that would take, it would     7           depend on how anal I got and how pretty a picture I wanted on     8           it.     9           Q   Well, you said at Page 223 of your deposition --     10                    MR. BARON:  -- I'd be happy at any appropriate point    11           to hand the witness the deposition if it will be --    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Whenever you want it, you just say    13           so.    14                    MR. BARON:  -- helpful for the record.    15           BY MR. BARON:      16           Q   You said at Page 223, Line 8, "Certainly on my site it    17           would be trivial for me to do," correct?    18           A   Once I created a home page it would be trivial for me to    19           do it, yes.    20           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 16?  This exhibit    21           is one that I showed you last week, correct?    22           A   That's correct.    23           Q   It's titled, "Safe Surf Internet Rating Standard," are    24           you familiar with Safe Surf?    25           A   As to the extent that you showed it to me last week.                                                                            58     1           Q   Okay.  On the second page of this exhibit at the top, the     2           first full sentence says, "If a majority of them spent five     3           to ten minutes to implement the system by marking their site     4           then a child-safe Internet could be realized in a matter of     5           weeks."  Do you see that statement?     6           A   I see that statement.     7           Q   And do you agree with it?     8           A   No.     9           Q   You could build PICS compatible software into existing    10           browsers, correct?    11           A   One could, I wouldn't proclaim to be a good enough    12           programmer to in any particular case.    13           Q   That's technically feasible, correct?    14           A   That's correct.    15           Q   Back to Exhibit 15, looking at the bottom of the Page 5    16           of 9 in the document.  It's the page with blue Figure 4 at    17           the top, but I'm going to concentrate on the bottom of the    18           page.  Do you see the sentence that starts, "Anything"?    19           A   Yes, I do.    20           Q   Let me read it to the record:  "Anything that can be    21           named by a URL can be labeled, including resources that are    22           accessed via FTP, Gopher or Net News, as well as HTTP."  You    23           agree, do you not, Mr. Bradner, that you may extend URL's to    24           provide labeling in some form across these applications on    25           the Internet, correct?                                                                            59     1           A   To be very specific and concrete, you can extend the     2           format of URL's themselves to include additional information,     3           which could be used by a browser to decide on whether to     4           implement -- to instigate a particular application.  You     5           would not actually do anything in the application itself, for     6           example FTP, you wouldn't modify FTP, you would modify the     7           browser to decide on whether or not to start up FTP based on     8           additional information in the URL.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I want to get very concrete on this,    10           because it's an important issue.  The Carnegie Library, Mr.    11           Croneberger is here for the Carnegie Library, it's card    12           catalogue is on line.  Now, I take it the card catalogue is a    13           site, correct, it has a URL -- if I want to get to it it has    14           a URL, does it not?    15                    THE WITNESS:  The -- I can speak with knowledge    16           about the Harvard University College --    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, fine, take that.    18                    THE WITNESS:  -- Library.  The Harvard University    19           College Library, which is called Holis (ph.), is available as    20           an interactive program.  So that you would Telnet to a server    21           at Harvard and then it presents a screen wherein you can do    22           an author search or a title search or things like that.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, what I'm getting at is what I    24           think Mr. Barn is asking you, is the idea here that Harvard    25           or the Carnegie Library would rate its card catalogue?                                                                            60     1                    THE WITNESS:  In the context of Harvard's, Harvard's     2           Holis system, what would have to happen is any place where     3           somebody referenced Harvard's Holis system, a URL which     4           referenced it, any place where that any URL existed the     5           reference Holis would have to be extended to include a rating     6           of Harvard's system.       7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I mean.     8                    THE WITNESS:  This wouldn't be Harvard rating it,     9           because Harvard isn't creating the URL's that might be placed    10           at Brown or at the National Library Association or any place    11           else, because that is a pointer to Harvard and it's the    12           pointer in this concept which is modified, not the site    13           itself.  In this particular case you do not get to Harvard     14           -- the way you access Harvard doesn't give an interactive way    15           for a browser to ask Harvard what its PICS rating is.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, then I'm not understanding    17           this at all.  The PICS rating -- assume that everybody adopts    18           this PICS system, okay?  Will the Harvard card catalogue    19           that's on line, will it be rated or will just subsets of it    20           be rated?    21                    THE WITNESS:  There --    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And who has to do that rating?    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Exactly, and who has to do the    24           rating?    25                    THE WITNESS:  All right.  I think using the Harvard                                                                            61     1           catalogue is exactly the kind of case where we can look at     2           it.  The current technology, the current way the Harvard     3           catalogue is implemented is that you interact with the     4           Harvard catalogue with the same program that I would use to     5           interact with my computer sitting on my desk, which is     6           Telnet, it allows you to remotely be connected to that     7           computer and remotely interact with that computer as if you     8           were a local terminal; this is not a Web interface, it is a     9           local terminal interface.  In that context Harvard has no way    10           of rating -- have no way of handing back a rating to anybody,    11           because what would have to happen instead is -- it's like you    12           would put ratings in T.V. Guide of T.V. shows, it's not that    13           the ratings are embedded in the shows, it's every place where    14           somebody pointed at Holis you would have to have that place    15           which did the pointing have the rating in it.  So, Harvard    16           wouldn't have control over that.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, but what I think Mr. Baron is    18           getting at is the feasibility of if you are going through a    19           card catalogue on line, which Mr. Croneberger describes in    20           detail in his declaration, would this marker be right next to    21           "Rebecca of Sullybrook Farm," and that's G rated, but then    22           when it has an Ice T lyric it would be NC-17?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Again --    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm not being facetious here.    25                    THE WITNESS:  No, no, I agree.  Under the current                                                                            62     1           Harvard system we wouldn't be able to implement this, I'm     2           saying under the current Harvard system that the pointers are     3           outside of Harvard's jurisdiction because they're pointers to     4           Harvard, not pointers within Harvard.  So, other people would     5           rate Harvard.  Another interface to this -- the same facility     6           which does not currently exist, but could be made to exist,     7           would be a Web Browser-type of interface to the Harvard     8           College library system.  In that case the browser could be     9           able to see a rating and the rating would be actually buried    10           in the URL, when you said Ice T the URL, which specified    11           where the file was if you're going to retrieve it, then that    12           URL, you could embed in that URL the PICS parental warning    13           symbol.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But my point, and it's a very    15           important point to this case, is since we know at least at    16           the Carnegie Library, and I would think that's in the    17           Carnegie Library would be up at Harvard, that they have the    18           Ice T lyrics, is the whole card catalogue NC-17, to take the    19           MPAA rating --    20                    THE WITNESS:  In the --    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- because there is some dirty words    22           there, in some people's view?    23                    THE WITNESS:  The question that I was asked a little    24           while ago, whether it was easy -- the statement in the    25           exhibit here of whether it was easy for everybody just to do                                                                            63     1           this, assumes the very assumption -- the question you just     2           asked, which is that, yes, Harvard would have to rate its     3           entire catalogue as questionable because of some references     4           within that catalogue.  The effort to go through and rate     5           every individual reference within the catalogue -- Harvard's     6           -- Carnegie Mellon's catalogue is a subset of Harvard's, of     7           course --     8                    (Laughter.)     9                    THE WITNESS:  -- it's some six or seven million    10           references in the Harvard catalogue, though I think on line    11           is three or four million at the moment, this would take    12           considerable effort to go through and --    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And rate them.    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- rate every single one of them.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If we started -- if nobody had ever    16           put Shakespeare into this -- ever at all put it into the    17           system and somebody, a third party or somebody else went    18           through Shakespeare before they did this and began to rate    19           Shakespeare plays, is there some feasible method where    20           anybody, any library that then have Shakespeare could absorb    21           that rating?  Or if Judge Dalzell, who has a younger person,    22           unlike mine, who can read anything, but would he be able to    23           find some mechanism whether she or he, I don't know, looked    24           at Shakespeare, wherever it might be?    25                    THE WITNESS:  There's two aspects to that and                                                                            64     1           actually something I should clarify.  On the Harvard College     2           Library this is the library card catalogue, not the materials     3           itself, there are other libraries with materials itself on     4           line.  For example, I was researching for a column that I do     5           and I was looking up Flatland, which is a -- some of you may     6           have read that, it's from the late 1800's, it's about a world     7           of two dimensions --     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I read it in geometry.     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, well, you should read it at least    10           there.  And I wanted to look at it, because I was going to do    11           a column which happened to be based on that.  So, I did a Web    12           search and I came up with a site where the text for that book    13           was on line, and I went on off and I read it.  And this was a    14           library which provided this, it's one of the university    15           libraries, I forget which one, where that material was on    16           line.  And I think the questions you were asking are more    17           related to places where the material is on line --    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Exactly.    19                    THE WITNESS:  -- rather than the Harvard University    20           catalogue, which is just saying, well, the rap songs are    21           available by going to the stacks and looking in Bin 3.  So,    22           in the areas where the material is on line that's a much more    23           complex issue, that -- certainly the Harvard -- I don't think    24           the Harvard catalogue, the catalogue per se would be ever    25           considered verboten, but certainly some of the items within                                                                            65     1           that the catalogue references could be.  There is a mechanism     2           where one in theory could do this.  A lot of college     3           libraries, a lot of libraries in generally actually use     4           external sources when they create their card catalogue, they     5           send a list of titles to a commercial firm which has expanded     6           information about titles.  So, you send -- you say I've got     7           Shakespeare's Hamlet and Edition 14, give a little bit more     8           information, they return to you the information block, which     9           includes the key words for use in searches and all of the    10           other information that you might want for your on-line    11           reference to this document, rather than you having to enter    12           all of this -- the individual university library having to    13           enter all of this information they go off to this third    14           party.  And in theory that third party, if the rating has --    15           if a rating has been done that third party could include that    16           rating in that block of information that they return when the    17           university or other library says tell me about Shakespeare's    18           Hamlet, 1912 Edition from whatever.    19           BY MR. BARON:      20           Q   Well, I'd like you to return, however, to the methodology    21           that I pointed you to in Defendant's Exhibit 15, which is    22           that one of the methodologies in PICS, is it not, to -- that    23           the content creator, the content provider embed the tag in    24           their document rather than a third-party rating organization,    25           correct?                                                                            66     1           A   As I said before, that is a feasible and reasonable thing     2           to do for some document, it is not possible for others; it is     3           not possible for binary files, for executables, for example,     4           you can't embed something in there because it would destroy     5           the integrity of the file itself --     6           Q   All right, but for --     7           A   -- it would make the file itself useless.     8           Q   But for the Web pages that represent, for example, the     9           Stop Prisoner Rape Web page, that doesn't have a binary or an    10           executable file, so far as you know?    11           A   As far as I know.  It could put at the top of the page --    12            embed in the HTML a coding, that is correct.    13           Q   It is also technically feasible to tag a portion of a Web    14           site, correct?    15           A   There is no -- in the Web there is nothing which -- there    16           is no structure which says this is a portion of a site and    17           this is not.  Going back to your question earlier about the    18           URL that was at the bottom of the page, I made the point of    19           saying that this was a pointer to a file some place on some    20           server, there is nothing to say that this is structurally on    21           this server or any other server.  So that if you are -- if    22           all of the access to some subsection of your disk is through    23           a particular home page and there are no URL's that exist any    24           place else in the world which have a more explicit pointing    25           down inside of a sub-subdirectory then, yes, if you put some                                                                            67     1           kind of labeling on the home page, on the first page of this     2           sub-tree you could imply something about the rest of the     3           tree.  But that would only be making, again, the assumption     4           that nobody had a URL which pointed further down into that     5           tree, if they did they would never even look at that page,     6           they would go directly to the more specific document.     7           Q   Well, I'm at a point where I think it's reasonable to     8           read a portion of your deposition last Friday and see if we     9           can seek clarification here, I'm at Page 222.  Let me read    10           into the record --    11                    MR. BARON:  -- and, with the Courts' indulgence, I    12           think it would be appropriate to show the witness the    13           deposition.    14                    (Pause.)    15           BY MR. BARON:      16           Q   I'm at Page 222 and around Line 17.    17                    MR. BARON:  If the Court wishes, I have copies of    18           some format of the deposition, but I do intend to read a few    19           sentences here.    20           BY MR. BARON:      21           Q   You're answering me and you say, the witness, this is at    22           222, Line 17:  "I could make a label and I could see that    23           most people could make a label and what, for a lack of a    24           better term, home page for the site which in some way    25           characterized the contents of the site and do that quite                                                                            68     1           economically, yes.  It gets a little more complicated, the     2           site is like a library site that are flat laying on board,     3           where the characterizations of the contents vary on a per-     4           file basis."     5                    Going down to Line 8:  "Certainly on my site it     6           would be trivial for me to do, once I got the software and     7           got everything else and got a sample page to put up it would     8           probably take me five minutes to do that after I got all of     9           the crap in line, a technical term."     10                    Moving on to Line 14:  "And so, yes, it would be    11           economically feasible if indeed somebody" --    12                    MR. MORRIS:  Your Honor, I would just ask that Mr.    13           Baron read the entire page, he is leaving out some important    14           points that -- and place the --    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you can get that --    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you get cross-examination and    17           the witness has got the entire testimony in front of him.    18                    MR. MORRIS:  Okay, that's fine.    19           BY MR. BARON:      20           Q   Continuing at Line 14:  "And so, yes, it would be    21           economically feasible if indeed somebody were to distribute a    22           sample.  Everything below here is fine file, putting that    23           into my environment would be actually quite easy to do."  Is    24           that still your testimony, Mr. Bradner?    25           A   Yes, and that -- and that's absolutely true and I think                                                                            69     1           that's what I just said.  But it makes one assumption, which     2           I did not state when we talked last week which I did just     3           state, which is it makes the assumption that anybody     4           referencing my site would only have a reference to my, quote,     5           "home page," rather than a more explicitly reference to some     6           subsection point, which actually in my particular case I know     7           is not true.  In my particular case some individual vendors     8           of equipment provide URL's pointing to their results, which     9           point down inside of my site, bypassing my home page and they    10           are saying, go and look at this file, which is underneath    11           this directory, underneath this directory, underneath this    12           directory, and go look at the results there.  So, yes it is    13           true that I could modify a -- put in a home page, but that is    14           only effective if people look at -- are actually stopping at    15           the home page on the way to what they're looking for and that    16           may or may not be true.    17           Q   The concept of coming up with some form of a standard way    18           to tag or label a warning sign is perfectly reasonable,    19           correct?    20           A   Yes.    21           Q   And it's technically possible, correct?    22           A   Yes.    23           Q   Assuming that there was software or browsers in the    24           marketplace that could read the tag or label in HTML source    25           code that Web site would be blocked, correct?                                                                            70     1           A   Again, it would be blocked if indeed that particular Web     2           page was one that the browser referenced on its way to the     3           document that it was seeking.  In my case, I included in my     4           news column a URL for Flatland and that URL specified the     5           file which is Flatland's home page, not the file which is the     6           home page of the library system itself.  So, if I -- if     7           somebody used the URL that I provided in the column they     8           would bypass any home page of the entire site and would go     9           directly to the Flatland file and would not see any tags that    10           happen to a site-wide tag, because their browser would never    11           read that page.    12           Q   You stated in your supplemental declaration filed on    13           Tuesday at Paragraph 79 that, quote, "To my knowledge no    14           Internet access software or Worldwide Web browsers are    15           currently configurable to block material with such tags."  Do    16           you recall that statement?    17           A   Yes, I do.    18           Q   You stated in the deposition that, however, the Netscape    19           owns the lion's share of the browser market, around 80    20           percent of the market, correct?    21           A   I think I stated that Netscape has stated that they own    22           80 percent of the market.    23                    (Laughter.)    24           Q   Last Friday --    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And they're not under oath.                                                                            71     1                    (Laughter.)     2           BY MR. BARON:       3           Q   Last Friday at your deposition I asked you specifically     4           how difficult would it be for Netscape to tweak its browser     5           to understand a tag or a label embedded in a header in HTML     6           that said adult, was in fact a site that was adult, and you     7           responded that, quote, "I certainly don't think it would be     8           an inordinate burden to do something of that form."  You     9           stand by that statement?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   You also agreed as a matter of technical feasibility that    12           Microsoft could do the same, correct?    13           A   Yes.    14           Q   And programs could be changed at AOL, Compuserve and    15           Prodigy to do the same, correct?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   And Surf Watch and Cyber Patrol and the world of that --    18           of parental control software, they could change their    19           software programs to pick up the tags or labels, correct?    20           A   They can pick -- they can -- software can be changed to    21           pick up the labels whenever they examine a page that has    22           labels in it.    23           Q   Okay, we're going to leave tags and labels.  Let's turn    24           to directories and registers in cyberspace, particularly on    25           the Web.  You recall at your deposition that I asked you                                                                            72     1           whether you agreed with the statement that many people     2           believe there should be a white pages directory for the     3           Internet and you at least conceded that many people do     4           believe that, correct?     5           A   Yes, that's correct, I conceded that.     6           Q   Even if a comprehensive index to the net is impractical     7           in some sense you surely agree, do you not, Mr. Bradner, that     8           a white pages subset of cyberspace is technically feasible,     9           correct?    10           A   It's more than technically feasible, there are a number    11           of organizations claiming they are providing just such a    12           thing.    13           Q   In fact aren't there, as you said, many neutral places or    14           sites that exist where URL's can be picked up in a kind of    15           index or directory, correct?    16           A   Neutral and non-neutral, yes.    17           Q   Indeed, you told me last Friday that a URL is a URL is a    18           URL and that no technical issues are involved in creating    19           pages which list URL's, correct?    20           A   That is correct.  That actually is the point I was making    21           earlier, that if there is a URL pointing to a -- pointing to    22           the Harvard College Library that -- and we're making the    23           assumption that we're controlling access by putting PICS-type    24           tagging in the URL's, it's wherever that URL exists, whether    25           it's on Harvard-owned machines or anybody else's machine,                                                                            73     1           which is where that labeling would have to be done.  And if     2           there is 10,000 places around the world which have URL's     3           pointing to Harvard, all of those 10,000 places would have to     4           rate -- would include the ratings for Harvard in their URL's,     5           it would not be under Harvard's control to make them do such     6           a thing.     7           Q   Aside from indexes or directories, if you have content --     8            if you are a content provider and you have content you wish     9           to restrict, for whatever reason, you could call Surf Watch    10           or other parental-control products to let them know about    11           your site in cyberspace, correct?    12           A   We had a long discussion of this last Friday and the    13           clear statement is yes, of course, I could call Surf Watch    14           and do so, but Surf Watch would have very little way of    15           knowing whether I had the authority to make a statement about    16           a particular site, they would have to have some ability to    17           resolve that this person had some relationship to the site    18           that was being spoken of.  So, if I'm a do-gooder and wanted    19           to talk about some other site I may or may not have the    20           authority or maybe I'm just trying to be mean to somebody or    21           they are a competitor of mine, Surf Watch would have to go    22           through some mechanism to insure that I had the right to    23           speak of that site.  So, in a true literal sense, sure, I    24           could call up Surf Watch and say the Reuter (ph.) vendors    25           think that the information about their products on my site is                                                                            74     1           dirty because it paints them in a bad light and you should     2           block that, I could do that, but I would suspect Surf Watch     3           would be a little curious as to why -- whether I had the     4           right to do that.     5           Q   Well, I'm concentrating on the good-faith actions of     6           content providers and you have conceded that they could     7           certainly call Surf Watch -- you can E-mail Surf Watch,     8           right?     9           A   I don't know their E-mail address, but I assume that    10           they're on the net --    11           Q   You could fax --    12           A   -- it would be silly if they were not.    13           Q   You could fax Surf Watch?    14           A   Again, I don't know their fax number, but I assume you    15           can.    16           Q   You could hyperlink Surf Watch from your site, correct?    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What would this -- let's get back    18           to the question and what would it say, if you faxed Surf    19           Watch what is your question, so we can --    20                    MR. BARON:  The question is whether a content    21           provider could take an affirmative action if they had a site    22           that they wished to block because of whatever reason, for    23           example, that it was not appropriate for minors, and they    24           wanted to inform the parental control software companies that    25           are out there, and Surf Watch is my example, could they take                                                                            75     1           an easy, simple action to E-mail, fax, telephone or hyperlink     2           that parental control software company to let them know that     3           the site in cyberspace exists, that's what these questions     4           are.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And your answer is yes?     6                    THE WITNESS:  Except for the last one, hyperlink,     7           I'm not sure what he means by that.     8           BY MR. BARON:       9           Q   You can just put a click on a Web site and click it to    10           the Surf Watch and they would -- it would be a link to them.    11           A   That would bring up Surf Watch's home page, I'm not sure    12           what that would gain us.    13           Q   All right.  Well, putting that aside, wouldn't doing any    14           of these affirmative actions cure the reliability problems    15           that you yourself have stated with respect to Surf Watch?    16           A   the reliability problems I believe that you're referring    17           to are where I said that there was a window of vulnerability,    18           if a primary method by which one of these blockers is working    19           is that you have a list of sites which is distributed at some    20           periodicity to update the local copy of the browser, there is    21           a window between the time that a site comes on line and the    22           time the site is discovered and the time that this update    23           occurs, there's a window of vulnerability wherein Surf Watch    24           wouldn't block a site that it otherwise would.  And if indeed    25           there were some reliable methodology for getting a message to                                                                            76     1           Surf Watch indicating that this site is a funny site, and I'm     2           in control of this site and I tell you it's a funny site and     3           Surf Watch can verify that it's me and all that kind of     4           thing, then sure, this would allow the window of     5           vulnerability to be zero.     6           Q   Let me just, because this is such an important point,     7           read you what you said last Friday in your deposition and     8           whether you would still agree, it's on Page 165, Line 10:  "I     9           feel that there is some reliability problems in terms of    10           using an exclusion list," that's with respect to parental    11           control software, "keeping that exclusion list up to date is    12           the biggest issue.  Until the exclusion systems that I have    13           seen are updated on a weekly or a monthly basis for their    14           exclusion lists, and new sites are being generated all the    15           time, and between the time when a new site is generated and    16           the time the exclusion list update comes in there is a period    17           of vulnerability," that's the period you're speaking to    18           today, correct?    19           A   Yes.    20           Q   Okay.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But the technical feasibility is    22           there?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the only question is, I gather,    25           the --                                                                            77     1                    MR. BARON:  The lag time.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- comprehensiveness of it?     3                    MR. BARON:  That's correct, your Honor.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, and the desire.     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And the what?     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the desire.  I mean, many of the     7           plaintiffs in this case who some reasonable people might     8           think are purveying, we'll use the motion picture parlance,     9           NC-17 say we're not doing that at all, we're giving safe sex    10           information, okay?  Now, in the questions you're asking    11           should they advise Mrs. Duvall we're NC-17 even though they    12           don't think they should?    13                    MR. BARON:  I am establishing through this --    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that what you're getting at?    15                    MR. BARON:  Your Honor, that's a different legal    16           issue and it is, I would submit, a legal issue.  I am asking    17           questions to the witness about a technical issue on the safe    18           harbor provisions.    19                    THE COURT:  Okay, fine.    20           BY MR. BARON:      21           Q   Let's turn to another area of cyberspace and I regret    22           that there's a whole new terminology associated with it --    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, you'll go slow.    24                    (Laughter.)    25           BY MR. COGAN:                                                                              78     1           Q   UseNet, what is it?     2           A   I won't go into the history that I did when we talked     3           last Friday, suffice it to say, it's a outgrowth of a     4           distributed bulletin board system that started with computers     5           calling each other up over the telephone and has migrated to     6           providing the communication over the Internet.  There's a few     7           hundred thousand UseNet servers, they're just computers     8           around the world running UseNet server software.  They     9           receive news group articles, which are just messages like E-    10           mail messages, there's a characterization of a news group at    11           the top of the article.  News group articles are    12           hierarchically organized, so it's -- one that I happen to    13           read is rec.autos.sport.F1, because I happen to be a Formula    14           One car racing fan, and so this is articles about car racing,    15           about Formula One car racing, and it's put into a separate    16           directory on the server.  And then as I as a client can -- I    17           as an observer can fire up a news client, which would then go    18           off and I could tell it I want it to look at this subset, and    19           it would show me the articles in the Formula One subsection.    20           Q   Okay, thank you.  And what is known as NNTP?    21           A   Network News Transfer Protocol is the language which is    22           used for the UseNet servers to talk to each other over the    23           network itself, it's a handshaking mechanism by which a    24           server tells another server I've got Article Number 1234 from    25           Site 7, do you want it, and the other server can say yes or                                                                            79     1           no.     2           Q   And what are ISP's?     3           A   Jumping around in technology a little bit here.  ISP is     4           the term that was actually coined by the National Science     5           Foundation, it refers to Internet Service Provider, it's a     6           company or an organization which is providing connectivity,     7           Internet connectivity.  It may or may not also include     8           services such as news services or time services or E-mail     9           forwarding or things that, but the fundamental service that    10           it's offering is connectivity, the ability for Internet    11           protocol packets to get from your local network to out into    12           the Internet to -- theoretically to some other local network    13           some place else.    14           Q   Are there approximately 15,000 global UseNet news groups?    15           A   There are somewhere -- there is actually probably    16           considerably more than that news groups, as far as global    17           news groups, it's a very hard number to determine because it    18           depends on one's definition.  I ran the news server at    19           Harvard for a long time and I was getting Japanese news    20           groups.  Now, I would have stopped them except there were    21           some people at Harvard who wanted to read the Japanese news    22           groups, they were in transcribed Japanese, which I couldn't    23           read at all, it looked like encrypted text to me.  So, there    24           -- it's hard to define.  I would say that because I was    25           getting those in Boston and they were being generated in                                                                            80     1           Tokyo those are global news groups.  If we're using that kind     2           of definition there are at least that and probably more, but     3           I don't know for sure.     4           Q   Would you say there are approximately 100,000 articles     5           posted today?     6           A   That's a reasonable estimate for the ones which go out on     7           the -- in that set of, quote, "global news groups."     8           Q   Now, this is a simple question, but how do you post an     9           article on UseNet?    10           A   You compose a message, textural message usually on your    11           UseNet client, which many of the browsers now include, and    12           you say -- you tell that client which list of news groups you    13           wish to post it to.  The client then contacts the local    14           server and says here is an article for news group    15           rec.sport.autos.F1, and then hands it off to the server.    16           Q   Is there any difference with moderated news groups in    17           terms of how an article is posted to UseNet?    18           A   There is no difference on how it's posted, what happens    19           after it's posted is different.  In an unmoderated news group    20           when I do that posting to rec.autos -- rec.auto.sport.F1 my    21           server would then automatically distribute it to all other    22           servers which it had a communication with, which is at    23           Harvard there may be a dozen different servers that it    24           interacts with, so there would be about a dozen different    25           computers it would send off this article to.  And they would                                                                            81     1           then propagate across the world, servers talking to their     2           adjacent servers, just distributing it in an ad hoc     3           interconnection mode, nobody controls that.  In a moderated     4           news group the posting would then go to my local server and     5           then on that server it looks up and says, oh, this is a     6           moderated news group, there is a list of moderators which is     7           maintained on a few dozen sites which allow -- which would     8           support the service of providing this forwarding list.  My     9           server doesn't maintain one now, I used to but I'm no longer    10           in charge of that server, so I don't do this anymore.  But    11           the server that I would deal with would then look at it and    12           say it's a moderated news group, I need to send it off to a    13           server which contains a list of moderators, so it sends it    14           off to one of these sites around the country -- around the    15           world which contain the list.  It would then go -- that site     16           would then go through the list, forward this posting, which    17           is really a textural message in my case, off to the    18           moderator, which would then do whatever the moderator wanted    19           to, including just automatically forward it into the news    20           group or put it in their in box and read it, doing whatever    21           the moderator wants to do and that would depend on the    22           moderator, there is no set set of procedures or rules or    23           software to support moderator functions.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When I read your direct testimony I    25           wondered about this, when you say a moderator you mean a two-                                                                            82     1           legged, regular person?     2                    (Laughter.)     3                    THE WITNESS:  Anybody --     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  To wit, a human.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.     6                    THE WITNESS:  Anybody who is willing to sit through,     7           in the case of rec.autos.F1 it's now two or 300 messages a     8           day, anybody who is willing to sit through two or 300     9           messages a day to decide whether they should be out I    10           wouldn't necessarily call a regular person, but --    11                    (Laughter.)    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess I asked for that.  Who pays    13           these people?    14                    THE WITNESS:  These are -- almost all of these are    15           voluntary efforts.  There may be -- there are moderated news    16           groups which are provided by corporations.  For example, a    17           company building some product may have a moderated news group    18           which speaks -- talks about that product as a subset of the    19           news group hierarchy which is specifically for business and    20           it's a bus., dot, company name, dot, product, and they --    21           those companies may pay a moderator to cut out redundancies    22           or to answer the questions that show up in the mailing,    23           whatever they want to do.  But the vast majority of the    24           moderators are volunteers.  And there are quite a few    25           moderated news groups, but the busy ones tend not to be                                                                            83     1           because it's just too much of an effort for a volunteer to     2           do.     3           BY MR. BARON:       4           Q   But to summarize here, the moderator's role is to decide     5           what messages are forwarded to the news group, correct?     6           A   That is correct.     7           Q   Could you describe the term hierarchy as it applies to     8           the UseNet groups?     9           A   Hierarchy is just as the -- what I said, that the Formula    10           One news group is in rec.autos.sport.F1.  Rec. is a    11           subsection of the news groups which are for recreation, autos    12           is a subgroup of the recreational, which is dealing with    13           autos; there's also sky diving and things like that in that    14           same recreational.  Within autos there's people who want    15           sports, which is what I'm interested in, but there's also    16           folks who do restorations of antique cars and there's a    17           subgroup for them.  And then within the sports category    18           there's half a dozen or so different categories and the one    19           that I happen to be interested in is Formula One.  So, the    20           hierarchy is that listing of -- it's the tree which winds up    21           with a specific pointer to a specific news group.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's a vehicle by which you    23           get to precisely that which you're interested in?    24                    THE WITNESS:  That is in theory the case.  In    25           practice people are a little less discriminate in what they                                                                            84     1           post to news groups than perhaps they should be, but the aim     2           is to make it so that the subgroup -- the news group is as     3           closely focused on the topic you're interested in as     4           possible.  When I first started out doing this news group     5           stuff it was -- rec.autos was the division and in rec.autos     6           there may be two dozen messages a day.  And then when that     7           built up so that the volume was high they broke it up into      8           -- under autos they put sport and restoration and et cetera     9           to further subdivide it, in order to try and make it more and    10           more focused.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But the reliability is dependent    12           upon whoever is labeling it -- I'm not sure that's the right    13           word in --    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Posting it.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Posting it, thank you.    16                    THE WITNESS:  Posting.  Whoever puts down on their    17           browser, when they say post it they write down what news    18           group it should group -- news group or news groups it should    19           go into and it's entirely dependent on that person making the    20           correct choice, that is correct.    21           BY MR. BARON:      22           Q   So, let me just try to recap that.  You said that some    23           individuals might post indiscriminately to news groups that    24           are sort of off-topic, but the point is that the individual    25           poster controls where he or she will post the article to                                                                            85     1           whatever the UseNet group is of the 15,000 --     2           A   That's correct.     3           Q   -- and all of the hierarchies therein?     4                    We discussed the K-12 hierarchy in our -- last     5           Friday, could you just tell the Court what a K-12 hierarchy     6           is?     7           A   I know about the K-12 hierarchy only because they started     8           -- they started it up at a time when I was running the     9           Harvard news server, it's a sub-hierarchy that's specifically    10           designed for people in the kindergarten through 12th grade    11           with specific classes or specific topics.  K-12, dot, one was    12           for the first grade and they had topics relevant either to    13           teachers or to students within first grade.    14           Q   Could you describe for the Court what the difference    15           between the alt. hierarchy and the other hierarchy is?    16           A   Alt. hierarchy is the one which is, let's say, more --    17           more traditional in the Internet sense of chaos.  The other    18           hierarchies, the rec. hierarchy, the science hierarchy, the -    19           - there's a few dozen, K-12 hierarchy, et cetera, are    20           hierarchies where there is an agreement amongst the people    21           running the servers, on the main servers that they will have    22           a controlled method for creating new news groups.  And the    23           controlled method is that somebody proposes a news group to a    24           particular news group, which is about discussing proposing    25           new news groups, and it's discussed on there and if there's                                                                            86     1           enough support indicated by E-mail to the proposer that this     2           particular news group should exist then the proposer can put     3           in a news group creation request, which will then propagate     4           across the net.  One of the things that happens is there is a     5           few places which maintain lists of, quote, "legitimate news     6           groups" within different hierarchies and these lists are     7           periodically posted to UseNet, to the UseNet as another     8           article.  The UseNet software can be configured to     9           automatically review that list of legitimate news groups and    10           delete any non-legitimate news groups, any news groups which    11           do not appear in this list.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What would be a non-legitimate news    13           group then, just because it doesn't appear?    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's considered irrelevant?    15                    THE WITNESS:  It's -- the structure is that, let's    16           say, I wanted to create a news group on rec.auto.sport.F2,    17           which is Formula Two.  Well, there doesn't happen to be a lot    18           of Formula Two activity these days.  And after some    19           discussion on the group -- on the new group list it was    20           determined there isn't much support for that, and I go create    21           it anyway, then the maintainer of the official list would    22           say, well, that didn't get enough support, it didn't go    23           through the right process to get that news group created, so    24           that's an illegitimate news group, so I won't put it on the    25           check list that goes out periodically.  So then automatically                                                                            87     1           when this check list goes out, some sites have set it up to     2           automatically delete those unapproved news groups, others     3           send mail to the news group operator or whatever.  Alt. news     4           groups do not have somebody who is maintaining that list of,     5           quote, "legitimate," which means that news group are created     6           ad hoc-ly by anybody, literally anybody in the hierarchy.      7           So, there is a news group that's alt., dot, Swedish, dot, f,     8           dot, borg, dot, borg, dot, borg, dot, borg, which I kept     9           trying to remove, but it kept coming back.  But there's    10           nobody making any kind of check as to what -- any kind of    11           list of what is a legitimate one.  So, the alt. hierarchy is    12           the old chaos of the Internet, free-will kind of hierarchy.    13                    MR. BARON:  It might be helpful to look at an    14           exhibit, if you would turn to Defendant's Exhibit 10 and see    15           what we're talking about in terms of the alt. hierarchy.    16           BY MR. BARON:      17           Q   I concentrate on the last two pages of this exhibit.  The    18           exhibit is from something called the Internet Yellow Pages,    19           Second Edition; you've seen that book, haven't you, Mr.    20           Bradner?    21           A   You showed me this same thing last week and I have seen    22           earlier editions of this publication.    23           Q   Would it be fair to say that within the alt. hierarchy    24           there's an alt. binaries sub-hierarchy?    25           A   That's one of many in the alt. hierarchy, yes.                                                                            88     1           Q   And there's an alt. sex sub-hierarchy     2           A   That's correct?     3           Q   Any particular ISP can decide whether to include the alt.     4           sex hierarchy or the alt. binaries hierarchy, correct?     5           A   This was a question that you asked me last week and I     6           maintained that you were using the term ISP incorrectly in     7           this context.  Any operator of a news server can determine     8           what news groups that that news server will and will not     9           maintain -- will and will not accept, and will and will not    10           maintain.  Some ISP's run news servers, some ISP's do not run    11           news servers.  So, to say that an ISP does this is an    12           incorrect characterization, a news server operator can make    13           that choice.    14           Q   Okay.  Could you tell the Court what binary files are?    15           A   Binary is the computer jargon for a bit pattern which is    16           used to represent any one of a number of things, for example    17           an executable program, if you want a new helper AP, a new    18           thing which draws pretty pictures on your screen when the    19           screen is supposed to be idle, a screen saver, there are    20           binary programs available to do that, you download them.  In    21           actuality UseNet only transmits printing characters, so in    22           order to deal with the binary nature, the nature of non-    23           printing characters, because the actual executables in the    24           computer are stored in a eight-bit bit pattern which turns    25           into gibberish when you try and print it, they actually                                                                            89     1           translate each eight-bit character into two printing     2           characters and then retranslate it back into -- you can     3           retranslate it back into a printing -- into a binary pattern     4           at your local site, on your local client.     5           Q   Just to be clear, can binary files include graphical     6           image files, and I'm using that in the lower-case sense of     7           the term?     8           A   Binary files can be, as you pointed out before when you     9           were talking about URL's, they can include graphics files,    10           motion pictures, sound, program -- pieces of program, sub-    11           routines, but it can be -- you can get your voice mail via E-    12           mail by including it in a binary file.    13           Q   Individuals can post binary files to any UseNet news    14           group, correct?    15           A   In -- anybody can post --    16           Q   Other than moderated groups, I don't mean it to be a    17           trick question, I'm sorry.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean you'll let him know when    19           you do?    20                    MR. BARON:  Right.    21                    (Laughter.)    22                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I was going to catch you on that    23           anyway.  Anybody can post any file to any news group; if it    24           is moderated, the moderator can control what goes in there.     25           All files look the same, because they -- as long as they have                                                                            90     1           the formatted point at the top, the formatted text at the top     2           indicating a news group name and an article I.D., then     3           they're in the correct format and the news servers know how     4           to deal with them.  The contents after that just look like     5           printing characters, some of which are -- have sense to them     6           and some of them don't, the ones that are binary tend not to.      7           But so do the ones, for example, that are slightly distorted     8           in order to make them not easily -- not trivially readable     9           because it's, I don't know, a dirty joke or something, they    10           have a very simple encrypting mechanism called Rot 13 or    11           Rotate 13, it comes from one of the ciphers that Caesar used,    12           as I recall.  You just substitute its -- you take every    13           letter in the alphabet and take the 13th one in a round trip    14           -- or further along in the alphabet.  And, so, that looks    15           like gibberish too, but in actuality it's a one-character-    16           per-one-character substitution.    17           Q   But it's an encryption scheme?    18           A   It's an encryption scheme.    19           Q   Let me -- forgive me if I'm being redundant, but you can    20           also post graphical image files to any UseNet group, correct?    21           A   I think I just said that.    22           Q   Okay.  Therefore, one makes a conscious choice when you    23           post graphical image files or binary files whether you're    24           going to post them to the alt. sex hierarchy, the alt.    25           binaries hierarchy or any other place on UseNet, correct?                                                                            91     1           A   Just as one makes a choice when posting any article.     2           Q   Okay, thank you.       3                    May we turn to Defendant's Exhibit 12?     4                    (Pause.)     5           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit on Friday?     6           A   Yes.     7           Q   Could you best characterize this, maybe you can do it     8           better than I as to what this sort of artificial construct     9           represents in terms of header information in UseNet?    10           A   It represents the basic UseNet header, which is present    11           on all UseNet news messages -- articles, plus some things    12           which are not in the basic.  The ones labeled "mime version"    13           and "content type" and "content transferring coding" and "X    14           mailer" are ones which are not part of the basic set that's    15           part of UseNet, it's the UseNet format itself.  The others,    16           the path is the sequence of computers that this article went    17           through, and that path can be 30 or 40 or 50 computers long;    18           the from is the stated name and E-mail address of the source    19           of the message; the news groups is the list of news groups    20           that the message was for; the date is the date; organization    21           is the stated organization of the poster; the message I.D. is    22           an important thing, because it is what is used to    23           undifferentiate two messages which otherwise may look the    24           same and make sure that messages don't loop around in the    25           network forever, a data base is maintained of message I.D.'s                                                                            92     1           which is relative to -- the message I.D. includes the source     2           post's name, so Message 13 from this host is not repetitively     3           posted to the news group accidentally.  And the NNTP posting     4           host is also not part of the original basic code, it's     5           something that was added when NNTP came into play.     6           Q   Can we just hold that as a place holder here and explain     7           for the Court what a news reader is?     8           A   A news reader is a piece of client software that -- in     9           current environment most of them go off and speak NNTP to a    10           news server, a UseNet server.    11           Q   Am I correct that some news readers are embedded in    12           browsers?    13           A   Yes.    14           Q   And some news readers have the ability to do what you    15           term threading, i.e. they follow articles based on the    16           subject line of the posting, correct?    17           A   That's correct.    18           Q   Back to this exhibit, in theory an enhanced protocol for    19           UseNet could include an extra line which essentially embeds    20           content information, correct?    21           A   Yes.    22           Q   Thank you.    23                    Let me turn more quickly to other applications on    24           the Internet.  You have described IRC, could you explain for    25           the Court what Internet Relay Chat is?                                                                            93     1           A   Internet Relay Chat is a way by which if I type on my     2           keyboard it can appear on the screens of many people around     3           the world simultaneously, and when they type on their     4           keyboards it appears on my screen and other screens.     5           Q   I just have one question for you, Mr. Bradner:  There are     6           moderators or channel operators on IRC, correct?     7           A   In some cases there are, in other cases there are not.     8           Q   And those are human moderators, human channel operators,     9           correct?    10           A   The only ones that I know of are.    11           Q   Okay.    12           A   Some I have question about, but...    13                    (Laughter.)    14           Q   All right, let's move to List Serves, could you explain    15           briefly for the Court what they are?    16           A   List Serve is a -- actually a product name, it would be    17           better to refer to it as an E-mail exploder.  You send E-mail    18           to a piece of software which then re-sends this piece of E-    19           mail to a list of recipients, that list can be quite    20           extensive.  The ones I run on my local machine, I have an E-    21           mail exploder for one of the IETF working groups, it has two    22           or 300 -- maybe it's 180 now, I pruned it a little recently,    23           different addresses that I have -- any message sent to that    24           address, BMWG at Harvard, dot, EDU will be in turn forwarded    25           to this list of addresses.  List Serve is a particular                                                                            94     1           product that implements this kind of E-mail exploder.  It has     2           some fancy features because it can deal with -- it can talk     3           with other List Serves over the network and some con --     4           regulation of what's -- which -- who -- which exploder has     5           which addresses to forward to.  But basically what you really     6           mean is an E-mail exploder.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, once again, it's a vehicle by     8           which one expands the recipients without the sender -- or the     9           source necessarily knowing where it's going?    10                    THE WITNESS:  Specifically that is the case.    11           BY MR. BARON:      12           Q   I just have one question, Mr. Bradner:  There are    13           moderators on List Serves or E-mail exploders, correct?    14           A   I would say on the majority of them there are not.    15           Q   But there are some?    16           A   There are some.  I actually currently, personally do not    17           deal with any E-mail exploders that do happen to have    18           moderators, all of the ones that I deal with are ones where I    19           send mail to the exploder itself and it just forwards it.  A    20           moderator, I would send the mail to the moderator and then    21           the moderator would in turn send it to the exploder list.  I    22           don't happen to deal with any, I know that some exist.  All    23           of the ones in the IETF, for example, for all of the working    24           groups are unmoderated.    25           Q   Let's turn to E-mail and I just have one question:  It's                                                                            95     1           true, is it not, that some E-mail user agents allow you to     2           separate out the mail based on the source of the message, the     3           subject line of the message or a combination of those,     4           correct?     5           A   That is correct.     6           Q   Have you heard of Eudora?     7           A   Yes, I have.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's that?     9                    MR. BARON:  Eudora.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As in wealthy?    11                    (Laughter.)    12           BY MR. BARON:      13           Q   You have an extensive background in FTP, file transfer    14           protocol, correct?    15           A   I'm not sure that it's an honor to say that, but, yes.    16           Q   You told me that last Friday.  Conceptually, it is    17           possible to block access to an FTP site, is it not, on an a    18           priori basis by means of a password, correct?    19           A   Yes, if FTP is a way that I can sit at a client and ask    20           to access to a server, an FTP server, and there are two ways    21           to do that:  One is what is called anonymous FTP, by which I    22           give the log name anonymous when asked for my log name, my    23           user name, and then I give my name as a password just to    24           indicate for tracing purposes who I am, but of course that    25           depends on who I say I am.  This is the way that a huge                                                                            96     1           percentage of the large data files, including for example the     2           version of Flatland that I referred to earlier and all of the     3           material on my machine are provided, they're provided by FTP.      4           There is an alternate way, which is if I don't want to     5           provide general access to some files then I can -- I can     6           restrict that access to a password -- a user name and     7           password protected, just as I restrict access to my local     8           computer to people with -- that I have given accounts on the     9           local computer to.    10           Q   The FTP protocol was standardized through the IETF RFC    11           process, correct?    12           A   It was standardized very, very early, I wouldn't say that    13           it was -- it was standardized early on, so I'm not sure that    14           you could characterize it as going -- it definitely didn't go    15           through the proposed and draft and full standard kind of    16           process, it was one of the very first protocols on the    17           Internet a long time ago.  So, it way predates my    18           involvement, so I couldn't speak with expertise on exactly    19           how it was standardized, but my guess is some people got --    20           sat down and said this is the way we're going to do it and,    21           bingo, that's the way it was going to get done.    22           Q   Now, let me switch gears here.  You told me last Friday    23           that at Harvard there are many individuals who download to    24           older versions of Netscape browsers for free, correct?    25           A   They download the version that is free.                                                                            97     1           Q   Okay.  You stated last Friday in your deposition that the     2           Internet is, quote, "becoming pervasive," unquote, do you     3           stand by that statement?     4           A   And by pervasive I mean omnipresent, it is available     5           anyplace.  I can call from my hotel room, which I did this     6           morning, and log in to read my E-mail.  Soon I will be able     7           to plug into a jack in the wall and identify myself and have     8           Internet connectivity in the hotel room.  So, it is avail --     9           it will be -- it's becoming available wherever I want to go    10           in and plug in and ask -- and identify myself -- connect to    11           my home computer and then identify myself to the home    12           computer with a log name password combination.  And in that    13           con -- the context in which I said pervasive I meant that it    14           was becoming omnipresent, an ability for me to get it    15           wherever I am.    16           Q   The Internet is also changing, correct?    17           A   Oh, at least.    18           Q   You recall that I asked you a visionary question last    19           Friday, correct?    20           A   You asked me to make a speech and I did.    21                    (Laughter.)    22           Q   And I asked you to discuss with me where you saw the    23           Internet going in the 21st Century, right?    24           A   Yes.    25           Q   And you expressed the view that there is not going to be                                                                            98     1           an Internet as we know it today in the year 2000, correct?     2           A   The year 2000 or shortly thereafter, that's correct.     3           Q   Let me quote you from the deposition and ask whether you     4           stand by this statement, you said, I'm quoting your speech,     5           "Will there" -- it's Page 312, Line 19 -- Line 18, you said     6           that you were giving a talk.  "Will there be an Internet in     7           the year 2000?"     8                    Line 19:  "My conclusion is that in the year 2000 or     9           shortly thereafter there will not be an Internet and by that    10           I mean the Internet of today, that which people see and    11           understand as the Internet is a differentiable data service.     12           It's something that you see that is different than your    13           television service, it's different than your telephone    14           service, it's different than your fax service, it's a    15           different thing than what you have, what you use for doing    16           other functions.  I believe that in the year 2000 or shortly    17           thereafter we will have a unified general data service.  In    18           certain parts of the country already we have had a crossover    19           between the amount of information carried as voice for the    20           voice telephone network and the amount of information carried    21           as data."    22                    And skipping down to Line 20:  "This will become    23           universal in the U.S. within the next half dozen years and    24           there won't be something that you would say that's the    25           Internet."                                                                            99     1                    Do you stand by those statements?     2           A   Yes.     3           Q   Thank you, Mr. Bradner.       4                    MR. BARON:  I have no more questions.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But this unified general data     6           service would act in similar ways that you have described     7           both this morning and in your declaration, would it not?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  And what I meant by saying what     9           I did was that right now you go and you go and buy telephone    10           connection and telephone service from this vendor, and you go    11           and you buy your cable service from that vendor, and you may    12           go buy your electric utility from some other vendor, I    13           predict in the future that you won't be able to differentiate    14           between vendors, you will have a pipe into the house or maybe    15           competition for pipes into the house and you plug this    16           instrument onto it, onto this pipe and you get telephone and    17           you plug this instrument onto the pipe and you get cable T.V.    18           and you plug this instrument onto the pipe and you get    19           whatever is the successor to the Web.  And I believe there's    20           a successor to the Web, I don't know what it is, but I    21           believe that there will be some other way, some additional    22           ways for a user to find things and interact with services    23           around the globe and, in particular, doing that in a way    24           which -- right now a great deal of the Internet is dependent    25           on the voluntary efforts of individuals to provide material                                                                           100     1           and I believe that in the long run that this -- the     2           facilitating of this global, global and ubiquitous data     3           service, one of the facilitating factors would be mechanisms     4           for making it economically reasonable for content providers     5           to provide content.  That -- it's a real mixed bag though, I     6           mean, one of the big things about a universal service like     7           this is that it doesn't get controlled very easily.  So,     8           those environments where governments would like to control     9           content, for example Singapore and China both have announced    10           recently that they are working on figuring out ways to    11           control content that their citizens can get over the net,    12           over the Internet, the current Internet, this is a very big    13           threat to that kind of their perception of what the social    14           order should be.  And I see this -- the Internet of the    15           future being both a combination of a promise of tremendous    16           reachability of availability of knowledge, availability of    17           interaction, people interacting with people, and a threat to    18           -- perceived threat to the ability to control what citizenry    19           get, and that it is the balance between the perception of    20           that threat and the reaction to the perception of that threat    21           and the promise.  I personally would rather focus in on the    22           promise.    23                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.    24                    (Discussion held off the record.)    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thought that we would                                                                           101     1           break now before you begin your redirect, to give you the     2           opportunity to catch your breaths.     3                    MR. MORRIS:  Your Honor, that would be fine.  We     4           have a somewhat unexpected scheduling problem, both the     5           Government and we anticipated that Mr. Bradner's testimony     6           would take a much shorter time than it has now.  Mr.      7           Bradner --      8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We didn't anticipate that.     9                    (Laughter.)    10                    MR. MORRIS:  Mr. Bradner has a very important    11           meeting relating to some international protocols    12           negotiations, he -- in Washington, D.C. late this afternoon.     13           He would absolutely be able to return first thing in the    14           morning and, if it would be acceptable to the Court and the    15           Government, we would suggest that we break for lunch and ask    16           Mr. Bradner to return first thing in the morning.    17                    THE COURT:  Is that congenital to the Government?    18                    MR. BARON:  In theory, your Honor, it would be    19           acceptable, but depending on the length of the questioning,    20           it may be just for a few minutes and therefore it can be    21           done.    22                    THE COURT:  Well, what's your anticipation, Mr.    23           Morris?    24                    MR. MORRIS:  I think we probably would only go for    25           15 or 20 minutes.  I don't know how many questions the Court                                                                           102     1           might have...     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning?     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's fine.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I will have some questions.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right with you?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that all right with you?     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay?    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Even if you come back to lovely    12           Philadelphia just for 15 minutes, you don't mind?    13                    (Laughter.)    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's on the way to Harvard.    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will resume at 1:30.    17                    (Luncheon recess taken at 12:10 o'clock p.m.) Back to Hearing Transcripts index Back to Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition page WT02-B06-9IA095-001027-B017-28http://www.cdt.org:80/ciec/transcripts/Mar_21_Duvall.html 205.177.10.31 19970215013542 text/html 114640HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:34:14 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Testimony of Ann Duvall - 21 Mar 96 Testimony of Ann Duvall, President of Surfwatch March 21, 1996                                                                            102     1           might have...     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning?     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's fine.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I will have some questions.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right with you?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that all right with you?     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay?    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Even if you come back to lovely    12           Philadelphia just for 15 minutes, you don't mind?    13                    (Laughter.)    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's on the way to Harvard.    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will resume at 1:30.    17                    (Luncheon recess taken at 12:10 o'clock p.m.)    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's now time to say good    19           afternoon.    20                    ALL:  Good afternoon.    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Judge Sloviter, my name is Bruce Ennis.     22           I'm counsel for the ALA plaintiffs.  We wish to call as our    23           second witness Ann Duvall, the president of Surfwatch    24           Software, Incorporated.    25                    Before I do that, may I take care of one brief                                                                           103     1           housekeeping matter?  I'd like to move into evidence the     2           plaintiffs' exhibits, which was filed a few days ago, and to     3           which the Government did not object.  That would be the ACLU     4           Exhibit Numbers 1 through 67, and the ALA plaintiff Exhibit     5           Numbers 200 through 289.     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.       8                    MR.

Please be seated.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government concede the    21           expertise of this witness?    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In the area she's proffered for.    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We conceded only in the area that    24           she is proffered for.  I do expect to have some questions    25           with respect to technical issues that would clarify the                                                                           104     1           matter.       2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you.     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honors, at this point, I would move     5           the admission into evidence of the declaration of Ann Duvall,     6           previously filed.  It was sworn to on March 19th of this     7           year, as her trial testimony.     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  It is accepted.      10                    (Whereupon the declaration of Ann Duvall was    11           admitted into evidence.)    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are we on mike?    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  You can hear us, can't you?    14                    ALL:  Yes.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, we can be heard anyway.    16                    MR. ENNIS:  As the Court is aware, Mrs. Duvall is    17           going to demonstrate for the Court some uses of the computer    18           in an interactive computer system.      19                    Briefly, she is going to demonstrate how you can    20           access the Internet and move around in the Internet.  And    21           then she is going to demonstrate how parents can use software    22           technology, which would make it possible for parents to view    23           whatever they want on the Internet, and yet for parents to    24           block or filter material they consider inappropriate for    25           their children.                                                                           105     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  That's at least a thesis on     2           which she's going to testify.     3                    MR. ENNIS:  That's the objective, your Honor.       4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.     5                    MR. ENNIS:  She -- the testimony will take     6           approximately 30 minutes, and I wish to emphasize that     7           because the point of the demonstration is to explain how this     8           works, if there are any questions from the Court at any     9           point, please feel free to interrupt and ask.    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think the Court is not bashful.    11                    (Laughter)    12                    MR. ENNIS:  Thank you, your Honor.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As you may have detected.  Did you    14           want the lights down?    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  Your screens would flicker less if    16           we turn off just the fluorescent lights.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  I think that's about to take    18           place.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, does counsel have -- oh, you    20           have it up there?    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  I don't have a monitor, and I    22           might need at some point, to approach the witness, if that    23           would be acceptable.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it's all right with the witness,    25           it's all right with the Court.                                                                           106     1                    THE WITNESS:  Good afternoon, your Honors.     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good afternoon.     3                    THE WITNESS:  I'd like to take and spend some time     4           with you exploring a little of the Internet, and putting in     5           front of you, something you can see that will perhaps explain     6           some of the very technical explanations that you saw this     7           morning.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Uh-huh.     9                    THE WITNESS:  I'm going to start at a very basic    10           level, so if I'm repeating things that you already know,    11           please forgive me.  But please feel free to ask questions, if    12           you have any, along the way.    13                    Before a parent can connect to the Internet, they    14           have to purchase a computer.  That's the first place that a    15           parent makes a decision about whether or not they want their    16           child to see things on the Internet.      17                    The computer I'm going to be using this afternoon is    18           a MacIntosh computer.  It actually -- the actual computer is    19           sitting right there on the floor, inside the little box    20           there.  And -- I can point to that?  Right.  It's inside the    21           little box.    22                    That is actually a portable computer.  And when I    23           leave this computer, I can actually remove the whole computer    24           from this set up, so that the child wouldn't have any access    25           at all to the computer, if that's how I chose to set up my                                                                           107     1           home with this portable computer.  So it's another way I can     2           make a decision to choose what my child sees on the Internet.     3                    Many computers have keys and locks that you actually     4           can use to lock up a computer.  Before you can actually turn     5           it on, you have to have a key to open it.  And so that's     6           another parental control that you can use when you're using a     7           computer.     8                    Now I'm going to go ahead and turn my computer on by     9           pushing one button over here, and as it's starting to get    10           warmed up, another means that I have used often is to have a    11           private password when my computer starts up.  It's a password    12           that I know, that I have to type in, in order for this    13           computer to begin and to actually boot up as they call it.    14                    So as we're waiting for this to start, you will see    15           that a screen will come on, and I want to make sure you all    16           have a blank white screen right now?    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.  Yes.      18                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  It says, Welcome to MacIntosh?     19           Okay.      20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  At least two members of the panel    21           are MacIntosh friendly.    22                    THE WITNESS:  Oh.  Good.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I can't say I'm friendly.  I'm    24           there.    25                    THE WITNESS:  So as this computer begins to start,                                                                           108     1           there will come a point where it will stop, actually     2           starting, and ask me for my private password, which I need to     3           type in from my keyboard, which is right now.  So I type that     4           word in, and then it will continue to load.       5                    Once the parents -- just because a parent has bought     6           a computer, doesn't necessarily mean they're connected to the     7           Internet automatically.  You can buy computers to do word     8           processing, or whatever.  But in order to connect to the     9           Internet, you must purchase additional hardware and software.     10           You probably have to buy a modem that will allow you actually    11           to make that connection to the Internet.    12                    Once you've bought the modem, then you need to find    13           your ISP, which Mr. Bradner mentioned this morning, your    14           Internet Service Provider, which is the person who will    15           provide that connectivity to the Internet.      16                    Most homes use modems.  I happen to be connected    17           here, this afternoon, with a special line that was brought    18           into the courthouse, called a T1 line.  That's a kind of a    19           line that a lot of businesses tend to use today.  But in most    20           homes, they use modems and what's called a dial up    21           connection.    22                    Once I've established my modem and my connection, I    23           still need some software that will allow me to view the    24           Internet and to connect to the Internet, software that Mr.    25           Bradner mentioned this morning.                                                                           109     1                    I'm going to take a little tour right now of the     2           Worldwide Web, which is one section of the Internet.  It's     3           the most popular, fastest growing, the one I think that     4           children use the most often today.     5                    In order to see the Worldwide Web, I need what's     6           called a browser, which we talked about quite a bit this     7           morning.  I have a choice of many different browsers, one of     8           which is Spy Glass Mosaic, the other which is Netscape     9           browser.      10                    I'm going to use Netscape this morning.  And the way    11           I start it up is I move my mouse to the center of the    12           application.  By double clicking, it will     13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I stop you here?  Do you have    14           to buy these browsers, or does one ordinarily have to buy    15           these browsers in order to install them?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Many times when you actually go to an    17           Internet Service Provider, they will, as part of the package,    18           provide you with a browser.  But most of the browsers have    19           been available, free.  What happens in the future is somewhat    20           difficult to determine.  But now, you can get most of them    21           free over the Internet.    22                    So I am now connected to the Internet.  And when you    23           first start up a browser, you go to what's called your home    24           page.  And each person can have their own individual home    25           page.  My home page happens to the home page for the company                                                                           110     1           Surfwatch, which gives you information about our company.      2           This piece of information is actually located on a computer     3           in California, on what's called our server.  But I actually     4           can view this information here, in Philadelphia.       5                    At the same time I'm viewing this information,     6           thousands of people could also be viewing the same piece of     7           information on their computers in their homes or their     8           offices.       9                    The -- this is the Netscape area that we're looking    10           at.  And what you're looking at up top on this bar -- does my    11           mouse move back and forth on your screen also?    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, it does.     13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.      14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Very clear.    15                    THE WITNESS:  Are some commands that I perhaps may    16           be using later on.  But this bar down below is really a fun    17           place to go to.  It always gives you access to What's New and    18           What's Cool, according to Netscape on the Internet.  So let's    19           go -- the way I can go there is just by clicking in the    20           what's cool area, and depending on how quickly that     21           connection will take us there, we will go to the area that's    22           called What's Cool.    23                    On the What's Cool page, and I'm going to move the    24           page up a little bit, it tells me it was last updated on    25           March 16th, so it's something that's constantly changing.  If                                                                           111     1           I move up a little bit, you can see all sorts of short pieces     2           of description of various places that might have information     3           I was interested in.       4                    And if you notice that the cursor, which is now an     5           arrow, when I bring it over one of the blue lettered items,     6           it turns into a little hand.  That means that I can click on     7           that and go to another location and get that information.      8           And I will do that in a minute and show you how that works.     9                    One of the ways that you can find information on the    10           Internet is to know the address, to actually know ahead of    11           time what the location is, where you want to go.      12                    Before I came here, I did a little research on    13           Philadelphia, and I found out the location of a page with    14           information on Philadelphia.  So if I choose to go there, I    15           go up under the file menu, select open location, then I type    16           in the address.  And again, now is the case where I'd have to    17           use those letters that we learned about this morning,    18           HTTP:\\WWW.Phila.Com.  And that's the address of the location    19           I've known about ahead of time.  So I say I'm ready, let's go    20           there.      21                    What I get welcomed to is Philadelphia's Newest Web    22           Site, the Key to the City.  So if I scroll a little bit    23           further down, I see that I have three keyholes, one for    24           business, one for pleasure, and one for service.  So, since    25           this is mostly business here, I'm going to go to the pleasure                                                                           112     1           one right now.     2                    (Laughter)     3                    THE WITNESS:  And now I get an even more interesting     4           picture.  It's a room with many doors, the key to the city.      5           I have different kinds of doors here with numbers above it,     6           and with numbers down below that correspond to the doors.  So     7           I have the choice of either clicking or actually going.  So I     8           thought I'd go to the Sports Door, which is actually a locker     9           room, so I can click right on that door, and it will take me    10           to some more information.    11                    So I come to a sports page about Philadelphia, and    12           if I'm a Phillies fan interested in what the Phillies'    13           schedule might be, or want to go to the games -- Mmm.  Well,    14           we just had a little crash of the computer, so... I'm going    15           to start Netscape up again.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I thought that only happened to me.    17                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'm going to reboot the    18           computer.  It didn't happen yesterday.  But that does happen    19           with computers, so you just kind of start over.    20                    MR. ENNIS:  While this is happening, are there any    21           questions the Court has that she could be explaining?    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No.      23                    THE WITNESS:  This will take a few minutes again for    24           it to start up, and it will again ask me for my password, and    25           then we'll just get back to where we were.                                                                           113     1                    (Pause in proceedings.)     2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  We'll try it again.  I'm going     3           to go back into Netscape.  One of the things that -- if     4           you've actually been to a location, and you know that you     5           like that location and you want to go back there, you can     6           actually ask the computer to remember that location, put it     7           into what's called a bookmark, and so I actually did that the     8           other day when I was looking in Philadelphia.  So now I can     9           just go back to the Key to Philadelphia, instead of retyping    10           the name.  I'm still choosing where I want to go, but I've    11           also chosen to remember where I've been, so I can return to    12           that same location.  And we can just repeat the steps that I    13           did before.      14                    MR. ENNIS:  I apologize to the Court.  We've ran    15           through this twice before, and did not have these    16           difficulties.  If we might ask a more technical person to    17           approach here, we might be able to figure --    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.      19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.    20                    MR. ENNIS:  -- out a way around that.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  By all means.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you need one of ours to help,    23           we'll send one down.    24                    MR. ENNIS:  We may, your Honor.      25                    (Pause in proceedings.)                                                                           114     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  While -- while we have a few     2           minutes, we'll talk to counsel.  We have a motion on behalf     3           of amici curiae to file --     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear that, your     5           Honor.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have a motion on behalf of the     7           Author's Guild, et al, to --     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Leave.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- file -- leave to file a brief in    10           support of plaintiffs' motion.  And I understand there's an    11           objection by the Government, and if so, I wanted to find out    12           when you could file your opposition, that's all.    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, maybe I don't have an    14           objection anymore then, your Honor.  I -- I said that I would    15           reserve the right to object.      16                    My view was consistent with the decision I think    17           that Judge Dalzell made a few days ago, to not have amicus on    18           the grounds that counsel for ACLU and for Jenner and Block    19           (ph) are very well and capably representing the positions of    20           the plaintiffs.  I thought that -- in fact, I hadn't even    21           seen that amicus request before.  So that was our    22           disposition.  If the Court feels otherwise -- I don't think    23           we want another brief to write.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.      25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Well, then we'll look at it.                                                                            115     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Fine.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  I mean we weren't     3           backpacking --     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We just got it this morning,     5           ourselves.       6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we were told that you objected,     7           and that was the only reason that I thought we'd ask.     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I reserve the right to object,     9           solely on the basis of what I read in Judge Dalzell's order,    10           assuming that the Court might not want to consider an amicus    11           brief for the reasons stated in that order.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.  Well, we're not encouraging    13           extra briefs either.  We have a lot to read.    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Why don't we just defer?    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  We'll defer ruling on    16           it.      17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay.  Thank you.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And maybe at some point, you    19           can tell us orally, if you have any basis to object, so you    20           won't have to write another brief.     21                    THE WITNESS:  We'll try again.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.    23                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know whether there's something    24           about the Philadelphia Phillies that doesn't want me to go    25           there --                                                                           116     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- so I'm going to move on.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL;  They had a tough year last year.     4                    (Laughter)     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Try the ballet.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Maybe put arts.     7                    THE WITNESS:  One of the really practical ways that     8           I actually used the Internet yesterday when we were setting     9           up, is someone was here and wanted to fax something back to    10           the hotel, and we were able to use the Internet, the Key to    11           Philadelphia, find the location of the hotel and the fax    12           number, and fax something off.  So there's some very    13           practical applications.    14                    Another thing that you might possibly do if you were    15           wanting to go to some other location, if you had a trip to    16           Paris planned, you might want to get some information about    17           the Louvre before you went there.  So you could also know the    18           address of that location, and type it in.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This is the address of the Louvre?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Pardon?    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This is the address of the Louvre    22           you're putting?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Of the Louvre, right.    24                    (Pause in proceedings.)    25                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  And now this will take me to                                                                              117     1           -- I typed it incorrectly -- to information about the Louvre.      2           So it really begins to show you the global nature of the     3           Internet and how you can just travel all places in different     4           parts of the world.     5                    Now sometimes it takes a while to get things.  We     6           happen to be using the Internet at a time when all of     7           California has awakened and is on the Internet, and the East     8           Coast is still using the Internet, so sometimes it takes a     9           little while to get -- get places.  I'll try again.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because it's going to France now.    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  I believe it's going.     12           It actually -- I assume that the origin of this is in Paris,    13           although I actually don't know.  Sometimes they have sites    14           where they keep pieces of the information in different           15           areas --     16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.      17                    THE WITNESS:  -- so it actually could be accessing a    18           computer that I don't know exactly where the location is.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A question I had for our witness    20           this morning which I'll have to wait until tomorrow about,    21           right?    22                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not getting there, so let me try    23           one more time.      24                    (Pause in proceedings.)    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, let's -- another place that I                                                                           118     1           had actually looked at to go beforehand was to the museums of     2           London.  Let's see if we can get to London instead of to     3           Paris right now.      4                    Okay.  So Paris was busy, and now we've gone to     5           London, so -- and this gives you a list of the various     6           museums of London, and if I followed one of these links, I     7           would then be able to get information about what was being     8           shown.  So if I go to say, the National Gallery, it would     9           show me what exhibits were being shown, or some information    10           about the National Gallery, so...    11                    Now, when I've chosen to go to these places, it's    12           because I've known the location that I want to go to.     13           Sometimes you don't know where you want to go, or where the    14           information is, and you need to use one of the search engines    15           that I think Mr. Bradner mentioned this morning.    16                    An example of that is last year, my daughter, who is    17           a freshman in high school, had to do a report on the Fragile    18           X Syndrome.  And our encyclopedia didn't have anything about,    19           and it was Sunday night, with the report due Monday.  So    20           access to libraries was a big limited.      21                    So we sat down at the computer together, and we went    22           and used one of the search engines.  There are a number of    23           different search engines that are available.      24                    The one that we're going to use this morning is    25           called Infoseek.  And it gives you information.  It says                                                                           119     1           search for information about, so I type in Fragile X, and I     2           say search now.  What I'm going to get is -- it's going to go     3           out in its database and find me citations, much like a card     4           catalogue, of what matches Fragile X.  If I look over here on     5           the right, I can see these citations.  It tells me there's a     6           research foundation newsletter, and if I scroll up a little     7           more, there's actually something that says, what is Fragile     8           X.  If I follow that link, I can then get some information     9           about the Fragile X Syndrome.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now this search engine that you    11           have, do you pay for that, or does that come as part of your    12           package?    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's part of -- they're -- they're    14           sort of built into the Internet as part of the browser.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The Netscape browser.    16                    THE WITNESS:  The Netscape browser.  So there I have    17           information about Fragile X, and it was the jumping off point    18           for her to do her report.      19                    In fact, in one of the places that we found some    20           research, there was actually an E Mail address of someone    21           that was doing current research in that area.  And she had    22           the opportunity to E Mail this person, who was not located in    23           our area, to get information about the Fragile X Syndrome.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mrs. Duvall, do we know from this,    25           where this is from?                                                                           120     1                    THE WITNESS:  No.  I don't know where this is coming     2           from.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is there any way we could find     4           out -- you know, for -- if we wanted to cite it?  That is to     5           say, if your daughter wanted to cite it --     6                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Right.       7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- in her paper, what would she put?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Well, she would probably put this     9           Internet address.  But I would also look a little further, to    10           see if there were any -- I'd probably go back to the Fragile    11           Research Foundation home page, and see if they had some    12           information about it.  So you have to travel around a little    13           bit.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do -- do that, would you?  Would        15           you --    16                    THE WITNESS:  I think she actually cited the    17           Internet as her reference, and I think --    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would you surf to that home page?    19                    THE WITNESS:  Sure.  Okay.  Here I also look up         20           -- here I say the reference section includes several texts on    21           educational strategy, so there is probably a reference    22           section in addition, that will give me some quotations.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But somebody -- but somebody has    24           compiled this --    25                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.                                                                           121     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- for this purpose.       2                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  This isn't word for word from some     4           publication that -- I think that maybe Judge Dalzell's     5           question also, that appears somewhere.     6                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  That's my understanding.      7           Someone has compiled this.  If there has been something that     8           is actual citation, such as I believe Mr. Bradner mentioned,     9           the Homeland, then it would give credit to the place that it    10           had come from.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, maybe the Fragile Foundation    12           put it on, because --    13                    THE WITNESS:  Right.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- it has here, what is Fragile X.    15                    THE WITNESS:  Uh-huh.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So presumably, that's what you just    17           had on your screen.    18                    THE WITNESS:  That's right.  That's a link back to    19           the page that I just saw.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's a link.  You could just       21           -- we could just test that right now.    22                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  And that would take me back to    23           where -- probably where I just was.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  Now we know.    25                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Okay.  Now, these are things                                                                           122     1           that I've done, sort of, with my 15 year old.  There's also       2           -- many parents that are getting on line with younger     3           children that have some concerns about letting their children     4           roam freely on the Internet, they'd like to have some     5           information about sites that were perhaps geared a little bit     6           more towards children.       7                    And one of the search engines that's out there is     8           called Yahoo, and they've just created a new site called     9           Yahooligans.  So if we go take a visit to -- just make sure I    10           spell it right -- will take us to a site called Yahooligans.     11           And as this comes up, you can see that it's really -- the    12           content is really geared for younger children -- pictures and    13           science and oddities, and art soup, things like that.  So    14           these are the kinds of new content that's been coming up    15           that's really available for young -- for young children to    16           see.    17                    One of the areas that I have had great interest in    18           is Street Smart on the Web, so I'm going to follow that link.     19                    And what Yahooligans has included is the fact that    20           the Internet is a great and wonderful place to see, but there    21           are also some areas that can be troublesome, or some areas    22           you might not -- have things you might not want your child to    23           see.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before you go on, what category        25           -- what would be the generic name of what is Yahooligans, in                                                                           123     1           terms of the testimony that we heard this morning?  Is that       2           a --     3                    THE WITNESS:  That's a URL.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's a URL.       5                    THE WITNESS:  I believe.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But Yahoo was a search engine?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Well, Yahoo is a company that has a     9           search engine and they also created this page for children --    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    11                    THE WITNESS:  -- so it wasn't connected with the    12           search engine --    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- at that moment.  So these rules for    15           safety are ones that were presented from the National Center    16           for Missing and Exploited Children.  And I use them a lot    17           when I'm talking with parents that are getting on line for    18           the first time, to help them understand that it's important    19           for kids not to give out personal information, like their    20           address and phone number, their parents' work address and    21           phone number.  And these are just some general rules that are    22           printed here on the screen that parents can see and    23           understand some of the pitfalls of the Internet, and all the    24           wonderful things of the Internet as well.    25                    Now if I scroll a little bit further down on this                                                                           124     1           page, there's also a pointer to Surfwatch, Protect Your Kinds     2           on the Net.  And I can actually click that and go to the     3           location on line.       4                    Now the interesting thing is, is that where we are     5           actually now is -- if you remember, we were at Surfwatch home     6           page when I first started.  We've now come in to a lower     7           place in the Surfwatch home page.  So we don't have to always     8           go down through the top we've come to, because there was a     9           link directly to some lower location, we could get to that    10           location immediately, which sort of explains why this is    11           called a Web, as opposed to just a tree, because you can jump    12           in at any point.    13                    And here, immediately --    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could you bookmark to this    15           particular --     16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- like the thing that we just saw,    18           the page we just saw, in which the child learns to say I will    19           not give anyone my address?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Okay.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can you bookmark to that, or do you    22           have to bookmark to the whole thing?    23                    THE WITNESS:  No.  I'll show you exactly.  I can go    24           back.  There's a back key, right up here at the top, which    25           keeps a record of where I've been.  So now I'm going to go                                                                           125     1           back to that page, which is right here, so you can go back to     2           that information you've seen.  I go up under bookmark, and I     3           say add bookmark.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Just to that -- and that gets it to     5           that page.     6                    THE WITNESS:  That's it.  Now if you look at     7           bookmarks now, you'll see the bottom one says Street Smart on     8           the Web.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.    10                    THE WITNESS:  So now I can go back to that at any    11           point.  Now I'll go forward to the point that I had just    12           left.      13                    This is an advertise -- or a place where parents can    14           actually purchase Surfwatch right on line.  If they click    15           there, they will go to the Internet Shopping Network and can    16           actually order the software right on line, and they will    17           actually will be able to download it on their computer.      18                    Now, Surfwatch and the other parental technology is    19           available in stores, available on line like this, available    20           from our company directly.    21                    So what is Surfwatch and where did it come from?  We    22           -- Surfwatch is -- the product was -- is less than a year    23           old, as is the other parental control technologies, and it    24           came from my husband and myself, concerned about things that    25           were on the Internet that we felt were inappropriate for our                                                                           126     1           child.  And my husband has a long technical background, 30     2           years of experience in this field.  So we were able to     3           actually implement the technology that both of us felt was     4           important to have on the Internet.     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well -- excuse me, your Honor.  I     6           really don't mean to interrupt, but we're getting beyond     7           demonstration, into a direct testimony type situation where     8           she's just --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, she's just giving a background    10           of her company.  Objection overruled.    11                    THE WITNESS:  So -- you know, and we really felt    12           like what we wanted to provide were tools.  We understood    13           that what our concerns for our kids were different than some    14           other concerns for other -- that other parents might have for    15           their children.      16                    So we really wanted to be able to provide tools,    17           that if parents had serious concerns about what their kids    18           saw on the Internet, they could have very severe filtering    19           technology, and parents who were less concerned with the    20           risk, could allow their kids to wander a little bit more.    21                    And for me, I believed it was important to have my    22           child wander on the Internet as much as I wanted.      23                    So Surfwatch is a product that during this whole    24           demonstration, has been on my computer right here, running    25           the whole time in the background.  So you can see it's                                                                           127     1           allowed us to search anywhere that we wanted to go on the     2           Internet, hasn't interfered with us going anywhere, and we     3           still have it running, and it's in the background.     4                    We designed Surfwatch to be easy to install, and     5           easy for parents who don't have a lot of computer experience     6           to put on their machine.  And it's about a 10 minute time     7           period to install it, and they install it with their own     8           personal password.       9                    So how does Surfwatch work?  Well, one of the things    10           that we did is I knew addresses of where -- places that I    11           might want to go.  Well, sometimes kids know addresses of    12           places that they might want to go.  And it is possible that    13           kids might know that Playboy Magazine exists on the Internet.     14           So they might know the address of that.  And if they open the    15           -- do the open location of HTTP:\\WWW.Playboy, and they hit    16           the open, they will get a message --    17                    (Laughter)    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, again, the Net is slow, so it's    19           actually got to go out and check and see if this is something    20           that Surfwatch blocks, but it should come back blocked by    21           Surfwatch.      22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that because it's stopping it?     23           It's programmed to stop it, or -- or will a -- should a    24           message come up?    25                    THE WITNESS:  A message should come up.  And I don't                                                                           128     1           understand why that's not coming up.  So -- I mean what's     2           happening is I can't get there.  So that's sort of good news.      3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's just as effective, I     4           guess, huh?     5                    THE WITNESS:  Let's try -- let me see if a bookmark     6           to it will get the connection to work.  Well, I don't know.      7           But anyway, let's move on.  We'll come back and do that one     8           in a few minutes.     9                    The other thing that -- that I --    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, in order to show how, to    11           demonstrate, could you think of an -- I don't know the name    12           of another magazine.  Do you know the name of another    13           magazine that would be locked?    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Something else that you know -- that    15           you know you've blocked.    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm going to show you how to    17           block something else, then I'll come back and do Playboy in a    18           minute.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.    20                    THE WITNESS:  We -- we did a word search before.  So    21           I'm now -- kids often will go to one of the search engines    22           and try searching on a word.  So for example, if they type in    23           the word sexy, and they try and do a search, they get blocked    24           by Surfwatch.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.                                                                           129     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.     2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  So the message does come up.      3           And they might be a little more sophisticated.  So they might     4           type in the word erotic.  And these are words that we have     5           found most likely lead to places that we think might contain     6           material that's inappropriate for children.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now how do you override it?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'll show you that in a second.      9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    10                    THE WITNESS:  So let me actually try Playboy one    11           more time.  My guess is that often what happens with a lot of    12           these sites is they get very busy in the middle of the day,    13           and you actually can't --    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Playboy.    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  And you actually can't have    16           access to it, which is actually a deterrent, often when a lot    17           of people are going there.  But it's not a guarantee, but,    18           you know, it is blocked by Surfwatch.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that may explain why it's slow,    20           because there's just a lot of traffic on that?    21                    THE WITNESS:  There's a -- this is -- this is the    22           most busy time on the Internet, during the day.  When    23           California's awake, and the East Coast still is busy.  It's a    24           very busy time on the Internet, so...    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We have California time on your                                                                           130     1           terminal.     2                    THE WITNESS:  I do.  It's because it's my portable     3           that I brought from home, so...so... there.  Okay.  So I     4           typed in another magazine.  I typed in Penthouse.  That's the     5           message I should get from Playboy.  The only explanation I     6           can give is that for some reason, it's busy out there and I     7           can't get out there.  But that's the message you get when you     8           attempt to go to a site like that.     9                    So you asked how easy it is to turn off?  That's    10           just another message that Netscape is giving me that it can't    11           -- it was refused access to Penthouse.  It's sort of a double    12           message because Surfwatch blocked it, and then Netscape said    13           I couldn't get there, but it couldn't get there at that point    14           because Surfwatch had actually blocked it.    15                    So to turn it off, I go to what's called the control    16           panel, and there's Surfwatch sitting there.  And it's turned    17           on, registered to me.  I go to turn it off.  It asks me for    18           my personal password, okay.      19                    If I type in something -- a kid tries to type in    20           something, you try it, it says, you entered the incorrect    21           password.  Nothing has been changed.  If I try again, and    22           type in the password that I know is correct, it turns it off.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    24                    THE WITNESS:  And now I have access to all of those    25           sites that previously were blocked.  And a parent can use                                                                           131     1           this at any time, because it may be the case that Surfwatch     2           has blocked something that a parent thinks is appropriate for     3           their child to see.  They can turn Surfwatch off at any time,     4           and go to that location.       5                    And Surfwatch will have available in about a month,     6           something called the Surfwatch Manager, which will allow     7           people to actually add and delete their sites right there, as     8           they're using the computer.  So if we've blocked something     9           someone would like unblocked, or vice-versa, they will have a    10           chance to actually change that right now.    11                    And in addition, if a parent wanted -- if a parent    12           was really concerned with what their kids saw and didn't want    13           them very much surfing the net, Surfwatch has a capability to    14           block everything on the Internet, except for the explicit    15           sites that a parent might choose to allow the person -- allow    16           their child to access.  So you could block everything, except    17           for the hundred sites that the parent might want the child to    18           access.    19                    So that's the end of my demo.  I just -- it was    20           important for me to actually put some visual stuff to what    21           you had seen this morning, so that it actually began to make    22           some sense of what the Web is.      23                    I think it's important, from my point of view, that    24           the Web is a place where you actually make an affirmative    25           choice to go places.  It doesn't just come at you.  You                                                                           132     1           actually choose to go to locations at each place, each step     2           along the way, and secondly, that it's a global network.      3           That's what's so exciting.  I mean I was -- tried to get to     4           Paris -- London, and you could go lots of different places in     5           the world.  I think that's really important.     6                    And that there are tools that exist for parents, and     7           this is a brand new technology.  We're growing.  We have lots     8           of new exciting ideas coming.  We're changing and adopting to     9           what the customers want and what's needed in there.  But    10           there is technology that allows parents to make choices about    11           what their children see on the net.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that the end of show and tell?    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that the end of the direct --    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- as supplemented?    16                    MR. ENNIS:  That's the end of our demonstration,    17           your Honor.  The Government may want to cross-examine, and if    18           the Court has additional questions --    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.  Mr. Coppolino, will you be    20           doing that?    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I will be.  Yes.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you going to be using this?     24           Are we going to be using these again during this hearing?    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Today, your Honor?  I don't believe                                                                           133     1           so.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Ever?     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes.  I think these should be     4           available for when we present our case.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Okay.  It's just a bit of a     6           -- if we could get it off --     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, maybe --     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we might not feel so --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would it be possible during the    10           break, or --    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, your Honor, it would just take a    12           moment to lift it down.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- just to take a moment.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, not this second.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you told me yesterday, you    16           could just take it off right now.    17                    MR. ENNIS:  Right.  Right.  Why don't we do that?     18           If the Government doesn't need the monitors, we can take this    19           down right now.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You don't need the monitors, Mr.    21           Coppolino?    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Today.    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We don't need them today.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Today, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That                                                                           134     1           would be --     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If that would be all right, Mr.     3           Coppolino, we would be able to have -- get our own material.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It gives us a little more space.     5                    (Pause in proceedings.)     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  There's a wonderful --     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Free at last.     8                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm going to turn the monitors off and     9           display, if that's acceptable to the Government and to the    10           Court.    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Could I just clarify, your Honor,    12           does the witness have a copy of her affidavit direct    13           testimony?    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you have this in front of you?    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Ennis, or one of your    17           colleagues, could you --    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, I can get one quickly, your Honor.    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  And also, your Honor, is there a    20           copy of any of the defendant's exhibits left over from this    21           morning?  Because if not --    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I could give her mine, if you'd    23           like.    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.  At the appropriate point, I can    25           hand her a copy, your Honor.                                                                           135     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.     2                    MR. ENNIS:  I gave them back to your side during the     3           lunch break.     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Oh, you gave them back.  Okay.      5           Well, we'll hand it up when we need them.     6                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION     7           BY MR. COPPOLINO:     8           Q   Good afternoon, Mrs. Duvall.  Nice to see you again.      9           First, with respect to your professional background, do you    10           have any expertise in computer programming?    11           A   No, I do not.    12           Q   Do you have any expertise in computer software    13           development?    14           A   No, I do not.    15           Q   Do you have any expertise in computer hardware    16           development?    17           A   No, I do not.    18           Q   Do you have any expertise in Internet transmission    19           protocols?    20           A   No, I do not.    21           Q   Is it correct to say that your expertise does not extend    22           to the specific technical details as to how Surfwatch    23           actually operates on a computer system?    24           A   That is correct.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you speak into the -- pull the                                                                           136     1           microphone --      2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.       3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is it on, the microphone?     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Go ahead.     6           BY MR. COPPOLINO:     7           Q   And so is it fair to say that your expertise is in what     8           Surfwatch does, as opposed to precisely how it does it on a     9           technical basis?  Is that a fair statement?    10           A   Yes, it is.    11           Q   I'd like to refer you to paragraph 21 of your direct    12           testimony affidavit, please.  And paragraph 21 describes some    13           of the criteria that Surfwatch uses to block access to    14           sexually explicit sites on the Internet.  Is that correct?    15           A   Yes, it is.    16           Q   And just so that the record is clear, that paragraph    17           indicates that Surfwatch's blocking criteria includes a    18           screen or warning at the entrance of a site that identifies    19           as containing adult material, or material that is not    20           suitable for minors, nudity, explicit descriptions of sexual    21           acts, obscenity, explicit descriptions in graphics or text,    22           of genitalia or a sexual apparatus, and sexually exploitive    23           or sexually violent text of graphics.  Do you agree that each    24           of these is one of the criteria that Surfwatch uses to block    25           sites on the Internet?                                                                           137     1           A   Yes.  That's one of many of the criteria we use.     2           Q   What additional criteria are there?     3           A   I actually don't have the list in front of me, but these     4           are the main criteria, and then we actually go and look at     5           sites, and make a judgment based on what we see.     6           Q   I understand.     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I am going to give the     8           witness the exhibit book.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Which numbers?  Which part of the    12           exhibit book?    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We're going to give her one to 45,    14           and I'll identify the exhibits.      15           BY MR. COPPOLINO:    16           Q   I'll tell you which exhibit I'm going to ask you to look    17           at.    18           A   Okay.    19                    (Pause in proceedings.)    20           BY MR. COPPOLINO:    21           Q   All right.  Ms. Duvall, would you take a look at Exhibit    22           30, please?  And do you -- do you recognize this exhibit as    23           an exhibit I showed you at your deposition on Monday, which    24           lists a number of so-called x-rated sites that are listed in    25           the Internet yellow pages?  I believe that's the 1995                                                                           138     1           edition.  Is that correct?     2           A   Yes.  I remember seeing this document.     3           Q   All right.  Are these the type of sites that Surfwatch is     4           designed to block?     5           A   Yes.  Surfwatch is designed to block these sites.     6           Q   That's all we're going to do with that exhibit.  Thank     7           you.  Referring to paragraph eight of your direct                 8           testimony --     9           A   Excuse me.  Eight?    10           Q   Eight.      11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You were talking about Exhibit 30    12           there?    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Excuse me, your Honor?    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What exhibit were you on?    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  30.    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I was looking at 30.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He had looked at 30.  You got it    18           there.  You got it now.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean it's designed to block    20           these?    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No.  Turn the page.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I asked, your Honor, if --     24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  All right.    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I asked her if it was designed to                                                                           139     1           block the type of sites that are listed at Exhibit 30, and I     2           believe the witness indicated that it was.     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  All right.  I was looking        4           -- okay.  Fine.     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I missed that.  I missed it.     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I might have gone a little too     7           quickly.  I apologize.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, two out of three missed it.    10           BY MR. COPPOLINO:    11           Q   Mrs. Duvall, you state in paragraph eight that Surfwatch    12           blocks access to more than 5,000 Internet sites that are    13           known, or appear likely to contain text or graphics of a    14           sexual nature that Surfwatch considers to be inappropriate    15           for minors.  Is that correct?    16           A   Yes, it is.    17           Q   Is it correct that that figure could be as high as 8,000?    18           A   It's a difficult number to actually pinpoint.  Let me    19           give you an example.  We block Playboy.  We count that as one    20           site.  Playboy actually could have multiple pages underneath    21           that, so it could be a hundred additional pages in that.  So    22           there -- now the number would be a hundred and one.  So    23           depending on how we want to actually count, we can't always    24           count exactly the sites that we're blocking because there    25           could be multiple underneath a certain header.                                                                           140     1                    In addition, we block on some word and pattern     2           matching technology.  And that's kind of a fluid ongoing     3           thing, so we don't actually have a count of exactly how           4           much.     5           Q   Well, I'm just trying to get a sense of the range of the     6           number of sites.  Would you take a look at Exhibit 22,     7           please, of defendant's exhibits?     8           A   Yes.     9           Q   Is that the affidavit that was filed in this case, signed    10           by your husband, Bill Duvall?    11           A   Yes.    12           Q   Would you look at paragraph nine?  Does paragraph nine of    13           that affidavit state that Surfwatch blocks access to    14           approximately five through 8,000 Internet sites containing    15           sexually explicit material?  Is that correct?    16           A   That's what it says.    17           Q   Are you saying your husband's statement was not correct?    18           A   No.  I assume if he made that statement, that he assumed    19           that it was correct.    20           Q   When Surfwatch was first introduced in May of 1985 -- is    21           that correct?    22           A   '95.    23           Q   1995.  Excuse me.  Do you know roughly how many specific    24           sites that Surfwatch had identified that were blocked by the    25           software?                                                                           141     1           A   I don't actually have a count, back in May of 1995 when     2           we first released.     3           Q   Could you give us an approximation?     4           A   Again, since we were blocking both on word matching     5           pattern technology and explicit sites, it was difficult.  But     6           I would imagine at that time, we were probably blocking about     7           2,000 sites.     8           Q   Okay.  Has the number of sites that -- excuse me.  Could     9           you tell me what the increase in the number of sites that    10           Surfwatch has specifically identified has been since May of    11           1985, the number of sites that have been specifically    12           identified by Surfwatch?    13           A   Again, that's a difficult number, because if I'm listing    14           Playboy as a specific site, I count that as one.  It could    15           also be counted as a hundred and one.    16           Q   Well, do you recall when we met at a deposition last    17           Monday, that you made a general estimate of a couple of    18           thousand new sites had been specifically identified by    19           Surfwatch since May of 1995?  Do you recall that testimony?    20           A   I don't recall exactly saying that, but --    21           Q   Well, let me refresh your recollection, then.     22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, may I give the witness a    23           copy of her --    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you may.    25           BY MR. COPPOLINO:                                                                           142     1           Q   I'll refer you the page...     2           A   Okay.       3           Q   Take a look at page 145, please.  Actually, starting at     4           the bottom of page 144, I asked you -- and I'll just quote     5           from the transcript:     6                    "Do you have any estimate of the number of new sites     7           that have been found since the software was released in May     8           of 1995?"     9                    "Answer:  Not specifically, no."    10                    "Do you have a general estimate?"    11                    "Answer:  It would be a couple of thousand."    12                    Is that testimony correct?    13           A   That is correct.    14           Q   Mrs. Duvall, does Surfwatch utilize a team of so-called    15           surfers to search the Internet for sites that may contain    16           sexually explicit material, as described in paragraph 21?    17           A   It's one of the ways we use to find new sites.    18           Q   Excuse me?    19           A   That's one of the ways we use to find new sites.    20           Q   Could you indicate how many people are currently    21           performing this task?    22           A   I believe we have at least 10 surfers at this time.    23           Q   Are a number of these individuals university students?    24           A   Yes, they are.    25           Q   And the ones that are university students, are over the                                                                           143     1           age of 21, is that correct?     2           A   Yes, they are.     3           Q   Okay.  Approximately how many hours per week do you ask     4           your searchers -- does Surfwatch ask its surfers to search     5           the net for sites that Surfwatch may choose to block?     6           A   We tell them we'd like to surf for a minimum of 10 hours     7           per week.     8           Q   And how many hours per week do you estimate that they     9           actually do search, on average?    10           A   Probably closer to 20 on average per week.    11           Q   That's your current estimate today, of 20?    12           A   Well --    13           Q   Well, let me try to refresh your recollection on that    14           one, too.  Why don't you take a look at page 49.      15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Matt, check if her microphone is on.    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah.  It doesn't seem --    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I don't think her microphone's on.    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Is her microphone on?    19                    THE WITNESS:  It is.  It's just not close enough to    20           me, probably.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's a very sensitive microphone,    22           so...    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mine's on off.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, no.  Hers.      25                    THE CLERK:  Oh.  It's on.                                                                           144     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  Okay.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't need yours on to get --     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I put mine off.         4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't need yours on --     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- mine on.  I don't want to --     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but for you to get on the     7           tape, don't you need to be -- I mean in my court, you do.       8                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, could we also see if this     9           could be turned off?  We're having trouble hearing at this    10           end as well.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have what turned off?    12                    MR. ENNIS:  Whatever this projector is.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, sure.      14                    (Pause in proceedings.)    15           BY MR. COPPOLINO:    16           Q   Mrs. Duvall, perhaps you heard me say two weeks instead    17           of one, but my question is the number of hours on average the    18           surfers search per week, and as the deposition transcript on    19           page 49 indicates, that your estimate was, "per week, I'll    20           say about 12 hours."  Is that correct?    21           A   That's what I said the estimate was.    22           Q   And -- and to be accurate, you said that's a guess, or    23           that's an estimate, is that correct?    24           A   Yes.    25           Q   All right.  Mrs. Duvall, do the surfers, I'll call them,                                                                           145     1           that Surfwatch utilizes, do they search for new sites with     2           the Surfwatch software loaded on their computers?     3           A   Yes, they do.     4           Q   And is the idea to find sites that Surfwatch does not     5           block?     6           A   Yes.  That's the idea.     7           Q   And the idea is to use the -- to load the software in     8           advance, so that if they find a site that's not blocked, they     9           know that it's not blocked.  Is that correct?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   And do your surfers in fact find that there are sexually    12           explicit sites meeting the criteria described in paragraph 21    13           that are not blocked by the software when it is loaded onto    14           the computer?    15           A   Yes, they do.    16           Q   With the Surfwatch software loaded, could you indicate    17           approximately how many new sites your surfers find per week?    18           A   We probably get between a hundred and 200 sites a week.    19           Q   And is it fair to extrapolate that number out to a    20           monthly approximately of 400 to 800 new sites identified a    21           month?    22           A   Well, it's very difficult to extrapolate with a new    23           company that's only been around for nine months.  So I would    24           be a little hesitant to do a lot of extrapolating.    25           Q   Do you recall that you testified to that effect last                                                                           146     1           Monday?     2           A   No, I didn't recall --     3           Q   Well, let's take a look at page 144 of your deposition.      4           The bottom of page 143 to 144.  I had asked you about a     5           weekly number.     6                    "Was that a weekly number?"     7                    "Answer:  I said 100 to 200 a week."     8                    "Question:  So could I extrapolate out to 400 to 800     9           a month, perhaps.  Is that fair?"    10                    "Answer:  Sure."    11                    Was that testimony that you gave on Monday correct?    12           A   That is the correct testimony I gave on Monday.    13           Q   Do you disagree with it today?    14           A   No, I don't disagree with it.  I -- it's a difficult    15           number to always extrapolate, since we don't have a lot of    16           history to base this on.    17           Q   Mrs. Duvall, is it correct to say that Surfwatch's    18           experiences at the number of sites on the Internet containing     19           sexually explicit material of the type described in paragraph    20           21 is constantly changing?  Is that a correct statement?    21           A   Yes, that is.    22           Q   I believe your affidavit indicates in paragraph 11 that    23           Surfwatch offers a subscription service that automatically    24           updates the identification of specific sites that Surfwatch    25           blocks.  Is that correct?                                                                           147     1           A   Yes.  That's correct.     2           Q   Could you tell the Court approximately how much that     3           service costs per month?     4           A   Well, if they purchase the service directly from us, it's     5           $5.95 a month, or $60 for a yearly subscription.  But it is     6           available through some of the Internet Service Providers at a     7           much lower cost to people.  It's provided -- included as part     8           of their package.     9           Q   Could you indicate how often Surfwatch normally provides    10           its subscribers an automatic updated list of sites that have    11           been -- that Surfwatch would add to its block site list?    12           A   At this point, we're on a 28 day cycle.    13           Q   Mrs. Duvall, do you agree that an important aspect of    14           maintaining the effectiveness of Surfwatch is to subscribe to    15           the list of updated sites?    16           A   Yes, I do.    17           Q   And would the effectiveness of Surfwatch diminish over    18           time, if a user did not subscribe to a list of updated block    19           sites?    20           A   If they were using the standard version of Surfwatch,    21           then the subscription wouldn't make a difference.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What was that?    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What did you say?  I'm sorry.    24                    THE WITNESS:  If they're using the standard version.     25           We have a version where parents will be able to block                                                                           148     1           everything on the Internet, except what they choose their     2           child to see, and therefore the subscription would not make a     3           difference at that point --      4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I see.     5                    THE WITNESS:  -- because they would be making their     6           own choices as to what they wanted their child to see.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, so -- go ahead.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.  Now what was --     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you can get -- you can get then a    10           version of Surfwatch that's a total block --    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- except for sites that the parents    13           specifically authorize.    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I didn't hear the answer to Mr.    17           Coppolino's question before, which was if you didn't get that    18           version and did get the regular version, but didn't get the    19           monthly update, what would the effectiveness be?  I think    20           that was your question, paraphrased.      21                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Right.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I just didn't hear your answer.    23                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  The effectiveness would    24           diminish, as there are new sites that are coming on the    25           Internet all the time.  So to have the most updated filters                                                                           149     1           available, you'd need to subscribe to the service.     2           BY MR. COPPOLINO:     3           Q   And is it -- is it fair to say that the software -- the     4           new software that you're developing that you've just     5           described to the Court, reverses the presumption, and instead     6           of selecting sites to block, allows parents to select sites     7           to provide access to?     8           A   That's correct.     9           Q   Is Surfwatch going to cease using its annual -- or 28 day    10           updates of updated sites, once this new software is available    11           that you just described?    12           A   Would you repeat that again, please?    13           Q   What I wanted to know is when you have the new software    14           that's going to allow parents to block everything except what    15           they want, does Surfwatch contemplate ceasing its    16           subscription service, which would provide automatic updates    17           of block sites?    18           A   We don't plan to, at this point.  And we -- I mean at    19           this point, we block every -- we update automatically every    20           28 days.  That's a number that can change at any time.  We    21           can automatically update anybody at any time, if we so    22           choose.  They just can -- we can set the number to be every    23           five days, if we think that's more appropriate, or every    24           three days, or every two weeks.  So that's a number that's    25           not solid, hard built into the program.  We can change that                                                                           150     1           as we find maybe it's more appropriate to have someone update     2           on a weekly basis, instead of 28 days.     3           Q   Does Surfwatch have any reason to believe that the need     4           to continue to provide an updated list of sites will diminish     5           for the foreseeable future?     6           A   You're asking me to predict what's going to happen on the     7           Internet.  It's difficult to say what will happen, as far as     8           people providing content on the Internet, of the nature that     9           we have been filtering out at this point.    10           Q   Would you take a look at page 147 of your -- of your    11           deposition?  I asked you then:    12                    "Is there any reason to believe that the necessity    13           for Surfwatch to continue to update its list of block sites    14           will diminish in the foreseeable future?"    15                    "Answer:  No."    16                    Is that your testimony on Monday?    17           A   Yes, it is.    18           Q   Paragraph seven of your -- of your affidavit today, if    19           you could take a look at that, please.  You use a phrase,    20           "the tiny portion of inappropriate material on the Internet."     21           Do you consider the 5,000 sites that Surfwatch attempts to    22           screen to be a tiny portion of inappropriate material on the    23           Internet?    24           A   Yes, I do.    25           Q   And what's the basis for that statement?  Have you -- let                                                                           151     1           me -- let me strike that question and ask this one.  Have you     2           done any statistical analysis of the percentage of material     3           that Surfwatch screens, as a percentage of the total material     4           on the Internet?     5           A   Would you repeat that question?     6           Q   Have you done a -- has Surfwatch done a statistical     7           analysis of the percentage of the material that Surfwatch     8           screens, as a percentage of the total material on the     9           Internet?    10           A   We haven't done it -- we -- Surfwatch has not done any    11           statistical analysis.    12           Q   Does your -- is your statement in this paragraph    13           reflecting a particular study?    14           A   Where's that -- where are you, paragraph seven?    15           Q   Paragraph seven.  The characterization, "a tiny portion    16           of inappropriate material on the Internet."    17           A   I'm not seeing that.    18           Q   Of your affidavit.  It's in the second sentence.      19           A   The second sentence of paragraph seven, or am I looking    20           at the wrong thing?    21           Q   Well, I think so, but most of your --    22           A   I'm looking at the wrong affidavit.    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Could I assist the witness perhaps,    24           your Honor?    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's this one, in the binder here.                                                                           152     1                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  There were two of them, and I     2           was looking at the wrong one.     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You can assist her, though.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page four.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  You want to show her, Mr.     7           Coppolino?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Sorry?       9           BY MR. COPPOLINO:    10           Q   I was referring to your --     11           A   Oh, okay.  Okay.  That's what I was -- they look -- yeah.     12           Q   Tab C.    13           A   Okay.  Thank you.    14           Q   That -- that -- I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.    15           A   Is that -- okay.  That wasn't in the other one.  Okay.     16           Okay.  Well, just -- I mean from my experience in what I know    17           is out on the Internet, and there have been some numbers that    18           have bantered around, that there are over 50 million pages of    19           information on the Internet, I tend to believe that there is    20           a small amount of inappropriate material on the Internet.    21           Q   But according to your affidavit, there are at least 5,000    22           to 8,000 sites that Surfwatch has currently identified.  Is    23           that correct?    24           A   About 5,000 sites that we block, that aren't --    25           Q   That you block.                                                                           153     1           A   Right.     2           Q   Well, I assume that includes a combination of those     3           you've identified, as well as a text blocking mechanism.  Is     4           that correct?     5           A   Yes.     6           Q   Okay.  And incidentally, if you block something by the     7           text blocking mechanism, are you aware -- you become aware of     8           the specific site?     9           A   No, we do not.    10           Q   Would you take a look at paragraph 23, please?  If you'd    11           like to take a moment to look through paragraph 23.  Have you    12           had a chance to look over paragraph 23, Mrs. Duvall?    13           A   Mm-hmm.    14           Q   Paragraph 23 indicates in the second to last sentence,    15           that Surfwatch blocks 90 to 95 percent of certain sites --    16           I'm not quoting exactly, so I'm going to let you explain         17           this --    18           A   Mm-hmm.    19           Q   -- but 90 to 95 percent of certain sites identified by    20           sexually explicit key words, such as sexy or erotica, is that    21           -- is that correct, that Surfwatch says that it blocks 90 to    22           95 percent of certain sites identified by sexually explicit    23           key words, such as sexy or erotica?  Is that -- is that          24           the --    25           A   What -- what that -- what that really means is that we                                                                           154     1           believe that most sites that attract -- there's so many sites     2           on the Internet, that there has to be something that attracts     3           someone to go to that site.  So either it's a site that they     4           know about, such as Playboy.Com, or it's a site that has     5           something in its title that's going to draw someone to there.      6                    If there's a site that says Ann's Home Page, it's     7           not likely, if a child is searching for sexually explicit     8           material, they're going to go to that home page.       9                    But if something says sexy, sexy, sexy in the title,    10           there's a good chance that a child might be attracted to    11           that.      12                    And since we can block on what's in the title, we've    13           come to find that we believe we block about 90 to 95 percent    14           of what we call the readily available sites on the Internet    15           that contain sexually explicit material.  And it has been our    16           experience in the thousands of copies that we have out there,    17           that we're not getting a huge amount of complaints from    18           parents and teachers that we're missing huge amounts of    19           material that students and kids are finding on the Internet.    20           Q   Mrs. Duvall, do you recall describing this estimate to me    21           last Monday in your deposition, as a marketing statement?    22           A   I said that it was used -- that I had taken it -- my    23           husband had taken it from a marketing statement, that we had    24           used it as a marketing statement.    25           Q   As a Surfwatch marketing statement.                                                                           155     1           A   Mm-hmm.  Yes.     2           Q   You testified previously that the number of sexually     3           explicit sites on the Internet is changing constantly.  Is     4           that correct?     5           A   That's correct.     6           Q   And you also testified previously I believe that your     7           surfers are finding a hundred to 200 new sites per week, that     8           Surfwatch would block.  Is that correct?     9           A   That's correct.    10           Q   Is it possible to determine at any given time how many    11           sexually explicit sites are actually added and removed from    12           the Internet?    13           A   No.    14           Q   One question with respect to the demonstration.  I    15           believe you indicated that in order to connect to the    16           Internet, somebody had to buy a modem.  Could you indicate to    17           the Court whether or not there are computers that actually    18           come with a modem built in?    19           A   There are computers that come with modems.    20           Q   Is it some, or many, or most?  Do you know?    21           A   I don't have that -- no, I don't know that information.    22           Q   So you wouldn't know if it's -- if it's today's    23           technology, would you know whether or not most computers come    24           with a modem built in?    25           A   No, I wouldn't.                                                                           156     1           Q   You don't know?     2           A   I don't know.     3           Q   Okay.       4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I thank the Court.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Ennis?     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Just a couple of brief questions.     7                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION     8           BY MR. ENNIS:     9           Q   Mrs. Duvall, you were testifying today, primarily on    10           behalf of Surfwatch.  But is it fair to say that there are    11           several other software companies that produce comparable    12           products?    13           A   Yes, there are.    14           Q   And do some of those other companies produce products    15           that permit parents to choose to block all access to the    16           Internet, except for sites the parents have previously    17           selected as appropriate?    18           A   To my understanding, yes.    19           Q   I think there's been a little confusion about how your    20           blocking works.  Is it fair to say that you block sites,    21           regardless of whether the site in its address has a sexy    22           word, if you know the site contains inappropriate material?     23           Is that correct?    24           A   That is correct.    25           Q   Like, for example, you said Ann's Home Page.  That                                                                           157     1           doesn't sound bad, but if you knew that Ann's Home Page     2           contained inappropriate material, you would block that site     3           as a site, correct?     4           A   Absolutely.     5           Q   And then is it also true that you block because of your     6           word pattern technology system, so that if the address of the     7           site has a word like sexy or porn, or cyberporn, you would     8           block that site for that reason?     9           A   That's correct.      10           Q   Now, you testified that insofar as you're blocking by    11           known site, that if you don't subscribe to the service, the    12           effectiveness of site blocking will diminish over time,    13           correct?    14           A   That's correct.    15           Q   Is that also correct, or is that incorrect when you're    16           blocking with respect to word recognition?    17           A   Not -- absolutely not the same amount, because the words    18           are always there, and will remain there, and we will continue    19           to block on those words forever.    20           Q   So that hypothetically --    21           A   Mm-hmm.    22           Q   -- if, in a two week period, 200 new sites were added to    23           the Web, and all of those 200 new sites had a word in the    24           title, like adult, or sexy, or erotic --    25           A   Mm-hmm.                                                                           158     1           Q   -- even if you hadn't investigated those sites     2           individually, they'd be blocked?     3           A   That's absolutely correct.     4                    MR. ENNIS:  I have no further questions.     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Could I ask one?     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, yeah.  We may have some, too.     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I understand, your Honor.     8                                RECROSS EXAMINATION     9           BY MR. COPPOLINO:    10           Q   Mrs. Duvall, just following up on Mr. Ennis' questions,    11           if Surfwatch had not previously identified the site captioned    12           Ann's Home Page, or something of that nature -- let's just    13           say Ann's Home Page -- as containing sexually explicit    14           material, if you had not previously identified that specific    15           site, would the site be blocked by Surfwatch?    16           A   No.    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask some questions?    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have some, too.  You go first.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is Surfwatch a money making    21           project?    22                    THE WITNESS:  I hope so.    23                    (Laughter)    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's the -- that's the hope.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it stopped being a money making                                                                           159     1           project, would you -- and your children had become adults,     2           there would be -- is it correct that there would be no reason     3           for you to continue with this project?     4                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think the original reason that     5           inspired the idea was that we have a child at home.  But as     6           we have developed this software, it's become very clear to me     7           that parents would like to have tools for themselves, to use     8           on the Internet, as their children become -- come on the     9           Internet, for them to help filter out what they think is    10           inappropriate.  So I would like to continue the work that    11           we've begun at Surfwatch.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But there's no assurance to the    13           public, the Government, parents, that your particular company    14           will remain in existence and provide this alternative.  Is    15           that right?    16                    THE WITNESS:  That's probably correct.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  On the other hand, I gather what    18           you're telling us is that the facility exists, so that if you    19           don't do it -- because, with all due respect, one might say    20           you're a small entity in this totality of what we heard the    21           first witness talk about --     22                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- somebody else might do it.    24                    THE WITNESS:  In addition, I think that we --    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well --                                                                           160     1                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- yes or no on that, first.     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  No, that's true.  Someone else     4           might do it.     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And at the moment, you're -- I     6           assume you're paying these college students and one, as I     7           know as a parent of one that just finished, you can't always     8           be sure that they won't be busy doing exams, or other things.      9           Is that correct?    10                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have you ever explored the    12           possibility of contacting parents' groups, and church groups,    13           and other groups that might be interested in this, to notify    14           you of appropriate -- what they would think are words that    15           should be added, or sites that should be added?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.  In fact, we solicit from    17           our customers now to send us information if they find sites    18           that we aren't blocking, so --    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But do you checks those sites    20           before you block them, to see whether your view as to whether    21           they should be blocked, may differ from the view of your    22           volunteer?    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we do.  We check all the sites.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then your subscribers -- is it    25           correct to say that your subscribers are dependent on your                                                                           161     1           view of what may be inappropriate for children?     2                    THE WITNESS:  At this point, yes.     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  I had a couple questions on     5           your declaration.  On page 19 in paragraph 39, you make     6           reference to "parental control software that blocks access to     7           non-Internet sites also is available."  Could you tell me,     8           what is a non-Internet site?     9                    THE WITNESS:  That was in reference to -- there's    10           some bulletin boards, some separate computers that people can    11           dial from their home, directly to a bulletin board.  And    12           there is some software available that will allow you to    13           actually block on specific phone numbers and -- and whatever.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  If you know what those    15           numbers are.    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  I got you.  And on page 20,    18           paragraph 41, you make the statement that 30 percent of    19           Surfwatch blocked sites, "originate outside the United    20           States."  How do you know that?    21                    THE WITNESS:  That's from our actual list of sites    22           that we block, so that number may actually be higher than    23           that.  But of the known sites where we specifically have the    24           name of the site, it's approximately 30 percent of those that    25           come from outside --                                                                           162     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how are you able to tell that     2           they originate outside the United States?     3                    THE WITNESS:  Well, even though today, when I wasn't     4           sure that I came from Paris, many sites actually do have an     5           identifier on them that indicate what country they     6           originated.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So it's based on an actual     8           canvas that you've done --     9                    THE WITNESS:  It's an --     10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- of these sites.    11                    THE WITNESS:  It's an actual address.  We can look    12           at the address, and decide whether it comes from United    13           Kingdom or Finland.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let's assume there's 5,000 blocked    15           sites.  You have actually counted, or your firm has actually    16           counted 1500 -- to wit, 30 percent as being from outside the    17           United States.  Is that correct?    18                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    20                    THE WITNESS:  We didn't count.  We used the    21           computers to help us figure that out, so...    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And last -- two other    23           questions.  You also --    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  The answer's yes.  You may    25           ask.                                                                           163     1                    (Laughter)     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.  You also say at page 31,     3           you make the statement, which I'm curious to know what the     4           source of the information is --     5                    THE WITNESS:  What page was that?     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that 50 percent of the nation's     7           public schools have connected to the Internet.  You cite a     8           survey by the U.S. Department of Education.  Could you be     9           more specific?    10                    THE WITNESS:  What page are you on?    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 14.      12                    THE WITNESS:  14.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Paragraph 31.  And you go on to say    14           that your firm has sold its software to these school    15           districts.  You see the bottom of page 14?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Okay.  We -- this was a survey    17           that was listed in the local paper, that 50 percent of the    18           nation's public schools have connected to the Internet.  That    19           was --    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What percentage of your customers    21           are public schools?    22                    THE WITNESS:  I'd say presently about 70 percent of    23           our customers are public schools.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  70?    25                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.                                                                           164     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Percent.  And lastly, how many     2           units, approximately, have you sold to date?     3                    THE WITNESS:  That is a very difficult number for me     4           to come up with.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's your company.     6                    THE WITNESS:  It is.  I know it's my company.  We     7           sell a certain number from our local office.  We also have     8           retail distribution that goes through a distributor.       9                    And in addition, we have -- we've done a deal called    10           Internet in a Box For Kids, and recently, Family PC Magazine    11           shipped a hundred thousand of these CDs out to families.      12                    So it's really difficult for us to say really how    13           many installed products we have.  We don't actually know that    14           someone's installed until they actually subscribe.  And what    15           we do is we give people a couple of months of free update, so    16           they can get used to the pattern, see how it works.  So we're    17           just beginning to get those figures coming in, since we are    18           such a new company.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So how many subscribers would    20           you say you have now, roughly?    21                    THE WITNESS:  About 1500 subscribers.    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Very good.    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Do you have competitors out    24           there?    25                    THE WITNESS:  We sure do.                                                                           165     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  How many do you have, just     2           roughly?     3                    THE WITNESS:  There are probably four that I know of     4           right now.       5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mm-hmm.     6                    THE WITNESS:  And there are a few others that are     7           lurking, I'm sure.      8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  How do you -- I think you     9           explained how you override the Surfwatch.  Is that through a    10           -- some kind of code?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Basically, it's a password that the    12           parent, or whoever installs the software, puts in.  They make    13           it up when they actually install the software.    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  They make -- they --     15                    THE WITNESS:  They make it up.  It's like your PIN    16           number at your bank.  So you make it up when you install the    17           software, and then you just use that same password.    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Can a clever person get a hold of    19           that somehow, or is there a way of finding that out?    20                    THE WITNESS:  There's no way of --    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Other than the -- other than the    22           parent or --     23                    THE WITNESS:  Parent telling it.    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- revealing it.    25                    THE WITNESS:  There's no -- it's not an easy way.                                                                            166     1           We've taken a lot of effort to try and prevent tampering of     2           the software.  And I'd say in the numbers that we have out     3           there, we've received very few complaints from parents or     4           teachers that the children have disabled the software.     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  That's all.     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have a question.     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you could get the public schools     9           in this country, or private schools -- Catholic schools, for    10           example -- to agree on what was inappropriate material, could    11           they develop their own version of Surfwatch or a blocker?    12                    THE WITNESS:  What we have available today is --    13           because we have this -- different filters available, if you    14           wanted to put together a list of sites that you wanted    15           blocked, and then make that available -- for example, the Boy    16           Scouts of America wanted to put together a list, or the    17           schools wanted to put together a list of sites that they    18           wanted blocked.  We would create a special filter set for the    19           school.  And then, if they had technology like Surfwatch,    20           then they would have access to that specific filter set.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would they need you to make out the    22           filter set?  In other words --    23                    THE WITNESS:  No.  They could --    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- somebody who was -- who knew as    25           much technical -- had as much technical background as your                                                                           167     1           husband, for example, or whoever helped develop this -- I     2           think Mr. Friend, was it, or somebody else -- could they do     3           it, independent of you?     4                    THE WITNESS:  There's two separate issues.  There's     5           actually the software technology that is fairly     6           sophisticated.  But developing the list or the filters, I     7           could do that.  I mean anyone without any technical     8           background could develop the list.  Then they would need that     9           technology to be able to identify those sites that were    10           trying to be accessed, in order to be able to block t hem.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did our questions elicit -- evoke    12           any additional questions from counsel?  Because I -- we don't    13           want --    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.    15                    MR. ENNIS:  No, you Honor.  May I ask your Honors if    16           the witness may be released?    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it's all right with them, sure.    18                    MR. ENNIS:  And since this -- I don't think the    19           Government needs the computer.  It's her personal computer.     20           May she take that with her?    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.  I think that we'll -- it    22           might be an appropriate time to break, and you can take care    23           of all these matters.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Will your next witness be Dr.    25           Hoffman, or -- Back to Hearing Transcripts index Back to Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition WT02-B06-10IA095-001027-B017-55http://www.cdt.org:80/ciec/transcripts/Mar_21_Kuromiya.html 205.177.10.31 19970215013554 text/html 30130HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:34:36 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Testimony of Kiyoshi Kuromiya - 21 Mar 96 Testimony of Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Director of Critical AIDS Path Project.

Okay.    12                    MR. ENNIS:  He's here now, actually.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Fine.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But will he be here tomorrow to --    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, whenever -- with the Court's    16           convenience.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, because we -- I think we have    18           some questions.  Okay.     19                    (Recess taken from 2:55 p.m. to 3:10 p.m.)    20                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Court is now in session.  Please    21           be seated.    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  My name    23           is Christopher Hansen.  I'm one of the lawyers representing    24           the plaintiffs in the ACLU case.  Plaintiffs' next witness is    25           Kiyoshi Kuromiya, the director of the Critical Path AIDS                                                                           169     1           project.  The Government has advised us that they have no     2           desire to cross-examine Mr. Kuromiya, so I would like to     3           first move his declaration into evidence.  His declaration     4           was signed on March 8th, 1996.  It's been previously filed     5           with the Court.  I'd like to move it into evidence for his     6           direct testimony.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's granted.  Do you have any     8           objection?  Before I grant it, we should hear.  Does the     9           Government have any objection?    10                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor, we don't have any    11           objection.    12                    COURT CLERK:  Could you identify yourself for the    13           record?    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, I will.  I'm Patricia Russotto.     15           I represent the Department of Justice as well.    16                    Your Honor, we do not have any cross-examination for    17           Mr. Kuromiya this afternoon.  We do not have any objection to    18           having his declaration admitted into evidence.  However, we    19           do reserve the right to submit deposition testimony.  This    20           witness was deposed over the weekend and we do have -- intend    21           to admit or present to the Court deposition excerpts.  And    22           we're satisfied that those excerpts will sufficiently address    23           the issues that Mr. Kuromiya raises in his declaration.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do the plaintiffs have any    25           objection?                                                                           170     1                    MR. HANSEN:  We do not, your Honor, with the     2           understanding that we could submit alternative pages, if     3           necessary, of the same deposition.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think the Federal Rules always so     5           provide, don't they?     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor --     7                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  The only other --     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You do have an objection?     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I might, your Honor, because it creates    10           a problem for us.  If they put in pages, particular portions    11           of deposition now, we might want to do some live redirect and    12           we wouldn't know what their pages are.  If they could tell us    13           those pages now, we could make that judgment now.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ms. Russotto, could you maybe now    15           give us some idea of the areas or the paragraphs of his    16           declaration that these excerpts would rebut or somehow    17           qualify?    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Your Honor, I'm really not prepared    19           to do that this afternoon.  We're going to be submitting the    20           deposition transcript to address -- to address the areas that    21           have been raised.  I point out that the plaintiffs had the    22           opportunity during the deposition to do redirect testimony    23           and that it was in our view clear during the deposition    24           process that we proceeded with that process on the    25           understanding that some of these depositions would be                                                                           171     1           admitted into evidence or would substitute for actual live     2           testimony during the hearing, and that the plaintiffs did     3           have the opportunity to do that kind of redirect and did not     4           do it.     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Your --     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is the Government finished with its     7           position on this so that we won't go back and forth.  Okay.     8                    Mr. Ennis?     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I don't mean to be raising a possible    10           false alarm.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, go ahead.    12                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it will be perfectly acceptable    13           from our plaintiffs for Mr. Kuromiya to leave the stand and    14           probably whatever we want to put in, other portions of the    15           deposition transcript will probably be just fine.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, okay, you understand that we    17           may have some questions now.    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So you're not going to    20           ask any questions now?    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, we're not.  We would, however,    22           reserve the right to do redirect or recross, rather, in this    23           case if the Court -- depending on what the Court's questions    24           are.  And also I would say that if the plaintiffs feel like    25           we have submitted deposition excerpts that they're not --                                                                           172     1           that they don't believe are representative of the entire     2           deposition, they're certainly free to submit their own     3           excerpts as well.     4                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Sir, would you state and spell     5           your name, please?     6                    THE WITNESS:  My name is Kiyoshi Kuromiya.  That's      7           K-I-Y-O-S-H-I, last name K-U-R-O-M-I-Y-A.     8                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Thank you.  Would you please     9           raise your right hand?    10                    KIYOSHI KUROMIYA, Sworn.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?    12                                 DIRECT EXAMINATION    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Critical Path Project, Incorporated,    14           that's a nonprofit entity?    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, we're a sub S corporation.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A sub S, so it's a for-profit    17           enterprise?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Actually we -- we work through a    19           nonprofit organization, but it's a partnership that we set up    20           by very early on.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A partnership with whom?    22                    THE WITNESS:  An individual who is no longer around.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And the Critical Path AIDS    24           Project, is that just a division or is that a sub 501(c)3    25           organization, nonprofit tax exempt organization?                                                                           173     1                    THE WITNESS:  We work through AIDS Information     2           Network of Philadelphia who handle our financial affairs.      3           We're a small organization, one employing myself and one     4           part-time technical person.     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  If you could look on page     6           two, paragraph six of your declaration, do you have it there?     7                    THE WITNESS:  I don't.     8                    (Pause in proceedings.)     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm very curious to know, how    10           exactly does the technology work?  How do you build up this    11           access to, as you say here, thousands of data bases that go    12           through your Web page?  Could you just explain that to me?    13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  We began in 1989 with a 24-hour    14           AIDS treatment hotline, specifically for persons with AIDS.     15           And we felt that we could provide the kinds of information    16           that persons with AIDS could not get from other sources.  I    17           am a person with AIDS myself, and I am also a primary care    18           provider.    19                    We began in 1992 with a small computer bulletin    20           board system.  We have about 1500 people registered under    21           that system.  We found it was quite effective in getting    22           information out, both prevention and treatment information to    23           individuals.    24                    We also found it important in providing data that    25           was not easily accessible from other sources, such as full-                                                                           174     1           text clinical trials information and information on     2           alternative treatments.  And we found that neither Government     3           sources nor clinicians within the community were able to     4           provide that kind of information, so we found it very useful.     5                    From that point we began expanding the number of     6           people who were on our system, and in May of '95 we set up a     7           Web site and later last year we became an Internet service     8           provider.  We host a number of Web pages through our system.      9           We provide free Internet access for both individuals and    10           grass roots organizations in the Philadelphia area who might    11           not otherwise be able to access this information.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So what your Web page links do is    13           they provide the people who are interested in this site and    14           the information with a free access to all this information;    15           is that correct?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And in addition to the information    18           that you physically assembled yourself, what I'm trying to    19           get at is you seem to have entered into a number of    20           arrangements, thousands of them, with institutions including    21           research institutions, correct?    22                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you do that?  I'm just    24           wondering how hard it is to do that and how you go about    25           doing that.                                                                           175     1                    THE WITNESS:  It's very easy.  For example, for     2           someone that wants to locate information at specific research     3           institutions, we might link to the biosciences database of     4           links at Harvard University.  And there are many hundreds of     5           links on that one site.  Through that we have access to     6           research institutions all over the world.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you --     8                    THE WITNESS:  For chemistry sites, we would access     9           them through UCLA.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you get the access?  I    11           mean how do you physically do that?  Do you write them, do    12           you call them on the telephone?    13                    THE WITNESS:  I write the HTML code and we include    14           that database or that set of links or single links or a    15           particular document, whatever it is, that's available on the    16           Internet and provide it for people who use our system.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you say here that you average at    18           least in the month from February 4 through March 4 of 1996    19           3,300 accesses per day?    20                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, since February 8th,    22           1996, when President Clinton signed the law in question here,    23           when he signed that legislation?    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have you all changed anything in the                                                                           176     1           way you communicate information to users?     2                    THE WITNESS:  No.  We're constantly updating our Web     3           site, but no, we haven't changed anything.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And if this panel were to find that     5           the law was constitutional, okay, would you have to make any     6           changes in the way you operate?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm not sure how to interpret     8           that law.  I do not know what indecent means.  I don't know     9           what patently offensive means in terms of providing life    10           saving and life promoting information to persons with AIDS or    11           persons at high risk for contracting AIDS, including    12           teenagers.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That is, people under 18?    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, I don't think you've answered my    16           question.  You don't know how you would change or you do know    17           how you'd change?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, my -- as a person with AIDS,    19           first and foremost is my mission to provide easily    20           accessible, easy to understand information for people who are    21           either infected with AIDS or at high risk for contracting    22           AIDS.  We see that it is a growing situation.  The White    23           House issued last week a report on the growing epidemic among    24           young people in this country.  We also know that it's the    25           leading cause of death for people between the ages of 25 and                                                                           177     1           44 in this country and in other countries, and particularly     2           in minority communities and communities that I'm interested     3           in providing this information for.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So do I interpret your answer as     5           saying that you will just take the risk that you'll be     6           prosecuted, or will you change something?     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't know how to interpret.      8           I don't know how this Court interprets the indecency and     9           patently offensive.  I personally find this life-saving    10           information.  I don't know how it could be interpreted    11           otherwise.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Fine.  That's all I have.    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I have no questions.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have only one.  Did this White    15           House report provide any information as to the number of    16           people who are HIV positive below the age of 18 in this    17           country?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, basically what we get from this    19           report is the fact that something like 25 percent of all the    20           people infected with HIV in this country which is    21           approximately one million people, although that may be    22           undercounting somewhat.  25 percent of those individuals were    23           infected while they were very young, either below the age of    24           18 or shortly thereafter.    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your statistics I thought in your                                                                           178     1           affidavit went up to 20 something, and I'm trying to, since     2           our interest here is in young people --     3                    THE WITNESS:  Well --     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you don't know, just please say     5           you don't know.  I'm not trying to --     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's paragraph 22.     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I --     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me, let me finish the     9           question.  But that was to the age of 20 and then you go on    10           to the age of 15 to 24 throughout the world, and I'm really    11           asking about our universe here, which is this country and    12           below the age of 18.  And all I want to know is do we have    13           figures that are segregated that show the number of people    14           below that age who currently are infected with -- who are HIV    15           positive.    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  We do have some information.  I    17           can provide the Court with some of that information.  On the    18           other hand, I must say that HIV is a disease that extends    19           over a long period of time.  A person does not show any    20           symptoms for something between seven and ten years after    21           infection.  That's why I provided the figures that extended    22           up into the early 20s.    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.  Have our    24           questions elicited any questions from counsel?    25                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, one or two, your Honor.                                                                           179     1                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION     2           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:     3           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Kuromiya.  I just want to ask you a     4           couple of questions to pick up on some of the questions that     5           the judges have asked you here.     6           A   Yes.     7           Q   I believe you had been asked about how exactly your     8           organization links to other organizations.  That's through a     9           hypertext link, correct?    10           A   That's correct.    11           Q   So that's something you would just click on.  It comes up    12           on your screen as a highlighted, in a color, and you just    13           click on that --    14           A   Yes.    15           Q   -- and that takes you to another location, right?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   And you write the HTML code yourself for those hot links?    18           A   I do.    19           Q   And you taught yourself to write HTML code, right?    20           A   That's correct.    21           Q   And that's something that it's your understanding is    22           going to become easier as new software comes out to help    23           people write HTML code, right?    24           A   Probably.    25           Q   You're aware that there is that software that's coming                                                                           180     1           out, though, right?     2           A   There's a lot of software coming out making it easier and     3           easier, yes.     4           Q   Let me ask you also about a statement in paragraph five     5           of your declaration.  Do you have a copy of your declaration     6           in front of you?     7           A   Yes.     8           Q   Where you talk about your Web pages during the period     9           from February 4, 1996 to March 4, 1996 were accessed    10           approximately 98,000 times average 3300 times per day.  Does    11           that tran -- are you talking about 3300 hits there?    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   How are those measured?    14           A   Those are measured when someone calls up under their    15           screen a document on our site or accesses our site from    16           another site.    17           Q   Okay.      18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Nothing further, your Honor.    19                    MR. HANSEN:  No further questions, your Honor.    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.    21                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  One other question, following up on    23           a question Mr. -- were you here this morning?    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That Mr. Baron was asking and Mr.                                                                           181     1           Brenner.  When there was talk about encoding your URL with a     2           self rating system, did you hear that testimony?     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I did.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And to use the motion picture     5           parlance, that NC17, R, PG13, that sort of thing, okay?      6           Let's just use that for my hypothetical, all right?  Would     7           you agree that there's material in your Web site that would     8           be NC17?     9                    THE WITNESS:  No.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you would not -- if you were    11           required to self rate your system, you would not self rate it    12           NC17?    13                    THE WITNESS:  No.  Our material is designed for all    14           ages and it may be explicit, but it's information that's    15           necessary to protect oneself from contracting a sexually    16           transmitted disease.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I'm getting at.  You    18           would not want, affirmatively, you would not want to rate    19           your Web page in such a way that young people could not    20           access it?    21                    THE WITNESS:  I would not want to deny young people    22           access to information that was necessary to protect them from    23           infection from a potentially fatal disease.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, that's what I'm getting at.  So    25           even if somebody told you you should do that, you wouldn't do                                                                           182     1           it.     2                    THE WITNESS:  I can only repeat what I said.  I know     3           the difficulties of living with this disease.  I've been     4           infected for something like 15 years, and have had full-blown     5           AIDS by the CDC definition since 1993.  And yes, I would want     6           to protect people who are potentially going to contract HIV     7           and we know that from current Government statistics that two-     8           thirds of all high school students are sexually active.  And     9           so yes, we're providing the information for people who are    10           sexually active and are potentially exposing themselves,    11           maybe because of lack of information or the lack of a source    12           where they can get anonymously information that they need to    13           protect themselves.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Just so I understand and I think we    16           put on the table what you're talking about that might    17           potentially come -- that some people might think come within    18           the statute are safe sex practices.  Is that really what    19           we're talking about?    20                    THE WITNESS:  We're talking about safer sex    21           practices and descriptions of those practices and how to    22           protect oneself from HIV infection or infection from other    23           sexually transmitted diseases.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's the universe of what you    25           think is potentially at risk in the material for which you                                                                           183     1           are the source?     2                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't -- someone might find     3           material that we find very important as being offensive to     4           them.  I have no control over that.  So that would --     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I'm just trying to find out     6           what we're talking about.  And what we're talking about then     7           are certain kinds of sexual practices and maybe some body     8           parts, and is that the limit of what we're talking about?     9                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  That's correct.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The depiction of body parts?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Possibly.    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, if I might ask one follow-    14           up question based on the Court's question.    15                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION    16           BY MR. HANSEN:    17           Q   Mr. Kuromiya, when your site discusses safer sex    18           practices, what language do you use to explain to people how    19           to use those safer sex practices?    20           A   We use language that they will understand.  I think that    21           this may create a problem for some people, since people may    22           not have the education to understand clinical language.  So    23           we may use street language, we may use colloquial language in    24           describing the -- what is high risk behavior and how to    25           protect oneself.                                                                           184     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you.  Thank you, your Honor.     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  One more question.  I was just     3           wondering if you make any effort not to use colloquial     4           language over the years?  Do you try in any way to explain     5           the proper terminology?     6                    THE WITNESS:  My experience comes from --     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand what you mean by     8           street language, and it's much easier to explain that way     9           than by using the technical terms, I fully understand that.     10           But --    11                    THE WITNESS:  My experience comes from what I'm able    12           to -- what communicates via my hotline.  I have for over six    13           years answered something like 10 to 20 hotline calls from    14           very concerned individuals of varying ages --    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I just asked simply the    16           question do you make any effort what the proper --    17                    THE WITNESS:  I use whatever language is appropriate    18           to communicate to that individual.  And I don't go out of my    19           way to use street language.    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  All right, I'm just curious.  All    21           right, thank you.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Gentlemen, ladies?  No.     23           Thank you very much.    24                    (Witness excused.)

BEESON:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  I am Ann                                                                           185     1           Beeson and I'm another of the attorneys for the ACLU     2           plaintiffs in this case.  And we now call as our next witness     3           Patricia Nell Warren.     4                    We have been informed by the Government that they do     5           not wish to cross-examine Ms. Warren, and so we therefore     6           offer into evidence the affidavit which she signed on the     7           15th of March and which was filed in this case on the 19th.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection by the     9           Government?    10                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor, this is basically the    11           same situation as with Mr. Kuromiya.  We're prepared to    12           accept the declaration being entered into evidence, but    13           subject to our ability to submit deposition testimony.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is there any objection to that    15           by the plaintiffs?    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection.    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, fine.    18                    MS. BEESON:  We now make her available for the Court    19           to question, if they wish.    20                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Good afternoon, ma'am.  Would you    21           please state and spell your name for the record?    22                    THE WITNESS:  Patricia, P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A, Nell, N-E-    23           L-L, Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N.    24                    PATRICIA NELL WARREN, Affirmed.    25                                 DIRECT EXAMINATION                                                                           186     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ms. Warren, one thing I'm not clear     2           about with respect to Wildcat Press, you are -- you have an     3           interest in Wildcat Press, as I understand in your     4           declaration?     5                    THE WITNESS:   A little bit of history, I am an     6           author that has published a number of books over the years     7           and I recently made a decision to go independent and to     8           publish my own books instead of relying on trade publishers.      9           So Wildcat Press is my own company co-owned with a business    10           partner.  I publish my own books, new books, old books,    11           getting them back in print.  We will also publish books by    12           other people.  It is what is referred to in the trade as a    13           small press.    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, Wildcat Press as you say    15           in your declaration has a Web site, right?    16                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, your books, let's just talk    18           about your books.  What do you have on that site, excerpts?     19           I wasn't clear.  Or chapters or summaries or what about your    20           books?    21                    THE WITNESS:  We do two things with the Web site.     22           One, it's a place where people can come, they can learn more    23           about the company, my books, what they're about.  They can    24           also buy books directly off of the Web site through a credit    25           card ordering apparatus.  So there are two excerpts, the                                                                           187     1           first chapters from two of my best-known books that are     2           available for people to access and read and possibly interest     3           them in buying the books.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, and how long are those     5           excerpts?     6                    THE WITNESS:  They are -- consist of the entire     7           first chapters of the books, so they are like one long     8           subpage.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So I guess as the copyright owner at    10           least of those books you could make a decision, could you    11           not, to put your whole book on line?    12                    THE WITNESS:  I could.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would you ever do that?    14                    THE WITNESS:  If I thought it was a good idea, I    15           definitely could do that.    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  But at this point you're    17           using the on line service to sell books, correct?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You mention in your declaration that    20           the credit card company, as I understand it, charges a dollar    21           service fee --    22                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- for processing.  Is that for the    24           verification, as a fee for that, or what is that dollar?    25                    THE WITNESS:  That is the fee for the -- that we are                                                                           188     1           charged for each user who wants to log into that particular     2           feature and use their credit card.  It's a secure ordering     3           device.  I believe there are several on the market.  This one     4           is called First Virtual, which they can use a MasterCard or     5           Visa credit card.  And we pay a fee for them to use that each     6           time it occurs.     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Were you here this morning?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You may have heard a lot of colloquy    10           about verifying credit cards.  At your Web site, can you    11           verify on line or do you have to go off line to verify?    12                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not a technical person, and I'm    13           not actually the technical person that runs this whole thing,    14           so I can't tell you exactly how it works, but it is handled    15           by the server that we operate off of, which is Southern    16           California Gay Wired, and they're the ones that process it.     17           That's mostly what I can tell you.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So this server, Gay Wired,    19           handles all of that for your company?    20                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Another line of questions I have for    22           you that I'm very curious about, you say at paragraph 17 of    23           your declaration that you've helped create an on line    24           magazine, an E-zine as you call it called Youth Arts; is that    25           correct?                                                                           189     1                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you said that you've also     3           created print magazines, a print magazine called Campus     4           Courier; is that correct?     5                    THE WITNESS:   I assisted in creating that.      6           Actually it never came to fruition, but that was many years     7           ago.     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, let me ask you this.  This is     9           what I'm most curious about.  Is it easier to start an E-zine    10           than a print magazine?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Why is that?    13                    THE WITNESS:  Because the material costs of putting    14           out a print magazine, standard print media, you're looking at    15           all of the costs of photography, and art and paper costs and    16           printing costs and so forth.  It generally is much more    17           expensive than the cost of putting up a publication on line.    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And where is the E-zine posted?  How    19           do you access it?    20                    THE WITNESS:  Through a URL.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Thank you.    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Buckwalter.    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I'm still looking through --    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Is it accurate that your    25           material would be considered gay and lesbian literature, the                                                                           190     1           material that you authored?  I gathered that from the     2           declaration, is that correct?     3                    THE WITNESS:  Are you asking about my personal     4           writing?     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your personal books, yes.     6                    THE WITNESS:  Not all of my books, but most of what     7           I'm known for would be called gay literature.     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And would that include also books     9           like Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms and some other    10           books by Truman Capote?    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, let me -- I'd like to make sure    12           I understand your question you're asking.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would that be considered gay and    14           lesbian literature?    15                    THE WITNESS:  I haven't read that particular book,    16           but it has been mentioned in that connection, as far as I    17           remember.    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is it your understanding that    19           literature in that genre might be viewed as subject to the    20           two provisions of the statute that are at issue in this case?    21                    THE WITNESS:  I'm concerned about people in this    22           country who view the entire subject of writing about gay and    23           lesbian life as patently offensive.  Their opinions and    24           feelings go way beyond the questions of the seven dirty words    25           of the FCC, and I am concerned that there could conceivably                                                                           191     1           be complaints made on the basis that the entire subject     2           matter is patently offensive.     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And at the moment to your knowledge     4           is such literature available to young people in public     5           libraries, people under 18?     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And you're concerned about     9           patently offensive, even with the extra language that's added    10           in this statute there?  I mean it just doesn't say patently    11           offensive, it says patently offensive, sexual or excretory    12           activities or organs.  Is that still a concern to you?    13                    THE WITNESS:  My concern is with how some individual    14           or group of individuals might choose to interpret that in the    15           course of bringing charges against me with the Justice    16           Department.    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  I don't think I have any    18           other questions.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have our questions elicited any    20           questions from counsel?    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor.    22                    MR. HANSEN:  No, your Honor.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you for coming up.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.    25                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.                                                                           192     1                    (Witness excused.)

Stayton - 21 Mar 96 Testimony of Dr. William R. Stayton, psychologist March 21, 1996                                                                            192     1                    (Witness excused.)     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, there are two additional     3           witnesses that we -- whose declarations we have proffered.      4           We were advised -- that is, Christine Soto and Hunter Allen.      5           We were advised by the Government that they neither wish to     6           depose nor to cross-examine either of those witnesses.  They     7           are both young people who are members of Youth Arts News, the     8           E-zine that Ms. Warren runs.  Because of their age we have     9           not brought them to Philadelphia.  We can make them available    10           if the Court wishes, but at this point I'd like to move their    11           declarations into evidence.  The declarations were previously    12           filed.  They were attested to on March 7, 1996.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll hear from the Government.    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  We have no objection, your Honor.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then that will be admitted.  Is    16           that it?    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I have no desire to have them    18           here.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  We have no desire to proceed    20           with them.  Thank you.  No questions from the Court.    21                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.  In that case,    22           the plaintiffs' next witness is Dr. William Stayton.    23                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Good afternoon.  Will you please    24           state and spell your name for the record?    25                    THE WITNESS:  William --                                                                           193     1                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Will you please move over and     2           stand close to the mike?     3                    THE WITNESS:  William ...     4                    MR. HANSEN:  It appears we have one minor     5           housekeeping problem.  If we might have just one moment, your     6           Honors?     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Of course.     8                    (Pause in proceedings.)     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, we would just note for    10           the record that the witness is being called out of order.  We    11           had been told a different order, and we will not object, but    12           we had prepared for a different witness for this time, and    13           now since we have the burden to go forward with the cross-    14           examination, we have to change our preparation.    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me just ask you, are you    16           prepared to go forward, or did you -- because I gather this    17           witness is from another city.    18                    MR. HANSEN:  This witness is from Philadelphia.    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, he's --    20                    MR. HANSEN:  He has a 4:15 class which I'm --    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  He has a 4:15 class --    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Or a 4:30 class which I'm trying to    23           help him with, if possible.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Hansen and Mr. Ennis, in view of    25           the constraints on Dr. Stayton's time as well as Mr.                                                                           194     1           Coppolino's concerns, Mr. Croneberger is here, is he not?     2                    MR. HANSEN:  He is.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you said to us before we started     4           that the Government, at least at that time, had not intended     5           to cross-examine him.  I certainly have some questions.  I     6           believe my colleagues do.  Could we use the time productively     7           with Mr. Croneberger?     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Mr. Croneberger is Mr. Ennis' witness,     9           your Honor.  I'll let him respond.    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, that would be fine with the    12           ALA plaintiffs.  But my understanding is the Government was    13           expecting the next witness to be Donna Hoffman.  And I don't    14           care --    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But she'll go on tomorrow, I mean,    16           so the Government surely isn't prejudiced by that.    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, that's fine.  If the Court    18           would prefer Mr. Croneberger now, that's fine with us.    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just so we use the time    20           productively, that's all.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right with Mr. Stayton,    22           Dr. Stayton?    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I would like Dr. Stayton not to    24           have to come back tomorrow.  I'd like to --    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, counsel is not prepared to                                                                           195     1           cross-examine him based on this.     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We don't object, we'll go forward.     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's that?     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It's out of order, but we'd rather     5           go forward with Mr. Stayton now than any other --     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  Well, okay, fine.  We're     7           just trying to be accommodating to you.     8                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Will you now state your name?     9                    (Much laughter.)    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Touche.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Touche.    12                    THE WITNESS:  It is still William R. Stayton, S-T-A-    13           Y-T-O-N.  (Laughter.)    14                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  And would you please raise your    15           right hand?    16                    WILLIAM R. STAYTON, Sworn.    17                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Thank you.  Please be seated.    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honors, I move into evidence    19           the declaration of William R. Stayton, attested to on     20           March 14, 1996, and previously filed as his direct testimony.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection by the    22           Government?    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No objection, your Honor, subject to    24           cross-examination, of course.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I have a question for Mr.                                                                           196     1           Hansen.  What exactly -- I assume that Dr. Stayton is being     2           offered as an expert witness?     3                    MR. HANSEN:  That's correct, your Honor.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And it's not exactly clear to me the     5           precise areas of expertise he's being offered for.     6                    MR. HANSEN:  He's being offered for the value, to     7           testify concerning the value of material about sex for     8           minors.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The value of material about sex --    10                    MR. HANSEN:  For minors.    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Social utility, in other words?    12                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, that's correct, your Honor.    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, having specified that,    14           Ms. Russotto, do you have any voir dire that you'd like to    15           ask?    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Not at this time, your Honor,    17           although we would ask some latitude to explore the bases for    18           Mr. Stayton's opinions about the availability and    19           appropriateness of certain sexually explicit material for    20           minors.    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  But you don't object to him    22           offering opinions in this area of expertise?    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, I do not.    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine.  That's all we needed to    25           know for now.  Of course you can ask those questions.                                                                           197     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.     2                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION     3           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:     4           Q   Good afternoon, Dr. Stayton.     5           A   Good afternoon.     6           Q   Dr. Stayton, you are a psychologist and sex therapist     7           here in the Philadelphia area; is that right?     8           A   That is correct.     9           Q   And your current practice includes about 20 clients a    10           week; is that right?    11           A   That is correct.    12           Q   And your practice is now almost exclusively adult    13           couples; is that correct?    14           A   That is correct.    15           Q   You have maybe one or two minors, right?    16           A   That is correct.    17           Q   But mostly adults.    18           A   That is correct.    19           Q   In preparation for your testimony here today, you have    20           reviewed the affidavits that have been filed by the    21           plaintiffs in the ACLU action; is that right?    22           A   That's correct.    23           Q   And I believe you've also reviewed some information from    24           the Web sites of two of the ACLU plaintiffs; is that correct?    25           A   That's correct.                                                                           198     1           Q   And those would be Stop Prison Rape, that's one?     2           A   Yes.     3           Q   And the Safer Sex Page?     4           A   Yes.     5           Q   From what you've read of the plaintiffs' materials, the     6           information that they've made available on the Internet     7           covers a variety of issues regarding human sexuality, doesn't     8           it?     9           A   Yes, it does.    10           Q   For example, the Safer Sex Page includes information    11           about safer -- safe sex practices, right?    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   And it of course talks about sexual activities in that    14           context as well, correct?    15           A   That's correct.    16           Q   And these would include things like information about    17           conception, right?    18           A   Yes.    19           Q   Information about birth control?    20           A   Yes.    21           Q   Safer sex?    22           A   Yes.    23           Q   AIDS?    24           A   Practices, mm-hmm.    25           Q   Yes, safer sex practices, yes.                                                                           199     1           A   Mm-hmm.     2           Q   And the Stop Prisoner Rape page would contain information     3           about -- explicit information about prison rape, correct?     4           A   That's correct.     5           Q   And the Critical Path AIDS Project as we've heard from     6           Mr. Kuromiya contains information about AIDS as well, right?     7           A   That's correct.     8           Q   And you've reviewed all of those, correct?     9           A   That's correct.    10           Q   Now, in your view, these discussions of sex and sexuality    11           that we've been talking about, that's information that is    12           valuable for minors to have, correct?    13           A   I believe so, yes.    14           Q   And it's information that you believe is valuable because    15           of its educational value, right?    16           A   Yes.    17           Q   And you'd agree, wouldn't you, that it's important to    18           provide minors with accurate information about sex and    19           sexuality, right?    20           A   Right.    21           Q   In fact, providing accurate information about sex and    22           sexuality can actually prevent minors from making bad choices    23           about those issues, right?    24           A   That's correct.    25           Q   So providing inaccurate information, inaccurate                                                                           200     1           information about sex and human sexuality, that could     2           actually be harmful to minors, couldn't it?     3           A   Giving them inaccurate --     4           Q   Giving them inaccurate information.     5           A   Could not be helpful, right.     6           Q   Right.  Now, Dr. Stayton, you're familiar with Playboy     7           Magazine, aren't you?     8           A   Yes.     9           Q   And you're familiar with Penthouse, right?    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   And Hustler?    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   And you're aware that these magazines contain sexually    14           explicit images, mostly of women, correct?    15           A   That's correct.    16           Q   In your opinion, viewing these types of sexually explicit    17           pictures is not harmful to minors, right?    18           A   I believe that's true.    19           Q   But you'd still prefer that your children didn't see    20           them, right?    21           A   Playboy and Penthouse and --    22           Q   Yes.    23           A   No, it doesn't matter to me.    24           Q   It doesn't matter to you?  Dr. Stayton, do you recall    25           that I took your deposition --                                                                           201     1           A   Right.     2           Q   -- on a Sunday afternoon, correct?     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I'm going to approach with a copy.     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.     5           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:     6           Q   And would you turn to page 58 of that deposition, please?     7           A   Mm-hmm.     8           Q   Do you recall that we were discussing some films that you     9           use in your therapy class, correct?  You recall that we were    10           discussing some films --    11           A   Yes, yes.    12           Q   And I had asked you whether or not -- and you had said    13           that it would be valuable to minors to show those types -- to    14           show the films in a -- I'm sorry, let me strike that.    15                    I had asked you if it was valuable to show certain    16           types of sexually explicit films to minors, right?    17           A   Yes.    18           Q   And I had also asked you whether or not it was important    19           that those films be shown in an educational context, correct?    20           A   Correct.    21           Q   Okay.  And I asked you, quote, and this is at the bottom    22           of page 58, "What if it were not shown in an educational kind    23           of context?"  And you answered me, "Most often it is.  Most    24           often -- you know, kids get together and they show their    25           magazines and that stuff, and they show stuff I wouldn't want                                                                           202     1           my kid to see, but they see it.  I would much rather it come     2           in the context of my being able to interpret it and talk     3           about it and answer questions about it.  I think children     4           often see material I would prefer my kids not to see, but I     5           don't have any control over that."     6                    So this is material you would prefer your kids     7           didn't see, isn't it?     8           A   There is material I would prefer them not to see.  That's     9           not a blanket that I don't want them to see any of the    10           material or the material that you mentioned from like    11           Playboy.    12           Q   Dr. Stayton --    13           A   Yes.    14           Q   -- do you have a set of the defendant's exhibits at the    15           desk?  They should be at your feet there, I'm sorry.  Let me    16           ask you, the second volume, the one that should be marked 46    17           to 89.    18           A   Okay.    19                    MR. HANSEN:  If I might, your Honor, plaintiffs have    20           not been supplied a copy with these exhibits.    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Oh, I'm sorry.    22           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:    23           Q   May I ask you to take a look at Defendant's Exhibits 70    24           through 77.    25           A   Okay.                                                                           203     1           Q   And you recall that -- well, take a look at them and let     2           me know when you've reviewed them.     3           A   I've seen these.     4           Q   Okay.  You recall that these are the same photographs     5           that we talked about during your deposition on Sunday,     6           correct?     7           A   That's correct.     8           Q   Okay.  Now, you would agree, wouldn't you, that these are     9           images of nude women in a variety of sexually explicit poses,    10           correct?    11           A   That's correct.    12           Q   And you'd agree also, wouldn't you, that these images do    13           not depict a healthy view of women as healthy sexual beings,    14           right?    15           A   I don't know about the word "as healthy sexual beings."     16           I don't know anything about them --    17           Q   Well, let me rephrase it then.  You would agree, wouldn't    18           you, that these images don't depict a healthy view of women    19           as sexual beings, do you?  Isn't that right?    20           A   I think the women are often exploited, yes.    21           Q   And you'd also agree that pictures like these reflect a    22           socialization process that use women as sex objects, right?    23           A   They can, but it's only one part of all the input that    24           they get.    25           Q   You would also agree, wouldn't you, that these sexually                                                                           204     1           suggestive images of women do not depict real life?  They're     2           not representative of the real world.     3           A   It depends upon whose world.  If a person is -- this is     4           all they see, then it would be a part of their real world in     5           terms of what they viewed.  It's not a part of their real     6           world in terms of I don't know what kind of input they get     7           from other sources.     8           Q   All right, well, let me go back to your deposition     9           testimony --    10           A   Sure.    11           Q   -- on page 127.  You recall that we were talking about    12           these very images.  And I asked you what you meant, and you    13           said that this fits into the socialization process.  I'm    14           sorry, I'm at line 10 on 127.    15           A   Right.    16           Q   What do you mean, you said this fits into the    17           socialization process?  What do you mean by that and by    18           "this" you're talking about the exhibits.  You said, "The    19           exhibits, I want my children or all children to have a    20           healthy view of women as sexual beings and of men as sexual    21           beings.    22                    "Question:  What is it about those pictures that you    23           think may not promote a healthy view of women and men as    24           healthy sexual beings?      25                    "Well, it's so typical of the way people are                                                                           205     1           socialized that women are like sex objects.  You know, this     2           just doesn't depict real life."     3                    That's accurate, right?     4           A   Yes, that's accurate.     5           Q   And yet you don't believe that exposing minors to these     6           types of sexually explicit images is harmful to them, do you?     7           A   Not in and of itself, no.     8           Q   And you don't think that minors would be socialized to     9           view women as sex objects by exposure to these kinds of    10           images?    11           A   No.  They're going to get that from other parts of their    12           input, from family, society, peer group.    13           Q   And you don't believe, though, that these pictures would    14           have any -- would be a factor in socializing people to view    15           women as sex objects?    16           A   In and of itself, no.  As a part of a total kind of    17           input, it's a factor.    18           Q   And you don't believe that minors viewing these images    19           would be misled into believing that they do depict real life,    20           do you?    21           A   Not if they're getting different information from outside    22           of these.    23           Q   So in your view there's no harm in allowing a ten-year-    24           old to see these kinds of sexually explicit images?    25           A   There's nothing inherently, right.                                                                           206     1           Q   I'm sorry, there's nothing inherently harmful about those     2           images?     3           A   Harmful about these images.     4           Q   In your view there's no harm in allowing an eight-year-     5           old to see those images, is there?     6           A   There's nothing inherently harmful about sex.     7           Q   I'm not -- well, okay.  I asked you about whether there     8           was anything inherently harmful --     9           A   About these pictures.    10           Q   -- about viewing those images.    11           A   No, there's nothing inherently harmful.    12           Q   And you wouldn't have a problem if a six-year-old was    13           exposed to those kinds of sexually explicit images, would    14           you?    15           A   No.  I would want to be the one to give my value system    16           as I worked with my six-year-old or a six-year-old.  But    17           there's nothing inherently harmful that would hurt a six-    18           year-old.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people have    19           seen pictures like this and never been harmed.    20           Q   Well, Dr. Stayton, you've never actually done any    21           research into whether or not minors viewing these kind of    22           pictures that can be downloaded from the Internet is harmful    23           to them, have you?    24           A   No, this is not a part of my research, right.    25           Q   And, Dr. Stayton, we were discussing a moment ago some                                                                           207     1           films that you use in your sex therapy.  And I believe that     2           you had told me during your deposition that those films     3           involved depictions of sexual intercourse; is that right?     4           A   Some of them do.  I -- a pharmaceutical company 20 years     5           ago made a series of sex therapy films for us using real     6           people in real situations, and I use these with couples.  And     7           it starts with -- it's really a process of helping them to     8           become sexually functional through offering them ways of     9           pleasuring their partner, first non-genitally and then    10           genitally and then through ways of having intercourse.    11           Q   And these are sexually explicit films, right?    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   And they do depict explicitly acts of sexual intercourse.    14           A   They depict -- there's a film that does, when we get to    15           that part of the therapy process.  But in the beginning it's    16           how to do a face caress.  How to caress a person's body and    17           give pleasure.  Things that, you know, lead up to being a    18           good lover through intercourse.    19           Q   And these films also contain explicit depictions of oral    20           sex as well, don't they?    21           A   We have films that do.  It's not a part of the regular    22           process.  A lot of couples will ask about oral sex, and we    23           then can show them a film that talks about oral sex, tells    24           them whether it's healthy or how it's healthy, et cetera, so    25           that they can be instructed.                                                                           208     1           Q   And these films that you've been talking about that do     2           have the explicit depictions of sexual activity, you believe     3           that it would be -- that it would not be harmful to show     4           those to minors, right?     5           A   No, right.     6           Q   And so you believe it would be appropriate to show those     7           films -- or would not be harmful to show those films to a 12-     8           year-old.     9           A   Right, or if a 12-year-old saw them.  I don't think it    10           would do harm.      11           Q   And it would be all right --    12           A   I don't think I would take a show 12-year-olds, in fact,    13           it's against the law.  I wouldn't do it.    14           Q   But you think it would do no harm if they did see it?    15           A   Absolutely it wouldn't.    16           Q   And you think it would be appropriate for a 10-year-old    17           to see those films?    18           A   Yeah.  My five-year-old saw them, when he was five years    19           old.    20           Q   Now, Dr. Stayton, you are familiar, are you not, with the    21           Attorney General's Commission on Pornography Final Report    22           dated July 1986, correct?    23           A   Yes, I am.    24           Q   Okay.  Would you please turn to Defendant's Exhibit 80?    25           A   Yes.                                                                           209     1           Q   Would you please turn to page 343 of that study.     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What page?     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  343, your Honor.     4           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:     5           Q   And just so the record is clear, this is a section of the     6           Attorney General's Commission on Pornography Final Report,     7           July 1986.  It's from the main body of the report.  It deals     8           with nonviolent and nondegrading sexually explicit materials.     9                    Now, on page 343 of the report the Commission begins    10           discussing the potential harm to children from exposure to    11           pornography, isn't that right?    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   And the Commission in the first sentence states, and    14           looking at the first full paragraph of 343, "Perhaps the most    15           significant potential harm in this category is with respect    16           to children.  We all agree that at least much, probably most,    17           and maybe even all material in this category, regardless of    18           whether it is harmful when used by adults only is harmful    19           when it falls into the hands of children."      20                    Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Stayton?    21           A   I do not.    22           Q   Okay, let me ask you to turn to page 344.  And again I'm    23           looking at the first full paragraph.  "We have little doubt,"    24           the Commission states, "We have little doubt that much of    25           this material does find its way into the hands of children,                                                                           210     1           and to the extent that it does, we all agree that it is     2           harmful."  Do you agree with that conclusion of the     3           Commission?     4           A   I do not agree.     5           Q   And in the next sentence the Commission states, "We may     6           disagree about the extent to which people should as adults be     7           tolerate" -- I'm sorry.  "We may disagree about the extent to     8           which people should as adults be tolerated in engaging in     9           sexual practices that differ from the norm, but we all agree    10           about the question of the desirability of exposing children    11           to most of this material.  And on that our unanimous    12           agreement is that it is undesirable."      13                    Do you agree with that statement?    14           A   I do not agree with that statement.    15           Q   And then skipping down one sentence the Commission    16           states, "We may disagree among ourselves about the extent to    17           which the effect on children should justify large scale    18           restrictions for that reason alone, but again we all agree    19           that if the question is simply harm and not the question of    20           regulation by law that material in this category is, with few    21           exceptions, generally harmful to the extent it finds its way    22           into the hands of children."    23                    Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Stayton?    24           A   I do not agree with that statement.    25                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I don't have anything further.                                                                           211     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Is there any redirect?     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, please, your Honor.     3                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION     4           BY MR. HANSEN:     5           Q   Dr. Stayton, the Government began by asking you about the     6           composition of your current clinical practice and its     7           relationship to minors.  I'd like to have you explain what     8           your experience has been in terms of sex education     9           specifically with respect to minors.    10           A   I'm a clergyperson.  And I started out my first six years    11           through seminary and after as a youth minister, where I had    12           charge of the entire program of a fairly large church.  I    13           then had my own parish which was in Gloucester,    14           Massachusetts, and there I also had the young people, as well    15           as being the pastor of the church.  It was a small church.     16           And they asked me if I would have a sex education course for    17           them.  I took what I had done with my youth at the church    18           where I was a youth minister in the area of sex education and    19           built a program where within a year I was going all over New    20           England setting up sex education courses for churches and    21           synagogues throughout the area.    22                    I then started teaching on the seminary level and in    23           a nursing school, and there they asked me if I would teach    24           human sexuality education.  On the basis of this, getting    25           more into it, I decided I might as well go all the way and                                                                           212     1           really get into this field, and I received a postdoctoral     2           fellowship to the University of Pennsylvania to spend a year     3           doing research on the interface between religion and     4           sexuality.  I was hired at the end of that as the chief of     5           family life and sex education for the Department of     6           Psychiatry, Marriage Council of Philadelphia, part of the     7           University of Pennsylvania.     8                    And there I began working with churches throughout     9           the country in developing human sexuality education.  I    10           actually taught for a year the juniors and seniors at the    11           Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and trained their teachers    12           to teach human sexuality education.  And in the last 25 years    13           since I started at Penn and I'm still there, I speak a lot at    14           churches to their youth and to their congregations about    15           human sexuality education.    16           Q   Have you also worked with schools with respect to human    17           sexuality education?    18           A   Yes.    19           Q   Would you discuss that, please?    20                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, Dr. Stayton's curriculum    21           vitae is Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 which has previously been    22           admitted into evidence.    23           A   Well, first of all, I worked with my own children's    24           school and did sex education for their high school.  I also    25           supervised my students who were adult trainees in the field                                                                           213     1           as they do sex education programs, both at the school that my     2           children attended and at other schools.     3                    By the way, Penn is one of two universities in the     4           whole world that gives a Ph.D. in human sexuality education.      5           And I've been on the faculty of that program since the     6           beginning.  So actually a lot of my work is training teachers     7           to teach, as well as helping them develop curriculum.     8           Q   Do you hold any other appointments, faculty appointments,     9           besides your appointment at Penn?    10           A   Yes.  I'm professor at LaSalle University in five minutes    11           (laughter) my class begins.  I do have a student assistant    12           who's going to start the class.  And I teach in a pastoral    13           counseling program there, and I teach both human sexuality    14           and I teach marital therapy, which is what I'm teaching    15           today.    16           Q   Dr. Stayton, how closely are you supervised by the --    17           what religion are you a minister of?    18           A   I'm an American Baptist.    19           Q   And how closely are you supervised by your denomination?    20           A   About five or six years ago my denomination commissioned    21           me as a minister in the field of human sexuality.  I don't    22           know how many Baptists know that (laughter) but they did.     23           And as a result of that, I have a board of directors from my    24           denomination that both oversee all the work that I do as well    25           as set all my fees.                                                                           214     1           Q   Do you hold any specialty certifications in the area of     2           sex education or sex therapy?     3           A   I'm a certified sex educator and a certified sex     4           therapist through the American Association of Sex Educators,     5           Counselors and Therapists.  I'm also a supervisor, a     6           certified supervisor.  I'm also president-elect of that     7           organization.     8           Q   The Government asked you about the Attorney General's     9           report --    10           A   Yes.    11           Q   -- which is Defendant's Exhibit 80.    12           A   Yes.    13           Q   Can you just describe for me what the Attorney General's    14           report reputation is in the field of those who teach and work    15           in the area of sex education?    16           A   First of all, let me say that there have been two    17           Commissions on Obscenity and Pornography, Presidents'    18           Commissions.  One came out in 1970 which was started by    19           Johnson but was known as the Nixon Commission.  And it was a    20           very well researched and documented Commission Report.  They    21           had the best people in the field of human sexuality that    22           spent a couple of years gathering data, getting the most    23           reliable information that we have, and giving and put out    24           that report.  It was an excellent report.  It is still highly    25           regarded in the field.                                                                           215     1                    The Commission on Obscenity and Pornography that     2           came out under Mr. Meese has -- in the field has absolutely     3           no positive reputation at all.  It was felt to be politically     4           motivated -- in the field we believe that it was politically     5           motivated to counteract the very fine Commission Report that     6           came out much earlier.      7                    Even our person, our sexologist, who was on that     8           Committee quit during the gathering of that because of the     9           way in which the Commission was doing their report.    10           Q   Now, the Government asked you a number of questions about    11           whether it would be harmful for minors to access sexually    12           explicit information.  Would you explain why you concluded    13           that it would not be harmful?    14           A   First of all, we're born sexual.  It's a fact.  That's    15           who we are.  And it's my belief that we then have a right to    16           know what it is to be a sexual person.  I have a great value    17           on knowledge.  I encourage my children at least to go through    18           high school, I wanted them to go to college, I encouraged    19           them to go to graduate school and I want them to take    20           continuing education courses and I want them to read    21           everything, because I have a value on knowledge.  It saddens    22           me that we reverse that and say that somehow knowledge is bad    23           for people or for children.  And I absolutely disagree with    24           that.      25                    I believe that children have a right to know about                                                                           216     1           themselves as sexual beings, just as if a child was deaf,     2           they would have the right to get information on how to     3           communicate.  If they were blind they would have a right to     4           the kinds of information that would help them to visualize     5           what the world is about.  I believe that because we're sexual     6           beings, we also have a right to know about that.  That's why     7           children are curious.  That's why I want children to be able     8           to get the information.  I believe it helps them to be not     9           only more responsible people, but to make more responsible    10           decisions as they get to the point where they have to make    11           decisions about themselves.  And I want them to have the kind    12           of information that will help them to make that decision.    13                    I believe that a lot of the things that happen to    14           children as they grow up and make the wrong decisions, a lot    15           of that, and this is well researched, is based upon the fact    16           that they're ignorant, and that they do not know what good    17           information there is out there, and so a lot of their acting    18           out is curiosity or rebellion against not knowing.    19           Q   Who do you think ought to be the primary sex educator of    20           children?    21           A   Absolutely the parents are the primary.  There's -- I    22           think there is total agreement on that.  Parents are the    23           primary educators of our children.  The home, the church -- I    24           mean the church, the school, the YMCA, the organizations as a    25           part like Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, are only auxiliary                                                                           217     1           educators.  I really want them also to do their     2           responsibility of providing that auxiliary education, because     3           our children are bombarded by sexuality on all sides, and I     4           want them to have good information and right information.     5           Q   Do you think parents are part of sex education ought to     6           impart their own personal values to their children?     7           A   Absolutely.  I think that's a sacred right of parents.  I     8           wanted to give my children my values, and impart that to     9           them.  I didn't want them to get their values from somebody    10           else until they knew what my values were, and could weigh my    11           values against the other value systems that they're going to    12           get a lot of stuff from.    13           Q   The Government asked you about the safer sex information    14           that you observed that was being spoken by the plaintiffs,    15           some of the plaintiffs that I represent.  Why do you think    16           particularly for teenagers it's important that they have    17           access, indeed valuable for them to have access to safer sex    18           information?    19           A   We know that unfortunately 20 percent of all children    20           across education, economic, racial guidelines are already    21           sexually active, 13 and 14-year-olds.  We know that by 16 or    22           17, 50 percent of our kids are already sexually active.  By    23           18 or 19, 85 percent.  We do almost nothing to really prepare    24           these kids and to help them.      25                    I agree with the former person who was here, I think                                                                           218     1           our teenagers are at highest risk for our sexually-     2           transmitted diseases, and I want to do everything I can to     3           protect them.  And I think they have a right to the     4           information that will protect them.     5                    One, I hope that by getting this information it will     6           help them to be more responsible in making that decision to     7           have sex.  Second, I hope that when they do make that     8           decision they will then be able to use the right methods to     9           protect themselves.    10           Q   Do you recall at your deposition that the Government    11           asked --    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me just for a minute.    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, your Honor.    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If Dr. Stayton doesn't mind going    15           through his class, that's all right with the Court, but I    16           just wondered if you had a lot more of Dr. Stayton on    17           redirect that we shouldn't let him go and ask him to come    18           back tomorrow.    19                    MR. HANSEN:  I have no further questions, your    20           Honor.    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I didn't mean to cut you off,    22           because the Court will have --    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Well then let me ask one more.    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but the Court will have    25           questions.                                                                           219     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I think he's going to miss his     2           class.  Is your class effectively missed?     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I think so.     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, all right.  So it's a fait     5           accompli, and go on.     6                    MR. HANSEN:  And now I've forgotten my last     7           question, so I withdraw it.  (Laughter.)     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And there's no court reporter to     9           read it back, I'm sorry.    10                    MR. HANSEN:  I hadn't formulated it yet    11           unfortunately, but I don't have any more questions, your    12           Honor.  Thank you.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I'm truly sorry.      14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Recross?    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Recross?    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  None, your Honor.    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You mentioned some percentages,    18           about 20 percent by age 13, --    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- 50 percent by I think you said 15    21           or 16 --    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  85 percent by 18?    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Where do those figures come from?                                                                           220     1                    THE WITNESS:  They come from a number of sources.      2           The Center For Population Options puts out figures like this.      3           The Planned Parenthood Association of America puts out     4           figures.  There are dissertations that have looked at this     5           type of activity.     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Based on surveys, I take it, of     7           young people?     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, correct.     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So this is self reported?    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's all I have.    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I just wanted to ask a question,    13           and not out of disrespect to the doctor's opinions, but I    14           guess if we had opening statements we would have known why he    15           was being presented here.  Perhaps my two colleagues know,    16           but maybe the lateness of the hour, I don't.    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, your Honor, I'd be happy to    18           address that.  The plaintiffs' first arguments here have to    19           do with the effect of the Act in banning speech for adults,    20           and it is our view that the effect of the Act will be to end    21           up banning a large amount of valuable speech for adults.  If    22           you agree with us on that argument, Dr. Stayton's testimony    23           will turn out to have been irrelevant.  If, however, you    24           disagree with us on that argument, it is then our view that    25           the Government must show that it has a compelling interest in                                                                           221     1           preventing minors from having access to this information.     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's precisely what I thought     3           the reason was for your presenting him, but I wasn't sure in     4           light of your briefs, so I just wanted to get that straight     5           in my mind.  Thank you.     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you.     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have a question, Doctor.     8                    THE WITNESS:  Sure.     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your attention was called by the    10           Government to Exhibits 70 through 77 which are these    11           pictures.    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would you think that there are some    14           people in contemporary society that would deem these pictures    15           to be obscene or pornographic?    16                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes.  I know them.  (Laughter.)    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  I think the end will follow.     18           Thank you very much.    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.    20                    MR. HANSEN:  If I might indulge the Court, I thought    21           of my one -- my last question.  (Laughter.)    22                    I apologize, but I had a minute to catch my    23           thoughts.    24           BY MR. HANSEN:    25           Q   Dr. Stayton, do you recall at the deposition the                                                                           222     1           Government asked you based on your contacts with other people     2           in the field of sex and based on your ministry whether you     3           thought your views were out of the mainstream with respect to     4           people who are --     5           A   Right.     6           Q   -- sex educators and sex therapists.  Could you tell me     7           whether you think your views are out of the mainstream in     8           that respect?     9           A   Not at all.  I go around to both seminaries and churches    10           and I work with denominational leaders, and I find that I'm    11           probably right in the middle as I work with churches.  I have    12           tremendous -- I find that people generally are hungry to know    13           about their sexuality, and especially in light of their    14           religious convictions and that's -- I work a lot with that    15           area.    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You believe that it ought to be    17           in the hands of parents?    18                    THE WITNESS:  Say it again?    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Ideally sex education ought to be    20           in the hands of parents --    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But it probably is not though, is    23           it?    24                    THE WITNESS:  Unfortunately what happens is the    25           parents abdicate their role.  I would like to see us do more                                                                           223     1           training of parents to be sex educators.

Equally troubling to Internetusers, Administration witnesses confirmed that the Government is seeking tocompel domestic Internet users towards a "voluntary" key-escrow encryptionsystem.The hearing was called to consider the "Security and Freedom throughEncryption (SAFE) Act of 1996," (H.R. 3011) sponsored by RepresentativesBob Goodlatte (R-VA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA), and a bi-partisan group of morethan 43 other Representatives. The bill is designed to encourage thewidespread availability of strong, easy to use encryption technology byrelaxing current encryption export controls.The hearing -- the first before the House in nearly 3 years -- marked thefirst time the House Judiciary Committee has formally considered theencryption issue, and marks an important step along the path towardspassage of real encryption policy reforms.Witnesses testifying before the Committee Wednesday:* Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chief Sponsor of the HR 3011* Jamie Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General* William Crowell, Deputy Director, National Security Agency* William Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce, Export Administration* Melinda Brown, VP and General Counsel, Lotus Development Corp.* Roberta Katz, VP and General Counsel, Netscape Communications Corp.* Patricia Rippley, Managing Director, Bear Stearns & Company* Dr. Charles Deneka, Senior VP and CTO, Corning, Inc (on behalf of the  National Association of Manufacturers).REPORTS OF ADMINISTRATION COMPROMISE PROVE PREMATUREAlthough some press reports had suggested that the Administration waspoised to announce a new compromise encryption policy in testimony beforethe Committee, these reports proved to be premature.In response to rumors that the administration would relax export controlson 56 bit DES encryption (encryption exports are currently limited to 40bit keys) Gorelick stated that the Administration does not support theunrestricted export of 56 bit DES.However, Gorelick did confirm that the Administration plans to proposelegislation soon, and suggested such a proposal would specify the processfor law enforcement to access encryption keys held by third-parties.  The proposal would include new civil penalties for the unauthorized disclosureof keys.Additionally, credible sources have told CDT that the Administration's newproposal will transfer jurisdiction for encryption exports from the StateDepartment to the Commerce Department, and that domestic law enforcementwill have a role in evaluating export applications.  It is also likely thatthe Administration will again offer to raise the export limit from 40 to 64bit key-lengths with law enforcement access.ADMINISTRATION REITERATES PLANS TO COMPEL USE OF KEY-ESCROW DOMESTICALLYBoth Gorelick and NSA Deputy Director William Crowell stressed that theAdministration is not seeking to mandate the domestic use of key-escrowencryption. However, both admitted that they would like to see thewidespread adoption of key-escrow systems and have initiated a broad effortto encourage industry to develop such systems.In her prepared statement, Gorelick acknowledged that criminals will attimes use non-escrowed encryption to communicate with themselves, but, "we believe that if strong key recovery encryption products that will  not interoperate -- at least in the long term -- with non-key recovery  products are made available overseas and domestically and become part  of a global KMI (Key Management Infrastructure), such products will  become the worldwide standard.  Under those circumstances, even  criminals will be compelled to use key recovery products, because even  criminals need to communicate with legitimate organizations like  banks, both nationally and internationally."The administration continues to insist that their policy is "voluntary",despite the fact that their policy is clearly designed to compel the use ofkey-escrow domestically through continued controls on encryption exportsand negotiations with foreign governments through the OECD.  This apparentdouble-talk from the Administration cannot be the basis for soundencryption policy reform.CONGRESS, INDUSTRY REMAIN SKEPTICAL OF ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION, STAGE ISSET FOR REAL REFORM NEXT YEARLed by Representatives Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), membersof the Judiciary Committee expressed a great deal of skepticism about theAdministration's proposal.Rep. Goodlatte (a chief sponsor of the SAFE bill) testified that in hisview, "the chief roadblock to electronic commerce on the Internet isgovernment regulation of encryption."  Goodlatte added, "The arguments thatthe FBI, CIA, and NSA have given me to justify the need for a massive'key-escrow' or as it's now called 'key-recovery' plan just don't ring truein 1996."Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), expressed concern that current USencryption policy is endangering the future of the US high-technologyindustry.  Lofgren was also highly critical of the Administrations effortsto push for a global key-escrow standards through the OECD. Lofgren said: "The Deputy Attorney General also argues that the United States,  combined with its allies, can control the world encryption market and  can coordinate the implementation of an international 'key-escrow'  regime.  Notwithstanding the absence of any demonstrable progress  towards such an agreement, the aspirations for a comprehensive global  key escrow scheme ignore the undeniable power of market demand for  cryptographic products that do not incorporate any form of escrow. The  customers that purchase encryption products DO NOT WANT products with  escrowed keys, and if use suppliers are forbidden to supply these  products, then someone undoubtedly will.  Whatever hopes we may have  for an international system of key escrow, we will never achieve 100  percent participation, and those who do not participate will profit  heavily at our expense." (emphasis in original)Several other members of the Committee, including Reps. Sonny Bono (R-CA),John Conyers (D-MI), Robert Scott (D-VA), and John Bryant (D-TX) echoedthese concerns in their questions of the Administration witnesses.  Thefact that Committee members from both parties expressed deep skepticism ofthe Administration's proposal is an extremely encouraging preview of thedebate when Congress resumes in January.Finally, witnesses testifying on behalf of the software industry, thesecurities industry and users of encryption technology all expressedsupport for the SAFE bill, and argued that current policy threatens thecompetitiveness of US businesses and Internet users.NEXT STEPSTime is running out in a busy election year Congressional calendar, andchances of passage of encryption reform legislation in either the House orSenate before the end of the current term are slim. However, the stage isclearly set for an all out battle when Congress returns in January, andsupport for encryption policy is clearly growing in Congress.Forty-five Republican and Democratic members of the House have signed onas co-sponsors of the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act (SAFE).The Burns/Leahy "Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (ProCODE)Act also enjoys broad bi-partisan support in the Senate.  Meanwhile, theAdministration continues to offer more of the same -- continued reliance onexport controls while pushing for a global key-escrow standard.The stage is set, but the battle over U.S. encryption policy reform is onlyjust beginning.  CDT will continue to work to educate policy makers and thepublic on the importance of encryption policy reform.

CDT applauds this decision as a significant victoryfor privacy and condemns the FBI's blatant efforts to subvert the specificrequirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act(CALEA, also known as "Digital Telephony")."The FBI is demanding that every cell phone double as a tracking device,providing instant and continuous location information not just when asubject is talking but whenever a cellular phone is turned on. " said CDTExecutive Director Jerry Berman. "The FBI is demanding real-time trackingof anyone suspected of committing a crime.  This is a clear violation ofthe statute and the Fourth Amendment." Berman addedAt issue are technical standards currently being drafted to implement the1994 law. The FBI, which holds an influential position within the industrystandards process, has demanded that the wireless telephone network bedesigned in a way that would allow real time tracking of individualssuspected of a crime.Specifically, the FBI is demanding that wireless networks be designed tofacilitate:* Tracking of the physical location of a subject any time a cellular  phone is turned on (even if no call is being made or received)* Tracking of the physical location of a subject when a cellular phone  moves within a service area or moves to another carrier's service area* Tracking of the physical location of a subject when a cellular phone  makes or receives a call* Delivery of this information to law enforcement in real time (within  500 milliseconds)Although law enforcement currently has the authority to obtain certainlocation information through a search warrant, the standards proposed bythe FBI would have allowed access to far more detailed location informationunder a lower standard."The law was designed to freeze the FBI in time, not as a blank check tothe FBI to design the telecommunications network any way it pleased."Berman said. "The FBI's demands go far beyond what's permitted under CALEAand contradict statements by Director Freeh before Congress 2 years ago."The drafters of CALEA specifically stated that the statute was not designedto expand law enforcement surveillance authority. The Committee report onthe legislation notes: "The FBI director testified that the legislation was intended to  preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law  enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in  the past. The Committee urges against over broad interpretation of the  requirements."   -- House Judiciary Committee Report to Accompany H.R. 4922. Rept.      103-827 Part 1, Page 22NEXT STEPSIn order to ensure public oversight and accountability over the FBI'ssurveillance authority, CALEA requires the government to reimburse thetelecommunications industry for the costs of meeting the statute'srequirements.  Congress is currently considering a mechanism to fund theimplementation of the law.CDT urges the Congress to exercise its oversight role to determine whetherthe FBI is seeking to use CALEA to expand current surveillance capabilitiescontrary to the specific intent of the law.  Unless and until the FBIclarifies its intent and justifies its demands, Congress should not allowthe expenditure of any funds to implement CALEA.CDT and a ad-hoc task force of other privacy organizations andtelecommunications industry representatives are currently conducting areview of electronic surveillance issues at the request of Senators PatrickLeahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA).  The task force report will cover theimplementation of CALEA and will be released within the next few months.CDT stands ready to intervene again at the standards setting process andbefore the FCC if necessary in order to ensure that privacy is protected asCALEA is implemented.The Center for Democracy and Technology is a Washington DC based non-profitpublic interest organization focusing on free speech and privacy issues innew computer and communications technology.

This effort by the FBI raises grave privacy concerns and mustbe rejected by the telecommunications industry.In ongoing discussions with a Telecommunications Industry Associationcommittee established to set technical standards to implement theCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, P.L. 103-414,also known as the "Digital Telephony" statute), the FBI is requestingsurveillance capability far beyond current law enforcement capabilities andin clear violation of the scope of the law.CALEA was not designed as a blank check from Congress allowing lawenforcement to design the telecommunications network to expand existingsurveillance capability. Rather, the statute was carefully balanced toensure that law enforcement maintain the status quo. This overreaching bythe FBI raises serious privacy concerns and clearly violates the balancestruck by CALEA.  CDT strongly urges Congress to refrain from approving anyfunding for the implementation of CALEA until the FBI makes its intentionsclear.FBI Demanding Location Information In Clear Violation of the StatuteThe FBI's request is contained in a proposal called the ElectronicSurveillance Interface (ESI), which specifies the design of the interfacebetween the telecommunications network and law enforcement's ownsurveillance equipment. The FBI has refused a formal request by CDT to viewa copy of the ESI.However, documents obtained from a meeting of the FBI and thetelecommunications industry on September 12 indicate that the FBI isdemanding that cellular networks be designed to deliver locationinformation to law enforcement.  Specifically,  the ESI states thatcellular networks must be designed to provide the geographic location of aparticular subject:The ESI states:  R7-62     The SSM (Surveillance Status Message) shall be delivered to            the LEA (Law Enforcement Authority) whenever the subject            changes location or between systems and this location is            available to the IAP (Intercept Access Point)In short, the FBI is requesting that the cellular network be designed toreport the geographic location of an individual subject:1. When a cellular phone is turned on (even if no call is made)2. When a cellular phone moves within a service area or moves to another   carrier's service area.3. When a cellular phone makes or receives a call.The FBI claims that location information has to be provided to lawenforcement under CALEA because it is part of  "call setup information."However, in his testimony before a joint hearing of the House and SenateJudiciary Committees on March 18, 1994, FBI Freeh director stated exactlythe opposite: "Several privacy-based spokespersons have criticized the wording of the  definition (of call setup information)... alleging that the government  is seeking a new, pervasive, automated 'tracking' capability. Such  allegations are completely wrong.... In order to make clear that the  acquisition of such information is not... included within the term  'call setup information' we are prepared to add a concluding phrase to  this definition to explicitly clarify the point: '*** except that such  information [call setup information] shall not include any information  that may disclose the physical location of a mobile facility or  service beyond that associated with the number's area code or  exchange.'"    (Testimony of FBI director Louis Freeh before a joint  hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and  Constitutional Rights and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on  Technology and the Law, March 18, 1994. S. Hrg 103-1022).The drafters of CALEA noted in the Committee report that the statute was notdesigned to expand law enforcement surveillance ability: "The FBI director testified that the legislation was intended to  preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law  enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in  the past.  The Committee urges against over broad interpretation of  the requirements." (House Judiciary Committee Report to Accompany H.R.  4922. Rept. 103-827 Part 1, page 22)The FBI's demand that all wireless communications equipment provide thephysical locations of a subscriber at all times goes raises obvious privacyissues and goes well beyond the scope of CALEA and the explicit statementsof the FBI.No Funds Should Be Appropriated to Implement CALEA Until This Issue is ResolvedIn passing CALEA, Congress sought to preserve law enforcement's ability toconduct electronic surveillance as new communications technologies aredeveloped.  At the same time, Congress was very clear that the law wasdesigned to preserve the status quo and not to expand law enforcementsurveillance authority.  In addition, Congress took the extra step ofincluding substantial Congressional oversight and public accountability tothe implementation process in order to ensure that law enforcement did notoverreach and that privacy interests would be protected.The law requires the telecommunications industry to set standards formeeting the FBI's general requirements in an open process, allowsinterested parties to challenge any standard before the FCC if it fails toprotect privacy, and requires Congressional oversight and accountabilityover the implementation of the law by mandating government reimbursementfor expensive capability upgrades.We urge Congress to exercise its oversight role to determine whether infact the FBI is seeking to use CALEA to expand its current surveillancecapabilities contrary to the intent of the law.  Unless and until the FBIclarifies its intent and justifies its demands, Congress should not allowthe expenditure of any funds to implement CALEA.We look forward to discussing this issue with you further.

Latest News House Telecommunications Subcommittee Holds Hearing on Wireless Privacy Issues [Posted on February 6, 1997] On Wednesday, February 5, 1997, the House Telecommunications Subcommittee held ahearing to consider cellular privacy issues. CDT Executive Director JerryBerman, along with FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom, Deputy AssistantAttorney General Robert Litt, Cellular Telecommunications IndustryAssociation President Thomas Wheeler, and others testified before the panel. Highlights of CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman's testimony: Preliminary findings of a Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) study of communications privacy, focusing on the effectiveness and coverage of ECPA, the implementation of CALEA, the potential of strong encryption technologies to protect privacy and security and prevent crime, and other issues. The study is being conducted at the request of Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and will be completed later this year; Issues relating to the implementation of CALEA, including concerns about the FBI's latest capacity notice; and Technical solutions to privacy, including the need for encryption policy reform. Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA), the Subcommittee Chairman, spoke strongly about the need for strong privacy protections in wireless data networks, and also announced that the House Telecommunicatinos Subcommittee will hold hearings on the Encryption issue in the comming months. Text of CDT's Testimony House Commerce Committee web page FBI Issues Scaled Back Surveillance Capacity Notice -- Cost and Capability Issues Remain [Posted on January 17, 1997 | Updated on February 14, 1997] On Tuesday January 14, 1997, the FBI issued a revised notice of proposedsurveillance capacity as required by the 1994 Communications Assistance forLaw Enforcement Act (CALEA - a.k.a. Digital Telephony). The notice detailsprojected increases in law enforcement wiretapping and other electronicsurveillance activity in the coming years. While the latest notice appears far less expansive than the FBI's firstcapacity notice issued in October of 1995, and while this notice, byincluding the unprecedented release of baseline surveillance information ona county-by-county basis, goes a long way towards satisfying some of CDT'sobjections to the first notice, many serious issues remain. The new notice is subject to a 30 day comment period, in which telephonecompanies, privacy advocates and members of the public can submit comments.Any person can submit comments, directing them to the TelecommunicationsIndustry Liaison Unit, FBI, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA 20153-0450. TheBureau has not made arrangements for on-line submissions. Hard-copycomments must be submitted by mail, in triplicate.

"Almost four years ago, the Clinton administration announced that     its plan to help secure the massive amounts of information we move     electronically was to give government a direct peephole into that     information," Burns said.  "Four years later, the president has not     budged from this position.        "A significant bipartisan coalition in Congress and in the private     sector has consistently rejected that approach.  We advanced the     debate significantly in the last Congress but came up short because of     White House obstructionism.  This time around, we intend to put a bill     on the president's desk and find out if he is truly on the side of the     users and providers of rapidly expanding high-tech goods and     services."        Burns announced the legislation along with cosponsors Sen. Patrick     Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and with U.S. Rep. Bob     Goodlatte (R-Va.), who is sponsoring a companion bill in the House, in     a video teleconference with the RSA Data Security Conference in San     Francisco.        "We're working hard to get the same broad cosponsorship we had in     the last Congress, and we will be introducing a bill that is virtually     identical to Pro-CODE from the last Congress," Burns said.        Pro-CODE, or "The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era     Act," would ease export restrictions on encryption technology to a     level deemed "generally available" worldwide by the U.S. Department of     Commerce.  It would also prohibit a mandatory system under which     producers or users of hardware and software would be required to     surrender a decoding "key" to a third party.  An executive order     signed by President Clinton would ease export restrictions to a level     of 56 bits for applicants who agree to give up a copy of their     decoding keys.        "This debate comes down to a potential loss of billions of     high-tech dollars and thousands of high-tech jobs.  It comes down to     significant harm to our global high-tech competitiveness.  It comes     down to whether or not government can force people into making     business and consumer choices, and whether government should have     access to our most private communications."                                # # # Back to the Pro-CODE Page Back to the CDT Cryptography Page Back to the CDT Home Page This Page Posted on 02/02/97 || For more information, write webmaster@cdt.orgWT02-B06-20IA096-001029-B016-355http://www.cdt.org:80/crypto/clipper311/archive.html 205.177.10.31 19970215015650 text/html 3184HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:55:30 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html CDT | Clipper 3.1.1 News Archive Clipper 3.1.1 News Archive President Signs Executive Order, Appoints "Special Envoy for Cryptography"; First StepsTowards Administration Key Recovery Plan [updated November 18, 1996] Taking the first steps towards implementing its new key recovery encryptionpolicy, the President signed an Executive Order on November 15 transferring jurisdiction over encryption exports to the Commerce Department.

However,given that everything we have seen and heard to date reveals that the governmentis headed in the absolute wrong direction, we specifically wanted to bringto your direct attention five key principles which underlie BSA's positionsand which should, but unfortunately do not appear to, be guiding the Administration. It appears that significant backtracking has occurred since the October1 announcement and, therefore, we seriously doubt that the regulations willwork, meet computer user demands, or be accepted by the private sector unlessthe Administration radically changes its approach immediately. If not, thenew policy is destined to fail just like its predecessor Clipper efforts.We strongly urge the Administration to focus on what is doable in the realworld of millions of Internet users with scores of encryption alternativesfrom which to chose. On November 8, BSA provided the Working Group detailed positions on theissues and specific suggestions for regulatory implementation (a copy ofthe letter is attached). Given the short period left before implementation,five key principles are specifically discussed below which underlie thepositions taken in our earlier letter. (1) VOLUNTARY AND MARKET DRIVEN: To be successful, any key recoveryinitiative must be voluntary and market-driven. Our companies cannot sellwhat consumers do not want. As BSA CEOs have discussed with numerous Administrationofficials, the U.S. software industry is operating in a very competitive,international market -- hundreds of strong encryption products are presentlyavailable around the world, many easily down loaded from the Internet. Consumersare demanding strong encryption and it is key to the success of the Internet.Unless users find value in a key recovery function, they will not buy productswith this function. The result: American companies lose sales and the governmentwill have failed in its efforts to have such products widely deployed. (2) UNLIMITED KEY LENGTH FOR KEY RECOVERY PRODUCTS: "Key recovery"products should be exportable without key length limit if they include featuresmaking the recovery of plain text stored information accessible withoutthe assistance of the individual who has encrypted the information. As we have explained to the Working Group, there may well be commercialdemand for products that enable the recovery of stored encrypted data, butthere is little, if any, commercial demand for a key recovery function inreal-time communications. Accordingly, there should be no such requirementfor exportable encryption communications products (or products which doboth communications and stored data as long as there are key recovery featuresfor stored data). Furthermore, key recovery is not key escrow. A purchaser or userof a product being able to recover his data is different than, and separatefrom, the decision as to whether to voluntarily empower a trusted thirdparty to be able to recover the data. (3) NO INDUSTRIAL POLICY: The government should not dictate "milestones"for company specific plans regarding key recovery products as a conditionfor interim export control relief. Companies have already announced plansto develop such key recovery products; for example, 35 companies have joinedIBM in a key recovery alliance. Numerous other companies already have keyrecovery products on the market today. There is no need for the governmentto go down the road of industrial policy by insisting upon becoming a partnerwith each company. We urge the Administration to adopt the simplest possibleprocess. (4) EASY EXPORT OF 56 BIT PRODUCTS AS PROMISED: Interim export controlrelief must permit the export of 56-bit non-key recovery encryption productsunder Department of Commerce General License procedures that represent actualliberalization. The mere transfer of licensing jurisdiction to Commerceis of little significance unless accompanied with expedited product reviewsand realistic licensing requirements. Yet, the recent Executive Order statesthat products which already have export licenses will have to undergo newreviews -- only this time with FBI scrutiny. There is also an urgent needto permit the export of 128-bit encryption for financial applications (whendone with appropriate safeguards). (5) MEETING MARKET DEMANDS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE: Any interim exportcontrol relief will be only a mirage unless it meets business needs aftertwo years. Quite simply, there must be interoperability between key-recoveryand non key-recovery products. It also must be possible for American companiesto service and support the installed base of 56-bit non key-recovery products. The American software industry needs immediate relief. It is a matter ofjobs and international competitiveness. For the Administration's policyto be successful, the government must accept and work with the market, nottry to supplant it. It is clear that many in Congress understand the urgencyand importance of this issue and the need for strong protection for Internetusers. We thought that the October 1 announcement showed that the Administrationwas also coming to grips with these issues. But now, only a few weeks later,we wonder. We have submitted comments to the Government and we stand ready to continueworking with you to formulate and implement a market driven, voluntary systemwhich meets consumers' needs.

As BSA said at the time, itis clearly a step in the right direction. However, as we have also explainedon numerous occasions since the announcement, there were some notable omissionsas well as a great number of unanswered questions. Therefore, we sincerelyappreciate your willingness to work with us on an expedited basis to hopefullyresolve remaining issues and to make further progress. . Based on our recent discussions and meetings with Administration officials,we believe there are four major outstanding areas that need immediate clarification.This letter is intended to provide the Administration with BSA's reactionsto what we have heard to date as well as our concrete recommendations formoving forward in these areas. 1. Interim Export Control Relief. BSA's members have said for some time now that the ability to immediatelyexport 56-bit encryption products is critical to maintaining the internationalcompetitiveness of the software industry and to providing computer usersworldwide with acceptable information security. This also was the majorrecommendation of the National Research Council Study. Such exports alsowere clearly permitted under legislation pending before Congress. Therefore, we welcome your decision to permit the export under Departmentof Commerce General License beginning January 1, 1997 of products using56-bit encryption keys. We believe that many American software companieswill be ready to ship such products on January 1st. We trust that any necessarygovernment action will be completed by then. Our specific concerns and suggestions follow: Licensing Procedures and Rewrite of Regulations: We expectthat: the decision covers all commercial software and hardware programsand products employing encryption for general text (data) confidentialitypurposes; after the transfer of licensing jurisdiction to DOC, exports of allcommercial products will occur under the least restrictive DOC General License(License Exception) - either GTDU (TSU) or, if a new license is createdor a new ECCN established, the terms and conditions should permit the exportto all non-embargoed countries without requirement of written assurances; all products already reviewed and approved for export will continueto be exportable (under whatever DOC General License) without the need forany further approvals, and independent of any new requirement or processfor "commitments" on key recovery, including: 1. 40-bit key length mass market products 2. 56-bit or longer key length products for the financial services sector(which, as explained below, needs to be immediately increased to 128 bitsfor Internet financial applications) 3. other 56-bit or longer key length products (e.g. to U.S. subsidiaries,certain foreign multinationals, certain foreign governments) with respect to new products and programs: 1. for all mass market products already approved for export at the 40 bitlevel, if the only change is to 56 bits, then a simple letter to that effectfrom the company (exporter) should be sufficient for General License treatment; 2. initial reviews of new products and programs with 56-bit key lengthswill occur under the same stringent time frame (7 to 15 days) that currentlyexist for mass market products; 3. any commercial products with key lengths longer than 56-bits that arenot eligible for General License treatment should still be eligible forexport under a Validated License with terms and conditions substantiallysimilar to existing State Department export licenses. We appreciate the time constraints under which the Administration is laboring;however, we also believe it is essential to get the regulations done right.Therefore we strongly urge you to involve industry associations in the draftingof the new rules. Industry involvement is essential if the Administrationis to make good on the promise of achieving liberalized export controlsthrough transfer of jurisdiction over encryption software from State toCommerce. Otherwise the new regime may be more restrictive than the currentdual agency regime. Periodic Upward Adjustments in Key Lengths. We were disappointedthat the Administration did not also institute automatic, periodic adjustmentsin key lengths that simply would maintain the same level of informationprotection in the future. Such adjustments are necessary because predictableadvances in computing power will make attacks on encrypted information cheaperand easier. This was the rationale behind BSA's earlier recommendation ofa "cost of cracking adjustment." The NRC CRISIS Report also calledfor periodic adjustments. We note again that such adjustments would notfurther disadvantage the government in performing any required brute forceattacks because it is precisely these attacks that benefit from the advancesin computing power! Financial Applications. While the announcement confirms thatlonger key lengths will continue to be approved for products dedicated tothe support of financial applications, no specific decision was made topermit the export of such products with 128-bit encryption keys (under GeneralLicense GTDU (TSU)). Immediate action in this area is critical as the worldwidefinancial sector currently demands this level of information security, foreigncompetitors already are providing it, and safeguards are available to ensurethat such products are not used as general confidentiality products. (Industryis familiar and comfortable with the binding standards currently used byNSA - essentially a "work factor" test in which it would takemore effort to reconfigure the program than to do a separate one.) It isessential to remember that if the U.S. Government does not provide immediateexport control relief in this area that foreign software companies are now,and will become even more aggressive in, supplying such products - but withoutthe safeguards - thereby defeating our government's efforts to limit suchencryption worldwide. For example, a German product explicitly advertiseson the Internet its ability to provide "highly secure 128 bit transactionencryption despite U.S. export restrictions." Personal Use Exemption. We also believe further progress needsto be made in the areas of the so-called "personal use exemption"and non-confidentiality uses of encryption. Specifically, reporting requirementsshould be eliminated or significantly simplified to ease administrativeburdens. Moreover, the exemption should be extended to foreign nationals(except those from embargoed countries) employed by U.S. or Canadian companiesor subsidiaries/affiliates of U.S. companies. 2. Definition of Key Recovery. Importantly, the Administration's announcement conditions the export of56-bit encryption products upon "industry commitments to build andto market future products that support key recovery." Such productswould have no algorithm restrictions or key length limits. To be successful, any key recovery initiative must be voluntary and market-driven.Users must see the value of key recovery features and want to use them.American companies cannot sell what users will not buy. In this regard,BSA's members have said for some time that they believe there may well becommercial demand for products that enable the recovery of stored data andthat could be saleable worldwide. We think it also is in the government's interest to see the deployment ofsuch key recovery products for stored data. We believe the government shouldfocus on what is "doable" in the near term. See what works; getreal world experience. What Key Recovery Means. As we have repeatedly explained,we believe a "key recovery" encryption confidentiality productshould be exportable if it includes features making the recovery of "plaintext" stored information accessible without the assistance of the individualwho has encrypted the information. Key Recovery Is Different Than Key Escrow. A purchaser oruser of a product being able to recover his data is different than, andseparate from, the decision whether to voluntarily empower a trusted thirdparty to be able to recover the data. Indeed, this distinction between a"key recovery" product that enables third party access to storedinformation. and "key escrow" which requires such advance thirdparty access, makes all the difference in terms of industry and user acceptance.Quite simply, there should be no requirement that a copy of the user's key,or the means to access or reconstruct the key, be given to anyone (let alonerequired to do so with government certified agents or with a U.S entity).Indeed, we also note that even if certain individuals wanted to give a copyof their key to a third party, the existence of a trusted third party infrastructurein each country does not yet exist and could take some time to develop. Thus, while we believe that in many cases businesses and other entitieswould have access to keys used by their employees and (in time) commercialkey recovery services would be able to recover keys of their subscribers,yet other computer users might choose not to give a copy of their key toanyone (instead perhaps printing out a copy on a floppy disk or paper orcontent to have it reside in a separate file on their hard drive). The analogyto what people do with their house keys seems apt -- some give a copy toa neighbor or friend, businesses often hold "passkeys" to theiremployees offices, others put a copy in a safe deposit box or a drawer.Importantly, in each situation the government can obtain the plain textof information by lawfully obtaining the key where ever it might be kept. Key Recovery Should Be A Condition Of Export Only For Stored Data.As we have explained on many occasions, there is little if any commercialdemand for a key recovery function in real-time communications. The reasonis simple: if the communication is unsuccessful then it is simply triedagain until the transfer of information is successfully completed. Usersonly want the ability to recover in plain text form their stored encryptedinformation after the fact of transmission. Moreover, software companieshave been focusing on meeting this user demand - recovery of stored data.They understand technically how to do this. In the short run, it is an achievableobjective. We are concerned, however, that some in government seem intent on arguingthat because a few products can technically perform key recovery for communicationsit should be a widespread requirement. To the contrary, our members haveseen nothing to suggest that any product developed to date can work on a mass market scale or that thereis significant commercial demand for such products. Therefore, an encryption product that provides key recovery for stored datashould be exportable even if it also encrypts communications without keyrecovery. Licensing Procedures. Finally, BSA believes that key recoveryencryption products for stored data should be exportable: regardless of key generation technique of technology used (i.e. nolimits on how often keys may be changed or replaced); without additional requirements or conditions precedent such as newbilateral agreements; to all destinations subject only to generally applicable limitationson non-controlled commodities (e.g. embargoed countries); and pursuant to DOC General License or License Exception (GTDU (TSU) orequivalent) after a one-time review comparable to that provided for massmarket software. 3. Industry Commitments. Based on what we have heard to date, unfortunately we believe the Administrationmay adopt an approach that is based much more on sticks than carrots. Wethink there is a better way. The Administration's Tentative Approach. We understand thatthe Administration may interpret "industry commitments" to buildingand marketing key recovery products so as to require each company to providedetailed information to the government regarding its plans for developing,producing and marketing key recovery products and services. Moreover, undersuch an approach companies would have to make resource commitments and concretebenchmarks. The government would review each company's plan every six months.If the government decided that inadequate progress had been made then itcould end a company's interim General License to export 56-bit products. We believe this approach is misguided and unnecessary. Undoubtedly it wouldsubject the Administration to charges of micromanagement and industrialpolicy. Moreover, such detailed governmental involvement could well threatenthe continued success of America's highly dynamic and competitive softwareand hardware industries. Finally, the burdens of such an approach wouldlimit the ability of companies to participate, thereby reducing the numberof companies who could afford to develop key recovery products. A Better Way. As we explained, we believe that a much moreproductive and efficient approach is to rely on the fundamental incentiveinherent in the government's decision: after two years companies wishingto export encryption programs with long key lengths will only be allowedto do so if those programs and products have key recovery functions forstored data. We understand that the Administration is nervous about industry actuallymoving forward with development of key recovery products. But the governmentalready knows that companies will develop and offer key recovery programsfor stored data because a number of companies either have such productsnow, are currently working on such products, or have announced individualor joint efforts to develop such products. They are doing so because userswant such products. Indeed, Administration officials have already acknowledgedthat a "critical mass" of companies are at work on such key recoveryproducts. We believe these activities should be sufficient and that any company shouldbe allowed to immediately begin exporting 56-bit products. We do not thinkit is appropriate or wise to condition each individual company's abilityto export 56-bit encryption products on that company's plans to developor offer key recovery products. However, if the Administration nevertheless believes such a requirementis necessary, then we strongly urge you to adopt the simplest possible process:make such a commitment to develop or offer key recovery products a termof the General License (or Exception). By exporting products pursuant tothe General License, companies would have "self certified" thatthey are making the requisite commitment. This would obviate the need foran entire separate regulatory scheme, with letters, meetings, reviews, etc.We also believe it is essential that the license simply require a commitmentto develop or offer key recovery products generally, not a key recoveryversion of each and every 56-bit product being exported pursuant to theGeneral License. 4. What Happens After Two Years There are several issues presented by the Administration's announcementthat after two years American companies will be unable, as a general proposition,to continue exporting 56 bit encryption products without key recovery. Interoperability. The Administration maintains that the "domesticuse of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain freeto use any encryption system domestically." As we have explained allalong, we do think that there always will be some demand for non-key recoveryencryption programs and products. Thus, we understand the Administration'sdecision to mean: companies may continue to sell domestically, to U.S. citizens abroad,and to U.S. subsidiaries abroad, non-key recovery encryption programs andproducts without regard to key length; companies may continue to sell worldwide non-key recovery encryptionprograms and products which are approved for export; and Exportable key recovery encryption programs and products will be ableto interoperate with non-key recovery programs and products at the encryptionstrength of those other programs and products (for domestic users this meansno limits and for international users at whatever level is approved forexport (e.g. 56 bit keys as adjusted upwards in the future)). The Installed Base. Any interim export control relief willbe a mirage unless it meets serious business needs. No commercial user willpurchase such products unless they know they can purchase similar productsin the future for expanding needs (e.g. a bigger site license), can getreplacement products if something is wrong, can install upgrades in theproduct (even if the encryption remains the same), and can get continuedservice and customer support. Yet we have heard nothing that addresses theseissues. The Administration's decision must be implemented so that whateveris permissible at the end of two years will continue to be so (i.e. approvalsalready granted must be reasonably interpreted in the future). BSA and its member companies remain committed to working with the Administrationto specifically address these important questions and implementation details.

This latest initiative continues the drivetowards a global guarantee of law enforcement access to all encryptedcommunications and stored data. CDT believes that such governmental accesssystems -- whether through "key escrow" or "key recovery" -- threaten thefundamental privacy rights of computer users, both domestically and abroad.The latest Administration proposal would promote key escrow by temporarilyeasing current export restrictions on moderately strong encryptionproducts.  The proposal would raise the current export limit from 40 bitsto 56 bits for companies that agree to produce key escrow products.  Companies would be required to report their progress every six months.  After two years, all exportable encryption systems stronger than 40-bits would have to include key escrow.  Encryption producers will be compelled tobe part of this scheme in order to stay competitive, eventually producing andadopting key escrow systems which so far have been largely rejected by thepublic.An overview of the latest Administration policy, considered within thecontext of the government's relentless drive towards key escrow, isattached below.- THE UNSWERVING GOAL: GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO ALL COMMUNICATIONS AND  STORED DATAThe long-standing goal of every major encryption plan by the Administrationhas been to guarantee government access to all encrypted communications andstored data. In 1993, the Clipper Chip policy achieved access through keysheld by the government.  In 1995, the "Clipper II" proposal allowed exportrelief for commercial key escrow systems. This summer, "Clipper III" soughtaccess to keys through the dual incentives of export controls and a newgovernment "key management infrastructure."  In each case, the ultimategoal has been a guarantee of government access to the plaintext ofencrypted information.  Law enforcement and national security interestshave driven this process.The attempt to institutionalize key escrow worldwide is a fundamentalthreat to the privacy and security of Internet users both domestically andabroad.* GUARANTEED ACCESS TO INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS AND STORED DATA WOULD BE  A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF CURRENT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES.  Guaranteed access to Internet communications and stored files is a far  greater intrusion into the privacy of computer users than current  wiretapping.   As individuals conduct more aspects of their lives  online, key escrow is tantamount to guaranteeing law enforcement  access to all of our most intimate conversations, sensitive personal  records, musings and thoughts in a way never available before.  Within  the United States, Congress and the courts have established a delicate  balance in electronic surveillance between law enforcement and  individual privacy rights.  Key escrow destroys that balance,  providing law enforcement with a comprehensive dossier of individual  lives and activities.* GLOBAL KEY ESCROW ENDANGERS THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF COMPUTER USERS  COMMUNICATING IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NO FOURTH AMENDMENT OR OTHER  PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.  An international key escrow scheme will necessarily entail the escrow  of key information in foreign countries, with access by foreign  governments through much weaker privacy protections.  Such global key  escrow jeopardizes the privacy rights of any American who communicates  or stores files abroad, where key information might be released with  few privacy protections. Moreover, global key escrow endangers the  privacy and free expression of computer users everywhere by  establishing the global machinery for government surveillance without  privacy protections.* THE CHOICE TO ACCEPT THE COSTS AND RISKS OF KEY ESCROW SHOULD BE MADE  BY INDIVIDUAL USERS, NOT FORCED UPON THEM.  Additional access points to encrypted data will create added  vulnerabilities, new security problems, and additional costs.  While  some users may decide that the benefits of key escrow outweigh the  costs, governments should not be imposing these costs and risks on  users who do not want them.  Individuals should be able to choose the  type of encryption they want.The global adoption of government access systems has serious, negativeconsequences on the privacy of computer users. The recent Administrationannouncement is another step in that wrong direction.-----------------------------------------------------------------------WHAT YOU CAN DO -- ADOPT YOUR LEGISLATORAs Members of Congress head home for the fall elections, they need to hearfrom Internet users about the importance of encryption policy reform forthe future of the Net.Adopt your legislator -- tell them that the Administration's Key Escrowplan threatens the basic privacy rights of Internet users, and let us knowwhat they say!Please take a moment to join the "Adopt Your Legislator" campaign.

Usinga carrot-and-stick approach, the plan promises moderate, short-term exportrelief in return for the development and eventual adoption of key recoverysystems.The Administration unveiled its encryption initiative at a White Housebriefing by CIA Director John Deutch, Domestic Policy Advisor to the VicePresident Greg Simon, Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch, andhigh-level representatives of the Department of Justice and the Office ofManagement and Budget.  The basic outlines of the proposal included belowwere culled from the Administration's statement and Tuesday's White Housebriefing.Major features of the new policy include:* ALLOWS EXPORT OF 56-BIT ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS,  "contingent upon industry commitments to build and market future  products that support key recovery." Six-month licenses for 56-bit  exports would be granted and renewed for up to two years -- contingent  on satisfactory progress towards key escrow.* REQUIRES KEY ESCROW CAPABILITIES AFTER TWO YEARS in all exportable  products with more than 40 bits.* "ENCOURAGES" THE ADOPTION OF KEY ESCROW SYSTEMS through international  agreements, standards processes, and a new key management  infrastructure.* TRANSFERS JURISDICTION OVER ENCRYPTION EXPORT LICENSING TO THE  DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, but grants the Department of Justice a formal  vote in the process.The President is expected to sign an Executive Order enacting many of thesechanges in mid-October. Other pieces will be published as agency rules orregulations; a small part of the proposal (rules governing key holders) mayrequire legislation.WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:In the short run, computer users may see more widespread availability of moderately stronger encryption products (up to 56-bit key length) if vendors choose to and are able to meet the "commitments" required under the proposal.  In the longer term, however, even these moderately strongerproducts will only be exportable with key escrow.  Ultimately, this proposal is designed to force the widespread adoption of key escrow systems,both domestically and abroad.A.  EXPORT CONTROL RELIEF AS AN INCENTIVE FOR KEY ESCROW:  The    Administration proposal would allow for short-term export of 56-bit    DES equivalent encryption products in return for commitments from    exporters to develop "key recovery" systems.* Starting on Jan. 1, 1997, the Administration would begin granting six  month general licenses for export of 56-bit encryption products.* Licenses would be granted "contingent on commitments from exporters to  explicit benchmarks and milestones for developing and incorporating  key recovery features into their products and services."* Additional six month licenses would be granted "if milestones are  met."* In two years, "the export of 56-bit products that do not support key  recovery will no longer be permitted."* Export of longer key lengths would continue for certain sensitive  financial applications.* Export of longer key lengths may be allowed more generally once key  escrow mechanisms are in place.Questions remain as to exactly what form the commitments from exporterswill take, who will qualify for these relaxations, and what will happen atthe end of two years to 56-bit non-escrow products in the marketplace andhow they will be supported.  No interoperability restrictions on productshave been mentioned, and the Administration seemed to indicate that itwould be willing to tolerate a greater degree of interoperability betweenproducts.WHAT EXPORT CONTROLS MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:This Administration export control scheme coerces industry into developingkey escrow systems, domestically and abroad, whether they want to or not.Since 1992, export controls have been the favorite vehicle for enforcingthe adoption of such key escrow systems.  The strong public desire forsecure global communications has allowed government to use key escrow as aprecondition for export relief.   Export controls are a force for keyescrow in the domestic market as well as the international market becauseof the need for secure international communications and the cost ofproducing product lines for U.S. use only.  The Administration realizesthis: as CIA Director Deutch stated at the White House press briefing, hewas more concerned with encryption that people "buy at Sears" than aboutless popular strong encryption products that the Administration concedeswill always be available.In addition to their impact on the market for key escrow, the proposal'sexport controls and key length limits themselves hurt user privacy andsecurity.* Export controls don't make sense for a global Internet; they place  business at a competitive disadvantage and prevent deployment of a  secure global infrastructure.* 56-bits is not enough for many applications.  CDT welcomes the  Administration's recognition that 40-bit products are not strong  enough, but last winter's study by a panel of encryption experts  argued that DES keys can be cracked relatively quickly by well-  financed groups, and that 70- to 90-bit keys are more appropriate.* Key length limits are a flawed approach because they presuppose that  some entities should be able to break keys and some should not -- a  solution that is unlikely to appeal to worldwide consumers of  encryption.B.  "KEY RECOVERY":  Government access to the plaintext of encrypted    data remains the centerpiece of the Administration proposal.  Major    features of the key escrow requirements in the latest proposal    include:* Key escrow systems would rely on a trusted party to recover a user's  confidentiality keys for use by law enforcement acting under "proper  authority."* The trusted recovery party might in some cases be internal to the  user's organization, but in all cases notice to surveillance targets  that their key information had been released would be prohibited.* Access to keys internationally "would be provided in accordance with  destination country policies and bilateral understandings."* The Administration will pursue legislation to govern the release of  keys, provide criminal and civil penalties for unauthorized releases  or theft of keys, and provide liability protection for key holders.* The Administration will continue to "encourage" the adoption of key  escrow systems through it's broad efforts to promote international key  escrow agreements, government key escrow purchasing standards, and the  creation of a key management infrastructure.None of the officials at the White House briefing were able to givespecific information about the requirements to be placed on key holders(e.g., response times, security clearances, etc.)  The Administration didindicate a broader approach to allowing industry key escrow systems thatmore limited access to confidential information through, for example,recovery of specific plaintext or separation of key information.  NOTE: KEY ESCROW V. KEY RECOVERY -- CDT recognizes that real progress  has been made in the development of systems that provide access to the  plaintext of encrypted data while minimizing the collection and  disclosure of sensitive key information.  However, from a privacy  policy perspective these approaches have the same basic privacy  problem: they are designed to provide law enforcement with guaranteed  access to all encrypted information.WHAT "KEY RECOVERY" MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:CDT recognizes that some companies and users may wish to use key escrowsystems.  The Administration's apparent recognition that these systems arebest designed in the private sector is welcome.  However, this policy'sacknowledged desire to widely promote key escrow is dangerous and threatensthe privacy of users:* Users are being pushed towards key escrow, whether they want it or  not. The Administration is using the enormous pressure of export  controls, competitive markets, and industry standards to force  adoption of key escrow.  Each user should be free to decide for  themselves whether to accept the costs of key escrow.* International key escrow doesn't protect privacy in a world without a  Fourth Amendment -- What legal standards apply to communications when  keys are held in foreign countries? Officials have been unable to  clearly explain how the privacy of computer users will be preserved.* Key escrow dramatically expands law enforcement capabilities --  Guaranteed access to encrypted information is a far greater intrusion  into our lives than the delicate balance struck under U.S. privacy  law.* Key escrow is unproven -- The NRC's recent study argued that a policy  relying on key escrow is "not appropriate at this time" and "is likely  to have a significant negative impact on the natural development of  applications."* Key escrow creates new security vulnerabilities, such as the creation  of large aggregations of sensitive key information, that are poorly  understood.C.  TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION TO THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT:  According to    the White House, "after consultation with Congress, jurisdiction for    commercial encryption controls will be transferred from the State    Department to the Commerce Department."* Encryption licenses will be reviewed under the Commerce Department's  "normal process" by a committee with representatives from the  Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, Energy, and for encryption  exports, Justice.* The Justice Department will have a single vote in the review  committee, which will make its decisions by majority rule.* The State Department will only have jurisdiction over special, single  customer, military-specific encryption products.WHAT TRANSFERRING JURISDICTION MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:While the switch to Commerce has been perceived as helpful by some, CDTbelieves the benefits are unclear if fundamental policy remains unchanged.The switch to Commerce will have little impact on the underlying policydirection aimed at institutionalizing key escrow.  Moreover, the CommerceDepartment's review committee is heavily weighted towards the lawenforcement and national security perspective (State, Defense, Justice, andEnergy), with the Commerce Department the lone representative of industryand consumer interests. Finally, the presence of domestic law enforcementin export control decisions raises serious questions about the ultimategoal of this policy.IV.  CONCLUSIONThe Administration's latest encryption proposal remains wedded to aflawed, key escrow and export control oriented approach that does notaddress the privacy concerns of users.  While it contains some welcomeideas, at its heart the Administration proposal uses the short-term easingof export controls to promote key escrow through a Faustian bargain with anindustry desperate to produce strong security products.Such manipulation of the market for encryption products is designed toforward law enforcement's dangerous agenda of worldwide governmental accessto all encrypted information.  The march towards institutionalized keyescrow is a real threat to the privacy of computer users, particularly in aworld where not everyone has a Fourth Amendment.  The United States shouldbe a force for Internet privacy and security worldwide.  Rather thanforcing key escrow on a wary public, the Administration should look to workwith Congress, privacy and Internet advocates, the user community, andindustry to craft a truly voluntary policy that meets the privacy andsecurity needs of computer users in the global Information Age.-----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

To that end, this Administration isconsulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state andlocal law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major initiativeto liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products. The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to usestronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protecttheir privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information. Itwill support the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security ofthe global information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S.encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key managementinfrastructure. Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption productswill be permitted under a general license after one-time review, and contingentupon industry commitments to build and market future products that supportkey recovery. This policy will apply to hardware and software products. The relaxation of controls will last up to two years. The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technologystrategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the ultimatesolution must be market-driven. Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make commitmentsto develop and sell products that support the key recovery system that Iannounced in July. That vision presumes that a trusted party (in some casesinternal to the user's organization) would recover the user's confidentialitykey for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under proper authority. Access to keys would be provided in accordance with destination countrypolicies and bilateral understandings. No key length limits or algorithmrestrictions will apply to exported key recovery products. Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remainfree to use any encryption system domestically. The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryptionpolicy initiative designed to promote electronic information security andpublic safety. For export control purposes, commercial encryption productswill no longer be treated as munitions. After consultation with Congress,jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred fromthe State Department to the Commerce Department. The Administration alsowill seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providingpenalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery agentsagainst liability when they properly release a key. As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the purchaseof key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote key recovery arrangementsin bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop federal cryptographicand key recovery standards, and stimulate the development of innovativekey recovery products and services. Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued afterone-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit benchmarksand milestones for developing and incorporating key recovery features intotheir products and services, and for building the supporting infrastructureinternationally. Initial approval will be contingent on firms providinga plan for implementing key recovery. The plan will explain in detail thesteps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute, and/or marketencryption products with key recovery features. The specific commitmentswill depend on the applicant's line of business. The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periodsif milestones are met. Two years from now, the export of 56-bit productsthat do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted. Currentlyexportable 40-bit mass market software products will continue to be exportable. We will continue to support financial institutions in their efforts toassure the recovery of encrypted financial information. Longer key lengthswill continue to be approved for products dedicated to the support of financialapplications. The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry, users,state and local law enforcement, and other private sector representativeswith the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery. Topics willinclude: evaluating the developing global key recovery architecture assessing lessons-learned from key recovery implementation advising on technical confidence issues vis-a-vis access to and releaseof keys addressing interoperability and standards issues identifying other technical, policy, and program issues for governmentalaction. The Administration's initiative is broadly consistent with the recent recommendationsof the National Research Council. It also addresses many of the objectivesof pending Congressional legislation.

He also criticizedthe White House for its failure to negotiate on the cornerstone of its proposals: that companies must agree to "escrow" their decryption keys. "I have no doubt that it was the pressure of Congress, high-tech companiesand privacy advocates that dragged the White House kicking and screaminginto agreeing that export restrictions should be eased," said Burns,chief sponsor of the Pro-CODE bill, which would loosen restrictions on encryptionexports and prohibit government-mandated key escrow. "However, I can'tsay I'm pleased with a process that has all but excluded Congress and thepublic from the discussion. "The administration's insistence on key escrow as a condition of liftingthese restrictions has never been negotiable." Meanwhile, what choicedo these companies have but to yield as their global competitiveness witherson the vine? "This plan raises even more questions than it answers, such as, whatabout the widespread availability of much stronger encryption that whichis allowed by the White House? How do we deal with rapid changes in technologythat will inevitably render the 56-bit limit obsolete? The devil is definitelyin the details. "This debate is not over by any stretch of the imagination. The administrationhas prevented Congress from weighing in on this issue just as support wasbuilding for a legislative solution. I intend to move forward with pro-encryptionlegislation in the next Congress. "I will also push for vigorous oversight of the administration's planin the Commerce Committee." The Senate Commerce Committee, of whichBurns is a member, has jurisdiction over the Commerce Department. The administrationhas stated its intent to transfer export licensing authority over encryptionfrom the State Department to the Commerce Department. ### Back.

Leahy Statement re: Admin. Crypto Proposal, 10/1/96 STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE October 1, 1996 The timing of the Administration's announcement on encryption, within hoursof the Congress' likely adjournment, is unfortunate. The Administrationneeds to work with Congress to develop a consensus on a national encryptionpolicy that takes account of the privacy, law enforcement and competitivenessconcerns of our Nation's citizens and businesses. Taking unilateral steps will not resolve this issue, but instead could delaybuilding the consensus we so urgently need. This issue simply cannot byresolved by Executive fiat. While technology should not dictate policy, particularly when our publicsafety and national security interests are at issue, any policy we adoptmust protect our privacy. As the Administration and industry rush to findan alternative to unbreakable encryption, they should take heed that anysolution which fails to protect the Fourth Amendment and privacy rightsof our citizens will be unacceptable. That is why, with bipartisan support, Senator Burns and I introduced legislationin March that set out privacy safeguards to protect the decoding keys toencrypted communications and stringent legal procedures for law enforcementagencies to get access to those keys. In this plan, the Administration is directing the resources of our high-techindustry to develop breakable, rather than unbreakable, encryption. Butno one is yet clear about who will be legally allowed to break into encryptedmessages, and under what circumstances. These are questions that have tobe answered not only with our own government but also with foreign governments. The weakest link in a key recovery system may be the country with the weakestprivacy protections. Internet users, who can send messages around the globeseamlessly, do not want the privacy of their encrypted communications tobe at the mercy of a country that ignores the Fourth Amendment principleswe enjoy here. These are significant privacy and security concerns not answered by theAdministration's plan. Even without reading the fine print, the general outline of the Administration'splan smacks of the government trying to control the marketplace for high-techproducts. Only those companies that agree to turn over their business plansto the government and show that they are developing key recovery systems,will be rewarded with permission to sell abroad products with DES encryption,which is the global encryption standard. Conditioning foreign sales of products with DES on development of key recoverysystems puts enormous pressure on our computer industry to move forwardwith key recovery, whether their customers want it or not. Internet users themselves -- not the FBI, not the NSA, not any governmentregulator -- should decide what encryption method best serves their needs.Then the marketplace will be able to respond. The Administration is puttingthe proverbial cart before the horse, by putting law enforcement interestsahead of every one elses. But that is not the only catch in the Administration's plan. Permissionto export DES will end in two years. Allowing American companies to sellDES overseas is a step long overdue. Given the fact that a Japanese companyis already selling "triple DES", one might say this step is toolittle, too late. Threatening to pull the plug on DES in two years, whenthis genie is already out of the bottle, does not promote our high-techindustries overseas. Does this mean that U.S. companies selling sophisticatedcomputer systems with DES encryption overseas must warn their customers\\thatthe supply may end in two years? Customers both here and abroad want stablesuppliers, not those jerked around by their government. The most effective way to protect the privacy and security of our on-linecommunications is to use encryption technology. Every American should beconcerned about our country's policy oencryption since the resolution ofthis debate will affect privacy, jobs and the competitiveness of our high-techindustries. Back.

Judge Marilyn Hall Patel handed down the declaratory judgment on Wednesdayin Bernstein v. Dept. of State, a challenge to the Cold War-era InternationalTraffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) that restrict export of encryption hardwareand software. The case was brought by researcher Daniel Bernstein, whowas prevented from publishing an encryption algorithm due to the exportcontrols. In her central ruling, Judge Patel held that, "The ITAR licensingsystem as applied to Category XIII(B) [cryptographic systems] acts as anunconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment." The opinion is an important first ruling by a Federal judge that there areserious First Amendment problems with the Administration's encryption restrictions. The ruling protects the publication of encryption source code and, if upheld,would significantly undermine the outdated export controls that currentlythreaten the privacy of computer users. The ruling also serves as a strongstatement of constitutional principles in the face of further encryptionregulations threatened both domestically and internationally. A cautionary note: At this time the court's ruling does not- necessarilypermit widespread encryption exports. The ultimate effect of the rulingon export of encryption products, particularly under new Commerce Departmentrules expected to take effect on January 1, is unclear. Major Findings In a closely-reasoned 40 page opinion, Judge Patel presented the most extensiveruling to date on the First Amendment problems raised by ITAR export controlson encryption. Major holdings of the court include: Encryption source code is protected speech -- The judge reiteratedher April ruling that "source code is speech," and held that:"Software relating to encryption is simply a topic of speech employedby some scientists involved in applied research. Hence, Snuffle [Bernstein'sencryption program] is speech afforded the full protection of the FirstAmendment not because it enables encryption, but because it is itself speech." The ITAR export controls on encryption are an unconstitutionalprior restraint -- The court held that the ITAR licensing process asapplied to encryption exports has the effect of preventing the publicationof software source code and thus represents a "prior restraint"on protected speech. Such restraints are highly disfavored under the FirstAmendment since they bypass the judicial process and give government officialsbroad discretion to rule on the permissibility of speech. Calling the ITAR scheme "a paradigm of standardless discretion"the court ruled that the government failed to meet any of the proceduralsafeguards required for prior restraints of speech. "Because it failsto provide for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicialreview and for a duty on the part of the [licensing agency] to go to courtand defend a denial of a license, the ITAR licensing system as applied toCategory XIII(B) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violationof the First Amendment." ITAR restrictions on "technical data" and "defensearticles" raise constitutional issues -- The court was "inclinedto agree" that export controls on 'technical data,' as they relateto academic and scientific speech, violate the First Amendment, but wasforced by Circuit Court precedent to uphold the restrictions. The courtalso held that ITAR definitions "defense articles" and "technicaldata" are to be more narrowly construed so as to maintain their constitutionality. The court did not specifically address the constitutionality of object codeexport restrictions. The court also declined to rule on whether encryptionrules are content-based, or whether there were other First Amendment interestsin encryption based upon anonymity. The court largely denied Bernstein'sother challenges based on overbreadth and vagueness, and denied Bernstein'smotion for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that it was not necessarygiven representation's by the government . Conclusion: Questions Remain The Bernstein ruling leaves many issues unresolved: The opinion's reasoning is based on source code protection, but itsultimate applicability to the export of object code or commercial productsis unclear. The District Court's ruling is not controlling in other potentialprosecutions under the export controls, though it is influential. The court did not rule on the constitutional problems raised by encryptionexport regulations that are not prior restraint, providing little guidanceshould the Administration significantly modify the licensing process. Moreover, new rules from the Department of Commerce are expected to replacethe ITAR encryption regulations as of January 1. The immediate effect ofJudge Patel's holding on the new Commerce rules is unclear, although thenew rules are strikingly similar to the ITAR and appear to contain manyof the same underlying constitutional problems. Despite these unanswered questions, Judge Patel's opinion represents a significantstep forward in the efforts to reform outdated U.S. encryption regulations. The ruling lays the groundwork for further challenges to encryption restrictions. The ruling also spells out important First Amendment protections for sourcecode as new encryption restrictions are being considered both internationallyand domestically. Finally, this ruling should serve as a wakeup call toCongress, the Administration, and the public: current U.S. encryption policiesraise serious issues of individual liberty, and should be changed to respectthe free speech and privacy rights of computer users.

S.1726, the encryption bill authoredby Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) and others, offers the electronic commerce counterpointto S. 1587, the pro-privacy encryption bill offered earlier this sessionby Senator Burns, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and others. S.1726 would: Relax current export controls by lifting restrictions on all encryptionhardware and software, regardless of key length, that is "generallyavailable" or in the public domain in the United States. Hardware andsoftware not available in the mass market or public domain would fall underan export scheme that would currently allow up to roughly DES-strength (i.e.,56-bit key length) security. Give the Commerce Department exclusive jurisdiction over encryptionexports, rather than the State Department. Affirm domestic use and sale of encryption and explicitly prohibitsmandatory key escrow. Prohibit Commerce Department standard-setting activities on encryption. Present broad new Congressional finding on the negative impact of currentencryption regulations on electronic commerce. The bill does not contain any of the key holder standards found in S.1587,or the criminal provisions found in S.1587 and its House counterpart H.R.3011. Taken together, the provisions of S.1726 are designed to make strongencryption products more widely available and remove many of the competitivebarriers facing U.S. industry and individuals. Major provisions. The "Promotionof Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996" wouldsubstantially change current encryption controls in the areas of exportcontrols, domestic use and distribution, and Commerce Department standard-setting. Export Controls: Under the Arms Control Export Act and subsequent ITAR regulations, encryptionproducts and technology are classified as "munitions" subjectto a complex export licensing scheme involving the State Department andCommerce Department. Currently, products with encryption keys over 40 bitslong -- a level of security increasingly viewed as inadequate for many uses-- generally cannot be exported. The Administration has used these regulationsto support policies whereby moderately stronger systems could be exportedif they guarantee government access to encryption keys through governmentor third-party key escrow systems. Moreover, due to the need for internationalinteroperability and the difficulty of creating domestic and internationalproduct lines, the export controls have had the effect of preventing thewidespread availability of strong encryption products within the UnitedStates. S. 1726 would relax these export controls: Any encryption software, or hardware incorporating such software, thatis "generally available, as is, and designed for installation by theuser or purchaser," or that is "in the public domain," wouldbe exportable, regardless of key lengths. "Generally available"software includes encryption software distributed over the Internet, widelyoffered for sale or transfer in the U.S. (including software disseminatedas shareware or freeware), or preloaded on computer hardware. The governmentwould retain the ability to regulate encryption under the more narrow nationalsecurity standards of the Trading With The Enemy Act or International EmergencyEconomic Powers Acts. The category of freely exportable encryption products appears to cover abroad class of hardware and software. Many of the popular web browsers,PGP, or encryption in other widely available software would all be exportablewith unlimited key lengths once made publicly available in the U.S. Thebasic premise appears to be: If encryption is available in your local softwarestore, via mail order catalogs, or widely distributed over the Net, thenit should be freely exportable. Other encryption hardware and software products would be exportableunder license to countries "in which exports of computer software ofsimilar capability are permitted for use by financial institutions ... not... controlled in fact by U.S. persons." Currently, this scheme makesnon-mass market hardware and software exportable with up to roughly DES-strength(i.e., 56-bit key length) security. (This represents a minor change fromS.1587, which had the same standard for software but permitted export ofnon-mass-market hardware if products of similar security were commerciallyavailable abroad.) The Secretary of Commerce would be empowered to deny such exports wherethere is "substantial evidence" that the products in questionwould be "diverted to a military end-use" or "modified formilitary or terrorist end-use." The Department of Commerce would receive exclusive jurisdiction overexport controls for encryption hardware, software, and technology, exceptsuch encryption technology that is specifically designed or modified formilitary use. Domestic Use and Sale of Encryption: No restrictions on sale or distribution of encryption in interstate commerce - S.1726 would prohibit the Federal government, or any State, from restrictingor regulating the sale of encryption products in interstate commerce. Prohibits mandatory key escrow - the bill would also prohibit the Federalgovernment, or any State, from imposing any key disclosure requirementsas a condition of sale in interstate commerce. Commerce Department Standards Activities: The bill restricts Commerce Department standard-setting activities on encryption. The Department, through the National Institute of Standards or otherwise,may not "promulgate, or enforce regulations, or otherwise adopt standardsor carry out policies that result in encryption standards for use by businessesor entities other than Federal computer systems." The Commerce Department would also be prohibited from promulgating regulationsthat impose government-designed encryption standards on the private sectorby restricting exports. Comparison of S.1726 with S.1587 (the Leahy-Burns encryptionbill) and H.R. 3011. S.1726, the Pro-CODE, provides the electronic commerce equivalent to S.1587,the pro-privacy encryption bill introduced by Senator Leahy, Burns, Dole,Pressler and Murray two months ago, and S.1587's House counterpart, H.R.3011, introduced by Rep. Goodlatte and others. Pro-CODE would relax exportcontrols in a roughly similar way, but contains none of the key holder provisions,and no new crime for using encryption to obstruct justice. Where S.1587is more narrowly applicable to only wire or electronic communications, S.1726applies to encryption of both communications and other information suchas stored files. Pro-CODE also contains a new provision to prohibit theCommerce Department from imposing encryption standards. Major areas for comparison include: Encryption of stored information: The definition of encryption in S.1587applies only to "wire and electronic communications," while S.1726includes "wire and electronic communications and information."S.1726 would thus appear to protect encryption hardware and software fornon-communicated information, such as encryption of locally stored filesor disk media. Export provisions: S.1587 and H.R.3011 have very similar export provisionsto S.1726. In all three, software and hardware that is "generallyavailable, as is, and designed for installation by the user or purchaser,"or that is "in the public domain," would be exportable, regardlessof key lengths. Other encryption hardware and software would be exportableusing the "currently exportable to foreign financial institutions"standard (i.e., roughly DES strength; see explanation above) under S.1726.The same standard is used for other software in S.1587 and H.R. 3011, buthardware is subject to a more liberal test of what is already "commerciallyavailable" abroad. Key holder provisions: S.1726 and H.R. 3011 contain none of the extensiveprovisions in S.1587 regarding the responsibilities of third-party encryptionkey holders, or standards for release of keys to law enforcement. Use of encryption to obstruct justice: S.1726 does not contain the provisionfound in S.1587 and H.R.3011 that would criminalize the use of encryptionto obstruct communications from law enforcement officials in furtheranceof a felony. Personal use exemption: S.1726 does not contain the broader personaluse exemption for U.S. users of encryption traveling abroad, found in S.1587. Commerce Department Standards activities: S.1726 prohibits any actionsby the Commerce Department that have the effect of imposing government designedencryption standards. S.1587 has no analogous provision. New findings: S.1726 contains a broad new set of findings emphasizingthe importance of encryption to the development of electronic commerce.

Your leadership in sponsoring the"Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of1996" is critical to eliminating the counterproductive regulation inthis area.  To build public support for this initiative, the undersignedgroups will also be sponsoring a series of public education events designedto raise awareness of encryption's importance to U.S. competitiveness andindividual privacy. We invite you to join us in this campaign.Current U.S. export controls and other regulations on encryptiontechnologies are stifling electronic commerce on the Internet, handicappingU.S. industry in the global marketplace, and preventing computer users fromprotecting their privacy online.  The high technology industry and Internetusers labor today under Cold War-era cryptography policies that threatenU.S. jobs by compromising the competitiveness of U.S. industry.  The ability of U.S. companies to participate in the global Internetmarketplace for computer sales, online services, and new electroniccommerce applications is undermined by export controls which prevent themfrom selling secure products required by their global customer base.  Theseproducts and services are, however, available from foreign competitors. Moreover, individuals will not use the Internet if their constitutionalprivacy rights are not protected.  Relaxing export controls, as thePro-CODE does, is essential to the success of electronic commerce and tomeet the needs of individuals online. To support this effort, many of the undersigned groups are sponsoring anEncryption Education Day this July in Silicon Valley.  We look forward toyour participation in the centerpiece of this education effort, aroundtable meeting in Silicon Valley between industry leaders, members ofCongress, encryption experts, and the national press, to continue the taskof raising public awareness about this important issue. We are committed toworking with you and other members of Congress towards a new nationalencryption policy.

Laterthis week, the Senate Commerce Committee will have an opportunityto address this problem when it acts on S.1726, the Promotion of Commerce On-line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 co-sponsored by Senators Burns, Leahy, Pressler, Lott, Wyden, Ashcroft, and others.The Center for Democracy and Technology strongly urges youto report S.1726 out of the Senate Commerce Committee withoutamendment.Individuals and businesses need strong encryption products to protect their personal communications, confidential records, and proprietary information online. Such trust in the security of the network is needed if we are to realize the tremendous promise of the Internet to invigorate our democracy and promote electronic commerce.  Moreover,the widespread use of strong encryption actually prevents crime and protects our sensitive infrastructure from possible "information warfare."Yet Cold War-era regulations on encryption continue to restrict the export and use of encryption products. Since strong encryption products are readily available abroad, these export controls do little to keep encryption out of the hands of terrorists, criminals, or foreign governments.  It is only law-abiding U.S. computer users who must sacrifice their security under current regulations.  The Administration has been unable to justify this loss of privacy for millions of computer users to satisfy a law enforcement concern that has already been compromised. S.1726 would sensibly ease the export controls on encryption while guaranteeing the rights of American computer users to choose the security products most appropriate for them.  Congressional action is urgently needed given growing concerns about the security of our information infrastructure and the Administration's continued intransigence on this issue. As a public interest group deeply involved in promoting democratic values in new electronic media, the Center for Democracy and Technology has had a chance to see first-hand the real need for privacyand security online that only widely available strong encryption productscan provide.  Help send a message that Congress is serious about the privacy and security of computer users. Please pass the Pro-CODE bill out of the Commerce Committee without amendment.Sincerely,Jerry BermanExecutive DirectorCenter for Democracy and Technology Back to the Pro-CODE Page Back to the CDT Home Page Posted on September 11, 1996WT02-B06-34IA096-001029-B017-224http://www.cdt.org:80/crypto/960502_Burns_stmnt.html 205.177.10.31 19970215020030 text/html 8001HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:59:14 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html CDT - Sen. Burns Pro-Code statement STATEMENT BY SENATOR CONRAD BURNS (R-MT) ON INTRODUCTION OF THE "PRO-CODE" BILL THURSDAY MAY 2, 1996 Thank you all for coming this afternoon. I'd especially like to thank theoriginal cosponsors of this legislation, some of whom are here today: thedistinguished Majority Leader Senator Dole; Senator Larry Pressler, whochairs the full committee to which this bill has been referred; SenatorLeahy, our chief Democratic cosponsor; Senator Murray; Senator Wyden;Senator Nickles; Senator McCain; and Senator Ashcroft. I'd like to announce today that we are introducing the Pro-CODE bill, the"Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era." Like the title of the bill states, my primary objective with thislegislation is to promote commerce both domestically and abroad. But Ihave two other goals that I believe will be achieved by Pro-CODE: one is toimprove the competitiveness of American software companies with theirforeign competitors, the other is to protect the intellectual property andprivacy or both businesses and individuals. Pro-CODE would have a profound impact on our economy and the way each of uslives our life from day to day. It's a relatively simple bill, but itdeals with a term few of us are familiar with: encryption. Encryption is simply the use of a string of letters or numbers _ or a "key"_ to render our computer files and transmissions unreadable by people whohave no business reading them. If you have the right key, you can unlockthe code and have access to that information. Unfortunately, American businesses and computer users face a threat _ andit's a threat from their own government _ because the currentadministration won't let American companies export encryption at a levelhigher than 40 bits. That's a fancy word, but what I'm told it means isthat it's a level of security that can be cracked by your basicsupercomputer in about one-thousandth of a second at a cost of a tenth of acent. Companies can sell stronger encryption here at home, but it's tooexpensive to create two different standards, so they don't. What this means is that commerce and communication on computer networksincluding the Internet is not reaching its full potential. How many of youwould feel secure sending your credit card number over the Internet _especially when you learn that reported invasions by computer hackersincreased nine-fold between 1990 and 1994? Or when Internet World magazineestimates that the actual number of unwanted computer penetrations in 1992alone was 1.2 million? If you were a business, how many of you would feelsecure passing sensitive information to your branches around the world oraround the nation? If you were an ordinary citizen, would you feel secureknowing that many of your records and files are subject to the kind ofsecurity that the cyber-criminals of today just laugh at? Yet that's the problem we face today, and my colleagues here today and Ifind it unacceptable. Just three months ago we passed a historictelecommunications law that is designed to make it easier to interact witheach other. But that law _ that vehicle which will take us along theinformation highway _ is useless without the engine of information securitydriving it forward. Our bill would allow the unrestricted export of mass-market orpublic-domain encryption programs. It would also require the Secretary ofCommerce to allow the export of encryption technologies if products ofsimilar strength are available elsewhere in the world. Finally, it wouldprohibit the government from imposing a mandatory key-escrow system inwhich the government or another third party would have a "back door" toyour computer files. I come from a state where distances can often keep us apart. From Eureka,Montana, in the northwest to Alzada, Montana, in the southeast is the samedistance as from Washington, D.C., to Chicago. Anything to bring us closertogether will give us benefits only enjoyed now by folks in larger areas.It will also give the mom-and-pop businesses in our smallest communities aleg up on their bigger competitors as we enter the information age. But my concern is also based on the effect the current policy is having onjobs and industry in this nation. Because of our current ill-advisedpolicy, American companies will lose their share of the world market _which now stands at 75 percent _ to foreign companies who don't have toabide by such restrictions. You'll notice, for example, in the press kitwe are making available to you, we have included a Web page from a SouthAfrican company that boasts 128-bit encryption. In many cases, theseencryption programs are available to download from the Internet. American companies clearly are at a competitive disadvantage. A study bythe Computer Systems Policy Project found that within just the next fouryears, American companies could lose $60 billion in revenues and Americanworkers could lose 216,000 high-tech jobs. Our bill is a jobs bill thatI'm sure the administration can agree with. But it's not only that. Asyou can see, it's also a consumers bill. One of the questions I have gotten is, "How does this legislation differfrom a bill you are also sponsoring with Senator Leahy?" The answer is, nota lot. However, Pro-CODE is narrower in its scope. It deals exclusivelywith the issue of commerce and omits the criminality provisions. Inaddition, it does not set up guidelines for a voluntary key-escrowarrangement. This is a streamlined measure that I hope to move quicklythrough the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and theScience, Technology and Space subcommittee, which I chair. We will havehearings on this bill, hopefully as soon as this month, and I hope to haveat least one of those in the field where the people are affected most bythis bill. In addition to the diverse and bipartisan group of senators you see beforeyou, support for this legislation in the private sector is both broad anddeep. Letters and statements of support have been made available to you inthe press kit, and I can tell you that's just the tip of the iceberg. Asyou can see on the monitor to my right, there are two homepages on the Webthat are dedicated to tracking encryption legislation and making peopleaware of why it is needed. As with the "blue-ribbon campaign," which youare probably familiar with, Internet users will be encouraged to downloadthe golden key and envelope symbol that you can see on this poster to myleft. They will then be able to link to one of the two encryption pages andshow their support for this effort. A number of supporters have come to the Capitol today and they have offeredto make themselves available if you have any questions after this newsconference, or you can call them later at the numbers we have provided toyou in the press kit. In addition to that grass-roots effort, I am also sending today an openletter to the Internet community encouraging support for this bill, and Iexpect it to be made available to hundreds of thousands of Internet users.I will also plan to make myself available for at least two online forums todiscuss my bill with computer users. I want to thank you again for coming today. Now I'd like to turn it overto the distinguished Majority Leader for his remarks.

Pressler Pro-Code statement STATEMENT OF SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER ON INTRODUCTION OF THE "PRO-CODE" ENCRYPTION LEGISLATION THURSDAY, MAY 2, 1996 I am proud to join with my colleagues today to introduce the "Promotionof On-Line Commerce in the Digital Era Act"(PRO-CODE). This bill willeliminate outdated, useless rules and regulations so that American companiescan compete effectively thoughtout the world in the global information technologyindustry. It will strengthen our economy, create jobs and maintain the UnitedStates' lead in telecommunications and information technology into the twenty-firstcentury. The high-tech industry is the crown jewel of the American economy-- growingexponentially each year and constantly creating new jobs. This is the futureof our country's economic security. We are the world leaders in the technology revolution. Whether in hardware,software, browsers, semiconductors, cryptography or other segments of theindustry, we have the talent and capability to retain this lead indefinitely. The private sector is doing everything possible to expand this industry. Unfortunately, they frequently are held back by unnecessary or antiquatedgovernment rules and regulations. Government should help, or at the veryleast, get out of the way Outdated government policy must change and it must change immediately. The future of this industry, its employees and our country's economy dependson this change. This is why I am an original sponsor of the "Promotion of CommerceOn-line in the Digital Era" (PRO-CODE) which we are introducing today. The Senate Commerce Committee will have jurisdiction over this bill, thatbasically, would allow unlimited export of commercially available encryptedsoftware. I believe that it is important to bring this issue before thecommittee I chair-- the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation--asI am committed to moving this legislation forward immediately and I am joinedby others on the Committee who feel the same way. The health of our national economy, and my home state of South Dakota'seconomy in particular, is heavily dependent upon exports. We must focuson expanding our present foreign markets and opening new ones in order tostrengthen our businesses and maintain our economic hegemony. It is undisputedthat American businesses can compete evenly with their foreign counterpartswhen operating on a level playing field. However, they are not always givenfair treatment. When U.S. companies are treated unfairly vis-a-vis their foreign competitors,they lose contracts and their market share suffers. This leads to lowerprofits and less repatriation of those profits to the United States. wemust do all we can to eliminate foreign trade barriers that restrict U.S.companies operating aboard. At the same time, we also must eliminate ourown government's discrimination against our American multinationals. Tothis end, I am working to assist U.S. multinationals companies, and high-techcompanies in particular, by eliminating unnecessary restrictions on theiroperations. The PRO-CODE bill enjoys widespread bi-partisan support. I believe thischange in policy is vital if the United States is to maintain its worldwide lead in the development and sale of software technology. This is anindustry key to the continued strength of our economy, however, export controls-- true relics of the Cold War -- are hurting American companies' abilityto sell their products overseas. We eon the Cold War. We must now disarmthe weapons used to win that war before they are used against us. It is simply logical to allow U.S. companies to sell overseas some of thetechnology they currently are allowed only to sell within the U.S. As youknow, certain software readily available around the world and on the Internetis not allowed to be exported from the U.S. Rules that once made senseare obsolete and harmful -- only to us -- in today's rapidly changing world.This encrypted software, which serves to secure communications is the futureof the industry. If we fail to loosen our export laws, American companies face two unpleasantchoices. First, they can simply stand by and watch their products be replacedby foreign competitors. This means losing this industry the way we lostconsumer electronics, steel and the auto industry in the past. In the morelikely alternative, these companies will be forced to move their productionand research facilities offshore.If this happens not only will our economysuffer, but we will lose high-paying, high-tech jobs. We cannot affordto allow either alternative to happen. That is why I am fighting to correctthis problem. We must do so -- before it is to late. When I led the effort to enact the sweeping Telecommunication Reform Actmy goal was to open up all aspects of the telecommunication industry towidespread competition. Without changes in the other laws this goal cannotbe fully achieved. Indeed without such changes we risk the loss of marketssuch as software to foreign competitors because our own government restrictsthe U.S. companies. The issue is a simple one -- with the globalization of our information systemswe must have secured transmissions. Those transactions should be protectedby the best encrypted software available. That means American products. As the Federal Communications Commission proceeds with implementation ofthe Telecommunication Act it is important for Congress to keep a watchfuleye on their deliberations. For example, some at the FCC support a mandatedHigh Definition Television (HDTV) standard. Not me. I will fight anyFCC attempt to set mandated equipment standards. To establish such mandateswould set a dangerous precedent which could chill competitive gains theU.S. has made thoughout the world. The computer industry has grown andflourished because the government did not set standards or impose mandates. The government should not get into mandating standards. I also am working to bolster our competitiveness through the enactment ofthe "International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness"bill. The purpose of this legislation is to make technical correctionsand simplification changes to the U.S. tax code -- eliminating some of thediscriminatory and redundant application of rules to our companies. Thisbill likely will include a provision eliminating the discrimination againstsoftware under the Foreign Sales Corporation rules. This too will helpU.S. software exporters. This bill contains common sense changes to thetax code designed to put U.S. companies on more equal footing with theirkey competitors in Japan and Germany. I intend to introduce this bill inthe next few weeks. Here too, I expect widespread bi-partisan support. I want to use my role as Chairman of the Commerce Committee -- with itsjurisdiction over international trade and the Commerce Department -- incombination with my membership on the Finance Committee -- which has jurisdictionover trade and tax policy -- to help strengthen American competitivenessoverseas. Our economic future depends upon diligent efforts to ensure our companies are treated equitably not only by foreigncountries, but by our own as well. We can compete with anyone given afair chance. It is my goal to put American first.

We created it. Now we dominate it. Our leadership is recognized worldwide. Today, our commanding position is under assault. Not by foreign competitors, but by our very own administration that touts itself as the darling of the high tech community. The administration's misguided proposal on encryption amounts to a pair of cement shoes for Silicon Valley. It seems to me that a new pair of track shoes might be a better answer. And as Senator Burns has pointed out, that's exactly what we intend to give them with our legislation. This measure has strong bi-partisan support and Senator Leahy has pushed this issue for some time. Strong encryption allows businesses and individuals worldwide to choose strong security features they need to protect information transmitted electronically. In simple terms, encryption amounts to nothing more than a modern day padlock. That's why Internet grassroots groups call our bill "My lock, My key." The administration apparently thinks very little of the right to privacy -- it presumes the government is entitled to all the so-called "keys" or secret passwords which protect computer generated information from prying eyes -- like hackers. The problem is President Clinton would only take the "keys" of U.S. products, not foreign ones. This would hobble our companies in the world market. After all, why would anyone buy U.S. computer products if they aren't secure? And they won't be once the government gets hold of the keys. Now many of you may be asking, "what's the big deal?" The administration's big brother proposal will literally destroy America's computer industry. The administration proposal will force American companies to surrender to foreign competitors, or force our companies to move off-shore in order to remain competitive. In short, our bill is pro-American. It bolsters our competitiveness. It creates jobs. It protects our right to privacy. And defends our national security.

Leahy Pro-Code statement STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON INTRODUCTION OF "PROMOTION OF COMMERCE ON-LINE IN THE DIGITAL ERA" (PRO-CODE) THURSDAY MAY 2, 1996 I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators in supportinglegislation to encourage the development and use of strong, privacy-enhancingtechnologies for the Internet by rolling back the out-dated restrictions on theexport of strong cryptography. As an Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting individualprivacy and encouraging the development of the Net as a secure and trustedcommunications medium. Current export restrictions only allow Americancompanies to export primarily weak encryption technology. The current strengthof encryption the U.S. government will allow out of the country is so weak that,according to a January 1996 study conducted by world-renowned cryptographers, apedestrian hacker can crack the codes in a matter of hours. A foreignintelligence agency can crack the current 40-bit codes in seconds. Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet and similarinteractive communications technologies by Americans to obtain critical medicalservices, to conduct business, to be entertained and communicate with theirfriends, raises special concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of thosecommunications. I have long been concerned about these issues, and have workedover the past decade to protect privacy and security for our wire and electroniccommunications. Encryption technology provides an effective way to ensure thatonly the people we choose can read our communications. Encryption is critical for electronic commerce really to flourish on theInternet, and for computer users to trust that their communciations will remainprivate. Today, I have sent out an open letter to the Internet about thisencryption legislation. So that people reading the letter can be assured thatit is really me sending it, I am using a popular encryption program called"Pretty Good Privacy", or "PGP", to authenticate my signature. This is yetanother practical use of encryption, and an important one for electroniccommerce. Maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computercommunications and information is very important to all of us both here andabroad. I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet about how humanrights groups in the Balkans have had their computers confiscated during raidsby security police seeking to find out the identities of people who havecomplained about abuses. The human rights groups have been able to get for freefrom the Internet an encryption program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) toprotect their computer communications and files. These encrypted files areundecipherable by the police and the names of the people who entrust their livesto the human rights groups are safe. The encryption bill, called the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in theDigital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996," which we introduce today, would: Bar any government-mandated use of any particular encryptionsystem, including key escrow systems and affirm the right of American citizensto use whatever form of encryption they choose domestically; Loosen export restrictions on encryption products so thatAmerican companies are able to export any generally available or mass marketencryption products without obtaining government approval; and Limit the authority of the federal government to set standardsfor encryption products used by businesses and individuals, particularlystandards which result in products with limited key lengths and key escrow. This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with Senator Burnsand other congressional colleagues this year. Both bills call for an overhaul ofthis country's export restrictions on encryption, and, if enacted, would quicklyresult in the widespread availability of strong, privacy protectingtechnologies. Both bills also prohibit a government-mandated key escrowencryption system. While PRO-CODE would limit the authority of the CommerceDepartment to set encryption standards for use by private individuals andbusinesses, the first bill we introduced, called the "Encrypted CommunicationsPrivacy Act", S.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement tofollow to obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to read the plaintext ofencrypted communications obtained under court order or other lawful process. To satisfy national security and law enforcement concerns, both billshave important exceptions to restrict encryption exports for military end-uses,or to terrorist designated or embargoed countries, such as Cuba or North Korea. I know this is not enough to satisfy our national security and lawenforcement agencies, who fear that the widespread use of strong encryption willundercut their ability to eavesdrop on terrorists or other criminals. BUT U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS WILL NOT KEEP ENCRYPTION OUT OF THE HANDS OFCRIMINALS; THESE CONTROLS ONLY HURT LEGITIMATE USERS AND AMERICAN BUSINESS. Anycriminal intent on encrypting his computer information or messages to avoidgetting caught can go into any Egghead store and buy off-the-shelf Lotus Notesor Norton Utilities encryption program, both of which contain strong encryptionthat cannot be exported. It is then a simple matter just to slip the softwaredisc into his pocket to smuggle out of the country. Actually, it is even simpler than that for a foreign terrorist or anycriminal to get ahold of strong encryption. They don't even have to leave home.With a computer, a modem and a telephone line, they could download for free offthe Internet from anywhere in the world strong encryption, such as Pretty GoodPrivacy. Strong encryption has an important use as a crime prevention shield, tostop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private computerfiles and stealing valuable proprietary information. We should be encouragingthe use of strong encryption to prevent certain types of computer and onlinecrime. It is clear that the current policy towards encryption exports ishopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs of individuals andbusinesses in the global marketplace. In one recent example, a major high-tech firm had a multi-million dollarcontract to sell digital television systems to China put at risk due to ourexport regulations. Why? The company suffered lengthy delays in getting exportapproval because the systems contained encryption technology to scramble TVsignals--a critical component of the system to protect the intellectual propertyrights of the programming carried by the signal. Foreign competitors seeking toget into the vast China market were ready and willing to step into the company'splace if it were unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. Two weeks afterthe contractual delivery date, the company finally got the export approval itsought. This example is particularly ironic since in trade negotiations, theUnited States has strongly urged China to protect intellectual property rightsbetter. Encryption expert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted thatcurrent U.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption are having a"deleterious effect ... on our country's ability to develop a reliable andtrustworthy information infrastructure." This sentiment is echoed by the chiefexecutive officers of 13 major U.S. computer systems companies, including IBM,Apple, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and others, which recently reportedthat "encryption is the most practical and effective means to protect valuableand confidential electronic information traveling across open networks. Theavailability of effective encryption is necessary to realize the full potentialof the Global Information Infrastructure (GII)." The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our nationalencryption policy on the right course. The PRO-CODE bill, as well as the"Encrypted Communications Privacy Act," S.1587, are much-needed steps to reformour nation's cryptography policy.

Leahy LETTER FROM SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON ENCRYPTION -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----     LETTER FROM SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON ENCRYPTION     May 2, 1996Dear Friends:Today, a bipartisan group of Senators has joined me in supportinglegislation to encourage the development and use of strong,privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet by rolling backthe out-dated restrictions on the export of strong cryptography.In an effort to demonstrate one of the more practical uses ofencryption technology (and so that you all know this messageactually came from me), I have signed this message using adigital signature generated by the popular encryption programPGP.  I am proud to be the first member of Congress to utilizeencryption and digital signatures to post a message to theInternet.As a fellow Internet user, I care deeply about protectingindividual privacy and encouraging the development of the Net asa secure and trusted communications medium.  I do not need totell you that current export restrictions only allow Americancompanies to export primarily weak encryption technology.  Thecurrent strength of encryption the U.S. government will allow outof the country is so weak that, according to a January 1996 studyconducted by world-renowned cryptographers, a pedestrian hackercan crack the codes in a matter of hours!  A foreign intelligenceagency can crack the current 40-bit codes in seconds.Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet andsimilar interactive communications technologies by Americans toobtain critical medical services, to conduct business, to beentertained and communicate with their friends, raises specialconcerns about the privacy and confidentiality of thosecommunications.  I have long been concerned about these issues,and have worked over the past decade to protect privacy andsecurity for our wire and electronic communications.  Encryptiontechnology provides an effective way to ensure that only thepeople we choose can read our communications.I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet about howhuman rights groups in the Balkans have had their computersconfiscated during raids by security police seeking to find outthe identities of people who have complained about abuses. Thanks to PGP, the encrypted files were undecipherable by thepolice and the names of the people who entrusted their lives tothe human rights groups were safe.The new bill, called the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in theDigital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996," would:     o    bar any government-mandated use of any particular     encryption system, including key escrow systems and affirm     the right of American citizens to use whatever form of     encryption they choose domestically;     o    loosen export restrictions on encryption products so     that American companies are able to export any generally     available or mass market encryption products without     obtaining government approval; and     o    limit the authority of the federal government to set     standards for encryption products used by businesses and     individuals, particularly standards which result in products     with limited key lengths and key escrow.This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with SenatorBurns and other congressional colleagues this year. Both billscall for an overhaul of this country's export restrictions onencryption, and, if enacted, would quickly result in thewidespread availability of strong, privacy protectingtechnologies. Both bills also prohibit a government-mandated keyescrow encryption system.  While PRO-CODE would limit theauthority of the Commerce Department to set encryption standardsfor use by private individuals and businesses, the first bill weintroduced, called the "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act",S.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement tofollow to obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to readthe plaintext of encrypted communications obtained under courtorder or other lawful process.It is clear that the current policy towards encryption exports ishopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs ofindividuals and businesses in the global marketplace.  Encryptionexpert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted that currentU.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption arehaving a "deleterious effect ... on our country's ability todevelop a reliable and trustworthy information infrastructure." The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our nationalencryption policy on the right course.I am looking forward to hearing from you on this important issue.Throughout the course of the recent debate on the CommunicationsDecency Act, the input from Internet users was very valuable tome and some of my Senate colleagues.You can find out more about the issue at my World Wide Web homepage (http://www.leahy.senate.gov/) and at the Encryption PolicyResource Page (http://www.crypto.com/).

McConnell [Initials] Edward J. Appel [Initials] Co-Chairs, Interagency Working Group on Cryptography Policy Attached for your review and comment is a draft paperentitled "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and PublicSafety in the Global Information Infrastructure." It presentsa vision and course of action for developing a cryptographicinfrastructure that will protect valuable information onnational and international networks. The draft paper is the result of the many discussions wehave had with interested parties concerning the use ofencryption. While those discussions have explored the use ofboth key recoverable encryption and non-recoverableencryption, the draft paper addresses an infrastructure whichuses key recoverable encryption. We believe such a keymanagement infrastructure, voluntary and supported by *privatesector* key management organizations, is the prospect of thenear future. It would permit users and manufacturers freechoice of encryption algorithm, facilitate internationalinteroperability, preserve law enforcement access, and, mostimportantly, provide strong system security and integrity. Recognizing that a robust infrastructure is not yet areality, we are also considering measures to liberalize exportpolicy for some non-escrowed products. Appendix II of thedraft paper begins to summarize current policy, and we intendto expand and improve that section. We believe that clearly articulating such a vision willaccelerate the ability of the United States to realize thefull advantages of the global network for commerce, securityand public safety. However, such a vision cannot become areality unless it is widely shared. Therefore, rather thanbeing a finished product, the attached paper is a draft whichwe ask you to help us improve. We hope it will contribute toconstructive discussion and promote a clearer understanding ofeach others' needs and concerns regarding the use ofencryption. We welcome your comments and look forward to furtherdiscussion. Written comments may be sent to our attention,Room 10236, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503. [End cover letter] [Note: All 25 pages of the typeset report have the word "Draft" printed in large letters across the text.] [Head note of report] Last Modified: May 17, 1996 Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in theGlobal Information Infrastructure Statement of the Issue This paper outlines a course of action for developing aninfrastructure that will protect valuable national informationresources on national and international networks. Governmentand industry must work together to create a securitymanagement infrastructure and attendant products thatincorporate robust cryptography without undermining nationalsecurity and public safety. A policy for escrow ofcryptographic keys which provides a basis for bilateral andmultilateral government agreements must be determined so thatindustry can produce products for worldwide interoperability.Industry will participate in defining algorithms and protocolstandards, and will develop key escrow encryption productssuitable for the protection of both government and privatesector information and which will assure timely, lawful,government decryption access. Government will help setstandards for the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) anddeliver a market for robust security products. A KMIinfrastructure and attendant key escrow products will providemany benefits, both domestic and internationally, as the USbegins to realize the advantages of the global network forimprove commerce, security and public safety. I. Introduction Government can no longer monopolize state of the artcryptography. It is no longer acceptable to argue that theonly information of a compelling national security interest isgovernment information. It is unrealistic to believe thatgovernment can produce solutions which keep ahead of today'srapdily changing information technology. Increasingly, allinstitutions, military, civil, or corporate, will communicateacross common links. The nation's commerce is moving tonetworking. With these enormous changes, means must be foundto responsibly raise the quality of cryptographic serviceswithout jeopardizing effective law enforcement, imperilingpublic safety. Industry and government must partner in the developmentof a public key-based key management infrastructure andattendant products that will assure participants can transmitand receive information electronically with confidence in theinformation's integrity, authenticity, and origin and whichwill assure timely lawful government access. When we conducttransactions, we rely on face-to-face interactions, orobtaining a signature on a paper, to have confidence thatcommitments will be fulfilled. Policies and infrastructure areneeded to assure we can have at least the same degree ofconfidence when we interact electronically. Government bearsa significant responsibility to ensure the informationinfrastructure has the features that are essential to suchconfidence. There is a more compelling rationale for the governmentto be a partner in the development of the KMI. Not only hasthe Information Age sparked fundamental changes in the way weinteract, but reliance on information systems makes ourinstitutions vulnerable to an unprecedented degree. Almost allinstitutions upon which public safety and national securitydepend, ranging from the power grid to military command andcontrol, are at severe risk because of their presence in anddependence upon a global information infrastructure. But the proliferation of quality cryptographic servicesis not without risk. Keys can be lost, stolen, or forgotten --rendering encrypted data useless. Additionally, the widespreaduse of encryption without safety features such as key recoverycan pose serious risks to society. It will put at riskimportant law enforcement and national security investigationswhere electronic surveillance and search and seizure areessential in preserving and prosecuting crimes, and moreimportantly, in saving human life. Public key cryptography allows for secure authenticatedtransactions with any party, known or unknown, with assuranceof data integrity and non-repudiation of the transaction.These features, together with increased network reliability,are needed to support electronic commerce, public services,redefined business processes and national security. But toachieve its promise, public key cryptography must be based ona key management infrastructure and attendant products thattie individual and coprorate identities to their public keythrough a series of Certificate Authorities (CA). The keymanagement infrastructure to do this on a global scale will bevery large and complex, but it is an essential foundation.Without a KMI of trusted certificate authorities, users cannotknow with whom they are dealing on the network, or sendingmoney to, or who signed a document, or if the document wasintercepted and changed by a third part. Therefore, users willdemand a strong key management infrastructure, which may, inturn, be based on a voluntary system of commercial certificateauthorities (CAs) operating within prescribed policy andperformance guidelines. To achieve the environment for such anapproach, a number of principles need to be accepted bygovernment, industry, and other users: Participation in the KMI will be voluntary. Key escrow in the KMI will occur naturally through mutually trusted authorities. There will be a transition period during which legacy equipments which do not support key recovery can be used to communicate with users in emerging full featured KMIs. Government, industry, and users will need to address the legitimate needs of those currently using non-key recovery products to communicate with users of the full- featured KMI in a manner that protects legitimate government and public safety concerns. This will provide a stable transition path. Products that operate with an escrowed KMI need to be developed with industry taking the lead. Industry can continue to lead in establishing standards for public key certificates, encryption algorithms, protocols, data recovery, and security servcies. Certificate authorities will operate within performance standards set by law. Agreements between governments will serve as the basisfor international cross certification. Self-escrow will be permitted under specific circumstances.(1) Export controls on Key Escrow products will be relaxed progressively as the infrastructure matures. -------- (1) The escrow agency must meet performance requirements for law enforcement access. II. Key Management Infrastructure In a key management infrastructure (KMI) based on publickey cryptography, each user has one or more pairs of publicand private keys. The public and private keys differ in a sucha way that it is computationally infeasible to determine theprivate key from the public key. This allows the public key tobe revealed without endangering the security of the privatekey. Users can communicate securely without having to share a"secret"; they only need to know each other's public key andthat each public key is certified by a trusted authority.Without assurance on the "binding" of a user to a specificpublic key, these keys have little or no value. Public key cryptography supports security services suchas authentication, confidentiality, data integrity andnonrepudiation. Access to a user's encrypted data for whichthe key is lost is a security related service referred to asdata recovery. Providing a secure and trusted means of storingprivate keys within the Key Management Infrastructure is onemeans of providing data recovery. This capability naturallysupports law enforcement access, under legal warrants. Thus,the user desire for data recovery and law enforcement'spotential need for access can be accommodated in a singlelocale, so long as the user trusts the key storage and lawenforcement has confidentiality of access.(2) ---------- (2) For a survey of escrow mechanisms see Dorothy Denning's article in the March 1996 Journal of Communications of the ACM. More in depth articles on solutions to escrow can be found in Building in Big Brother a collection of papers edited by Professor Lance Hoffman that contains both technical and political responses to Clipper/Capstone. [Diagram]                Escrow          -->  Authority  (private key database)          |         |          |         |          |         | public keys          |         |                        Escrow andprivate   |         |                        Certificatekey       |    Certificate                   Authorities(either   |    Authority                     can be combinedway)      |         |                        into one entity          |         |          |         | public key certificate          |         | (binds IDs and keys)          |         |          |         |          -->  User A (private keys and certificates) The simplest model for a KMI meets government accessrequirements by relying on the certificate authorities (CAs).However, the hierarchy could be structured to include aseparate Escrow Authority (EA) to provide law enforcementaccess. Provision for split keys to enhance personal privacyand security can be incorporated into the KMI. Either of thesemechanisms lessens the burden of key escrow on users and onthe producers of security products. To participate in the network a user needs a public keycertificate signed by a CA which "binds" the user's identityto their public key. One condition of obtaining a certificateis that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or otherinformation as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certifiedescrow authority to allow access to a user's data orcommunications.(3) (As noted before, this might be the CA oran independent escrow authority). The certificate creationprocess is pictured above. For users to have confidence in the KMI, CAs must meetminimum standards for security, performance, and liability. APolicy Approving Authority (PAA) certifies CAs for operation.The PAA sets rules and responsibilities for ensuring theintegrity of the CAs. The PAA is also responsible for settingCA performance criteria to meet law enforcement needs. If law enforcement has obtained legal authority to accessa user's encrypted data or communications, it would certifythat authorization to the escrow authority. The escrowauthority will then relinquish information sufficient toaccess the user's communication. ---------- (3) This applies only to keys used for confidentiality purposes and not keys used for signing purposes. III. Some Issues Difficult issues include i) how to refine the applicationof export controls, ii) whether and to what extent to permitself-escrow, iii) whether legislation is required and, if so,what it should accomplish, and iv) the certainty and extentthat government-to-government agreements can be established toensure timely law enforcement access to keys/information heldby a foreign country. This section of the White paper brieflyexplores each. Export Controls The most contentious issue surrounding encryption isexport control policy. Encryption exports are controlled toall destinations in the interest of U.S. national security/foreign policy under the Arms Export Control Act. These exportcontrols are often criticized as an impediment to the fieldingof interoperable security across the GII and thecompetitiveness of U.S. industry. The government is mindful ofthese criticisms and has initiated a number of reforms to easethe impact export controls have on manufacturers and users ofencryption. The task, then, is to find a method of applyingexport controls that meets the interest of national security,public safety, privacy, and competitiveness. Freedom to choose any mutually trusted certificateauthority may accommodate the above interests.(4) In addition,allowing ready export of products of any bit length to marketswhere the key management infrastructure, which complies withstatuatory constraints, is in place to permit governmentaccess to keys, would provide both a level market for U.S.manufacturers and higher quality security products for users.Products that meet defined performance requirements and whichwill not operate until the key is escrowed with an appropriatecertificate authority will address commercial, public safetyand national security needs. Some law enforcement and nationalsecurity concerns would be protected since government agencieswould be able to obtain escrowed keys pursuant to government-to-government agreements. ---------- (4) A mutually trusted authority is an escrow agent trusted by users to store keys and trusted by law enforcement to provide access upon certification of lawful authority. Transition We are working toward a policy that permits licensing ofkey recovery encryption systems regardless of algorithm, bitlength, or whether implemented in hardware or software, onceneeded infrastructure and government-to-government agreementsare in place. In the interim we recognize that the policy mustmake it worthwhile for manufacturers and users to invest inescrowed KMI. With these objectives in mind, and consistentwith applicable statutes, the interim policy will consider: Prior to formal government-to-government agreements: Permitting export of products that use an escrowed KMI to approved markets, e.g., Europe or Australia, consistent with the policies of the destination country. Prior to multi-national Public Key Infrastructure with KeyRecovery: Reviewing, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to export products which require the use of an escrowed KMI to any destination with which the U.S. has a government-to- government key escrow agreement. Continuing and expanding the administration's previously announced key escrow initiative by permitting the export of 64 bit S/W or 80 bit H/W key escrow products that meet defined performance requirements, after one-time review, to any destination if keys will be escrowed in the U.S., or in foreign countries with which the U.S. has a government-to-government key escrow agreement. In any condition: Permitting the export of other products on a case-by-case determination that such exports are consistent with US interests. The proposals for an interim export control policy arefounded on the assumption that the products will require theuse of an escrowed KMI in a country with which the U.S. has agovernment-to-government agreement. Note that the contemplatedexports are to civil end-users; exports to military end-userswill require more extensive product review. The existingpolicies applicable to unescrowed products provide substantialflexibility and will continue as currently defined throughoutthe transition period (see Appendix II). Additional requestsfor near-term relief will be considered on a case-by-casebasis consistent with existing practice. The interim policy also reflects a judgment that overseasescrow of key will generally be permissible with suitablegovernment-to-government arrangements. There is a concern thatU.S. products with keys escrowed in the U.S. will not besalable overseas. Hence, it may be possible to permitoverseas escrow in Europe, even before government-to-government arraignments are completed. This exception ispossible since the European countries are already moving toimplement key escrow systems and we can reasonably expect toenter into law enforcement agreements in the near term. TheOECD's goal of negotiating multilateral cryptographyguidelines by 31 December 1996 is further evidence of Europeanintent and momentum in infrastructure development. The interim policy reflects a differentiation betweenhardware and software products, i.e., hardware products withgreater bit lengths are treated more favorably under thispolicy. Hardware implementations of products permit moreconfident binding between encryption and the key management,limiting the risk that the encryption can be easily strippedfrom the key management and used independently of keyrecovery. Software does not provide similar protection. Thissaid, the interim policy to permit export of 64 bit softwarekey recovery products would reflect a significant increaseover the bit length restrictions applicable to non-keyrecovery products. Self-Escrow Self-escrow will be a principal concern of many largecorporations that want to provide corporate data recovery,protect against loss of proprietary data from use of anoutside escrow agent, and simply for reasons of efficiency andcost. Hence, self-escrow must be considered as an acceptableoption. Escrow requires less architecture if the CA can be theescrow authority. However, in those cases in which anindividual or corporation serves as its own certificateauthority, government organizations could be compelled torequest escrowed key from the subject of an investigation. Theinvestigation could be compromised under such circumstances.While this risk could be avoided by adding independent escrowauthorities as another layer in the PKI, such a solution wouldbe costly and inefficient. A solution is a national policy which allows CAs for anorganization to serve as escrow authorities if they can meetnecessary performance requirements. These requirements shouldbe determined by government in consultation with industry andshould address timeliness, security, confidentiality ofrequests for, or release of, keys, and independence of theescrow authority from the rest of the organization. To thisend, the government should seek legislation that would shieldorganization certificate authorities from internal pressuresin the course of law enforcement investigations. Legislation There is some consensus that the ultimate legislativepackage should include provisions to criminalize theunauthorized disclosure/use of escrowed key, provisions toauthorize civil actions by victims against those responsiblefor the unauthorized disclosure/use of escrowed key,provisions specifying the circumstances in which escrowed keymay be requested and released (e.g., death of a family memberor employee), and establishing liability protection forcertificate authorities who exercises due prudence in thefulfillment of their performance obligations. Those who endorse a larger government role would seeklegislation that would, for example, establish the governmentas a major participant in the PAA, which would be responsibleto establish policies and guidelines governing certificateissuance. In this case, the government would be authorized toassure establishment of standards for the PKI that adequatelyprovide for systems security and law enforcement access.Inasmuch as the integrity and reliability of the whole rangeof network centered activities, including electronic commerce,will depend on the integrity and reliability of the keymanagement certificate process, there is good reason forgovernment to play a substantial role. The enabling legislation envisioned here should reflectthe stated needs of industry and users. To that end,government must work closely with industry and other affectedparties to develop such legislation. Government to Government Agreements There is an expressed need by all governments to haveaccess to information affecting their own security or publicsafety. Inevitably there will be situations in which the U.S.will want access to keys in a foreign country that concerncriminal activities in violation of U.S. laws and vice versa.The security and other technical protocols that will serve asthe framework of the GII should ensure key recovery ispossible in either circumstance. The U.S. government shouldseek to frame and execute law enforcement agreements that: will allow for timely access when authorized minimally impact security products operate within guidelines established for key recovery methods including trusted third parties and self-escrow standards used in the U.S. It would be recognized that no agreement can guaranteeaccess to keys/information held in a foreign country, butestablished agreements might serve as a framework to requestlawful access to keys/information. Such arrangements will bebased on the philosophy that authorized government access mustbe preserved consistent with the legally recognized privacyinterests of the citizens of each country. IV. Actions Several issues discussed in this paper raise substantialpolicy questions that will not be easily resolved. Thegovernment, however, has an interest in seeing good securityproducts populate the NII and GII as soon as possible. To demonstrate resolve and good faith, the United StatesGovernment should immediately: 1. Collaborate with industry and existing standards groups, to develop Key Management Infrastructure and attendant products performance requirements (with a working draft completed within 6 months); 2. Collaborate with industry on a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) within government that specifies a suite of algorithms and protocols for encryption, key exchange, and digital signature functions sufficient to protect government information. The resulting FIPS should provide for key recovery operations and should be mandatory for government use. 3. Establish a security management infrastructure for government use which complies with the standards developed jointly by industry and government. This is the first step in providing a market for industry products which support the new FIPS. 4. Determine an appropriate government agency to work with industry in specifying security requirements for products used in network security applications for protecting highly sensitive information. 5. Collaborate with industry to formulate legislation to establish viable key management infrastructure. Such legislation would, inter alia, set policies for assuring the integrity of escrowed key, establish an appropriate government role in this PAA, and address civil liability issues. 6. Negotiate with other governments arrangements for access to escrowed keys consistent with national sovereignty, national security, and public safety. As trusted partners, industry and government can shareexpertise and tackle intractable problems such as the insecureoperating system. In times past, the cryptographic algorithmwas the core of the solution: now it is the easy part. Thedebate over algorithms and bit lengths should end: it is timefor industry and governments to work together to secure theGII in such a way that does not put the world at risk. Appendix I: One View of a KMI The discussion given here is intended to provide adescription of how a KMI might be designed and operatedconsistent with the tenets of the White Paper. Thisdescription is not intended to preclude consideration ofother, equally suitable, implementations. Introduction to KMI Based Escrow In a KMI based on public key cryptography, each user hasone or more pairs of public and private keys. The public andprivate keys differ in such a way that it is computationallyinfeasible to determine the private key from the public key.This allows the public key to be revealed without endangeringthe security of the private key. Users can communicatesecurely without having to share a "secret", they only need toknow each other's public key. In practice, users may havemultiple public/private key pairs. The key pairs may be used in applications such as keyexchanges and digital signatures. To make use of suchapplications, a user's public keys must be available tointended recipients in a manner that the recipient canconfidently associate the user with his/her public key.Without assurances on the "binding" of user identities to aspecific public key, these keys have little or no value. Thus, in the context of public key cryptography, thestrength of cryptographic mechanisms relates to protecting theconfidentiality of the private keys and the integrity of thepublic keys. Ultimately, the viability of public keycryptographic applications is dependent on the evolution of akey management infrastructure. KMI and Certificates The KMI supports the integrity of public keys through thegeneration and distribution of public key certificates. Therole of a certificate is to cryptographically bind a specificuser identity with a public key and other security relatedinformation. A trusted system entity, generally called aCertificate Authority (CA), obtains information from anindividual sufficient to verify the individual is who he sayshe is. The CA then generates and digitally signs a certificatespecific to that individual using the CA's private signaturekey. Any system user can then validate the contents of thatcertificate by verifying the CA's digital signature (via theCA's public signature key). Certificate contents must be bound together by amechanism which can be authenticated. The certificate formatcommonly used is based on the structure defined by the CCITTX.509 Recommendation. This has worldwide support in industryand governments. The concept of a CA can be easily extended to apply to alarge system of users where a single CA is not feasible.Providing interoperability within a system containing multipleCAs leads to a hierarchical structure. At the very top of thehierarchy is a Root entity which is often referred to as aPolicy Approving Authority (PAA). The PAA represents thesingle node in the hierarchy that all system users trust. ThePAA creates the overall guidelines and policies for theoperation of the KMI. The PAA exists to ensure the securityand integrity of each and every entity within the hierarchy.Security and integrity are enforced by PAA certifying thepublic keys of subordinate CAs. Each of these subordinate CAsmay also certify the public keys of other CAs or users. Asample hierarchy is pictured below. The PAA public signaturekey is possessed by all those in the hierarchy. [Hierarchical Diagram]                           PAA                           |                  CA1     CA2    CA3                   |       |      |               CA4    CA5     CA6     CA7                |      |       |       |     (------------------ Users ----------------) Any two users within a defined hierarchy can validateeach other's public key certificates through a commoncertification path. A certification path is an orderedsequence of certificates between the entity to be validatedand the trusted point in the hierarchy, i.e., PAA. Thisdefines a path of trust. Validation of any system certificaterequires that each certificate in the certification path bechecked by verifying the digital signature over eachcertificate. To maintain trust in the path, the entities making upcertificate authorities must follow prescribed rules foridentifying users, issuing certificates, and protecting keys.Adherence to these regulations can be enforced by a PAA or asa condition of cross certification between two CertificateAuthorities. After a CA generates a certificate, it is transferred tothe user along with the certificates in the user'scertification path. Distribution of certificates among systementities can be accomplished by sending them via e-mail(quickly becomes unwieldy) or through the use of a DirectorySystem. Other users can then request and retrieve certificatesdirectly from a Directory Server. The hierarchical structure is designed to supportmultiple communities of users who may need to communicate witheach other. It is also possible that some communities of usersin the system could remain autnomous and yet still be able tocommunicate with users outside their immediate community ofinterest. The PAA provides the means for such inter-communitycommunication by functioning as the single mutually trustedauthority for the entire hierarchy. Cross Certification There could exist one or more PAAs within the U.S. andnon-U.S. KMIs. To permit communication between users ofdifferent PAA domains, a common certification path must exist.Cross certification will be based on the existence of acceptedpolicies and standard certification criteria. PAAs from eachKMI could then cross certify each other. This is accomplishedby each PAA countersigning the registered public keycertificates of the other. This cross certifying ofcertificates provides a valid certification path for all usersin the respective KMIs. [Diagram]                              CC              U.S. PAA<-------------->Non-U.S. PAA          |    |   |   \                 |     |         CA1   |   |     \     CC        |     |               |   |       \----------->CAa   CAb              CA2  |                   |                  CA3 Cross Certification Options Between Distinct KMIs This scenario permits specific entities under one PAA tohave a verifiable certification path for communications withentities serviced by another PAA. It is important to note,however, that the integrity of this cross certification systemis only assured by limiting cross certification to bilateralnad direct connection between the two PAAs involved. One PAAshould not rely on the representation of another that a thirdPAA has been authenticated. Key Recovery Performance Criteria Key recovery provides for backup storage of a user'sprivate keys. This backup capability helps ensure theavailability of a user's data even after it has beenencrypted. It also provides for an effective means for lawenforcement access. Key recovery requirements would be viewedfrom the perspective of the individual, the corporation, orgovernments that require access. Most of the criteria to bediscussed have a dimension for key recovery on an individualbasis as well as from a corporate or government perspective.The criteria can be grouped into three categories. 1. Key Integrity: Confidentiality - Key recovery storage and release mechanisms must preclude simple exploitation. Availability - Key recovery data must be available when subject to authorized release. 2. Key Accessibility: Responsiveness - Timely access to key recovery information requires 24 hour responsiveness and real time accessibility requires a two hour response window to authorized requests. Confidentiality - Confidentiality must be maintained on all requests for release of key recovery information. Proof of Approval - Trustworthy on-line or off-line mechanisms must exist to support identification and authorized release of key recovery information. 3. Key Recovery Use: Subject Message Recovery - All information related to the subject of the recovery request must be accessible through the release of key recovery information pertaining only to that subject. Release Window - The start and end dates of authorized key recovery periods must be enforced. Key Recovery Using KMI[Diagram]                Escrow          -->  Authority  (private key database)          |         |          |         |          |         | public keys          |         |                        Escrow andprivate   |         |                        Certificatekey       |    Certificate                   Authorities(either   |    Authority                     can be combinedway)      |         |                        into one entity          |         |          |         | public key certificate          |         | (binds IDs and keys)          |         |          |         |          -->  User A (private keys and certificates) Key recovery fits well within a public key KMI.Interleaving key recovery within the KMI provides for aconcentration of trust that stands to benefit the individualsfrom a confidentiality of private key aspect and facilitatesgovernment access by limiting the number of access points. Themost simple model is to rely on the existing CAs within theKMI to meet government access requirements. If necessary,however, the hierarchy can be structured to include an EscrowAuthority (EA) as a separate trusted entity. EA hierarchy is intrinsically shallow when compared withthe depth of the CA hierarchy. The structure is more likenedto a peer group of EAs that all fall under the jurisdiction ofthe KMIs PAA which creates guidelines and policies for EAoperation. To become a system endorsed EA entity, an EA mustbe certified by the PAA. Certification encompassessatisfactory implementation of the standards and policies putforth by the PAA. The PAA provides the standardization for theescrow functions to occur across multiple EA entities with anequivalent degree of trust. It is important to stress thatsome or all of the elements of the escrow infrastructure maybe the same as those in the certificate infrastructure. TheKMI supports both. As with the certification of subordinate CAs, therecognition of a certified status for a particular EA isembodied by the PAAs digital signature on the public keycertificate of the EA (thus attesting to the validity of theservice they provide). This allows a particular EA to have asystem-wide recognized signature, one that is traceable backto a common trusted entity, the PAA. Two examples follow that show how the EA and CA entitieswork in tandem to provide both a certificate and data recoveryservice for users and law enforcement: 1. Certificate and Recovery Registration. In this example we have a single Escrow Authority distinct from the Certificate Authority. In reality, the EA may be the same entity as the CA or the EA may be one of a set of users certified by the government as an EA. The simple protocol described below follows closely the key escrow proposal made in 1993 by Silvio Micali of MIT. User A wishes to register, in the form of a public key certificate, a public key exchange key with his local certified KMI entity. User A does the following: Identifies himself and securely distributes the public and private components of the key pair he wishes to have registered to a certified Escrow Authority (EA). This may be done electronically. Alternately, the EA could generate these keys for User A. Uniquely identifies himself to the CA. This must be done physically unless User A already possesses a valid signature key. Distributes the public component of the key pair he wishes to have certified to the CA. The EA does the following: Protectively stores the private component. Notifies the CA that a valid key pair has been "escrowed" for user A. (This notification can take the form of a signed message from the EA that contains the public key of User A.) The CA does the following: Verifies the identity of User A. Verifies the signature on the message received from the EA. This ensures that only properly escrowed keys are entered into the system. Generates a public key certificate that contains (at least) the public key exchange key acknowledged by the EA, an identifier representing User A, an identifier for EA, and validity period for certificate management. Digitally signs the certificate using the CA private signature key. Distributes the certificate to User A (and potentially to a Directory Service). User A then verifies the CA signature on the received certificate as well as the information it contains. To more fully reflect the Key Integrity Criteria, the EAentity could in fact be a set of EAs that work in conjunctionwith a particular CA. Providing multiple EAs allows forincreased flexibility with respect to the generation, storage,and recovery of key information. Not only would users haveincreased flexibility of choice in selecting a certified EA,but they essentially have a voice in who is entrusted withprotecting their keys. Specifically, the EA entity could be aset of EAs, each of which only possesses a portion (key split)for User A's private key component. This provides a recoverymechanism for User A that more directly protects his privatekey component since recovery of the key by other thanauthorized requests would require collusion on the part of allEAs, compromise of all EA storage mechanisms, or compromise ofall of the distribution paths used during recovery from eachEA to User A) 2. User Key Recovery: An Archiving Example In this example User A stores (archives) his data in encrypted form using a locally generated key. He must have alternate access to that encrypted data. Consider the following: User A generates a private key (session, archive, message, etc.) User A encrypts his information with this archivekey. User A encrypts the archive key with his public keyexchange key (of which the private component isescrowed). The result of this encryption is stored, along with public escrow key, in the header portion of theencrypted file. Upon loss of his key exchange key, decryption ofthe information is accomplished by requestingrelease of the private key exchange key from theEA. User A identifies himself to the EA(s) holding hisprivate key and requests its release. The EA(s) does the following: Positively identifies the requestor. Locates and securely transmits the private keycomponent to User A. 3. Law Enforcement Key Recovery: An e-mail Example In this example the sender of a message, generates asession key, encrypts the message with the session keyand encrypts the session key he uses to protect hiscommunications with the recipient's public key exchangekey. This encrypted session key is stored in the headerinformation of the encrypted message for recipient andgovernment recovery purposes. The key recovery processproceeds in the following manner: Escrowed data to or from the subject of a lawfulinvestigation is intercepted. The subject's public key certificate is obtainedfrom the data or a Directory Service. The Escrow Authority ID is extracted from thecertificate. This allows law enforcement to locatethe private key components. Legal authorization is obtained to receive theappropriate escrowed private key(s) components. Legal authorization is presented to appropriateEA(s). This may involve working through foreigngovernments. EA(s) verifies authenticity of request. EA(s) securely transmits the private keycomponent(s) to law enforcement (this could beaccomplished physically or electronically.) Law enforcement forms the private key from itsprivate key component(s) and decrypts to recoverthe session key and the message. Law enforcement will destroy keys at the end of theauthorized period of use. Access can be also be time boundeddirectly by users by repeating the registration process. Appendix II: Current Encryption Export Policies This appendix has been prepared to state clearly theexisting encryption export control policies and procedures. While the government recognizes that further progress isneeded in license processing, changes instituted to date haveresulted in a reduction of average license turnaround time of39 days in 1993 to an average of 13 days in 1995. Further,over 99% of export licenses for proposed cryptographicproducts are approved each year. Authorities The export of cryptographic products is regulated by theDepartment of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act(AECA) and its implementing International Traffic In ArmsRegulations (ITAR), and by the Department of Commerce pursuantto the Export Administration Act (EAA) and its implementingExport Administration Regulations (EAR). No license is required for the import of cryptographichardware or software. There are no federal laws regulating theuse of cryptographic products within the United States. Alicense is required for the export of cryptographic productsto all destinations except Canada. Applications are reviewedby the Department of Defense (NSA) for national securityimplications and by State for foreign policy concerns. Theexport licensing policy is consistent with U.S. nationalsecurity and foreign policy. The Department of Commerce controls the export ofrudimentary cryptographic products containing cryptographicfunctions generally limited to purposes such as dataauthentication, password protection, and access control.Products which are determined to be covered by the CommerceControl List (CCL), with certain foreign policy exceptions,may be exported under a General License. Procedures Autolist - For products reviewed and approved by NSA forexport to approved classes of end users and end uses.Permits Department of State to process licenseapplications for such products without further review byNSA. Distribution Arrangements - Single license vehicle forexport of approved products to classes of end users incountries or regions. Avoids need for licenses on anexport-by-export basis. Distribution Agreements - Permits single license forexport of approved products to identified distributors.Again, avoids export-by-export licensing. Personal Use Exemption - Products exported for thepersonal use of the exporter are excepted from pre-exportlicense requirements. Policies Products designed to use cryptography for accesscontrol/authentication purposes are export controlled asdual use commodities pursuant to the ExportAdministration Act. Product manufacturers determine if their products areaccess control/authentication devices. Generally, access control/authentication products areexportable under general license procedures. Mass-market software products verified as implementingRC2/RC4 encryption algorithms, with 40-bit key spacelimitations, are designated dual use items, to becontrolled under the Export Administration Act, after aone-time review completed within 7 working days ofsubmission. Mass-market software implementing other encryptionalgorithms and key space lengths for confidentiality arereviewed on a case-by-case basis for designation as dualuse items and control under the Export AdministrationAct. By regulation, reviews must be completed within 15days of submission. Generally, licenses are approved for export of productsto be used in protecting U.S. proprietary information(i.e., intellectual property). U.S. companies and their subsidiaries are allowed toexport products with strong encryption for their internaluse. Confidentiality encryption products that incorporate theData Encryption Standard (DES) are routinely approved forexport to: Financial institutions and financial applications Protecting financial information in Electroniccommerce applications Confidentiality encryption products that incorporate theData Encryption Standard (DES) are favorably consideredfor export to: Applications involving protection of personalmedical data Parking and toll systems; Debit applications; Othertransaction-based systems in which encryption isconfigured to perform identified specifictransactions.

Such a publickey infrastructure would enable users of encryption to clearly identifythe people they are communicating with, and is widely viewed as an importantprerequisite for the widespread use of secure electronic communications.However, the Clipper III proposal would establish this infrastructure ata price: All users of the public key infrastructure would have to ensuregovernment access to their encryption keys through an approved key escrowagent. Clipper III will not meet the privacy and security needs of Internet users.While the proposal represents real progress by the Administration in recognizingthe importance of encryption, in reality it provides few provisions to protectindividual privacy. The proposal is hardly voluntary -- it makes key escrowa virtual precondition for participation in a secure GII. It targets domesticusers of encryption, contains few guidelines for key exchanges with foreigngovernments, and encourages collection of highly sensitive private key information.Moreover, it contains none of the standards for key holder liability, limitson access to keys by law enforcement, or audit requirements that many havealready identified as crucial to protecting individual privacy in even avoluntary key escrow system. For these reasons, CDT believes that the ClipperIII proposal is another step in the wrong direction for U.S. encryptionpolicy. Overview of the Administration Proposal Taking a nod from the European Commission's recent Trusted Third Party initiative,the Clipper III proposal would develop a needed public key infrastructure,couched in the language of privacy and security, and use it as an incentivefor development of a de facto key escrow system. The Clipper III proposal: Acknowledges the importance of encryption and the need for a publickey infrastructure (PKI) -- The proposal reaffirms the importance of encryptionand the emerging need for a system to certify public encryption keys. Sucha "public key infrastructure" would allow users to certify toother users that their public keys in fact belonged to them, allowing thekeys to be used and trusted for encrypted commerce and communication. Withoutsuch a system, "users cannot know with whom they are dealing on thenetwork, or sending money to, or who signed a document, or if the documentwas intercepted and changed by a third party."1 Establishes a complex new Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) -- Theproposal would form a new public key infrastructure to tie encryption usersto their public keys. The KMI would establish new certification authoritiesthat would guarantee -- and be held liable for -- the identity of a publickey. The new entities proposed under the Administration plan include: Certification Authorities (CAs) - to identify and issue certificatesto users; Escrow Authorities (EAs) - to hold private key information as required;and Policy Approving Authorities (PAAs) -- overarching bodies, possiblyunder governmental control, responsible for certifying trusted escrow authorities. Requires key escrow as a condition of participation in the new publickey infrastructure -- In order to participate in the new Key ManagementInfrastructure, users would be required to ensure law enforcement accessto encrypted information. "One condition of obtaining a certificateis that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or other informationas appropriate) has been escrowed with a certified escrow authority to allowaccess to a user's data or communications."2The escrow agent could be the certification authority or another third-party,so long as they meet "minimum standards" including "performancecriteria to meet law enforcement's needs." Self-escrow would also beallowed for entities that meet certain unspecified "necessary performancerequirements." Relaxes export controls for key escrow products as in Clipper II --The proposal would "continue and expand" the NIST "ClipperII" export control provisions proposed this fall, allowing 64 bit software/80bit hardware exports to any destination if keys are escrowed in the U.S.or if the U.S. has a bilateral escrow agreement. Other exports to certainmarkets would be considered, upon case-by-case review and under certainconditions. Key length limits would presumably expand as law enforcementconfidence in the key escrow authorities grew. Critique and Areas of Concern Clipper III does represent a major step forward by the Administration inacknowledging the importance of encryption and public key cryptography:"Government can no longer monopolize state of the art cryptography.... It is unrealistic to believe that government can produce solutions whichkeep ahead of today's rapidly changing information technology."3The proposal goes on to note that, "[Public key cryptography features]are needed to support electronic commerce, public services, redefined businessprocesses, and national security." However, Clipper III is also a clear attempt to force the widespread adoptionof key escrow by leveraging the need of encryption users to participatein a public key certification system. Major problems with the proposal include: It makes key escrow a precondition for participation in the public keyinfrastructure - Other than law enforcement access, there is no reason thepublic key infrastructure must store private keys. On the contrary, theessential breakthrough of public key cryptography is the ability it givesusers to share public key information and partake fully in authenticated,secure communications without revealing any private key information to thirdparties. Data recovery -- the ability to recover encrypted data if a privatekey is lost -- is the main rationale presented for key escrow. However,data recovery can be done independently of the public key infrastructureif desired, and in a more secure manner. It is not voluntary -- Though participation is theoretically "voluntary,"under Clipper III users will have no choice but to escrow their keys orforego participation in the Information Age economy. The proposal itselfcalls the key infrastructure a "basic and entirely essential foundation."To participate, users will need to escrow their keys; if they choose notto participate in the KMI, users will be unable to obtain the essentialcertifications that the Administration foresees as being the standard forsecure electronic communications and commerce. It targets domestic users -- While export controls have ostensibly beenaimed at controlling the use of encryption by foreign users, the ClipperIII proposal is clearly aimed at domestic users of encryption. It leaves international key exchange problems unresolved -- Withouta system of international agreements, interoperability is at risk. The sameencryption and/or authentication scheme exportable to Germany or Francemight not be exportable to India or China in the absence of appropriatebilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements raise their own issues: underwhat standards will keys be released to foreign governments, especiallythose with no tradition of Fourth Amendment search and seizure protection? It contains no key escrow privacy provisions -- The Administration proposalonly tangentially addresses the privacy problems posed by key escrow systems.As others have already noted in the encryption policy debate, any key escrowsystem (even if voluntary) raises issues regarding the need for: liabilityrules for unauthorized key disclosures by escrow agents; standards for lawenforcement access; auditing requirements for escrow agents; and guidelinesfor decryption information access.4 Clipper III containsno such standards or guidelines. It compromises network security by encouraging storage of private keyinformation -- Clipper III requires the accumulation of private keys orother decryption information in dangerous and vulnerable points-of-failure-- the escrow agents. At the same time as it seeks to design a secure infrastructure,the proposal builds enormous new vulnerabilities into the system. It is not responsive to years of feedback from industry and policy advocates--The proposal answers few of the concerns repeatedly raised by privacyadvocates or industry. It reflects a policy-making process still drivenby national security and law enforcement concerns rather than the privacyneeds of individuals and the security needs of the online economy. Conclusion As the European Commission prepares to release its Trusted Third Party encryptionproposals in Europe, the very similar Clipper III proposal provides a previewof the choices being made around the world to sacrifice privacy concernsin the name of law enforcement access. The Administration proposal has thepotential to hold the budding public key infrastructure -- an importantcomponent of secure communications online -- hostage to the demands of lawenforcement. Instead, CDT believes the Administration should use this opportunityto develop a more secure and trusted communications infrastructure for allusers, even those in countries without the same tradition of Fourth Amendmentprotection afforded to U.S. citizens. CDT looks forward to continuing towork towards voluntary, private-sector security standards for the informationinfrastructure independent of escrow requirements or export controls.

For example, if a system provides access to private keys, thanevery communication using that key is compromised. The costs of accidentaldisclosure are consequently much higher than they need to be, and thereis no ability to narrowly tailor law enforcement requests. To the extentthat key escrow is ever used, standards should be put in place to keep accessto encrypted information as narrowly tailored as possible.

However, the Clipper III wouldestablish this infrastructure at a price: All users of the public keyinfrastructure would have to ensure government access to their encryptionkeys through an approved key escrow authority.A detailed analysis of the Administration's latest draft proposal isattached below. Among other concerns:* The proposal is hardly voluntary - Key-escrow would become a  prerequisite for participation in the Global Information  Infrastructure.* The proposal contains few guidelines for how keys would be shared with  foreign governments.* The proposal encourages the collection of highly sensitive private key  information.* The proposal does not address major privacy concerns such as liability  for key holders, limitations on law enforcement access, audit  requirements, and other concerns that many have already identified as  crucial to protecting individual privacy even in a voluntary key  escrow system.CDT believes that the Administration's draft proposal does not meet theprivacy and security needs of Internet users or the demands of themarketplace.  While the proposal represents real progress by theAdministration in recognizing the importance of encryption and the value ofa public key infrastructure, in reality it provides few provisions toprotect individual privacy.  Moreover, the Clipper III proposal, like itspredecessors, continues to put law enforcement and national securityconcerns above the privacy and security needs of the American public.The latest Administration proposal comes in the midst of Congressionalefforts to relax encryption export controls and encourage the widespreaduse of strong, easy-to-use encryption and prohibit the government fromimposing key escrow domestically.  It also comes in the wake of a lettersigned by over 27 Representatives last week urging the Administration toabandon its key-escrow initiative (See CDT Policy Post 2.19)A copy of the Draft proposal is available on CDT's encryption policy webpage (http://www.cdt.org/crypto).SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL:------------------------Taking a nod from the efforts currently under way through the EuropeanCommission to establish a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in Europe, theClipper III seeks to establish a means of ensuring authentication and keymanagement for Americans.Among other things, the Clipper III draft proposal:* RECOGNIZES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT IMPOSE ENCRYPTION STANDARDS  ON MARKET: One positive element of the new proposal is an explicit  recognition of the importance of encryption and the need for private  sector, as opposed to government solutions.  The draft states,  "Government can no longer monopolize state of the art cryptography ...  It is unrealistic to believe that government can produce solutions  which keep ahead of today's rapidly changing information technology".* ESTABLISHES KEY MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE: The draft proposal would   create a new public key infrastructure designed to tie individuals   and entities to their public keys.* RELAXES EXPORT CONTROLS FOR KEY ESCROW PRODUCTS: The new draft would  continue and expand the effort started with the Clipper II proposal by  allowing the export of software with 64 bit key lengths (80 bits for  hardware) on the condition that products contain a key-escrow  function. Keys could be escrowed in the United States or where the  US has a bilateral escrow agreement. Other exports to certain markets  would be considered on a case-by-case basis.* PROVIDES FOR 'SELF ESCROW' OF ENCRYPTION KEYS:  Self Escrow (where  a corporation or individual could become an escrow agent for its own  private keys) would be permitted, though the exact conditions of and  obligations are not specified in the draft.MAJOR FLAWS IN THE CLIPPER PROPOSAL RENDER IT A NON-STARTER-----------------------------------------------------------* CLIPPER III IS NOT VOLUNTARY & MAKES KEY-ESCROW A PRECONDITION FOR  PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTUREWhile the Administration deserves credit for recognizing that a trustedpublic key infrastructure is an important component of a workable NationalEncryption policy, the latest proposal attempts to use the need for apublic key infrastructure as a means to impose key escrow domestically.Although the Administration has repeatedly stressed that any key-escrowinitiative would be a voluntary system, the text of the latest draftdirectly contradicts that contention.The proposal states that in order to participate in the Global InformationInfrastructure, users will need to escrow their keys; if they choose not toparticipate in the key infrastructure, "users cannot know with whom theyare dealing on the network, or sending money too, or who signed a document,or if the document was intercepted and changed by a third party." (page 3).The proposal goes on to state:  "To participate in the network a user needs a public key certificate  signed by a CA [Certification Authority] which 'binds' the user's  identity to their public key.  One condition of obtaining a  certificate is that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or  other information as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certified  escrow authority to allow access to a user's data or communications."  (page 5)In other words, the Clipper III proposal would require individuals andbusinesses to use key-escrow encryption as a condition of participating inthe Global Information Infrastructure.  Under the proposal, an individualcannot obtain certification by a Key Certification Authority (a necessityunder the Clipper III scheme) unless he or she registers with a "certifiedescrow authority".There is no technical or structural reason (beyond law enforcement access)why key escrow must be a component of a public key infrastructure.  Infact, a robust example of a public key infrastructure exists today forexchanging PGP keys (the PGP public key server at MIT).* CLIPPER III TARGETS DOMESTIC USERSWhile export controls have ostensibly been aimed at controlling the use ofencryption by foreign users (and indirectly, at domestic users as well),the Clipper III proposal is aimed directly at the domestic use ofencryption and seeks to establish a system whereby key escrow becomes ade-facto component of domestic encryption products.* RAISES MAJOR QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL KEY EXCHANGEIn order to work, Clipper III assumes bi-lateral agreements between the USand other countries with respect to law enforcement access to escrowedkeys, who could legally be an escrow agent, and other factors.  Currentlyno such agreements exist.  Bilateral agreements also raise importantprivacy issues, including how to deal with releasing keys to foreigngovernments, particularly those without any tradition of privacyprotections. Finally, a patchwork of international agreements can createproblems for interoperability.  The same encryption and or authenticationscheme exportable to Germany or England might not be exportable to India orChina in the absence of a appropriate bi-lateral agreements.* CONTAINS NO PRIVACY PROTECTIONS/RESTRICTIONS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS  TO ESCROWED KEYS:Like Clipper and Clipper II, the latest proposal does not squarely addressstandards for law enforcement access to escrowed keys, unauthorizeddisclosure of keys by escrow agents, and other privacy issues associatedwith key escrow.* CREATES VULNERABILITY AND INSECURITY BY ENCOURAGING STORAGE OF PRIVATE  KEYS:The proposal suggests that escrow agents hold either a user's private keyor "other information as appropriate".  Allowing escrow agents toaccumulate private keys creates severe vulnerabilities in the network.Once a private key is disclosed (either to law enforcement or to anunauthorized third party), *every* communication using that key iscompromised. Although the draft does attempt to limit this concern byallowing escrow agents to hold "other information", the proposal no wherespecifies what that would be.NEXT STEPS----------Congress is currently considering legislation which would head off theAdministration's efforts to encourage domestic key-escrow encryptionschemes and promote the widesprad avaiability of strong, easy-to-uesencryption technologies.Several bills, including S.1726 (the Pro-CODE bill) sponsored by SenatorsBurns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Dole (R-KS), Pressler (R-SD), Wyden (D-OR) andothers, along with HR 3011, sponsored by Reps Goodlatte (R-VA), Eshoo(D-CA), Campbell (D-CA) and over 25 others are currently being consideredby Congress. Both bills would relax export restrictions and prohibit thegovernment from imposing key escrow domestically.CDT looks forward to working with Members of Congress to pass legislationthat encourages the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-useencryption technologies based on marketplace, not government, standards.-----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) JOIN SENATOR LEAHY TODAY (Wed 5/22) TO DISCUSS PRIVACY AND SECURITY ONLINESenator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), the "Senior Senator from Cyberspace", ardentproponent of Net.Freedom and co-sponsor of 2 bills to repeal encryptionexport controls, will hold an online "town meeting" on Wednesday May 22 todiscuss privacy and security online.DETAILS ON THE EVENT* Wednesday May 22, 4 - 5 pm ET (1 pm Pacific) on HotWired   URL: http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/ To participate, you must be a registered HotWired member (there is no charge for registration).

Montana Senator Conrad Burns today criticized the Clinton administration's latest computer security proposal as yet another government-driven mandate and urged swift passage of Burns' "Pro-CODE" bill, which addresses export of encryption technology andprohibits mandatory decryption-key escrow.  Burns reacted to the circulation of a draft administration proposal entitled "Achieving Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure."     The proposal, dated May 10 and dubbed "Clipper III" by critics, moves toward the loosening and possibly eventual elimination of export controls on encryption technologies, but only if companies and individuals surrender a copy of their code keys to a government-approved third party.     "It's three strikes and you're out at the old ball game, and I would say that the third version of the administration's Clipper Chip proposal is a swing and a miss," Burns said.  "It's time to quit relying on government mandates for what is truly a matter of great concern to the private sector: the expansion of commerce on the Internet and other computer networks.     "The administration has been using export restrictions as a billy club to force American companies into accepting government control over the keys to their computer files and transmissions.  At least this new proposal admits that the current 40-bit limit on exports is outdated and a poor guarantee of electronic security and integrity, but it againoperates from the standpoint that the government, and not the private sector, knows best when it comes to key strength and control over those keys.     "We can only stick our heads in the sand for so long.  It is important to point out that the criminals and trouble-makers who are apparently targets of this plan are unlikely to enroll in any key-escrow system.  Law-abiding businesses and individuals would suffer at the hands of this misguided proposal.     "While this may appear to be a compromise of the administration's earlier positions, we have to remember that an executive action can be reversed just as quickly after an election year.  It is crucial that we pass legislation to codify a solution to the administration's current outdated export policies, and to ensure that the government won't force anyone to give up the keys to their computers."                  # # # Back to the CDT Clipper III Page Back to the CDT Cryptography Page Back to the CDT home page WT02-B06-44IA096-001029-B019-121http://www.cdt.org:80/crypto/prev_hlines/960712_Gore.html 205.177.10.31 19970215020628 text/html 2458HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 02:05:09 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html CDT | Administration Statement 7/12/96 More of the Same: Gore Announces Administration Statement on Encryption Policy First Posted on July 12, 1996 || Last Updated on July 12, 1996 In a written statement issued Friday (7/12), Vice President Al Gore announced that the Administration will continue to push for the adoption ofa massive public key infrastructure to enable law enforcement access toencryption communications and continue to rely on cold war-era exportcontrols.

May 30, 1996                                     ***  Good morning.  In this age of telecommunications and lightning-speed  advances in computing, keeping private information private gets tougher  all the time.  Without proper safeguards, personal financial  transactions, medical records, corporate secrets such as bidding  information and proprietary research reports may be compromised by  criminals and corporate spies.  Without proper safeguards, crucial  information systems such as those of the banking system and the public  switched telecommunications network may be vulnerable to intrusion by  terrorists, curious computer hackers, and unfriendly foreign governments.       One of the best ways to protect electronic information is through  encryption, which is the use of mathematical formulas to scramble  information into digital codes.  Once of concern only to spies and the  military, cryptography has now become a vital tool for protecting the  legitimate interests of  the nation's businesses and the privacy of its  citizens.  This change has created a dilemma for the U.S. government  because encryption also can be used in a wide range of illegitimate  activities.  Drug dealers, terrorists, and other criminals can use  cryptography to thwart even legally authorized search and surveillance by  law enforcement officials; foreign governments can encrypt information  that the U.S. needs to protect its national security.  Now the federal  government -- which in the past has sought to restrict the spread of  encryption --  must weigh the pros and cons of promoting broader use of  cryptography.       The National Research Council was asked by Congress to provide  policy makers with guidance in making this assessment. Our study  committee was made up of individuals with expertise in many relevant  fields: technical expertise in computers, communications, and  cryptography; policy experience in law enforcement, intelligence, civil  liberties, national security, diplomacy, and international trade;  business experience in telecommunications and computer hardware and  software, as well as in protecting information in the for-profit and  not-for-profit sectors.  It was formed to examine the appropriate balance  among various national security, law enforcement, business, and privacy  interests.       Our committee's broad conclusion is that the advantages of  cryptography in safeguarding information outweigh the possible  disadvantages of making apprehension and prosecution of criminals more  difficult.  Thus, we believe that federal policies should promote rather  than discourage the use of encryption.  For example, current export  controls impede the use of strong encryption by U.S. firms with foreign  customers and suppliers as well as reducing the availability of strong  encryption domestically. The government needs to make it easier for U.S.  companies operating internationally to use strong encryption, and for  U.S. technology vendors to develop and sell cryptography products both in  this country and abroad.  Indeed, maintaining world leadership for U.S.  information technology vendors is an important contribution to national  security, as well as being important to the economy.       Furthermore, the development of products with encryption should be  driven largely by market forces rather than by government-imposed  requirements or standards.  There are no legal limits on the kinds of  encryption that presently can be sold in the United States and  we  strongly endorse the idea that no law should bar the manufacture, sale,  or use of any form of encryption within the United States.       We do not believe that by adopting such a course the government  would necessarily be choosing the interests of business and individuals  over those of national security and law enforcement.  We say this for two  reasons.  First, availability of encryption technologies will benefit law  enforcement and national security.  Here's how: by making economic  espionage more difficult, cryptography supports law enforcement.  By  protecting elements of the civilian infrastructure such as banking,  telecommunications, and air traffic control networks, cryptography  safeguards national security.       The second reason is that current national policy -- which  discourages the use of cryptography despite its many valuable  applications -- can at most delay encryption's spread.  Already, the use  of such technologies is growing, and in the long run, we believe  widespread non-governmental use of cryptography in the United States and  abroad is inevitable.  The government should recognize this changing  reality and help law enforcement and national security authorities  develop the new technical capabilities they will need to conduct  investigations and surveillance in a world in which information will be  more protected and even unencrypted communications will be harder to  read.       Our report also urges that the government should explore escrowed  encryption rather than the aggressive promotion that is the case today.  Encrypted information is unintelligible to anyone lacking the keys to  unlock the digital code.  In escrowed encryption, the decoding key would  be held by a trusted third-party organization or institution.  This is  attractive to law enforcement agencies because with a court order, they  could obtain the key and unlock even the most unbreakable code.  However,  escrowed encryption is relatively untried and many unresolved issues  remain, ranging from the liability of these third parties to the  magnitude of the risk incurred by companies trusting these third parties  with the keys to their sensitive business plans and trade secrets.       Rather than aggressively promoting escrowed encryption, our  committee believes that the government should explore escrowed encryption  for its own purposes as a way of gaining operational experience with this  technology and making it more useful to the commercial sector.  Even when  that occurs, we say that adoption of escrowed encryption or of any other  specific technology or standard by the commercial sector should be  voluntary and based on business needs, not government pressure.            To make it easier for U.S. companies with foreign customers and  suppliers to protect their information with the best encryption  technologies, the committee believes that export controls should be  progressively relaxed, though not eliminated. Right now federal law makes  it hard to export strong encryption technology.  This helps protect the  government's ability to gather foreign intelligence.  However, it also  makes it more difficult for U.S. technology vendors to produce and sell  cryptography products both here and overseas, and it limits what's  available here because software companies are reluctant to develop  different products for U.S. and foreign markets.       And we call on the executive and legislative branches to develop  national cryptography policy on the basis of open public discussion.  In  the past, government officials have treated many aspects of cryptography  policy as "top secret," to be discussed only behind closed doors.  This  has led to considerable public distrust and resistance, which makes it  impossible to achieve consensus.       In our report we point to a number of specific areas such as  telecommunications and banking where the government should actively  promote the adoption of encryption. For example, the privacy of the  cellular phone and the security of the nation's telecommunications  networks should be enhanced through the use of cryptography.  In the case  of the cellular phone many people have at home, the digital signals sent  between the cell phone and the cell's ground station could be encrypted.  This would prevent eavesdroppers from listening in on conversations.       Overall, we believe that adoption of our recommendations would lead  to enhanced protection and privacy for individuals and businesses in a  many areas, while also bolstering the international competitiveness of  U.S. companies.

The 500 page report, sponsored by theNational Research Council (NRC), highlights the need for strong, reliableencryption to protect individual privacy, provide security for businesses,and maintain national security.Among other things, the report describes how the current US encryptionpolicy is not working, notes that classified information is not relevant tothe policy debate, and outlines the adverse impact export restrictions havehad on the domestic market.  In addition, the study emphasizes that marketforces and user choices, not law enforcement or national securityinterests, should drive the development of encryption technologies and thedebate over US cryptography policy.The report, entitled "Cryptography's Role in Securing the InformationSociety", provides an important starting point for an honest and opendebate on this critical issue. A summary of the report's most importantfindings and an overview of its policy recommendations is included below.OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE REPORT'S MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGSFor the past 3 years, the US government has attempted to leverage the needfor strong encryption and the desire of US businesses to export strongprivacy and security products as a means impose key-escrow encryption. Theresult of this has been a policy morass which has stifled innovation,limited the availability of strong, easy to use encryption technologies,and endangered the ability of US companies to compete in the globalinformation marketplace.While acknowledging the complexities and challenges associated with theencryption policy debate, the study's findings directly undermine theAdministration's current approach to cryptography policy. The reportconcludes by noting that the "[w]idespread commercial and private use ofcryptography in the United States and abroad is inevitable in the long runand that its advantages, on balance, outweigh its disadvantages.  Thecommittee concluded that the overall interests of the government and thenation would best be served by a policy that fosters a judicious transitiontoward the broad use of cryptography."The NRC study identified several critical issues:* CURRENT US ENCRYPTION POLICY IS NOT WORKING:  The study is highly  critical of the current ad-hoc approach to US encryption policy,  particularly the reliance on export controls. The study states  explicitly, "Current national cryptography policy is not adequate to  support the information security requirements of an information  society."  The study goes on to note, "Indeed, current policy discourages the use  of cryptography, whether intentionally or not, and in so doing impedes  the ability of the nation to use cryptographic tools that would help  to remediate certain important vulnerabilities.  For example, through  the use of export controls, national policy has explicitly sought to  limit the use of encryption abroad but has also had the effect of  reducing the domestic availability to businesses and other users of  products with strong encryption capabilities."* CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE POLICY DEBATE: The NRC  report explicitly states that classified information is "not  particularly relevant" to the policy debate. The study states, "The  debate over national cryptography policy can be carried out in a  reasonable manner on an unclassified basis."  The study goes on to  note, "Although many of the details relevant to policy makers are  necessarily classified, these details are not central to making policy  arguments one way or another. Classified material, while important to  operational matters in specific cases, is neither essential to the big  picture or why policy has the shape and texture that it does today nor  required for the general outline of how technology will, and why  policy should, evolve in the future."  This is a startling revelation which will profoundly alter the  encryption policy debate.  No longer can the government claim, "If you  knew what we knew, you would understand this issue." It also suggests  that, while national security and law enforcement interests are an  important element in the debate, there is no "secret-silver-bullet"  which trumps all other considerations.  From now on, the debate over cryptography policy should occur in the  open, with all issues aired publicly.  By removing its arguments from  the veil of secrecy, the government can go a long way towards building  the trust of the public.* EXPORT CONTROLS DO INFLUENCE THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND HARM  COMPETITIVENESS OF US INDUSTRY: The NRC study confirms what civil   liberties advocates and the computer industry have long argued: that  the current administration policy of limiting the export of strong  encryption is impacting the domestic market and harming US business.  The study states, "Export controls also have had the effect of  reducing the domestic availability of products with strong encryption  capabilities... Thus, domestic users face a more limited range of  options for strong encryption than they would in the absence of  export controls."* MARKET FORCES, NOT GOVERNMENT INTERESTS, SHOULD DRIVE THE POLICY  DEBATE: The study stresses that the domestic availability of  encryption should not be restricted in any way, and that the market of  individual users, rather than the government's interests, should drive  the development of technology and policy.  The study notes, "As cryptography has assumed a greater importance to  non government interests, national cryptography policy has become  increasingly disconnected from market reality and the needs of parties  in the private sector ... A national cryptography policy that is  aligned with market forces would emphasize the freedom of domestic  users to determine cryptographic functionality, protections, and  implementations according to their security needs as they see fit."The study is without a doubt the most comprehensive and balanced analysisof the complex encryption policy debate yet published. While stressingthe need for strong encryption to protect individual privacy and to maintain the competitiveness of US industry in the global marketplace,the report also acknowledges the real challenges posed to lawenforcement and national security by the global proliferation of strongencryption technologies. The authors of the study deserve great credit fortheir work in producing what will clearly become the basis for an open andhonest public debate over the need to reform US encryption policy.Information on how to obtain a copy of the document is available atOVERVIEW OF THE NRC REPORT'S POLICY RECOMMENDATIONSThe report also outlines several recommendations for a nationalcryptography policy.  An overview of these recommendations is attachedbelow. CDT will post an analysis of the NRC's policy recommendations in thenear future.Recommendations of the Committee for national cryptography policy would:1. Free domestic manufacture, sale, and use of encryption -- The   committee argued that any future legal prohibitions on the domestic   use of any kind of cryptography are "inappropriate." While no such   prohibitions are currently in effect, many encryption users have been   concerned over law enforcement's articulated desire to slow the   domestic use of encryption.2. Call for open policy-making process -- The report supports the   development of national cryptography policy based on open public   discussion. Policy to date has often taken place outside of the   public eye, and with little guidance from Congress or the general   public.3. Align national policy with market and user demand -- The report notes   that national policy has "become increasingly disconnected from   market reality and the needs of parties in the private sector."4. Progressively relax, but not eliminate, export controls -- The   committee recommends that export controls should be "progressively   relaxed but not eliminated." This would include:4.1.  Products that meet "most general commercial requirements" for      confidentiality should be exportable -- The report suggested that      56-bit DES products would meet this need and should be exportable      today, and that this level of security should be increased over      time. The report noted that DES provides a significantly more      attractive level of security than 40-bit products currently      exportable, without imposing too great a burden on national      security as many sophisticated targets do not use U.S. products      today.4.2.  Stronger products should be exportable to a list of approved      companies if access to decrypted information is provided -- The      report argues that exports of encryption greater than 56-bit DES      should be permitted for "trustworthy" users who will guarantee      access to decrypted information upon a legally authorized request.      The report does, however, acknowledge the significant privacy and      security concerns raised by any such "key escrow" plan.4.3.  The U.S. government should streamline the export licensing process.5.  Provide assistance for law enforcement -- The report recognizes that    "cryptography is a two-edged sword" for law enforcement, providing    both a tool to help prevent crime such as economic espionage, fraud,    or destruction of the information infrastructure, and a potential    impediment to law enforcement investigations and signals    intelligence. Specific suggestions to assist in adjustment to "new    technical realities of the information age" include:5.1.  The government should encourage use of encryption for      authentication and integrity.5.2.  The government should promote telecommunications security,      especially for cellular phones and telephone switches.5.3.  The government should explore escrowed encryption for its own      uses. The report recommends further use of escrowed encryption for      government purposes as a testbed for the technical and privacy      concerns raised by key escrow policies. The report acknowledged      many of the problems of escrow, and noted that escrow may never be      adopted freely by the market for real-time communications but that      such communications will be of less concern to law enforcement      over time.5.4.  The government should seriously consider criminalizing "the use of      encrypted communications in interstate commerce with the intent to      commit a federal crime." The report acknowledged the risks posed      by such legislation, including ambiguity about what is an      encrypted communication, how to deal with automatic or ubiquitous      encryption, and how to define intent and the need for an      underlying criminal conviction.5.5.  Research and development of additional capabilities for law      enforcement should be given a high priority.6.  The government should develop a mechanism to promote information    security in the private sector.CDT will post an analysis of the report's recommendations soon.

In recent weeks, a number major new organizations, including USA Today andthe Washington Post, have featured protests by Internet users over the nonconsensualsale and usage of consumers personal data by companies that operate computerdata bases. The companies are allegedly obtaining and compiling personal background data on individual citizens into electronic transmitted databases for sale to private entities or individuals, including attorneys,banks and credit card companies, without the consent of the targeted individuals. the data bases reportedly include social security numbers, drivers licensesnumbers and other identifying information, credit files and medical records. We have received calls and letters from constituents who are greatly disturbedabout the compilation, sale, and usage of these data bases. They, as wellas consumers in general, are concerned about the potential intrusion upon,and violation of individual privacy rights. There also is concern aboutthe potential abusive and unlawful usage of the data. In light of these concerns, we request the Commission investigate the compilation,sale and usage of electronically transmitted data bases that include identifiablepersonal information of private citizens without their knowledge. Theprobe should address, but not be limited to, the following questions andissues: (1) Is the non-consensual compilation, sale, and usage of data- base aviolation of private citizens civil rights? (2) Are the data-bases subject to unlawful usage? Do they create an unduepotential for fraud on consumer? (3) Are the compilation, sale and usage of consumers personal data consistentwith the Fair Credit Reporting Act and federal telemarketing regulations? (4) Are there ways consumers can prevent data-based service companiesfrom including their personal background information in commercial databases absent their consent? We believe a study of this matter should begin immediately. We would likeyou to submit a report on your study within six months of your within sixmonths of your findings and conclusions for such legislative action as theCommission deems appropriate. Please respond as to the Commission's finaldeclaration regarding this request. Thank you for your assistance Senator Bryan Senator Hollings Senator Pressler Back.

The FTC's recommendations --included in a letter to Sen. Richard Bryan (D-NV) -- come on the heels ofconsumer outrage being expressed over the recently-released online database,P-Trak, offered by the information service Lexis-Nexis.  P-Trak provides personal information on millions of people across thecountry.  For a fee of $85 per search, Lexis-Nexis subscribers can obtainpersonal information about an individual that can include name, current andprior addresses, maiden names, birth month and year, and current telephonenumber.  In June, Lexis-Nexis stopped displaying Social Security numbers inresponse to complaints from consumers and privacy advocates about the availability of that information.  However, P-Trak users can still search thedatabase by Social Security number.A primary source for this personal information is credit reports from creditbureaus, such as Equifax, Experian (formerly TRW), and TransUnion.  Theinformation is found in the header, or top, of a person's credit report.  Under the current FCRA, credit bureaus may release and sell the type of information contained in the P-Trak database without limitation.  The FTC proposes amending the FCRA to prohibit the disclosure of certain personalinformation by expanding the definition of "consumer report" to include "anyidentifying information other than the consumer's name, generational designation, current address and telephone number."   Currently most people are unaware of the vast amount of information that is generated, captured, used and disclosed during daily activities -- from themembership card scanned in at the grocery store checkout, which neatlytallies our purchases and spending habits, to departments of motorvehicles which make a profit selling our personal information formarketing and other purposes.  As the public learns of the collection anduse of personal information by the private sector -- information that is increasingly made available in electronic format -- pressure to addressprivacy concerns will grow. As Congress moves to adjourn for the session at the end of the week, the Senate is currently considering amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.CDT believes adoption of the FTC's recommendations would be an important first step in acknowledging that individuals have a privacy interest in personal information such as social security numbers, prior addresses, andmaiden names.To preserve privacy in the digital age, CDT believes that the core privacyprinciples of notice and individual control over personal information mustinform both the design of the information infrastructure and public policydecisions.  CDT supports Congressional approval of the FTC's recommendationsin response to the growing public concern over the loss of privacy.For information about this and other privacy issues, including the text of the FTC response to Sen.

Bryan re: P-Trak FTC Response to Sen. Bryan's letter regarding P-Trak FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20580 September 20, 1996 Senator Richard Bryan Ranking Member Subcommittee on Financial Institution and Regulatory Relief U. S. Senate 364 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510-2804 Dear Senator Bryan: This responds to your September 20, 1996, letter requesting the Commission'sviews concerning reports about a database service provider that allows searchesto be performed by entering a consumer's social security number which enablesthem to retrieve a name and address. The Federal Trade Commission has received numerous complaints and Congressionalinquiries concerning recently-introduced, widely-available commercial servicesthat provide, for a fee, identifying information on individuals. Accordingto press reports, at least one tracking service currently furnishes an individual'sname, maiden name, aliases, address, prior address, telephone number andbirth month and year. To access this information, the service will searchfor the data by any elements just listed, or by social security numbers. Apparently, social security numbers are no longer displayed, but the searchfor all other identifying information can be made on social security numberalone. The ready availability of this information through the tracking servicemay facilitate identity fraud, credit fraud and other illegal activities. These concerns may outweigh the limited legitimate uses of this informationfor locating individuals. On August 20 of this year, Commission staff metwith representatives of credit bureaus, creditors, law enforcement agencies,consumer groups, and a number of additional interested parties. The stafflearned how, using the kind of information available on this service, fraudartists could open credit lines in innocent consumers names and run up unpaidcharges, thereby ruining the consumers credit histories. The interest of the Commission in the potential misuse of this informationstems in part from its responsibilities in enforcing the Fair Credit ReportingAct, ("FCRA or ACT"), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq The FCRA,which was enacted in 1970, is intended, among other things, to promote accurateconsumer reporting and to protect the privacy of consumer report informationcompiled by consumer reporting and to protect the privacy of consumer reportinformation compiled by consumer reporting agencies (also known as creditbureaus) by restricting access to such information. Reportedly, this tracking service obtains the consumer information froma consumer reporting agency that maintains the identifying and other informationin its extensive computer files of data used in the preparing and furnishingof consumer reports.1 Section 603(d) of the FCRA defines a consumer report2, and Section604 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from furnishing a consumer reportto anyone who does not have a "permissible purpose" to obtainthe report. If the information provided by the consumer reporting agencydoes not meet the definition of a consumer report, however, the FCRA doesnot apply and the recipient does not need a permissible purpose to obtainthe information. No provision of the FCRA specifically prohibits the releaseof non-credit related consumer identifying information.3 Nonetheless, the Commission believes that in light of the information ithas recently obtained about credit identity fraud, it may be appropriateto reexamine the elements of information that consumer reporting agenciescan legally provide to recipients who do not have a statutorily definedpermissible purpose to obtain the information. Because many otherwise neutralconsumer identifiers are now recognized to be, either individually or incombination, critical elements in systems of fraud prevention and security,the Commission believes that these identifiers may warrant the same protectionsafforded to other consumer information specified in the FCRA. Accordingly, Congress may wish to consider amending the Fair Credit ReportingAct to provide confidentiality protections to the following elements ofconsumer identification: social security number, mother's maiden name, prioraddresses and date of birth. In order to accomplish this we suggest additionof the following language as Section 603(k), 15 U.S.C. 1681a(k) The term "consumer report" also includes any communicationby a consumer reporting agency of any identifying information other thanthe consumers name, generational designation, current address and telephonenumber. Congress may also wish to consider amending Section 602 of the Act, whichsets out the findings and purpose of Congress in enacting the FCRA, as follows: § 602. Findings and purpose (a) the Congress makes the following findings: *** (4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercisetheir grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, concern for theconfidentiality of consumer information, and a respect for the consumer'sright to privacy. (b) It is the purpose of this title to require that consumer reporting agenciesadopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumercredit, personal, insurance, and other information in a manner which isfair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of such information, includingindentifying information, in accordance with the requirements of this title. If you have any questions or wish to discuss this response further, pleasefeel free to contact David Medine, Associate Director for Credit Practices,at (202) 326-3025. By direction of the Commission. [signed] Robert Pitofsky 1 Certain of this information may be available from othersources not subject to the FCRA. 2 Section 603(d) defines "consumer report " as "information...bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity,character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of livingwhich is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part forthe purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibilityfor (1) credit or insurance... (2) employment...or (3) other purposes authorizedunder section 604." 3 In early 1993, the Federal Trade Commission entered into anagreed order amending its 1991 consent order against TRW Inc. (FTC v TRWInc., 784 F Supp. 361 (N.D. Tex 1991)), restricting TRW's ability to engagein target marketing, the practice of using information from consumer reportsto develop and sell direct marketing lists. The amended order providesthat TRW may, in the sale or distribution of lists of consumers, use thefollowing identifying information from its consumer reporting database:name, telephone number, mother's maiden name address, zip code, year ofbirth, age, any generational designation, social security number, or substantiallysimilar identifiers or any combination thereof.

Over the past several months, concerns about the availability and use of personal information in the online world, particularly with respect to the collection and use of information about children, have prompted Congress to seriously consider this important issue. Legislation designed to restrict the collection and use of personalinformation about children without parental consent was introducedby Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ) on May 22, 1996. While the bill (H.R. 3508) is supported by various groups, including Enough is Enough and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), it has sparked concerns from cyber-rights advocates that it may end up increasing the collection of personal information online and result in restrictions on the free flow of information. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), People for the American Way (PFAW) Action Fund, Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW), and CDT sent Rep. Franks a letter regarding his legislation on June 4, 1996. In the letter, the groups expressed concern that the bill, in its current form, raises some of the same privacy and free flow of information concerns raised by the Exon/Coats "Communications Decency Act" to the extent that it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a person visiting a web site is or is not a child without requiring all visitors to identify themselves. On September 12, 1996, the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bill. CDT sent a letter to subcommittee members reiterating its concerns about the bill.

These hearings highlighted the current and future availability of technologies which empower users and parents to exercise more control over the collection and use of personal information.

Markey Introduces Online Privacy Legislation First Posted on June 24, 1996 || Last Updated on June 24,1996 On June 20, Representative Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced legislation designedto address concerns over the collection and use of personal informationthat is collected online. The Communications Privacy and Consumer EmpowermentAct (CPCEA) directs the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal CommunicationsCommission to first examine the ability of user empowerment technologies,coupled with industry action and standards to provide individuals with thesebasic privacy rights. Where privacy protections do not exist or need tobe buttressed, the bill directs the FCC and FTC to step in and craft rulesto ensure people's privacy is protected online. At the bill's core are three fundamental privacy rules that will give peoplecontrol over the use of personal information: People must have Knowledge that information is beingcollected; Collectors must give adequate and conspicuous Noticethat they intend to reuse of sell the information; and, Individuals must have the ability to say No to furtheruse or sale of personal information. CDT, along with the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federationof America, and People for the American Way Action Fund joined Rep. Markeyat a press conference to discuss the bill's introduction. CDT applaudsRep. Markey's efforts to put control over personal information back intothe hands of individuals.

If you are unsure about a screen name, send us an email usingthe "Write to Community Action Staff" button under keyword "TOS,"and select the "Names/Profiles Violations" button.

(i) Offensive Communication. AOL is a community-oriented service composedof many different communities of people. Our goal is to provide an interesting,stimulating and fun place for all Members. Using vulgar, abusive or hatefullanguage undermines this goal and is not allowed. Please use your best judgmentand be respectful of other Members. Remember, there may be children online.If you use vulgar, or abusive language online, even if masked by symbolsor other characters, you may either receive an "on-screen-warning"by a Guide or Room Host, or in some cases be terminated immediately. A warningindicates that your language is not in compliance with the TOS or ROR. Shouldyou receive such a warning, take the time to read the AOL Rules again, comprisingthe TOS and these ROR which you will find posted in the Member Servicesarea. (ii) Harassment. When a Member targets another individual or entity to causedistress, embarrassment, unwanted attention, or other discomfort, this isharassment. AOL Inc. does not condone harassment in any form and may suspendor terminate the accounts of any Member who harasses others. You may havea disagreement with someone's point of view -- we encourage lively discussionin our chat rooms and message boards -- but personal attacks, or attacksbased on a persons race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexualorientation, disablement or other such affiliation, are prohibited. If youhave a disagreement with someone's point of view, address the subject, notthe person. (iii) Graphic Files. AOL Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on AOL ofsexually explicit images or other content deemed offensive by AOL Inc. (iv) Scrolling. "Scrolling" means repeatedly causing the screento roll faster than Members are able to type to it. It is caused by a userentering a set of random characters or by repeatedly entering a carriagereturn or any such action to a similar disruptive effect. Scrolling is anexpressly prohibited form of disruption. (v) Impersonation. This can involve the portrayal of another person or entity,such as the impersonation of AOL Inc. staff or an information provider,authorized Guide or Host, or communication under a false name or a namethat you are not authorized to use. Members must avoid the portrayal ofAOL Inc. personnel or others persons in all forms of online communication,including, but not limited to, screen names, member profiles, chat dialogueand message postings. (vi) Room Disruption. This includes purposefully interfering with the normalflow of dialogue in a chat room. Room disruption may occur by repeatedlyinterrupting conversation between Members, or by acting in such a way asto antagonize, harass or create hostility in a chat room. (vii) Chain Letters and Pyramid Schemes. Transmission of chain letters andpyramid schemes of any kind is not allowed on AOL. This material placesan unnecessary load on our electronic mail ("email") system andis considered a nuisance by many Members. Certain chain letters and pyramidschemes are illegal. Letters or messages that offer a product or servicebased on the structure of a chain letter are also of questionable legality.At minimum, they are a waste of resources and are not permitted on AOL. (viii) Advertising, Solicitation and Name Harvesting. You may not use AOLto send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms ofsolicitation to other Members except in those specified areas that are designatedfor such a purpose (e.g., the classified area) unless you receive the expresspermission of the Member.

AOL Inc. reserves the right to block or filter mass email solicitationson or through AOL. If you witness chat in a public chat room that violates the AOL Rules, youmay contact an AOL Service Guide by using the keyword "Guide Pager."You may also contact AOL Inc.s Community Action Staff about any violationby using the "Write to Community Action Staff" icon located inthe TOS area of the Members Services area. D. Content. You recognize that communication over AOL often occurs in real-time, oris posted on one of AOLs thousands of message boards or libraries, and AOLInc. cannot, and does not intend to, screen communication in advance.

Any copyright Content submitted with the consent ofa copyright owner other than you should contain a phrase such as "Copyrightowned by [name of the owner]; Used by Permission." The unauthorizedsubmission of copyright or Content which is otherwise subject of any thirdparty Rights constitutes a breach of the AOL Rules and may also render youliable to the holder of such rights. Remember you, not AOL Inc. or its affiliatesor independent contractors (such as Independent Content Providers or "ICPs"),are exclusively responsible for any liability resulting from infringementof Rights arising from such submission or transmission. By posting shareware or other software to AOLs file libraries, you authorizeAOL to distribute the software through its worldwide network. You may providefor additional license terms and restrictions in your upload, but AOL shallhave no obligation whatsoever with respect to enforcing such terms and conditionsand reserves the right to remove any software from its network, at its solediscretion.

Many of the online areas that you visit on AOL are operated by companiesthat are independent from AOL Inc.

Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Companyis committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,by maintaining the very highest privacy standards. Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that isassociated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both informationsupplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and informationwe collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact thata Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through theservice). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total numberof Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Memberhas made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY serviceas a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal fileson their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standardswhich meet these expectations. We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policyon Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodyingour privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamentalto our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service. 1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provideProdigy's products and services. These purposes are: - to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, andservice providers on the PRODIGY service; - to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, includingmaking members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercialofferings that may be of interest; - to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings; - to serve members when they have questions or problems; - to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, andaccounting; - to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;and - as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy'slegal department in each case. Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID endsin "A") information regarding service usage by other MembershipID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the MembershipHolder is responsible. 2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect theprivacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access topersonal information are required to follow specific practices concerningits proper handling. 3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list foruse by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communicationsto members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through thePRODIGY service. 4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private whilethey are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or discloseto others the contents of these private messages except with the specificconsent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy'slegal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federallaw. 5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derivedfrom private files without the member's authorization. Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and upholdthis Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it. Opt Out of Commercial Promotional Mail Prodigy's online advertisers often send mail about specials, one-of-a-kindsales and limited-time promotions they don't want you to miss. We hope you find this information useful. But it's your mailbox, and yourchoice. If you prefer, select Take Me Off the List to stop receiving thistype of mail. You'll still get information about Prodigy features, pricingchanges and your account, but all advertiser mail will be suppressed. Or,choose Keep Me On the List to continue receiving special offers and Prodigynews in your mailbox. To return here anytime, Jump: opt out. Copyright 1996 Prodigy Services Company.

Please be aware that AOL is a private online service which allows accessto the Internet, but is not the Internet. AOL Inc. does not control thecontent or services available through the Internet (except for the AOL andGNN homepages), and providers of Internet sites or services have separatedata and privacy practices which are independent of AOL Inc. Internet areasmay appear to be seamlessly incorporated into AOL; however, currently, youcan tell youre on the Internet whenever there appears a spinning AOL logo,or when you click on icons labeled as "Newsgroups," "Web,""Link," "FTP," "Gopher" or other items relatingto the "Internet." Many of the online areas that you visit on AOL are operated by companiesthat are independent from AOL Inc. While AOL Inc. will seek to require theseindependent companies (e.g. information providers, advertisers, and merchants)to adhere to our strong privacy principles, AOL Inc. does not bear responsibilityfor their policies or actions. You should be aware that when you voluntarilydisclose personal information (such as your screen name) in public areas(e.g., the Member Directory, chat rooms, message boards, Internet Newsgroups),your information can be collected and used by others. (When you visit Internetsites, your AOL screen name or other Member Identity Information is generallynot identifiable.) Also, ordering products through AOL often requires youto provide an independent company with limited Individual Information toenable them to fulfill and ship your order.

Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that isassociated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both informationsupplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and informationwe collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact thata Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through theservice). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total numberof Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Memberhas made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY serviceas a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal fileson their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standardswhich meet these expectations. We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policyon Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodyingour privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamentalto our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service. 1.

Why doesn't PRODIGY do something about notes on thepublic bulletin boards that clearly violate the guidelines? A. Due to the high volume of posted notes on a daily basis(in excess of 70,000), PRODIGY cannot possibly read each and every note.We rely upon electronic scanners to scan all notes for offensive and inappropriatelanguage and return those that violate our guidelines. We also rely uponour members to alert us to problem notes on the boards or areas where membersare being otherwise disruptive to the bulletin board community. To alert us to problem situations on the board, select the Guidelines &Info button off the main menu of the board where the problem exists. Thenwrite to us with the details (date, time, BB, topic/subject, IDs) of theproblem note by selecting the Problem Note Alert mailbox option.

Use of the Service You are responsible for providing all equipment, devices and software (otherthan the PRODIGY software) necessary to receive the Service. Prodigy will providetelephone numbers to connect to the Service, which for most Members will include alocal number. You are responsible for selecting the best number for you, and for all telephonefees and charges associated with the use of the telephone number you select. If youhave any question about which telephone number is best for you, check with your localphone company. The Service will be available during the hours stated on the Service.Jump: service hours. Use of the Service, and of specific telephone numbers, issubject to interruptions at Prodigy's discretion or beyond Prodigy's control. Unauthorizedaccess to the Service, to restricted portions of the Service, or to the telecommunicationsor computer facilities used to deliver the Service, is breach of this Agreementand a violation of law. Membership Holders may suspend Service use by other Members in the Membership through the means provided on the Service. Jump: member access.Prodigy gives the Membership Holder the ability to limit access of Members in theMembership to certain content available through the Service, including access to contenton the Internet over which Prodigy exercises no control. The responsibility for controllingMember access to and use of these content areas is solely that of the MembershipHolder. IDs and Passwords. Use of the Service requires both an ID and a password. Each new Member receivesa unique ID and a temporary password, and must choose a new password upon enrollment. Your ID is your address on the Service, and you and Prodigymay disclose it to others. Your password is the key that unlocks access to your personalinformation on the Service. Anyone knowing both your ID and password can gain access toyour personal information and misuse it, so KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECRET; use a password that is hard to guess (for example, do not use your first or lastname); and change your password frequently. REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD! If you forget your password, Prodigy may disclose it to you under security proceduresdetermined by Prodigy, but reserves the right to charge for doing so. For more informationon passwords, Jump: password security. To change your password, Jump: change password. You may not use another Member's ID without the specific consentof that Member. Unauthorized use of another Member's ID, or improper solicitationof another Member's password, are grounds for termination of your Membership, and maybe a violation of law. For your convenience, Prodigy provides an option thatallows you to connect to the Service automatically, without manually entering your IDand password each time. Software available from third parties may also offer this function.If you choose to use any automatic connection function, you must understand thatanyone who has access to your computer can also gain access to and abuse your Serviceaccount. For example, anyone having access to the software or computer containing yourautomatic connection information could abuse any credit, debit or charge card information associated with your ID. 7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability topersonalize editorial and commercial content and offerings to your interests. Personalizationis based on information that you (or the Membership Holder) provide to Prodigy and information derived during your use of the Service and during installation of the PRODIGYsoftware on your equipment used to receive the Service. You may review or updatecertain personal information you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools featureon the Service. Jump: tools. You may be requested to supplement or update your personal information fromtime to time. All personal information that you provide on the Service must be accurate,and Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy may use or discloseaggregated (not personally identifiable) information regarding Members for any purpose.Prodigy will not use or disclose information specifically about you (or your Membership)except as permitted by this Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting MemberPrivacy. Jump: privacy policy. From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer, communications equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY software). Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiablebasis only to: (i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate on your equipment;(ii) monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY software on your equipment;or (iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings that may become availablefor your equipment. When you place an order on the Service, Prodigy may provide yourname, address, telephone number, and other relevant information to the Merchant,including whether you are a minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannotand will not be responsible for how Merchants use this information. Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Companyis committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,by maintaining the very highest privacy standards. Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that isassociated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both informationsupplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and informationwe collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact thata Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through theservice). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total numberof Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Memberhas made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY serviceas a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal fileson their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standardswhich meet these expectations. We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policyon Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodyingour privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamentalto our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service. 1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provideProdigy's products and services. These purposes are: - to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, andservice providers on the PRODIGY service; - to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, includingmaking members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercialofferings that may be of interest; - to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings; - to serve members when they have questions or problems; - to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, andaccounting; - to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;and - as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy'slegal department in each case. Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID endsin "A") information regarding service usage by other MembershipID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the MembershipHolder is responsible. 2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect theprivacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access topersonal information are required to follow specific practices concerningits proper handling. 3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list foruse by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communicationsto members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through thePRODIGY service. 4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private whilethey are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or discloseto others the contents of these private messages except with the specificconsent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy'slegal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federallaw. 5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derivedfrom private files without the member's authorization. Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and upholdthis Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it.

While we commend the bill's sponsor,Representative Franks, and Chairman McCollum, as well as the members ofthe Committee for their efforts to protect children's privacy, we believethat the solutions proposed in the CPPPEA -- particularly as they relateto the exchange of information on the Internet -- will increase the collectionof information about children in certain circumstances and criminalize behaviorin a vast array of unintended situations, thereby compromising the freeflow of information online. CDT is committed to advancing individual privacy on the Internet. We believethat protecting children's privacy is a subject in need of exploration andaction, however we urge the Committee to seek solutions that both protectprivacy and respect our First Amendment freedoms. As stated by CDT, Voters Telecommunications Watch, People for the AmericanWay, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a June 1996 letter to RepresentativeFranks (attached), the CPPPEA raises a number of significant privacy andFirst Amendment concerns. Compliance with the bill could well lead to an increase in the collectionof information about children and adults, compounding privacy risks. Informationproviders on the Internet currently have no way of distinguishing childrenfrom adults. Given marketers and other information providers desire tocontinue their business, it is likely that they will seek to collect moreintrusive information about children's ages and their parents in an effortto limit their liability and garner parental consent. In the worst casescenario this could lead to an unacceptably intrusive national ID systemfor the Internet (a system that none of us support). The term "list broker," is drafted to cover any entity whichexchanges personal information in the course of its operation. The vastmajority of World Wide Web site operators, as well as anyone who operatesa listserv, mailing list or other information distribution mechanism, allcollect, store, and may well exchange, email addresses. Unless Web siteoperators obtain parental consent before collecting information, they riskcriminal penalties for violation of section (a)(4). The requirement to disclose the source and content of personal informationabout children to parents creates unclear new obligations on Internet informationproviders. In fact, many of the information providers who would be coveredby the CPPPEA do not keep track of the source of their information and thusmay not have the ability to comply with the statute. Compliance with thissection could well lead to an increase in the overall collection of personalinformation about Internet users, thereby compounding privacy risks. Requiring parental consent in all instances and requiring providersto disclose information to parents collected from children fails to acknowledgethe distinction between young children and teenagers and their rights underthe Constitution. Such a provision as applied to a fourteen or fifteenyear old child may fail to respect the youth's independent First Amendmentand privacy interests. Imposed identification procedures applied to the World Wide Web underthe threat of criminal penalties would limit all Internet users' abilityto read, speak, receive information and interact online under constitutionally-protectedconditions of anonymity. Section (a)(6) which criminalizes any distribution or receipt of personalinformation where the receiver has knowledge or "reason to believethat the information will be used to abuse the child or physically harmthe child" is well-intentioned, but potentially so broad as to coveranyone who receives and discloses personal information about a child, oron the Internet anyone who allows a child to "post" informationabout his or herself. The bill establishes no clear standard of care orlevel of knowledge necessary to meet this requirement, leaving everyoneon the Internet in doubt about whether or not they may be violating thisnew crime. Schools and organizations who publish directories as well asnewspapers who publish the identity of a child in a news story could besubject to prosecution because they had "reason to know" thatthe information may end up in the possession of bad actors. The Internet offers children unprecedented and important new educationaland recreational opportunities. But, the medium also may offer access toinappropriate material, and exposure to unfair marketing or informationcollection practices. Solutions to these problems must be carefully analyzedand should take into account both the unique nature of the Internet, aswell as the multitude of First Amendment and privacy rights at stake forall who seek to read, communicate, and associate with others in the onlineenvironment. Given the importance of addressing children's privacy issues, we suggestthat the Committee examine alternatives. Empowering parents to protecttheir children's privacy with existing technological tools, fair informationpractices by the industry, and the enactment of more narrowly tailored legislation,will help ensure that the Internet continues to grow and thrive for bothcommercial and noncommercial endeavors. For example, software already onthe market such as Cyberpatrol, as well as industry-standard technologiessuch as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) enable people-- including parents and their children -- to restrict access to sites whichpractice objectionable marketing and information collection techniques. At present, PICS technology, along with other innovative products, allowsparents to filter and block-out materials that contain objectionable contentor block access to sites with inappropriate or abusive marketing practices. Current technology can enable parents to: prevent their children from accessing Web sites with inappropriate informationpractices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy organizationof the parent's choice; prevent their children from revealing personal information such as name,address, and e-mail address to others; install security measures such as passwords that prevent their childfrom changing rules about Web site access or information disclosure, collectionand use that the parent has established. CDT strongly believes that parents should be given the tools and legal remediesnecessary to ensure a safe, educational, and enjoyable online experiencefor their children. It is possible to craft a policy that will ensure children'ssafety and protect children's privacy, consistent with the First Amendment. We urge the Committee to seek a policy that will protect the privacy ofusers of the Internet, foster free speech, and continue the Internet's developmentas a robust platform for social, political and economic activities.

Franks Letter to Representative Bob Franks regarding H.R. 3508 June 4, 1996 Representative Bob Franks 429 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Dear Representative Franks: We are writing to commend your efforts to protect children's privacy. Weare pleased that you have begun a process to put these important issuesat the center of the political debate. We believe, however, that the solutionsrecommended in your bill, -- the "Children's Privacy Protection andParental Empowerment Act" (HR 3508) -- particularly as they relateto the exchange of information on the Internet, will not only increase thecollection of information about children in certain circumstances but willalso criminalize behavior in a vast array of unintended situations, therebycompromising the free flow of information online. With the rising popularity of the Internet and commercial online services,concerns regarding the vulnerabilities of unsupervised children's activitiesonline must be addressed. Indeed, although the Internet offers childrenunprecedented and important new educational and recreational opportunities,the medium also may offer access to inappropriate material, or exposureto unfair marketing or information collection practices. Solutions to theseproblems must be carefully analyzed and should take into account both theunique nature of the Internet, as well as the multitude of First Amendmentand privacy rights at stake for all who seek to read, communicate, and associatewith others in the online environment. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission(FTC), whose responsibility it is to police the existence and proliferationof unfair or deceptive advertising and information practices has scheduledhearings for June 4 and 5 to look at these very issues as they apply tothe Internet. Because your bill was drafted to apply to all media we are concerned thatits application in the Internet context may lead to unintended consequences.We ask that you examine, together with the FTC, the unique qualities ofthe Internet and the problems that result from regulating activity at theinformation publisher or Web site operator end. In its application to the Internet, the Children's Privacy Protection andParental Empowerment Act is both over-inclusive, covering virtually allwho participate in the Internet, and ineffective, in that it leaves substantialloopholes for those who engage in the behavior at which the bill is targeted. The term "personal information," the basic regulatory target ofthe bill, is defined in such as way that it may include nothing more thanan electronic mail address which by its nature, gives no indication of theage or physical location of a user. Furthermore, the term "list broker,"is drafted to cover any entity which exchanges personal information in thecourse of its operation. The vast majority of World Wide Web site operators,as well as anyone who operates a listserv, mailing list or other informationdistribution mechanism, all collect, store, and may well exchange, emailaddresses. Then, unless Web site operators obtain parental consent beforecollecting information, they risk criminal penalties for violation of section(a)(4). The difficulty in compliance is two-fold. First, information providers onthe Internet have no way of distinguishing children from adults. In fact,compliance with the bill could well lead to an increase in the collectionof information about children and adults, only compounding privacy risks.Even with the imposition of an unacceptably intrusive national ID system(a system that none of us support), it would still be essentially impossiblefor an information publisher or Web site operator to establish the age ofthe user visiting the providers site. Second, the requirement to disclosethe source of personal information about children to parents creates unclearnew obligations on Internet information providers. In fact, many of theinformation providers who would be covered by your bill do not keep trackof the source of their information and thus may not have the ability tocomply with the statute. Compliance with this section could well lead toan increase in the overall collection of personal information about Internetusers, thereby compounding privacy risks. Imposed identification procedures applied to the World Wide Web under thethreat of criminal penalties would limit all Internet users' ability toread, speak, receive information and interact online under constitutionally-protectedconditions of anonymity. Further, requiring parental consent in all instancesor requiring providers to disclose information to parents collected fromchildren fails to acknowledge the distinction between young children andteenagers and their rights under the Constitution. Finally, section (a)(6) which criminalizes any distribution or receipt ofpersonal information where the receiver has knowledge or "reason tobelieve that the information will be used to abuse the child or physicallyharm the child" is well-intentioned, but potentially so broad as tocover anyone who receives and discloses personal information about a child.The bill establishes no clear standard of care or level of knowledge necessaryto meet this requirement, leaving everyone on the Internet in doubt aboutwhether or not they may be violating this new crime. Schools and organizationswho publish directories as well as newspapers who publish the identity ofa child in a news story could be subject to prosecution because they had"reason to know" that the information may end up in the possessionof bad actors. Given all of these difficulties in applying your bill to the Internet, andgiven the importance of addressing children's privacy issues, we suggestthat examination of alternatives is in order. Empowering parents to protecttheir children's privacy with existing technological tools and fair informationpractices by the industry will help ensure that the Internet continues togrow and thrive for both commercial and noncommercial endeavors. For example,software already on the market such as Cyberpatrol, as well as industry-standardtechnologies such as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS)enable people -- including parents and their children -- to restrict accessto sites which practice objectionable marketing and information collectiontechniques. At present, PICS technology, along with other innovative products, allowsparents to filter and block-out materials that contain objectionable contentor block access to sites with inappropriate or abusive marketing practices.Current technology can enable parents to: prevent their children from accessing Web sites with inappropriate informationpractices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy organizationof the parent's choice; prevent their children from revealing personal information such as name,address, and e-mail address to others; install security measures such as passwords that prevent their childfrom changing rules about Web site access or information disclosure, collectionand use that the parent has established. The Internet community is already considering extensions to the PICS specificationswhich will enable individual users and parents to block the transmissionof their personal information to Web sites they visit and to express a preferenceabout how and to what extent they are willing to have personal informationreused. PICS, Cyberpatrol and other technologies can help eradicate thedeceptive and inappropriate practices your bill seeks to address withoutcompromising the rights of users or content providers. Several of us have had the opportunity to talk with you and your staff aboutthis legislation. We appreciate your willingness to discuss these issuesand look forward to working with you in this important area in the hopesthat technological alternatives combined with better industry practicesand much more narrowly crafted legislation will help protect this nation'schildren in the online world, consistent with First Amendment and privacyprinciples.

The bill has sparked concerns from cyber-rightsadvocates that it may end up increasing the collection of personalinformation online and result in restrictions on the free flow ofinformation (see the attached letter from EFF, People for the American WayAction Fund, VTW, and CDT below).Recent hearings before the FTC emphasized the broad consensus about the needto give individuals more control over the collection and use of personalinformation. The FTC hearings highlighted the availability of technologieswhich empower users and parents to exercise more control over the collectionand use of such information, and the possibility that existing methods,including the PICS standards, can be enhanced to enable users to expresspreferences about how and to what extent they are willing to have personalinformation reused (although much work needs to be done before this is fullyimplemented).In addition, Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), a long time champion of privacy issues,told the FTC panel that he would like to encourage the development oftechnologies that enable users to control the amount of personal information they reveal online. Markey also emphasized that Congress shouldconsider legislation in this area if such technologies are not developed orare not effective.  Markey told the FTC: "We should see if there are technological tools that can empower  consumers. Where they don't exist, or where a particular industry  refuses to embrace this code of electronic ethics in a way that solves  this problem, then the government is obliged to step in and do  something."Markey also announced that he intends to introduce legislation soon to giveconsumers the right to know that information is being collected about them,notice that personal information may be reused or sold, and the right tosay "no" to the reuse or sale of their personal information.  Markey'slegislation would also commission a study of existing online privacypractices (The full text of Rep. Markey's statement is available at CDT'sprivacy issues web page URL below.)The FTC hearings illustrated that there is broad concern about thecollection and use of personal information online. There was also greatsubstantial support expressed for technological solutions to address thisissue.  As a result, the FTC has requested that the industry report back tothe Commission in 6 months on progress towards developing technologies thatenhance user control over the collection and use of personal informationonline.CDT is encouraged that Congress and the FTC have taken such strong interestin the issue of online privacy, and we look forward to working with allinterested parties to ensure that solutions give users control over thecollection and use of personal information and do not adversely affect thefree flow of information online.More information, including CDT's testimony before the FTC panel and Rep.Markey's statement, and a demonstration illustrating the amount of personalinformation collected during the normal course of surfing the Web, can befound at CDT's Privacy Issues page:   http://www.cdt.org/privacy/-----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Letter from EFF, PFAW Action Fund, VTW & CDT to Rep. Bob Franks     Regarding "Children's Privacy" (HR 3508) BillThe following letter was sent last week to Representative Bob Franks (R-NJ)regarding the "Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act"(HR 3508) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, People for the AmericanWay Action Fund, the Voters Telecommunications Watch, and the Center forDemocracy and Technology.Among other things, the groups expressed concern that, as currentlydrafted, the bill raises some of the same privacy and free flow ofinformation issues raised by the Exon/Coats "Communications Decency Act" tothe extent that it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a personvisiting a web site is or is not a child without requiring all visitors toidentify themselves.While commending Rep. Franks for his efforts and expressing support for thegoal of his legislation, the letter outlines several concerns about theimpact of the bill on the Internet.  The groups pledged to work with Rep.Franks and other interested members of Congress to explore technologicalsolutions which empower users and parents to control the use of personalinformation and preserve the free flow of information.The Franks bill enjoys broad support from a number of conservative"pro-family" groups such as the Christian Coalition, Enough Is Enough!, andthe National Law Center for Children and Families, as well as privacygroups such as EPIC, Privacy Times Publisher Evan Hendricks and PrivacyJournal Publisher Robert Ellis Smith.The text of HR 3508 is available at: http://www.cdt.org/privacy/children/The full text of the letter from EFF, PFAW Action Fund, VTW and CDT follows: ----------June 4, 1996Representative Bob Franks429 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Dear Representative Franks:We are writing to commend your efforts to protect children's privacy.We are pleased that you have begun a process to put these important issuesat the center of the political debate. We believe, however, that thesolutions recommended in your bill, -- the "Children's Privacy Protectionand Parental Empowerment Act" (HR 3508) -- particularly as they relate tothe exchange of information on the Internet, will not only increase thecollection of information about children in certain circumstances but willalso criminalize behavior in a vast array of unintended situations, therebycompromising the free flow of information online.With the rising popularity of the Internet and commercial onlineservices, concerns regarding the vulnerabilities of unsupervised children'sactivities online must be addressed. Indeed, although the Internet offerschildren unprecedented and important new educational and recreationalopportunities, the medium also may offer access to inappropriate material,or exposure to unfair marketing or information collection practices. Solutions to these problems must be carefully analyzed and should take intoaccount both the unique nature of the Internet, as well as the multitude ofFirst Amendment and privacy rights at stake for all who seek to read,communicate, and associate with others in the online environment. In fact,the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose responsibility it is to police theexistence and proliferation of unfair or deceptive advertising andinformation practices has scheduled hearings for June 4 and 5 to look atthese very issues as they apply to the Internet.Because your bill was drafted to apply to all media we are concernedthat its application in the Internet context may lead to unintendedconsequences. We ask that you examine, together with the FTC, the uniquequalities of the Internet and the problems that result from regulatingactivity at the information publisher or Web site operator end.In its application to the Internet, the Children's Privacy Protectionand Parental Empowerment Act is both over-inclusive, covering virtually allwho participate in the Internet, and ineffective, in that it leavessubstantial loopholes for those who engage in the behavior at which the billis targeted.The term "personal information," the basic regulatory target of thebill, is defined in such as way that it may include nothing more than anelectronic mail address which by its nature, gives no indication of the ageor physical location of a user.  Furthermore, the term "list broker," isdrafted to cover any entity which exchanges personal information in thecourse of its operation. The vast majority of World Wide Web site operators,as well as anyone who operates a listserv, mailing list or other informationdistribution mechanism, all collect, store, and may well exchange, emailaddresses. Then, unless Web site operators obtain parental consent beforecollecting information, they risk criminal penalties for violation ofsection (a)(4).The difficulty in compliance is two-fold. First, information providerson the Internet have no way of distinguishing children from adults.  Infact, compliance with the bill could well lead to an increase in thecollection of information about children and adults, only compoundingprivacy risks. Even with the imposition of an unacceptably intrusivenational ID system (a system that none of us support), it would still beessentially impossible for an information publisher or Web site operator toestablish the age of the user visiting the providers site. Second, therequirement to disclose the source of personal information about children toparents creates unclear new obligations on Internet information providers.In fact, many of the information providers who would be covered by yourbill do not keep track of the source of their information and thus may nothave the ability to comply with the statute.  Compliance with this sectioncould well lead to an increase in the overall collection of personalinformation about Internet users, thereby compounding privacy risks.Imposed identification procedures applied to the World Wide Web underthe threat of criminal penalties would limit all Internet users' ability toread, speak, receive information and interact online underconstitutionally-protected conditions of anonymity. Further, requiringparental consent in all instances or requiring providers to discloseinformation to parents collected from children fails to acknowledge thedistinction between young children and teenagers and their rights under theConstitution.Finally, section (a)(6) which criminalizes any distribution or receiptof personal information where the receiver has knowledge or "reason tobelieve that the information will be used to abuse the child or physicallyharm the child" is well-intentioned, but potentially so broad as to coveranyone who receives and discloses personal information about a child. Thebill establishes no clear standard of care or level of knowledge necessaryto meet this requirement, leaving everyone on the Internet in doubt aboutwhether or not they may be violating this new crime. Schools andorganizations who publish directories as well as newspapers who publish theidentity of a child in a news story could be subject to prosecution becausethey had "reason to know" that the information may end up in the possessionof bad actors.Given all of these difficulties in applying your bill to the Internet,and given the importance of addressing children's privacy issues, we suggestthat examination of alternatives is in order. Empowering parents to protecttheir children's privacy with existing technological tools and fairinformation practices by the industry will help ensure that the Internetcontinues to grow and thrive for both commercial and noncommercialendeavors. For example, software already on the market such as Cyberpatrol,as well as industry-standard technologies such as the Platform for InternetContent Selection (PICS) enable people -- including parents and theirchildren -- to restrict access to sites which practice objectionablemarketing and information collection techniques.At present, PICS technology, along with other innovative products,allows parents to filter and block-out materials that contain objectionablecontent or block access to sites with inappropriate or abusive marketingpractices. Current technology can enable parents to:* prevent their children from accessing Web sites with inappropriate  information practices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy  organization of the parent's choice;* prevent their children from revealing personal information such as name,  address, and e-mail address to others;* install security measures such as passwords that prevent their child from  changing rules about Web site access or information disclosure, collection  and use that the parent has established.The Internet community is already considering extensions to the PICSspecifications which will enable individual users and parents to block thetransmission of their personal information to Web sites they visit and toexpress a preference about how and to what extent they are willing to havepersonal information reused. PICS, Cyberpatrol and other technologies canhelp eradicate the deceptive and inappropriate practices your bill seeks toaddress without compromising the rights of users or content providers.Several of us have had the opportunity to talk with you and your staffabout this legislation. We appreciate your willingness to discuss theseissues and look forward to working with you in this important area in thehopes that technological alternatives combined with better industrypractices and much more narrowly crafted legislation will help protect thisnation's children in the online world, consistent with First Amendment andprivacy principles.Sincerely,The Center for Democracy and TechnologyThe Electronic Frontier FoundationPeople For the American Way Action FundVoters Telecommunications Watch--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) Join Senator Conrad Burns Live Online to Discuss Encryption Policy The    Night Before His Subcommittee Holds a Hearing On the Issue! --> Visit http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/ for details <--In what is becoming the newest way for Congress to read the net.community'sopinion on issues, Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will be on HotWired on June11th @ 10pm EST to discuss the encryption issue with all attendees.

Markey statement to FTC Statement of Representative Edward J. Markey (D-MA) Ranking Democrat, House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee Electronic Privacy and Children's Privacy Federal Trade Commission June 5, 1996 Good Morning.  Thank you very much for inviting me to be with you here today.  The issue of privacy in the information age and in particular, children's privacy protection is quite timely as the nation becomes ever more linked by the Internet.  It is important that we tackle these issues now before we travel down the information superhighway too far and realize perhaps we've made a wrong turn.Yesterday, I had the privilege of addressing a conference at MIT on how the Internet and other telecommunications technologies can enhance the educational experience for millions of schoolkids.Yet the "wire" -- and I use the term "wire" as shorthand for any telecommunications infrastructure such as phone, cable, computer or wireless networks -- the wondrous wire that brings new services to homes, businesses and schools will have a certain Dickensian quality to it:  it will be the best of wires and the worst of wires.  It can uplift society as well as debase it.  It can allow people to telecommute to work and obtain distance learning classes.  New digital technologies and other innovations allow corporations to become more efficient, workers more productive, and businesses to conduct commerce almost effortlessly in digital dollars.This same technology however, will avail Corporate America of the opportunity to track the clickstream of a citizen of the Net, to sneak corporate hands into a personal information "cookie jar" and use this database to compile sophisticated, highly personal consumer profiles of people's hobbies, buying habits, financial information, health information, who they contact or converse with, when and for how long.  In short, that wondrous wire may also allow digital desperadoes to roam the electronic frontier unchecked by any high tech sheriff or adherence  to any code of electornic ethics.It is this issue of personal information hijacking that we are concerned about and we are obviously concerned when kids are the target. As many of you may know, I have long battled to establish privacy protections in the telecommunications area.  I fought successfully to include privacy provisions in the recently-signed Telecommunications Act that were based upon legislation that I previously passed through the House of Representatives in 1994.  In fact, in the Telecommunications Act, I was able to convince my colleagues to greatly expand the privacy protections traditionally accorded consumers of telephone services.In short, the Telecommunications Act recognizes that many additional players in the telecommunications industry will now be privy to personal information similar to what telephone companies can obtain.  for this reason, the Act extends privacy protections to residential consumers and ensures that all "telecommunications carriers" -- rather than simply local phone companies -- are prohibited from utilizing personal consumer information except in narrowly tailored circumstances -- such as to render and bill service -- or with the approval of the user.It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that the existing privacy protections granted to consumers with respect to information gathered by telecommunications carriers are not alone sufficient to protect consumer privacy rights.  Further protections are needed to ensure the privacy rights are retained and respected in cyberspace by other entities doing business there as well.In addition to my work on telecommunications privacy, I also have spent considerable time fighting to maximize the benefits of the information revolution for children.  Last week, I sent a letter to the FCC with the signatures of 220 Members of the House of Representatives -- a majority of the House -- requesting that that agency adopt a minimum standard as part of the Children's Television Act.  This minimum standard would require America's television broadcasters to air at least 3 hours per week of educational and information programming designed for children.In addition, I have advocated establishing "learning links" to schools and libraries.  I believe that the very telecommunications companies to whom so much opportunity has been given in the Telecommunications Act have an obligation to harness a small portion of their economic activity to do something noble and necessary to prepare the next generation of Americans for the fiercely competitive global economy of the future.Thirdly, I fought over a number of years to get the TV industry to adopt the V-chip and finally won its approval as part of the Telecommunications Act.  The V-chip will allow parents -- in a 1st Amendment-friendly way -- to exercise the marketplace option of turning off TV content that they believe is inappropriate for their young daughter or son.Yet, the V-chip will only work because the television industry decided earlier this year that, rather than further opposing the concept and litigating it, they would work with parents to give them the information and tools they needed to make informed decisions.  I think that model is quite instructive in this situation.The issue of children's privacy, and indeed, adult privacy in an electronic environment, must find its ultimate solution in technology, industry action, government oversight or regulation.  Or, some combination of any or all of the above.Without question, the issues posed here today are tremendously complex.  The ever-evolving nature of the Internet does not lend itself to easy solutions.  My colleague, Congressman Bob Franks, has recently introduced legislation to help protect kids from harm and deceptive marketing practices.  I want to commend and congratulate him for his work and I agree 100 percent with the goals of his bill.  It's application, however, to the Internet -- as distinct from other electronic media -- is problematic.Being able to distinguish, for instance, a child from an adult in an online environment is quite difficult.  Determining the age of the user behind the modem is tough to do as well.  Imposing criminal penalties for the distribution or receipt of personal information where the recipient of that information has "reason to believe" that it will be used to abuse a child is a commendable sentiment.  I would note, however, that it is hard to enforce because no standard exists in the bill to ascertain the level of knowledge necessary to meet this requirement.This leaves the citizenry of the Net not knowing their obligations.  Many World Wide Web sites collect information for distributing content electronically and often exchange such "e-mailing lists."  Do they have "reason to believe" when they exchange such lists that this data may end up in the hands of unscrupulous people?Again, how best to protect kids is a complex issue.  How to put teeth into privacy protections is also important to figure out.  What may have worked for privacy protection or parental empowerment in the phone or cable or TV industry may not adequately serve as a model when these technologies converge.  Therefore I believe we must pursue other alternatives.I suggest we step back from all the complexity for a moment and focus instead on the core principles we want to advance.We must recognize that children's privacy is a subset of a parent's privacy rights.  I believe that regardless of the technology that consumers use, their privacy rights and expectations remain a constant.  Whether they are using a phone, a TV clicker, a satellite dish, or modem, every consumer should enjoy a Privacy Bill of Rights for the information age.  These core rights are embodied in a proposal I have advocated for many years and I call it "Knowledge, Notice and No."In short, irrespective of the telecommunications medium consumers use, they should get the following 3 basic rights:1) KNOWLEDGE that information is being collected about them.  This is very important because digital technologies increasingly allow people to electronically glean personal information about users surreptitiously.2)  Adequate and conspicuous NOTICE that any personal information collected is intended by the recipient for reuse for sale.And, 3)  the right of a consumer to say "NO" and to curtail or prohibit such reuse or sale of their personal information.I will introduce legislation before the end of next week that will canvass privacy policies governing the telecommunications universe -- from NYNEX to NETSCAPE -- to figure out whether consumers are able to obtain and exercise these rights.  And secondly, in the case of children, to see whether these rights can be exercised adequately by their parents.We should see if there are technological tools that can empower consumers.  Where they don't exist, or where a particular industry refuses to embrace this code of electronic ethics in a way that solves the problem, then the government is obliged to step in and do something.Pilfering personal information from kids online, under the guise of giving them prizes or letting them play a game, is wrong, just plain wrong.  We must say it is wrong and the industry itself should condemn such practices.  The telecommunications industry is full of talented individuals and they can clearly help to find solutions and thereby limit the need for government action.  For instance, in my congressional district in Massachusetts a company called Microsystems has developed CyberPatrol to help parents better supervise their kids' activities online.  Software that helps establish privacy preferences on the Internet that adequately gives consumers the tools they need to prevent the unwanted dissemination of their personal data is clearly needed.I implore the industry to act swiftly because the current situation is utterly unacceptable.  At risk is consumer confidence in the medium.  When consumer confidence plummets so will economic activity on the Internet.My legislation will establish "Knowledge, Notice, and No" as the goal and will require government action where the technology of the industry fails to protect consumers and kids.I look forward to working with the Commission on finding a solution.  I welcome consumer as well as industry input in further developing my legislative proposal.  And I want to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that we work together in a way that respects the 1st Amendment and the new issues raised by the Internet.Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to come here today to speak today.

The bill does not contain provisions relating to encryption or expanded wiretapping authority. However, the Senate did not vote on the bill before they recessed for the month. The Senate will take up consideration of the bill when Congress returns in September. So while the current version of the bill does not contain the privacy-threatening provisions that were previously discussed, they will likely resurface when the Senate considers the bill. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.

The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer   certain encryption products from the United States Munitions   List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce   Control List administered by the Department of Commerce.    When I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive   Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which sets forth procedures   for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export   license applications, to include the Department of Justice   among the agencies that have the opportunity to review such   applications with respect to encryption products transferred   to Department of Commerce control.    Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate   controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption   products transferred to the Department of Commerce.  Among   other provisions, I determined that the export of encryption   products transferred to Department of Commerce control could   harm national security and foreign policy interests of the   United States even where comparable products are or appear to   be available from foreign sources.  Accordingly, the new order   makes clear that any EAA provision dealing with issuance of   licenses or removal of controls based on foreign availability   considerations shall not apply with respect to export controls   on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this, the   Secretary of Commerce retains the discretion to consider the   foreign availability of comparable encryption products in any   particular case.         	    	      	   	Sincerely,           	    	      	   	WILLIAM J.

Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal   organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here   and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other   countries.  The exportation of encryption products accordingly   must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives,   and promote our national security, including the protection of   the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.  Nonetheless, because of   the increasingly widespread use of encryption products for the   legitimate protection of the privacy of data and communications   in nonmilitary contexts; because of the importance to U.S.   economic interests of the market for encryption products;   and because, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Executive   order entitled Administration of Export Controls on Encryption   Products (the "new Executive order") of November 15, 1996,   Commerce Department controls of the export of such dual-use   encryption products can be accomplished without compromising   U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests,   I have determined at this time not to continue to designate such   encryption products as defense articles on the United States   Munitions List.    Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution   and the laws of the United States, I direct that:    1.  Encryption products that presently are or would be   designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions   List and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to   the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall   be transferred to the Commerce Control List, and regulated   by the Department of Commerce under the authority conferred                                    more         	    	      	   	     	       	    (OVER)                                  2    in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (as continued on   August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996), Executive Order 12981   of December 5, 1995, and the new Executive order except   that encryption products specifically designed, developed,   configured, adapted, or modified for military applications   (including command, control, and intelligence applications),   shall continue to be designated as defense articles, shall   remain on the United States Munitions List, and shall continue   to be controlled under the Arms Export Control Act.  The   transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective upon   the issuance of final regulations (the "Final Regulations")   implementing the safeguards specified in this directive and   in the new Executive order.    2.  The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption   products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be   placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the   Department of Commerce.  The Department of Commerce shall,   to the extent permitted by law, administer the export of such   encryption products, including encryption software, pursuant   to the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export   Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the   regulations thereunder, as continued in effect by Executive   Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (continued on August 15, 1995,   and on August 14, 1996), except as otherwise indicated in or   modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of   December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited   therein.    3.  The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption   products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be   licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls   of both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration   Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations   thereunder, as modified by the new Executive order, Executive   Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders   and laws cited therein, are satisfied.  Consistent with   section 742.1(f) of the current Export Administration   Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure that a license   for such a product will be issued only if an application can   be and is approved under both section 5 and section 6.  The   controls on such products will apply to all destinations.    Except for those products transferred to the Commerce Control   List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations,   exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be   subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof   would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and   national security interests, including the safety of U.S.   citizens.  Consideration shall be given to more liberalized   licensing treatment of each such individual product after   interagency review is completed.  The Final Regulations shall   also effectuate all other specific objectives and directives set   forth in this directive.    4.  Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically   be transformed into object code, and because export of such   source code is controlled because of the code's functional   capacity, rather than because of any "information" such code   might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that   encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption   product, and not as technical data or technology, for export   licensing purposes.    5.  All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding   "de minimis" domestic content of items shall not apply with   respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1   of this memorandum.                                   more                                  3    6.  The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with   section 16(5)(C) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide   that it will constitute an export of encryption source code   or object code software for a person to make such software   available for transfer outside the United States, over radio,   electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications   facilities accessible to persons outside the United States,   including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet   file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the   software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the   unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States.    7.  Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of   State shall continue to have authority to administer the export   of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum   as defense articles designated in Category XIII of the United   States Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.    8.  Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the   administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense,   the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine   whether adequate controls on encryption products can be   maintained under the provisions of the new statute and advise   the Secretary of Commerce of their conclusions as well as any   recommendations for action.  If adequate controls on encryption   products cannot be maintained under a new statute, then such   products shall, where consistent with law, be designated or   redesignated as defense articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1),   to be placed on the United States Munitions List and controlled   pursuant to the terms of the Arms Export Control Act and the   International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  Any disputes   regarding the decision to designate or redesignate shall be   resolved by the President.             	    	      	   	     WILLIAM J.

CLINTON, President of the United States of   America, have decided that the provisions set forth below shall   apply to administration of the export control system maintained   by the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730   et seq. ("the EAR").  Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as   follows:         Section 1.  Treatment of Encryption Products.  In order   to provide for appropriate controls on the export and foreign   dissemination of encryption products, export controls of   encryption products that are or would be, on this date,   designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the   United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States   Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act,   22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the AECA"), but that subsequently are   placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be subject   to the following conditions:  (a)  I have determined that the   export of encryption products described in this section could   harm national security and foreign policy interests even where   comparable products are or appear to be available from sources   outside the United States, and that facts and questions   concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products   cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review   without revealing or implicating classified information that   could harm United States national security and foreign policy   interests.  Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of   the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA"), 50 U.S.C.   App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued   in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and   by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all   other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign   availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such   EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export   controls on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this,   the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may, in his discretion,   consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption   products in determining whether to issue a license in a   particular case or to remove controls on particular products,   but is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or   to remove controls on particular products based on such   consideration;         (b)  Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive   Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows:         (1)  A new section 6 is added to read as follows:    "Sec. 6.  Encryption Products.  In conducting the license   review described in section 1 above, with respect to export   controls of encryption products that are or would be, on   November 15, 1996, designated as defense articles in Category                                    more         	    	      	   	     	       	    (OVER)                                  2    XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the   United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export   Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that subsequently are   placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration   Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and   Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have   the opportunity to review any export license application   submitted to the Department of Commerce.  The Department of   Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a   voting member of the Export Administration Review Board   described in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory   Committee on Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this   order.  The Department of Justice shall be a full member of the   Operating Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of   this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups   reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption   products."         (2)  Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of   December 5, 1995, are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8,   respectively.         (c)  Because the export of encryption software, like the   export of other encryption products described in this section,   must be controlled because of such software's functional   capacity, rather than because of any possible informational   value of such software, such software shall not be considered   or treated as "technology," as that term is defined in   section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR   (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);         (d)  With respect to encryption products described in this   section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the   promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as   may be necessary to control the export of assistance (including   training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same   extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the   AECA, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164;         (e)  Appropriate controls on the export and foreign   dissemination of encryption products described in this section   may include, but are not limited to, measures that promote the   use of strong encryption products and the development of a key   recovery management infrastructure; and         (f)  Regulation of encryption products described in this   section shall be subject to such further conditions as the   President may direct.         Sec. 2.  Effective Date.  The provisions described in   section 1 shall take effect as soon as any encryption products   described in section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List   in the EAR.         Sec. 3.  Judicial Review.  This order is intended only to   improve the internal management of the executive branch and to   ensure the implementation of appropriate controls on the export   and foreign dissemination of encryption products.  It is not   intended to, and does not, create any rights to administrative   or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust   responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable   by a party against the United States, its agencies or   instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other   person.

First, President Clinton has signed an executive order directing the transferof jurisdiction for the export control of commercial encryption productsfrom the State Department to the Commerce Department. Second, PresidentClinton has designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography. "We are moving forward to implement the encryption export liberalizationplan that I announced in October," said Vice President Gore. "Thesetwo actions will help to promote the growth of international electroniccommerce and robust secure global communications in a manner that protectsthe public safety and our national security." On October 1, 1996, Vice President Gore announced an Administration planto make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products -- whetherat home or abroad -- to protect their privacy, intellectual property andother valuable information. The plan comprises a comprehensive set of actionsto promote the development of key recovery products and an encryption keymanagement infrastructure. Specifically, it allows the export of 56-bitkey length encryption products under a general license contingent upon industrycommitments to build and market future products that support key recovery.It also called for transferring jurisdiction for controlling the exportof commercial encryption technology from the State Department to the CommerceDepartment. Key recovery presumes that a trusted party (such as a bank or, in some cases,a party internal to the user's organization) could recover a confidentialitykey to the encrypted data for the user or for law enforcement officialsacting under proper court authority. The Executive Order, "Administration of Export Control on EncryptionProducts," and a Presidential Memorandum on Encryption Export Policy,signed by President Clinton today, directs the transfer of jurisdictionfor the export control of commercial encryption products from the StateDepartment to the Commerce Department. The transfer becomes effective uponpromulgation of regulations by the Commerce Department, expected beforethe end of the year. This action subjects licensing application decisions to strict time linesfor governmental response, while providing for interagency consultationon those decisions. Under the executive order, concerned agencies will havethe opportunity to participate in Commerce Department licensing decisions.No agency will have a veto over decisions to export encryption products.The computer and communications industries have called for the jurisdictiontransfer, and it was recommended in the recent report of the National ResearchCouncil. Vice President Gore also announced today that President Clinton has designatedAmbassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography, with the responsibilityto promote the growth of international electronic commerce and robust, secureglobal communications in a manner that protects the public safety and nationalsecurity. Ambassador Aaron will carry out his responsibilities as Special Envoy whileretaining his position as the United States Permanent Representative tothe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris.As Special Envoy, Ambassador Aaron will promote international cooperation,coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governments on encryption mattersand provide a focal point for identifying and resolving bilateral and multilateralencryption issues. Ambassador Aaron has served in both government and the private sector. Hehas been a member of the boards of several major private sector organizations,and served as Deputy National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter.He has been the Permanent Representative at the OECD since 1993. ## Back.

This approach fails to meet the fundamental privacy needs of computer usersand industry because: *  International communications are still vulnerable since products sold    by the dominant U.S. hardware and software manufacturers must conform    to U.S. export controls.*  Key recovery won't protect privacy internationally and institutionalizes   a global government surveillance mechanism without privacy safeguards.*  U.S. exports are still controlled and uncompetitive making it harder for   the market to develop a secure global encryption standard.The Administration policy, initially announced on October 1st and dubbed "Clipper 3.1.1," leaves Internet users without the technical means to securetheir communications or the international legal standards needed to protecttheir privacy.In other developments this week, Hewlett-Packard and other companies announcedpreliminary approval to export new "dormant encryption" products, whichcontain strong encryption that can only be activated with a special license. While this new architecture is expected to make it easier for industry tomarket encryption products, this technology does not change the underlyingprivacy problems created by the Administration's export control policy.Granting of licenses to use strong encryption will still be subject to thecurrent export controls limiting key length and requiring key recovery forstrong encryption.CONTINUING A DANGEROUS KEY RECOVERY POLICY The Administration's announcements mark the first real steps towards implementing an approach to encryption policy based on the dangerous anduntested idea of global key recovery.  This approach would institutionalizeworldwide governmental access to encrypted communications without providingany privacy standards for electronic communications or stored data.The Administration's approach leaves computer users at risk operating on aglobal network without the technical security provided by strong encryption or the legal privacy rights afforded here in the United States by the FourthAmendment and federal law.  For example, the Administration policy would notsolve the following privacy problems:*  International communications are still vulnerable.  For example, an   American individual doing business with someone in France would still    be forced to use weaker forms of encryption, or use key recovery systems    that make their communications accessible to law enforcement officials of    both countries.*  Key recovery won't protect privacy internationally.  A Chinese dissident    communicating with supporters in the U.S. and fearful of weaker encryption   would be to forced to use key recovery. The Administration indicates that    such key recovery mechanisms would be based on bilateral key-access    arrangements between governments. Even if the dissident�s keys were    recoverable only in the U.S., such a global key access policy would    almost certainly make those keys accessible to the Chinese government. If   the United States expects China to assist U.S. law enforcement with key    recovery for issues of national interest, such as anti-piracy efforts in    China, we can also expect China to require U.S. disclosure of keys to its    law enforcement community.*  Exports are still controlled and uncompetitive.  A Japanese company using   exportable U.S. encryption products would be forced to use lower strength   encryption -- or use an key recovery agent approved by the U.S. law    enforcement community. This is unlikely to help the global market develop   a worldwide standard for secure communications.As a result of this policy, computer users all over the world will be left with a lowest common denominator infrastructure that does not provide foreither technical security or legal privacy for sensitive communications anddata. CDT believes that any workable U.S. encryption policy must be designedto protect the privacy and security of Internet users.------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) DETAILS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERThe Executive Order signed by the President on Friday does not change the type of encryption products that will be exportable. Rather, it lays thegroundwork for the eventual transfer of encryption export control jurisdiction from the State Department to the Commerce Department pendingFinal Regulations by both departments. Encryption exports have traditionally been regulated as "munitions" controlled by the State Department. While the Commerce Department is widelyviewed as more sensitive to the needs of business and individual encryptionusers, Commerce is still constrained by Administration encryption policy. Additional provisions of the Executive Order indicate that the CommerceDepartment's encryption controls will continue to be dominated by lawenforcement and national security interests:*  New Justice Department role in export review committee -- In an unusual    step, the Order adds the Justice Department to the interagency group    reviewing Commerce encryption export decisions.*  Source code treated as a "product" -- The Order specifically singles out    encryption source code to be given the stricter review scrutiny of a    "product" rather than a "technology."*  Broad definition of export -- The export of encryption source code or    object code is extended to explicitly include posting to FTP sites or    electronic bulletin boards unless "adequate" precautions are taken to    prevent transfer abroad. As reflected by a recent Federal Court finding    in the CDA indecency case that Internet users rarely have control over    the parties accessing materials via FTP, Usenet, or the Web, this    provision could have the chilling effect of preventing most    dissemination or discussion of new cryptographic tools on the Internet.The Administration's announcements will have little effect on the existingencryption privacy problem unless the underlying policies governing the export and use of encryption are changed. These announcements do little toaddress the unanswered questions about how privacy will be protected in thekey recovery system envisioned by the Administration.APPOINTMENT OF THE "SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY"On Friday the President also designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as the new "Special Envoy for Cryptography."  According to the White House, thisSpecial Envoy will have "responsibility to promote the growth of electroniccommerce and robust, secure global communications in a manner that protectsthe public safety and national security. . . . Ambassador Aaron will promoteinternational cooperation, coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governmentson encryption matters and provide a focal point for identifying and resolvingbilateral and multilateral encryption issues."  Ambassador Aaron is currentlythe U.S. Ambassador to the OECD.CDT hopes that the new Special Envoy, as a representative of the United States, will work to represent the needs of Americans to communicate privately in the currently insecure global environment.  Until now, U.S.encryption representation abroad has been dominated by law enforcement andnational security interests. CDT hopes that the new Special Envoy will alsoconsult with the computer user community, consumers, privacy advocates, andindustry to promote their need for secure networks worldwide.NEXT STEPSIn the coming months, both the Department of Commerce and the State Department must issue rules to implement the Administration's new encryptionpolicy.*  The State Department will issue a rule transferring its jurisdiction of    encryption licensing  to the Commerce Department. *  The Commerce Department will issue rules spelling out exactly how it will    approve products for export, and what the requirements for approved key    recovery centers and key recovery plans will look like.  CDT hopes and expects that the Administration will provide an opportunity for public comment in the rulemaking process to allow input from thoseconcerned about privacy and security in the formulation of U.S. encryptionpolicy.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

First we agree with the October 4, 1996, New York Times editorial thatcharacterized the Administration's plan as "needlessly restrictiveand probably unworkable" and (though better than previous Administrationproposal) "risks doing more harm than good." We recognize thatthis issue involves a careful balancing of commercial, consumer, law enforcementand national security considerations. However, the well-respected 1996report by the National Research Council on this matter emphasized thatU.S. law enforcement and national security would be enhanced -- not weakened-- by broader use of stronger U.S. encryption technologies both at homeand abroad. Furthermore, the report stressed that efforts to control internationaltrade in encryption technologies will only be effective if implementedon a comprehensive, multilateral basis. Unfortunately, the Administration's most recent encryption initiativeshortchanges both U.S. business and law enforcement interests. The proposalis flawed for four reasons: it fails to recognize that top-down, government-imposedpolicies are doomed to defeat: export policies must be directly linked,or indexed, to advances in technology; export controls must be fully multilateralin order to be effective; and export control decisions will be furtherdelayed by granting the FBI new veto authority over U.S. exports. We fear these defects will continue to leave U.S. companies at a disadvantagein the world market, leave users of U.S. encryption uncertain about thesecurity of their information and leave U.S. law enforcement and nationalsecurity agencies behind the cryptography-curve. Although we were not consulted in the formulation of this policy, wenevertheless hope that in the coming months you will work with us and industry,consumer and user groups to refine it further. In addition to conductingoversight hearing in the next Congress on the Administration's proposal,we also want to assure you that we will continue to pursue legislativesolutions toward this end.

An open letter to the Internet Community from Senator Conrad Burns(R-MT), along with a letter from 20 Republican and Democratic members ofboth the House and Senate sent to Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor onOctober 15, are attached below.The letters cap off an active year in which the Internet community madereal progress towards reforming US encryption policy to promote privacy andsecurity on the Internet. While the Administration continues to promote keyescrow and export controls, a growing segment of Congress has recognizedthe importance of encryption policy reform to the viability of the Internetand the future of privacy in the information age.  This growing bi-partisansupport, along with an increasingly mobilized Net community, has resultedin several significant accomplishments:* Three bills designed to promote privacy and security on the Internet  were introduced in the House and Senate:  - The Burns/Leahy "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act" (S. 1587)  - The Goodlatte/Eshoo "Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE)    Act" (HR 3011), and  - The Burns/Leahy/Pressler "Promotion of Commerce Online in the    Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act" (S. 1726).  The bills, which would have relaxed export controls on encryption  technology and prevented the government from imposing "key-escrow"  schemes domestically, enjoyed broad bi-partisan support.* Congress held four hearings on encryption reform legislation, and  heard testimony from privacy advocates, cryptographers, computer  industry leaders, and others.  These hearings provided a critical  opportunity for the Internet community to make its case on the need  for encryption policy reform.* Through online forums and the first ever cybercasts of Congressional  encryption hearings, the voice of the Internet user community is  finally beginning to be heard in Congress, and is helping to educate  the Congress about the importance of encryption.* The Adopt your Legislator Campaign (http://www.crypto.com/) is linking  Netizens with members of Congress to create a dialogue about the  encryption issue.* Nearly 9000 Netizens have signed the online petition  (http://www.crypto.com/petition) in support of encryption policy  reform.* Leaders from the computer and communications industry joined with  members of Congress, public interest organizations from across the  political specturm, and the Internet community in Stanford California  on July 1 to raise awareness about the need for encryption policy  reform.* Other developments include progress on three ongoing legal challenges tothe encryption export controls, efforts by privacy advocates to impact theencryption debate in the international encryption policies through theOECD, and the long awaited National Research Council Report whichcriticized current US encryption policy as "failing to meet the needs of aninformation age society."Despite these accomplishments, supporters of encryption policy reform stillhave a long way to go. In late October, the Clinton Administrationannounced yet another encryption policy initiative relying on exportcontrols and "key-recovery" systems. As the Administration continues topush its plans to satisfy law enforcement concerns, the Internet communitymust be ready to work hard to protect privacy and security on the Internet.Fortunately, as a result of our efforts this year, we have strong andsupportive allies in Congress.When Congress returns in January, expect a renewed effort to enact seriousencryption policy reform legislation.  With your help, we can ensure thatthe Internet develops into a secure platform for free expression, commerce,and privacy.WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW:Congress and the Administration are now focused on the elections.  Helpraise the voice of the Internet community and educate our elected officialsabout the importance of privacy and security on the Internet.* ADOPT YOUR LEGISLATOR - Join an innovative online campaign designed to  help Netizens create an ongoing dialogue with their elected officials  on critical Internet policy issues like encryption policy reform  http://www.crypto.com/adopt/adopt.cgi?genre=crypto* SIGN THE PETITION - Add your name to the online petition and join the  fight for privacy and security on the Internet.

As you all know by now, the 104th Congress adjourned before it had     a chance to act on S. 1726, the Promotion of Commerce Online in the     Digital  Era Act of 1996.  The bill, which was co-sponsored by     Senators Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott (R-MS), Wyden (D-OR)     and many other Senators from both parties, would have encouraged     the widespread availability of strong, easy to use privacy and     security tools for Internet Users.     Although the Senate was not able to act on Pro-CODE this year, our     efforts have laid the groundwork for real reform of US encryption     policy in the 105th Congress.  And despite significant opposition     from the administration, Netizens had a significant impact on the     Congressional debate on the encryption issue.  I am honored to have     helped to arrange the first ever Cybercasts of Congressional     hearings, and I enjoyed the many online discussions I had with     Netizens.  Together, we have helped to show the Congress that the     Internet user community can and should have a voice in debates over     critical Internet policy issues.     Finally, just days before adjournment, the Administration announced     yet another encryption policy initiative.  The proposal continues     to insist on key escrow as a condition for lifting encryption     export controls, and raises numerous questions about privacy and     competitiveness.     This debate is not over by any stretch of the imagination.  I     intend to move forward on pro-encryption legislation soon after the     105th Congress begins in January.     You can find out more about this issue by visiting my web site     (http://www.senate.gov/~burns). You can also visit the Encryption     Policy Resource Page (http://www.crypto.com/) and the Internet     Policy Coalition page (http://www.privacy.org/ipc/). Set up by     experts to provide resources on the encryption policy debate, these     sites also contain information on how you can get more involved.     Thanks again for all your support. Next year, with your help, we     can reach a commonsense solution to the critical policy crisis on     encryption.     Sincerely,     U. S. Senator Conrad Burns-----------------------------------------------------------------------(3) BI-PARTISAN GROUP OF 21 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT    ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST ENCRYPTION INITIATIVELast week, a bi-partisan group of 21 members from both houses of Congresssent the attached letter to Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor expressingtheir concerns about the Administration's latest encryption policyinitiative (see http://www.cdt.org/crypto for details).The members, many of whom were co-sponsors of the Burns/Leahy Promotion ofCommerce Online in the Digital Era "Pro-CODE" Act (S. 1726) or theGoodlatte/Eshoo Security and Freedom through Encryption "SAFE" Act (HR.3011), called the latest administration effort "flawed" and pledged tocontinue to pursue legislation to reform US encryption policy.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                     Congress of the United States                       Washington, D.C.  20515October 15, 1996The Honorable Michael KantorSecretaryDepartment of CommerceWashington, D.C.  20230Dear Secretary:We write to express our serious concerns about the Administration's mostrecent policy announcement on export restrictions on encryption technology.First we agree with the October 4, 1996, New York Times editorial thatcharacterized the Administration's plan as "needlessly restrictive andprobably unworkable" and (though better than previous Administrationproposal) "risks doing more harm than good."

Zimmermann tothe Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Spaceof the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation26 June 1996Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Philip Zimmermann, and I'm Chairman and Chief Technology Officer for PGP Inc, a newly-formed company that provides cryptographic products.  I'm here to talk to you today about S.1726 and the need to change US export control policy for cryptographic software.  I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here to speak in favor of this bill.I'm the creator of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a public-key encryption software package for the protection of electronic mail.  Since PGP was published domestically as freeware in June of 1991, it has spread organically all over the world, and has since become the de facto worldwide standard for encryption of E-mail, winning numerous industry awards along the way.  For three years I was the target of a criminal investigation by the US Customs Service, who assumed that laws were broken when PGP spread outside the US.  That investigation was closed without indictment in January 1996.Computers were developed in secret back in World War II mainly to break codes.  Ordinary people did not have access to computers, because they were few in number and too expensive.  Some people postulated that there would never be a need for more than half a dozen computers in the country, and assumed that ordinary people would never have a need for computers.  Some of the government's attitude toward cryptography today were formed in that period, and mirrors the old attitudes toward computers.  Why would ordinary people need to have access to good cryptography?In addition to the limited availability of computers, another problem with cryptography in those days was that cryptographic keys had to be distributed over secure channels so that both parties could send encrypted traffic over insecure channels. Governments solved that problem by dispatching key couriers with satchels handcuffed to their wrists.  Governments could afford to send guys like these to their embassies overseas.  But the great masses of ordinary people would never have access to practical cryptography if keys had to be distributed this way.  No matter how cheap and powerful personal computers might someday become, you just can't send the keys electronically without the risk of interception. This widened the feasibility gap between government and personal access to cryptography.Today, we live in a new world that has had two major breakthroughs that have an impact on this state of affairs.  The first is the coming of the personal computer and the information age.  The second breakthrough is public-key cryptography. With the first breakthrough comes cheap ubiquitous personal computers, modems, FAX machines, the Internet, E-mail, the World-Wide Web, digital cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless digital networks, ISDN, cable TV, and the data superhighway.  This information revolution is catalyzing the emergence of a global economy.But this renaissance in electronic digital communication brings with it a disturbing erosion of our privacy.  In the past, if the government wanted to violate the privacy of ordinary citizens, it had to expend a certain amount of effort to intercept and steam open and read paper mail, and listen to and possibly transcribe spoken telephone conversation.  This is analogous to catching fish with a hook and a line, one fish at a time.  Fortunately for freedom and democracy, this kind of labor-intensive monitoring is not practical on a large scale.Today, electronic mail is gradually replacing conventional paper mail, and is soon to be the norm for everyone, not the novelty it is today.  Unlike paper mail, E-mail messages are just too easy to intercept and scan for interesting keywords.  This can be done easily, routinely, automatically, and undetectably on a grand scale. This is analogous to driftnet fishing-- making a quantitative and qualitative Orwellian difference to the health of democracy.The second breakthrough came in the late 1970s, with the mathematics of public key cryptography.  This allows people to communicate securely and conveniently with people they've never met, with no prior exchange of keys over secure channels.  No more special key couriers with black bags.  This, coupled with the trappings of the information age, means the great masses of people can at last use cryptography.  This new technology also provides digital signatures to authenticate transactions and messages, and allows for digital money, with all the implications that has for an electronic digital economy.  (See appendix)This convergence of technology-- cheap ubiquitous PCs, modems, FAX, digital phones, information superhighways, et cetera-- is all part of the information revolution.  Encryption is just simple arithmetic to all this digital hardware.  All these devices will be using encryption.  The rest of the world uses it, and they laugh at the US because we are railing against nature, trying to stop it.  Trying to stop this is like trying to legislate the tides and the weather. It's like the buggy whip manufacturers trying to stop the cars-- even with the NSA and the FBI on their side, it's still impossible.  The information revolution is good for democracy-- good for a free market and trade. It contributed to the fall of the Soviet empire.  They couldn't stop it either.Today, every off-the-shelf multimedia PC can become a secure voice telephone, through the use of freely available software such as PGPfone.  When you combine that with the strong political will that exists in the American people to have their privacy, it's going to require extreme measures to control this technology.  What does this mean for the government's Clipper chip and key escrow systems?Like every new technology, this comes at some cost.  Cars pollute the air and cause traffic jams.  Cryptography can help criminals hide their activities.  People in the law enforcement and intelligence communities are going to look at this only in their own terms.  But even with these costs, we still can't stop this from happening in a free market global economy.  Most people I talk to outside of government feel that the net result of providing privacy will be positive.Law enforcement and intelligence interests in the government have attempted many times to suppress the availability of strong domestic encryption technology.  In 1991, Senate Bill 266 included a non-binding resolution, which if it had become real law, would have forced manufacturers of secure communications equipment to insert special "trap doors" in their products, so that the government could read anyone's encrypted messages.  Before that measure was defeated, I wrote and released Pretty Good Privacy.  I did it because I wanted cryptography to be made available to the American public before it became illegal to use it.  I gave it away for free so that it would achieve wide dispersal, to inoculate the body politic.The 1994 Digital Telephony bill mandated that phone companies install remote wiretapping ports into their central office digital switches, creating a new technology infrastructure for "point-and-click" wiretapping, so that federal agents no longer have to go out and attach alligator clips to phone lines.  Now they'll be able to sit in their headquarters in Washington and listen in to your phone calls.  Of course, the law still requires a court order for a wiretap.  But while technology infrastructures tend to persist for generations, laws and policies can change overnight.  Once a communications infrastructure optimized for surveillance becomes entrenched, a shift in political conditions may lead to abuse of this new-found power.  Political conditions may shift with the election of a new government, or perhaps more abruptly from the bombing of a Federal building.A year after the 1994 Digital Telephony bill passed, the FBI disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap one percent of all phone calls in all major US cities.  This would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped.  In previous years, there were only about 1000 court-ordered wiretaps in the US per year, at the federal, state, and local levels combined.  It's hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1% of all our phone calls, much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time.  The only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all, searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker's voice.  If the government doesn't find the target in the first 1% sample, the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1% until the target is found, or until everyone's phone line has been checked for subversive traffic.  The FBI says they need this capacity to plan for the future.  This plan sparked such outrage that it was defeated in Congress, at least this time around, in 1995.  But the mere fact that the FBI even asked for these broad powers is revealing of their agenda.  And the defeat of this plan isn't so reassuring when you consider that the 1994 Digital Telephony bill was also defeated the first time it was introduced, in 1993.  Advances in technology will not permit the maintenance of the status quo, as far as privacy is concerned.  The status quo is unstable.  If we do nothing, new technologies will give the government new automatic surveillance capabilities that Stalin could never have dreamed of.  The only way to hold the line on privacy in the information age is strong cryptography.  Cryptography strong enough to keep out major governments.The government has a track record that does not inspire confidence that they will never abuse our civil liberties.  The FBI's COINTELPRO program targeted groups that opposed government policies.  They spied on the anti-war movement and the civil rights movement.  They wiretapped Martin Luther King's phone.  Nixon had his enemies list.  And then there was the Watergate mess.  The War on Drugs has given America the world's largest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, a distinction formerly held by South Africa, before we surpassed them during the eighties even when apartheid was in full swing.  Recently, we've seen the images and sounds of the Rodney King beatings, Detective Mark Fuhrman's tapes boasting of police abuses, and the disturbing events of the Ruby Ridge case.  And now Congress and the Clinton administration seem intent on passing laws curtailing our civil liberties on the Internet.  At no time in the past century has public distrust of the government been so broadly distributed across the political spectrum, as it is today.The Clinton Administration seems to be attempting to deploy and entrench a communications infrastructure that would deny the citizenry the ability to protect its privacy.  This is unsettling because in a democracy, it is possible for bad people to occasionally get elected-- sometimes very bad people.  Normally, a well-functioning democracy has ways to remove these people from power.  But the wrong technology infrastructure could allow such a future government to watch every move anyone makes to oppose it.  It could very well be the last government we ever elect.When making public policy decisions about new technologies for the government, I think one should ask oneself which technologies would best strengthen the hand of a police state.  Then, do not allow the government to deploy those technologies.  This is simply a matter of good civic hygiene.In addition to the human rights arguments, there are technological reasons why the current export control regime makes no sense anymore.There has been considerable debate about allowing the export of implementations of the full 56-bit Data Encryption Standard (DES). At an academic cryptography conference in 1993, Michael Wiener of Northern Telecom in Ottawa presented a paper on how to crack the DES with a special machine.  He has fully designed and tested a chip that guesses DES keys at high speed until it finds the right one.  Although he has refrained from building the real chips so far, he can get these chips manufactured for $10.50 each, and can build 57000 of them into a special machine for $1 million that can try every DES key in 7 hours, averaging a solution in 3.5 hours.  $1 million can be hidden in the budget of many companies.  For $10 million, it takes 21 minutes to crack, and for $100 million, just two minutes.  That's full 56-bit DES, cracked in just two minutes.  I'm sure the NSA can do it in seconds, with their budget.  This means that DES is now effectively dead for purposes of serious data security applications. If Congress acts now to enable the export of full DES products, it will be a day late and a dollar short.Knowledge of cryptography is becoming so widespread, that export controls are no longer effective at controlling the spread of this technology.  People everywhere can and do write good cryptographic software, and we import it here but cannot export it, to the detriment of our indigenous software industry.I wrote PGP from information in the open literature, putting it into a convenient package that everyone can use in a desktop or palmtop computer.  Then I gave it away for free, for the good of democracy.  This could have popped up anywhere, and spread.  Other people could have and would have done it.  And are doing it.  Again and again.  All over the planet.  This technology belongs to everybody.PGP has spread like a prairie fire, fanned by countless people who fervently want their privacy restored in the information age.Today, human rights organizations are using PGP to protect their people overseas.  Amnesty International uses it.  The human rights group in the American Association for the Advancement of Science uses it.  It is used to protect witnesses who report human rights abuses in the Balkans, in Burma, in Guatemala, in Tibet.Some Americans don't understand why I should be this concerned about the power of government.  But talking to people in Eastern Europe, you don't have to explain it to them.  They already get it-- and they don't understand why we don't.I want to read you a quote from some E-mail I got in October 1993 from someone in Latvia, on the day that Boris Yeltsin was shelling his Parliament building:  "Phil I wish you to know: let it never be, but if dictatorship takes over Russia your PGP is widespread from Baltic to Far East now and will help democratic people if necessary.  Thanks." Appendix -- How Public-Key Cryptography Works In conventional cryptosystems, such as the US Federal Data Encryption Standard (DES), a single key is used for both encryption and decryption.  This means that a key must be initially transmitted via secure channels so that both parties have it before encrypted messages can be sent over insecure channels.  This may be inconvenient.  If you have a secure channel for exchanging keys, then why do you need cryptography in the first place?In public key cryptosystems, everyone has two related complementary keys, a publicly revealed key and a secret key.  Each key unlocks the code that the other key makes.  Knowing the public key does not help you deduce the corresponding secret key.  The public key can be published and widely disseminated across a communications network. This protocol provides privacy without the need for the same kind of secure channels that a conventional cryptosystem requires.Anyone can use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message to that person, and that recipient uses her own corresponding secret key to decrypt that message.  No one but the recipient can decrypt it, because no one else has access to that secret key.  Not even the person who encrypted the message can decrypt it.  Message authentication is also provided.  The sender's own secret key can be used to encrypt a message, thereby "signing" it.  This creates a digital signature of a message, which the recipient (or anyone else) can check by using the sender's public key to decrypt it.  This proves that the sender was the true originator of the message, and that the message has not been subsequently altered by anyone else, because the sender alone possesses the secret key that made that signature.  Forgery of a signed message is infeasible, and the sender cannot later disavow his signature. These two processes can be combined to provide both privacy and authentication by first signing a message with your own secret key, then encrypting the signed message with the recipient's public key. The recipient reverses these steps by first decrypting the message with her own secret key, then checking the enclosed signature with your public key.  These steps are done automatically by the recipient's software.

Introduction and Overview Good morning, my name is Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Centerfor Democracy and Technology (CDT). The Center is pleased to have this opportunityto testify today. CDT is an independent, non-profit public interest policyorganization in Washington, D.C. The Center's mission is to develop andimplement public policies to protect and advance individual liberties anddemocratic values in new digital communications media. The Center achievesits goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building.CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG),an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, associations,and public interest organizations working on communications privacy issues.In the past, CDT and members of the Working Group have strongly opposedthe Administration's Clipper Chip proposals. A. Overview: Encryption Policy in the Internet Age With the recent Federal court ruling in Philadelphia enjoining the CommunicationsDecency Act, the remaining major legal obstacle to the development of electroniccommerce is outdated U.S. encryption policies. The Administration's cryptographypolicy, based upon a narrow national security perspective that ignores theprivacy needs of individual users, cannot form the sound basis for a securecommunications infrastructure. A cryptography policy without explicit privacyprotections will never gain the trust of users or be embraced by the internationalmarketplace. In the two years since the Senate last held hearings on encryption policy,the looming crisis in privacy and security has become more urgent, yet remainsunresolved: The Internet Perspective -- U.S. encryption policyhas failed to account for the emergence of the Internet as a model for communications: The Internet is not like the telephone system --The Internet encompasses a range of social functions far beyond simple two-wayvoice communication. These broad activities demand a heightened capacityfor users to protect their security and privacy online. The traditionalapproach to wiretapping cannot simply be exported to this new medium. The Internet is a global, decentralized medium --Efforts to impose unilateral national policies -- such as export controlsor key escrow proposals -- are unlikely to be accepted widely. Decentralizeduser choice solutions to privacy problems are preferable to and more effectivethan centralized government mandates. On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance-- Constitutional guarantees offer no protection to U.S. citizens whosecommunications regularly cross national borders. Policies should be designedto protect Americans outside of the shelter of U.S. law. Current encryption policy fails to meet users' needs-- Widely available strong encryption is essential if users are to evertrust their private and sensitive information to the Global InformationInfrastructure (GII). Yet export controls and other policies have kept goodencryption tools out of the hands of everyday users and capped securityat a 40-bit key length that many experts judge to be "inadequate protection."1 Administration encryption policy remains hostage to a law enforcementand national security rationale that is outdated and unsubstantiated-- National security arguments have been undermined by the increasing availabilityof strong encryption outside of the United States. The law enforcement problemposed by encryption is real, but narrowly focused around real-time surveillanceof electronic communications. The massive invasions of privacy and the highcost of the Administration's export controls and key escrow policies cannotbe justified on these narrow and eroding grounds. Congressional action is needed. Encryption policy is the weak link creatinga crisis in electronic commerce and individual privacy. Only Congress isin a position to demand that law enforcement justify its policies. OnlyCongress can act quickly to reverse the policies of the Administration.CDT strongly commends those of you who have supported S.1726, the ProtectingCommerce Online in the Digital Era (PRO-Code) Act of 1996, authored by SenatorBurns, and S.1587, the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996, authoredby Senator Leahy. The Congress should act to immediately liberalize exportcontrols and provide American Internet users with the strong security andprivacy they so badly need. B. Internet User Involvement is Crucial CDT is pleased to be here as part of these important Congressional effortsto address the crisis that exists today in U.S. encryption policy. The Centerwishes to express its thanks to you, Mr. Chairman, to Senator Pressler,Senator Wyden, and the other sponsors of S.1726 for your work in supportof Internet privacy and security, and to Senator Leahy, who has been a long-timesupporter of efforts to ease encryption controls. We are particularly concerned that the voice of Internet users be heardin this forum. We are pleased to have been a part of the Committee's effortsto solicit input from everyday computer users for this hearing, via theWorld Wide Web. We are also pleased to be working with HotWired and Digexto make this the first Senate hearing ever simulcast live over the Internet-- making these proceedings accessible to millions worldwide. We commendthe Committee for reaching out to the growing community of computer userswho care deeply about this issue. II. Communications Privacy in the Age of the Internet: Public PolicyPrinciples For years encryption policy has been driven, substantially unchallenged,by the needs of the national security establishment. With the arrival ofthe personal computer and the Internet, that narrow focus is plainly nolonger acceptable. The policies that may have been appropriate for the Ageof the Mainframe Computer will not meet the needs of individuals and societyin the Age of the Internet. We suggest that any policy that addresses privacyand security on the Internet should do so in light of the following policyprinciples: The Internet is not like the telephone system. The Internet is a global medium: Decentralized user choices are preferableto centralized government mandates. On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance.2 Application of these principles to today's encryption policy logjam leadsto the inescapable conclusion that fundamental change is needed. S.1726has CDT's full support for its effort to move this policy debate beyondthe Cold War-era Mainframe model, into the Age of the Internet. A. The Internet Is Not Like The Telephone System "The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new mediumof worldwide human communication." Court's Findings of Fact, ¶81,ALA v. Dept. of Justice3 If there is one truth that policymakers have learned about the Internetin the last year, it is that the Internet is not just another telephonesystem. Current encryption policy is justified, in part, by law enforcementarguments that they must continue to conduct electronic surveillance inthe same manner as they are able to on the telephone network. But effortsto simplisticly apply assumptions about wiretapping from the telephone systemto the Internet risk grave threats to individual privacy. In a similar vein,congressional attempts in the Communications Decency Act to impose content-basedrestrictions on speech from the phone system onto the Internet have recentlybeen harshly rebuffed by the Federal courts.4 From a constitutional privacy perspective, the single most significant differencebetween the Internet and traditional telephone service is the vast arrayof uses that the Internet currently serves, as well the even larger rangeof new applications bound to come in the future. The Internet is not simplya new-fangled digital telephone. Rather, Internet services will likely facilitatethe following important social functions now or in the near future: wallet first class mail envelope carrier of credit card transaction face-to-face contact with a bank or a merchant public library neighborhood bookstore movie theater doctor's office town square, coffee shop, union hall, political clubhouse, or communitycenter where we discuss politics local art museum romantic night spot for intimate conversations The Internet is much more than simply a means of instantaneous communicationslike telephone conversations, which are short and largely support otheractivities that transpire in the physical world. Instead, the Internet isitself a platform where all of the activities listed above can take place.On the Internet, people do business, engage in politics, conduct intimatelyprivate interactions with health care professionals, participate in culture,and even fall in love. The vast breadth of activities conducted online demandthat individuals have the greatest ability possible to protect their privacyand ensure their security. These activities also demand greater protectionagainst government intrusions on individual privacy, free expression, andfreedom of association. The privacy protections embodied in the U.S. law today are the product ofa long and thorough debate in which the concerns of law enforcement wereaired and carefully weighed against the rights of citizens. Congress shouldnot allow law enforcement concerns to unravel this delicate balance by imposingthe wiretapping paradigm on this new medium without careful deliberation. Case Study: Application of wiretapping to the virtual corporationchallenges Fourth Amendment principles Wiretapping and other electronic surveillance has always been recognizedas an exception to the fundamental Fourth Amendment prohibition againstsecret searches. Even with a valid search warrant, law enforcement agentsmust "knock and announce" their intent to search a premises beforeproceeding. Failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment. Until now, thelaw of search and seizure has made a sharp distinction between, on the onehand, seizures of papers and other items in a person's physical possession,and on the other hand, wiretapping of communications. Seizure of papersor personal effects must be conducted with the owner's knowledge, upon presentationof a search warrant. Only in the exceptional case of wiretapping -- andwith the heightened procedural and substantive requirements that accompanya wiretap request -- may a person's privacy be invaded by law enforcementwithout simultaneously informing that person. In the era where people work for "virtual corporations" and conductpersonal and political lives in "cyberspace," the distinctionbetween communication of information and storage of information is increasinglyvague. The organization in which one works may constitute a single virtualspace, but be physically dispersed. The papers and files of the organizationor individual may be moved within the organization by means of telecommunicationstechnology. Instantaneous access to encryption keys, without prior noticeto the communicating parties, thus present a much broader intrusion. Suchaccess may well constitute a secret search, if the target is a virtual corporationor an individual whose "papers" are physically dispersed. B. The Internet Is A Global Medium: Decentralized User SolutionsAre Preferable To Centralized Government Mandates On of the Internet's great strengths is the ease with which it spans theglobe: information flows as effortlessly from New York to Nairobi as fromWashington, DC to West Virginia. Moreover, a communication from New Yorkto Nairobi might travel through the United Kingdom and four countries oneday, but through France and five other countries the next day. For thisreason, national controls are unlikely to work in a global medium like theInternet. Privacy solutions should not rely on centralized policies andcontrol, but instead should be oriented towards the user and robust enoughto exist in the highly decentralized environment that characterizes theInternet. The rapid pace of Internet development has occurred with some importantgovernment support, but entirely without the interference of the traditionalregulatory process. The flexibility of the Internet community in developingnew solutions to meet user needs has been nothing short of astonishing.Yet the one area in which the innovative energy of the Internet has beenmost stifled has been in the area of security and privacy. Just as we cannotexpect the United States government to have anticipated the architectureof the World Wide Web, so it is foolhardy to expect that the national securityestablishment of the United States can anticipate and provide for the securityneeds of all Internet users. S.1726 properly gets the government out ofthe business of controlling this vital part of the emerging informationinfrastructure. C. On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a Local Ordinance Both data security solutions against private intrusion and privacy protectionsagainst unwarranted government surveillance must be suited to the globalnature of the Net. Good data security demands strong encryption to foilthreats wherever they are in the world. And good data security and privacypolicies must recognize that the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitutionis nothing more than a local law. United States Constitutional protections against unreasonable search andseizure offer little protection to U.S. citizens whose Internet communicationsregularly cross borders. Foreign governments and others can intercept thesemessages without the knowledge of the senders, and beyond the ability ofthe United States government to protect the privacy rights of its citizens.For similar reasons, the key escrow agents called for in recent Administrationpolicy proposals would create an enormous new vulnerability for Internetusers -- both from private data intruders and from governments which maynot have adequate law enforcement safeguards or may not accord the sameprivacy protections to United States citizens. The global nature of the Internet thus demands that users have access tothe highest quality encryption technology. We strongly agree with the manyindividuals, fellow privacy advocates, and industry leaders who praise S.1726'seffort to lift export controls and allow the market to provide the securityand privacy that global Internet users need. III. The Need for Locks and Keys on the GII: Users Need Encryption "On balance, the advantages of more widespread use of cryptographyoutweigh the disadvantages."5 The use of encryption is an inevitable and essential part of life online.As the National Research Council found in its long-awaited encryption WhitePaper, not only do users need encryption, but it is actually in America'snational interest to promote the widespread use of good cryptography.6 A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) isessential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of Information Agesociety. Developing that secure and trusted GII requires strong, flexible,widely-available cryptography. Individuals need to have confidence in theGII to realize the full democratic potential of free association and personalcommunications. Competitive businesses need to protect proprietary informationas it flows across insecure global communications networks. In recent months the public has been made increasingly aware of the dangersof computer crime and the vulnerability of current cryptography implementations.Rapid advances in the speed and sophistication of hardware and softwarehave laid siege to the 40-bit key systems currently approved for export,as well as the popular 56-bit DES algorithm.7If we are to maintain the trust of the public and realize the full potentialof the GII, individual users will need widely available good encryptionto protect themselves online: Individuals need encryption in order to trust the GII with confidentialdata such as financial transactions, medical records, or private communications. Businesses need encryption to provide individuals with privacy protectionand to protect proprietary information as it flows across vulnerable globalnetworks. Moreover, businesses need good encryption to protect the growingstores of personal information that they accumulate about individuals --such as medical, insurance, credit, or financial records.8 Government users need encryption. Government itself needs good encryptionto protect sensitive military, law enforcement, financial, or private citizeninformation.9 America needs encryption to promote national security and prevent crime.The widespread use of strong encryption is widely considered one of ourbest defenses in the battle to protect America's information infrastructurefrom information warfare and other security threats. It is ironic that thevery players within the Administration who should be promoting the use ofencryption to promote national security and prevent crime online are activelyworking to stop it. FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in the Senate thisSpring about the massive losses attributed to industrial espionage in thiscountry, estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. CIA DirectorJohn Deutch has testified just yesterday about the increasing vulnerabilityof our financial, utility, government, and telecommunications informationinfrastructure to "information terrorists" and other bad actors.Yet the lack of strong encryption use today has left computer users vulnerableto the prying eyes of hackers, corporate competitors, and even foreign governments.10 The GII will not fully develop without widely available and strong cryptography.The lack of any international standard for strong cryptography has alreadyhindered the deployment of highly secure systems worldwide. Moreover, nationaland regional governments are increasingly considering regulations on theuse of encryption. Such actions threaten to create a patchwork of internationalregulations which would hinder the deployment of secure global communicationsand leave users without the security and privacy they need. In this context, the sole focus on national security needs embodied in theAdministration's cryptography policies is unlikely to meet the needs ofGII users. By maintaining 40-bit key length restrictions on exports, thesepolicies leaves users hamstrung with insecure systems. By proposing unattractiveinteroperability restrictions and minimal privacy protections for key escrowsystems, these policies discourage the deployment of secure systems in U.S.products. Rather than being seamlessly incorporated into popular products,secure communications will remain out of reach for less sophisticated GIIusers. The resulting loss of security will have a chilling effect on thedevelopment of electronic commerce and the information infrastructure asthe privacy and security needs of users are not met. IV. "Naked To Mine Enemy"11-- The Failure of Administration Encryption Policy:Users' Needs Go Unmet "Current national policy is not adequate to support theinformation security requirements of an information society."12 Current Administration encryption policy has failed to meet the needs ofcomputer users. Export controls and other government policies keep goodencryption out of the hands of users. These policies act to coerce the domesticmarket for encryption. The 40-bit key length encryption available underthese policies is widely viewed by experts as inadequate. Worse, the exportcontrols are intrusive and ineffective at meeting their stated nationalsecurity goals. U.S. encryption policy is in a state of crisis, with usersunable to get the privacy because of unsupportable national security andlaw enforcement rationale. Moreover, the Administration's Clipper Chip andsubsequent policy proposals have barely acknowledged privacy concerns inany meaningful way, and have been greeted with distaste and scorn by themarketplace and the public. Current Administration policy restricts the export of "strong"encryption hardware or software products with keys greater than 40 bitslong (the length of the "keys" indicates the security of a system).Many experts believe that 40 bit security is woefully inadequate.13Export controls actually keep domestic users from getting good encryption.Most U.S. software and hardware companies have been held hostage as they try to make their domestic products interoperable with and subject to thesame restrictions as their exportable products. The result is agovernment policy that hurts American businesses and individuals: It hurts individuals by not allowing them to choosethe encryption systems that best meet their security needs. A recent studyby a panel of renowned cryptographers found that the systems currently exportableunder government policies "offer virtually no protection from brute-forceattacks."14 It hurts U.S. industry by not allowing companies toprovide secure products in the face of strong foreign competitors who arenot restricted by export controls. A recent report by the CEOs of 13 largeAmerican technology companies concluded that the American computer industrycould lose up to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 due to these exportcontrols.15 It doesn't even meet the needs of national security.The Software Publishers Association has documented hundreds of foreign encryptionproducts already widely available abroad. Criminals, terrorists, and foreigngovernments will always have access to good encryption; it is law-abidingcitizens who sacrifice their privacy under current law. Recent Administration proposals would only allow the export of moderatelystronger encryption, and then only with "key escrow" restrictionsto guarantee U.S. government access to individuals' keys -- restrictionswhich are bound to fail in the competitive international marketplace. V. Putting the Administration's Arguments in a Box: Law EnforcementHas Not Made It's Case Law enforcement has been unable to justify massive losses of privacy itproposes in return for minor gains in surveillance capabilities. The lawenforcement problem posed by encryption is real, but narrowly focused aroundreal-time surveillance of electronic communications. The massive invasionof privacy and high cost of the Administration export controls and key escrowcannot be justified by the law enforcement's last, hopeless grasp to expandtheir capabilities is an area where those capabilities are already largelygone. Law enforcement faces a real, but narrowly focused, problem with encryption.The vast majority of encrypted information will be accessible to law enforcementby legal process. Stored information, corporate and business information,and even much electronic communication will be largely available to lawenforcement through similar legal process available today (See Figure 1below): Stored business information -- Stored corporate records and businessinformation, encrypted for security and privacy purposes, represents a largepart of the use of encryption and will be almost completely accessible tolaw enforcement using the same sorts of court orders, warrants, and evensubpoena processes that are available today to access similar unencrypteddata. Stored information by individuals -- Will be similarly available bylegal process, just as it is today. In certain narrow circumstances, accessto encrypted information may be thwarted by assertion of a Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination. Business communications -- Business communications will be largely accessibleto law enforcement. Today, electronic communications almost always becomestored information at one end or the other, and often both, and often asplaintext. (For example, consider the instructive example of the archivedemail in the Bush Administration). Such stored information will be readilyavailable to law enforcement as noted above. Thus, most communications willbe accessible -- As data stored, often in plaintext, by communicating parties and availablevia court order; Through stored decryption keys available via court order; or Through other kinds of authorized surveillance. Individual communications -- Similarly to business communications, thebulk of individual communications will be accessible to law enforcementthrough legal process in some manner. Fifth Amendment privileges for individualsmay protect some of these communications. The remaining problem for law enforcement can be narrowed to the real-timeinterception of communications without any notice to the party under surveillance.While this represents a problem for law enforcement, it is a narrow problem.There are currently only on the order of 1100 wiretaps conducted by lawenforcement in the U.S. each year.16 The widespread use of compression algorithms, a vast array of text, audio,and video applications, and even 40-bit encryption have already made real-timeelectronic interception dramatically more difficult. The widespread useof strong encryption by our more sophisticated national enemies makes manyof those interceptions impossible. The days of a vast positive signals intelligenceoperation are numbered, with or without U.S. export controls. We must findways to help law enforcement and national security to adjust to this newworld, without limiting effective privacy for individuals and businesseson the GII. Moreover, the information economy presents new and powerful tools and opportunitiesfor law enforcement. Online interaction leaves a detailed trail of electronictransactions, credit card purchases, online communications, and Web-basedclickstream data presenting new traffic analysis opportunities. This informationoffers law enforcement unprecedented new tools to obtain evidence of criminalactivity. The balance of power in an online world is tilting further towardslaw enforcement and away from individual liberty. Encryption may representone of the rare opportunities to reclaim individual liberty in the faceof the steady erosion of privacy and individual autonomy brought on by technologyand the Information Age. The federal government is granted the ability to monitor a specific telephoneline. It has never been prospectively guaranteed the ability to interceptall communications of all individuals, and understand them. Wiretap targetshave always been able to use other phones, or speak in unintelligible code.More importantly, the ability to hear a specific phone conversation is notnearly as invasive as the ability to intercept, without notice or consent,the full panoply of life online including health records, financial transactions,online entertainment, intimate letters and conversations. Law enforcementhas been unable to justify this new, unwarranted expansion of surveillancecapabilities sought through the control of encryption technologies.

Remaining problem in real-time interceptions without notice. VI. Conclusion Current U.S. encryption policy fails to recognize the needs of users andthe changes brought on by the Internet Age. The Internet is not like a phonesystem, so the extension of wiretapping authority to the Internet is inappropriate.The Internet is a global medium, so centralized control schemes like currentU.S. encryption policy are likely to be ineffective. And the Internet makesU.S. Constitutional protections a local ordinance, so U.S. encryption policyshould seek to guarantee the privacy and liberty of Americans in their communicationsoutside of the United States. In the current policy standoff between eroding law enforcement argumentsand the emerging and acute privacy and security needs of the InformationAge, Congressional action is needed. Only Congress is in the position todayto change U.S. encryption policy and get Americans the privacy and securitytools they need. The private sector cannot do it. The Administration willnot do it. The courts may do it, but not without a protracted struggle.Congress must act. CDT supports the legislative approaches embodied in S.1726,S.1587, and H.R. 3011. The Congress should act to immediately liberalizeexport controls and provide Americans on the Internet with the strong securityand privacy they so badly need.

MATTHEW BLAZE BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, SUBCOMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SPACE JUNE 26, 1996 Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about the technical impactof encryption policy. It is a privilege to be here, and I hope my perspectivewill be useful to you. Let me begin by describing my own background and biases. I am a PrincipalResearch Scientist in the area of computer security and cryptology at AT&TResearch in Murray Hill, New Jersey. I also hold a number of ancillaryappointments related to computer security; among others, I teach an occasionalgraduate course in the subject at Columbia University, and I serve as co-chairof the Federal Networking Council Advisory Committee subcommittee on securityand privacy (which advises Federal agencies on computer networking issues). However, the views I am presenting here today are my own, and should notbe taken to represent those of any organization with which I happen to beaffiliated. I am a computer scientist by training; my Ph.D. is from the Princeton UniversityComputer Science department, and my primary research areas are cryptology,computer security, and large-scale distributed systems. Much of my researchfocuses on the management of encryption keys in networked computing systemsand understanding the risks of using cryptographic techniques to accomplishsecurity objectives. Recent government initiatives in encryption, such asthe "Clipper Chip," have naturally been of great interest to me,in no small part because of the policy impact they have on the field inwhich I work, but also because they present a number of very interestingtechnical and scientific challenges in their own right. My testimony today focuses on three areas. First, I will discuss the roleand risks of cryptographic techniques for securing the current and futureelectronic world. Next, I will examine in more detail the security implicationsof the limitations imposed on US-based cryptographic systems through thegovernment's export policies. Finally, I will discuss the technical aspectsof the Administration's current approach to cryptography policy, which promotes"key escrow" systems. I. THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF ENCRYPTION The importance of cryptographic techniques for securing modern computerand communications systems is widely recognized today. Evidence of the scopeof this recognition can be found in the increasing number of hardware, software,and system vendors that offer encryption in their products, the increasingdemand for high-quality encryption by users in a widening array of applications,and the growing, thriving community of cryptologic researchers of whichI am a part. It is vital that those who formulate our nation's policiesand official attitude toward encryption understand the nature of the underlyingtechnology and the reasons for its growing importance to our society. The basic function of cryptography is to separate the security of a message'scontent from the security of the medium over which it is carried. For example,we might encrypt a cellular telephone conversation to guard against eavesdroppers(allowing the call to be transmitted safely over easily-intercepted radiofrequencies), or we might use encryption to verify that documents, suchas contracts, have not been tampered with (removing the need to safeguarda copy of the original). The idea that this might be possible is not anew one; history suggests that the desire to protect information is almostas old as the written word itself. Perhaps as a consequence of the inventionof the digital computer, our understanding of the theory and practice ofcryptography has accelerated in recent years, with a number of new techniquesdeveloped and many new applications emerging. Among the most important ofthe recent techniques is "public key cryptography." It allowssecure messages to be exchanged without the need for specific advance arrangementsbetween parties. A related notion is the "digital signature,"which allows messages to be "signed" in a way that verifiablyassociates the signer of a message with its content. Modern cryptographic techniques are based on the application of simple,if repetitive, mathematical functions, and as such lend themselves nicelyto implementation by computer programs. Any information that can be representeddigitally can be protected by encryption, including computer files, electronicmail messages, and even audio and video signals such as telephone calls,radio, and television. Encryption can be performed by means of softwareon general-purpose computers, through special-purpose hardware, or by specialprogramming of microprocessor-based electronic products such as the nextgeneration of cellular telephones. The basic cost of encryption in termsof computational power required is quite low, and the marginal cost of includingencryption in a software-based computer program or a programmable electronicproduct is essentially zero. Why, then, has encryption recently enjoyed so much attention? The reasonscan be found from two perspectives: the technology of modern communicationsystems, and the new purposes for which we are relying on digital information. First, the technology and economics of modern communications and computingsystems strongly favors media that have little inherent security. For example,wireless telephones have great advantages in convenience and functionalitycompared with their familiar wired counterparts and are comprising an increasingproportion of the telephone network. This also makes eavesdropping much easier for curiousneighbors, burglars identifying potential targets, and industrial spiesseeking to misappropriate trade secrets. Similarly, decentralized computernetworks such as the Internet have lower barriers to entry, are much lessexpensive, are more robust and can be used to accomplish a far greater varietyof tasks than the proprietary networks of the past, but, again, at the expenseof intrinsic security. The Internet makes it virtually impossible to restrict,or even predict, the path that a particular message will traverse, and thereis no way to be certain where a message really originated or whether itscontent has been altered along the way. It is possible, even common, forelectronic mail messages to route through the computers of competitors. This is not a result of sloppy design or poor planning on the part of theInternet's architects; on the contrary, these properties are a direct consequenceof the technological advances that make the Internet efficient and usefulin the first place. Second, electronic communication is becoming increasingly critical to thesmooth functioning of our society and our economy and even to protect thesafety of human life. Communication networks and computer media are rapidlyreplacing less efficient, traditional modes of interaction whose securityproperties are far better understood. As teleconferencing replaces face-to-face meetings, electronic mail replacesletters, electronic payment systems replace cash transactions, and on-lineinformation services replace written reference materials, we gain a greatdeal in efficiency, but our assumptions about the reliability of very ordinarytransactions are often dangerously out-of-date. Put another way, the trend in communication and computing networks has beenaway from closed systems in favor of more open ones and the trend in oursociety is to rely on these new systems for increasingly serious purposes. There is every reason to believe that these trends will continue, and evenaccelerate, for the foreseeable future. Cryptography plays an importantand clear role in helping to provide security assurances that at least mirrorwhat we have come to expect from the older, more familiar communicationsmethods of the not-so-distant past. II. KEY LENGTH AND SECURITY The "strength" of an encryption system depends on a number ofvariables, including the mathematical properties of the underlying encryptionfunction, the quality of the implementation, and the number of different"keys" from which the user is able to choose. It is very importantthat a cryptosystem and its implementation be of high quality, since an error or bug in either can expose the data it protectsto unexpected vulnerabilities. Although the mathematics of cryptographyis not completely understood and cipher design is an exceptionally difficultdiscipline (there is as yet no general "theory" for designingcipher functions), there are a number of common cipher systems that have been extensively studied and that are widely trustedas building blocks for secure systems. The implementation of practicalsystems out of these building blocks, too, is a subtle and difficult art,but commercial experience in this area is beginning to lead to good practicesfor adding high-quality encryption systems to software and hardware. Users and developers of secure systems can protectagainst weaknesses in these areas by choosing only cipher functions thathave been carefully studied and by ensuring that their implementation followsgood engineering practices. The most easily quantified variable that contributes to the strength ofan encryption system is the size of the pool of potential values from whichthe cryptographic keys are chosen. Modern ciphers depend on the secrecyof the users' keys, and a system is considered well-designed only if theeasiest "attack" involves trying every possible key, one afterthe other, until the correct one is found. The system is secure only ifthe number of keys is large enough to make such an attack infeasible. Keysare usually specified as a string of "bits," and adding one bitto the key length doubles the number of possible keys. An important question,then, is the minimum key length sufficient to resist a key search attackin practice. Last November, I participated in a study, organized by the Business SoftwareAlliance, aimed at examining the computer technology that might be usedby an "attacker" in order to determine the minimum length keysthat should be used in commercial applications. We followed an unusuallyconservative methodology in that we assumed that the attacker would haveonly available standard "off-the-shelf" technology and is constrainedto purchase in single-unit quantities with no economies of scale. Thatis, our methodology would tend to produce a recommendation for shorter keysthan would an analysis using the more conventional approach of giving thepotential attacker every benefit of the doubt in terms of technologicaladvantages he might enjoy. Nonetheless, we concluded that the key lengthsrecommended in existing U.S. government standards (e.g., the Data EncryptionStandard, with a 56-bit key) for domestic use are far too short and willsoon render data protected under them vulnerable to attack with only modestresources. We concluded that keys today should be a bare minimum of 75bits long, and that systems being fielded today to secure data over thenext twenty years must employ keys of at least 90 bits. I have includeda copy of our report as an appendix to my testimony. Attempting to design systems "at the margins" by using the minimumkey length needed is a dubious enterprise at best. Because even a slightmiscalculation as to the technology and resources available to the potentialattacker can make the difference between a secure system and an insecureone, prudent designers specify keys that are longer than the minimum theyestimate is needed to resist attack, to provide a margin for error. Current U.S. policy encourages the designers of encryption systems to takeexactly the opposite approach. Encryption systems designed for export fromthe United States at present generally must use keys no more than 40 bitslong. Such systems provide essentially no cryptographic security, exceptagainst the most casual "hacker." Examples of 40 bit systems being"broken" through the use of spare computer time on universitycomputer networks are commonplace. Unfortunately, it is not only users outsidethe U.S. who must make do with the inferior security provided by such shortkeys. Because of the difficulty of maintaining multiple versions of software,one for domestic sale and one for export, and the need for common interoperabilitystandards, many US-based products are available only with export-lengthkeys. There is no technical, performance, or economic benefit to employing keysshorter than needed. Unlike, for example, the locks used to protect ourhomes, very secure cryptographic systems with long keys are no more expensiveto produce or any harder to design or use than weaker systems with shorterkeys. The only reason vendors design systems with short keys is to complywith export requirements. The key length figures and analysis in this section are based on so-called"secret key" cryptosystems. For technical reasons, current publickey cryptosystems employ much longer keys than secret key systems to achieveequivalent security (public keys are measured in hundreds or thousands ofbits). However, virtually all systems that use public key cryptographyalso rely on secret key cryptography, and so the overall strength of anysystem is limited by the weakest encryption function and key length in it. III. THE RISKS OF KEY ESCROW A number of recent Administration initiatives have proposed that futurecryptosystems include special "key escrow" provisions to facilitateaccess to encrypted data by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In a such systems, copies of keys are automatically deposited, in advance,with third parties who can use them to arrange for law enforcement accessif required in the future. Several key escrow systems have been proposedby the Administration, differing in the details of how keys are escrowed,and who the third party key holders are. In the first proposal, calledthe "Clipper chip," the system is embedded in a special tamper-resistanthardware-based cryptosystem and copies of keys are held by federal agencies. In the more recent "public key infrastructure" proposal, keysare escrowed at the time a new public key is generated and are held by theorganization (public or private) responsible for certification of the publickey. Although the various key escrow proposals differ in the details of how theyaccomplish their objective, there are a number of very serious fundamentalproblems and risks associated with all of them. There are some appropriate commercial applications of key escrow techniques. A properly designed cryptosystem makes it essentially impossible to recoverencrypted data without the correct key. This can be a double-edge sword;the cost of keeping unauthorized parties out is that if keys are lost orunavailable at the time they are needed, the owner of encrypted data willbe unable to make use of his own information. This problem, of balancingsecrecy with assurances of continued availability, remains an area of activeresearch, and commercial solutions are starting to emerge. The Administration'sinitiatives do not address this problem especially well, however. The first problem with key escrow is the great increase in engineering complexitythat such systems entail. The design and implementation of even the simplestencryption systems is an extraordinarily difficult and delicate process. Very small changes can introduce fatal security flaws that often can beexploited by an attacker. Ordinary (non-escrowed) encryption systems haveconceptually rather simple requirements (for example, the secure transmissionof data between two parties) and yet, because there is no general theoryfor designing them, we still often discover exploitable flaws in fieldedsystems. Key escrow renders even the specification of the problem itselffar more complex, making it virtually impossible to assure that such systemswork as they are intended to. It is possible, even likely, that lurkingin any key escrow system are one or more design weaknesses that allow recoveryof data by unauthorized parties. The commercial and academic world simplydoes not have the tools to analyze or design the complex systems that arisefrom escrow. Key escrow is so difficult that even systems designed by the classifiedworld can have subtle problems that are only discovered later. In 1994I discovered a new type of "protocol failure" in the EscrowedEncryption Standard, the system on which the Clipper chip is based. Thefailure allows, contrary to the design objectives of the system, a rogueuser to circumvent the escrow system in a way that makes the data unrecoverableby the government. Other weaknesses have been discovered since then thatmake it possible, for example, to create incriminating messages that appearto have originated from a particular user. It should be noted that these weaknesses have been discovered in spite ofthe fact that most of the details of the standard are classified and werenot included in the analysis that led to the discovery of the flaws. Butthese problems did not come about because of incompetence on the part ofthe system's designers. Indeed, the U.S. National Security Agency is likelythe most advanced cryptographic enterprise in the world, and is justifiablyentrusted with developing the cryptographic systems that safeguard the government'smost important military and state secrets. The reason the Escrowed EncryptionStandard has flaws that are still being discovered is that key escrow isan extremely difficult technical problem, with requirements unlike anythingpreviously encountered. A second problem with key escrow arises from the difficulty of operatinga key escrow center in a secure manner. According to the Administration(for example, see the May 20, 1996 White House draft report "EnablingPrivacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global InformationInfrastructure"), key escrow centers must be prepared to respond tolaw enforcement requests for escrowed data 24 hours a day, completing transactionswithin two hours of receiving each request. There are thousands of lawenforcement agencies in the United States authorized to perform electronicsurveillance, and the escrow center must be prepared to identify and respondto any of them within this time frame. If the escrow center is also a commercialoperation providing data recovery services, it may also have tens of thousandsof additional private sector customers that it must be prepared to serveand respond to. There are few, if any, secure systems that operate effectivelyon such a scale and under such tightly-constrained response time. The argument,advanced by the Administration, that escrow centers can use the same proceduresthat protect classified data is a curious one, since classified informationis by its nature available to a far smaller and more carefully-controlledpotential audience than are escrowed keys. It is simply inevitable thatescrow centers that meet the government's requirements will make mistakesin giving out the wrong keys from time to time or will be vulnerable tofraudulent key requests. Key escrow, by its nature, makes encrypted dataless secure because the escrow center introduces a new target for attack. A third problem with the Administration's key escrow proposals is that theyfail to distinguish between cryptographic keys for which recovery mightbe required and those for which recoverability is never needed. There aremany different kinds of encryption keys, but for the purposes of discussingkey escrow it is sufficient to divide keys into three categories. The firstincludes keys used to encrypt stored information, which must be availablethroughout the lifetime of the data. The owner of the data has an obviousinterest in ensuring the continued availability of such keys, and mightchoose to rely on a commercial service to store "backup" copiesof them. A second category of key includes those used to encrypt real-timecommunications such as telephone calls. Here, the key has no value to itsowner once the transaction for which it was used has completed. If a keyis lost or destroyed in the middle of a conversation, a new one can be establishedin its place without permanent loss of information. For these keys, theowner has no use for recoverability; it is of value only to law enforcementand others who wish to obtain access to a conversation without the knowledgeor cooperation of the parties. Finally, there are the keys used not forsecrecy but for signature and authentication, to insure that messages indeedoriginated from a particular party. There is never a need for anyone, lawenforcement or the key owner, to recover such keys, since their purposeis not to obscure content but rather to establish authorship. If the ownerlooses a signature key, a new one can be generated easily at any time. Unfortunately, however, the current Administration proposal exposes allthree types of keys equally to the risks introduced by the escrow system,even though recoverability is not required for all of them. Partly thisis because there is no intrinsic difference in the structure of the differenttypes of keys; they are usually indistinguishable from one another outsideof the application in which they are used. Finally, there is the problem that criminals can circumvent almost any escrowsystem to avoid exposure to law enforcement monitoring. All key escrowsystems are vulnerable to so-called "superencryption," in whicha user first encrypts data with an unescrowed key prior to processing itwith the escrowed system. Most escrow systems are also vulnerable to stillother techniques that make it especially easy to render escrowed keys uselessto law enforcement. The ease of avoiding law enforcement when convenientraises an obvious question as to whether the reduced security and high costof setting up an escrow system will yield any appreciable public safetybenefit in practice. IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The wide availability of encryption is vitally important to the future growthof our global information infrastructure. In many cases, encryption offersthe only viable option for securing the rapidly increasing range of human,economic and social activities taking place over emerging communicationnetworks. It is no exaggeration to say that the availability of encryptionin the commercial marketplace is and will continue to be necessary to protectnational security. Unfortunately, current policy, through export controlsand ambiguous standards, discourages, rather than promotes, the use of encryption. Current encryption policy is enormously frustrating to almost everyone workingin the field. Export controls make it difficult to deploy effective cryptographyeven domestically, and we can do little more than watch as our foreign colleaguesand competitors, not constrained by these rules, are matching our expertiseand obtaining an ever-increasing share of the market. A large part of theproblem is that the current regulations were written as if to cover hardwarebut are applied to software, including software in the public domain oraimed at the mass market. The PRO-CODE bill goes a long way toward movingthe regulations in line with the realities of the technology.

Burns said the focus of the hearing is on commerce and business  issues.  He said a second hearing, which will focus on privacy, law  enforcement and national security issues, is scheduled in his  subcommittee on June 26.          The bipartisan Pro-CODE bill would ease export restrictions on  computer security, or "encryption," for software and hardware.  It would  also prohibit mandatory systems in which users or companies would have to  place a code-breaking "key" in the hands of a third party.                                        # # # Back to the Pro-CODE Page Back to the CDT Cryptography Page Back to the CDT Home Page This Page Posted on 06/07/96 | For more Information, write webmaster@cdt.orgWT02-B06-92IA096-001029-B022-305http://www.cdt.org:80/crypto/ITAA_letter.html 205.177.10.31 19970215022510 text/html 6582HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 02:23:50 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html ITAA Letter supporting Pro-CODE Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) Letter in Supportof Pro-CODE Legislation May 16, 1996 The Honorable Robert Dole United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Larry Pressler United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Conrad Burns United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Patrick J. Leahy United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senators Dole, Pressler, Burns and Leahy: On behalf of high-technology companies in the United States, we want torecognize your efforts to ensure that our industry continues to be the globalleader, driving the creation of jobs at a rapid rate here. The explosive growth of the Internet promises great benefits for education,healthcare as well as the ability of U.S. businesses to compete around theworld. It is becoming a significant driver of new jobs in the U.S. economy. But the ability to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality ofthe information that flows over this network of networks is the key to itsgrowth. In particular, we want to thank you for your strong support of legislationdesigned to make certain that U.S. companies are not placed at a disadvantagein selling software globally that allows companies to protect sensitiveand proprietary information that is sent over the Internet, the global network of networks. As original co-sponsors of both the "Promotionof Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996," andthe "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act" you have demonstratedyour commitment to changing the Administration's ill-conceived, "BigBrother" policy which restricts U.S. exports and mandates a "keyescrow" regime. The Administration's policy only allows the use ofgood, effective encryption if the "key" or password is made availableto the government. The legislation you have sponsored recognizes the legitimate needs of nationalsecurity and law enforcement while ensuring that if a level of informationsecurity is generally available, U.S. companies should not be placed ata disadvantage in the international marketplace. Without such changes in policy, the U.S. software industry will lose $60 billion in revenuesand 200,000 jobs in the next four years to foreign competition. Some of you also played a significant role in another significant issuefor the high-technology industry: securities litigation reform. As a resultof Congress overturning the President's ill-considered veto, high-tech companieswill no longer suffer from "legal extortion" whenever a company'sstock price fluctuates. The result will be a more competitive U.S. technologyindustry, translating into U.S. jobs. We look forward to working with you in passing the Internet encryption legislation,and thank you again for your recognition of the significance of our high-technologyindustry for the broad U.S. economy.

In a May 15 letter to the President, the bipartisan groupcalled on the Adminstration instead to "immediately liberalize exportcontrols on non-key escrow encryption programs and products." Thebipartisan group, including Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va), Anna Eshoo (D-Ca),Tom Campbell (R-Ca) and Eliot Engle (D-NY), argued that "the ability ofcompanies and individuals to ensure that the information they send overcommunications and coputer netwroks is secure is a prerequisite toexploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure." Rep. Goodlatte's Press Release about the letter Text of the letter Senators Burns, Dole, Leahy, and Pressler Introduce Legislation to Challenge Clinton Administration's Encryption Export Controls May 2, 1996 In a move to replace the Cold War-era regulations on encryption withpolicies that make sense for the global Internet, Senators Burns (R-MT),Dole (R-KS), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Wyden (D-OR), and others todayintroduced legislation to roll back the restrictions prohibiting the exportof strong encryption technology. This historic legislation promises toinject the debate over privacy and security on the Internet into the 1996presidential campaign. The bill, entitled the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996", is designed to encourage the widespreadavailability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies forthe Internet. It is similar to a bill introduced in March by Senators Leahyand Burns, though the new bill does not contain criminal provisions orprovisions imposing liability for third party key holders.

Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that "source code is speech" and is thus entitled to heightened First Amendment protection. The ruling has important policy implications on the future of cryptography exports and on privacy and electronic commerce. The ruling could also affect the ongoing legislative battle to lift export controls on cryptography.

It would be developedby industry and will be available for both domestic and international use. The framework will permit U.S. industry to take advantage of advances intechnology pioneered in this country, and to compete effectively in therapidly changing international marketplace of communications, computer networks,and software. Retaining U.S. industry's leadership in the global informationtechnology market is of longstanding importance to the Clinton Administration. The framework will ensure that everyone who communicates or stores informationelectronically can protect his or her privacy from prying eyes and earsas well as against theft of, or tampering with, their data. The frameworkis voluntary; any American will remain free to use any encryption systemdomestically. The framework is based on a global key management infrastructure that supportsdigital signatures and confidentiality. Trusted private sector partieswill verify digital signatures and also will hold spare keys to confidentialdata. Those keys could be obtained only by persons or entities that havelost the key to their own encrypted data, or by law enforcement officialsacting under proper authority. It represents a flexible approach to expandingthe use of strong encryption in the private sector. This framework will encourage commerce both here and abroad. It is similarto the approach other countries are taking, and will permit nations to establishan internationally interoperable key management infrastructure with rulesfor access appropriate to each country's needs and consistent with law enforcementagreements. Administration officials are currently working with other nationsto develop the framework for that infrastructure. In the expectation of industry action to develop this framework internationally,and recognizing that this development will take time, the Administrationintends to take action in the near term to facilitate the transition tothe key management infrastructure. The measures the Administration is considering include: Liberalizing export controls for certain commercial encryption products. Developing, in cooperation with industry, performance standards forkey recovery systems and products that will be eligible for general exportlicenses, and technical standards for products the government will purchase. Launching several key recovery pilot projects in cooperation with industryand involving international participation. Transferring export control jurisdiction over encryption products forcommercial use from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce. Administration officials continue to discuss the details of these actionswith experts from the communications equipment, computer hardware and softwareindustries, civil liberties groups and other members of the public, to ensurethat the final proposal balances industry actions towards the proposed framework,short-term liberalization initiatives, and public safety concerns. The Administration does not support the bills pending in Congress that woulddecontrol the export of commercial encryption products because of theirserious negative impact on national security and law enforcement. Immediateexport decontrol by the U.S. could also adversely affect the security interestsof our trading partners and lead them to control imports of U.S. commercialencryption products. A Cabinet Committee continues to address the details of this proposal. The Committee intends to send detailed recommendations to the Presidentby early September, including any recommendations for legislation and ExecutiveOrders. The Committee comprises the Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerceand Treasury; the Attorney General; the Directors of Central Intelligenceand the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and senior representatives fromthe Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, andthe National Economic Council.

Information technology istransforming society, creating new businesses, new jobs and new careers. The technology also creates new opportunities for crime, and new problemsin investigating and prosecuting crime. As a result, electronic information,be it corporate trade secrets, pre-release government crop statistics, ora patient's medical records, must have strong protection from uninvitedmodifications of disclosure. Cryptography enables that protection. The United States is the world leader in information technology. US firmscontinue to dominate the US and global information systems market. Retainingthis leadership is important to our economic security. The Clinton Administration,through its National Information Infrastructure initiative, has long recognizedthat government has an important role as a facilitator and catalyst forthe industry-led transformation of the way we use computer and communicationstechnology to work and live. In particular, government has a strong interest in promoting the legitimateuse of robust encryption to support US international competitiveness, fosterglobal electronic commerce, prevent computer crime, and ensure that theinformation superhighway is a safe place to conduct one's business. Atthe same time, there is a growing recognition, affirmed most recently bythe National Academy of Science that the use of encryption to conceal illegitimateactivities "poses a problem for society as a whole, not just for lawenforcement and national security." In brief, criminals can use encryptionto frustrate legal wiretaps and render useless search warrants for storedelectronic data. We know of no technical solution to the problems thatwould result from the global proliferation of strong cryptography (see box). The implications of this are no small matter. Encrypted computer files have hampered the prosecution of child pornographers. Militia groups advise their members to use encryption to hide illicit weapons,financial, and other criminal activities. Aldrich Ames was instructed byhis Soviet handlers to encrypt computer files that he passed to the Soviets. And international terrorists and drug dealers increasingly use encryptionto prevent law enforcement officials from reading their voice and data transmissions. Grave crimes, such as a plot to shoot down several airliners over Chicago,have been foiled by the use of wiretaps. Had the FBI been unable to readthose transmissions, however, a major tragedy might have ensued. No restrictions apply to the US domestic use of cryptography, and the Administrationhas no plan to seek restrictions. Cryptography has long been controlledfor export for national security reasons, so as to keep it from gettinginto the hands of foreign governments. But is has today become a dual-usetechnology, and international businesses want to use the same security productsboth domestically and abroad. The Administration is thus under strong pressureto provide relief from cryptography export controls. For our cryptography policy to succeed, it must be aligned with commercialmarket forces and operate on an international basis. Further, it shouldpreserve and extend the strong position that US industry enjoys in the globalinformation systems marketplace. Accordingly, the US government is workingwith US industry and our international trading partners on an approach thatwill protect information used in legitimate activities, assure the continuedsafety of Americans from enemies both foreign and domestic, and preservethe ability of the US information systems industry to compete worldwide. Key Management and Recovery A consensus is emerging around the vision of a global cryptography systemthat permits the use of any encryption method the user chooses, with a storedkey to unlock it when necessary. The encryption key would be provided voluntarilyby a computer user to a trusted party who holds it for safe keeping. Thisis what many people do with their house keys -- give them to a trusted neighborwho can produce them when something unexpected goes wrong. Businesses shouldfind this attractive because they do not want to lock up information andthrow away the key or give an employee -- not the company -- control overcompany information. An individual might also use this service to ensurethat she can retrieve information stored years ago. This will require anew infrastructure, consisting of trusted parties who have defined responsibilitiesto key owners. Under law, these trusted emergency key recovery organizationswould also respond in a timely manner to authorized requests from law enforcementofficials who required the key to decode information lawfully obtained orseized from a subject of investigation or prosecution. The Federal government will use key recovery encryption on its own computersbecause it makes good management sense. It would be irresponsible for agenciesto store critical records without key recovery, risking the loss of theinformation for programmatic use and the inability to investigate and prosecutefraud or misuse of the information. A number of US and international companies are working with the US and othergovernments to create a system of trusted parties who are certified to safeguardthe keys. In some cases, organizations might guard their own keys. Inother cases, persons will use the key recovery services provided by thirdparties, one of a suite of services that will include electronic directoriesand electronic "notaries" in support of online commerce. Personswill be free to choose the type and strength of encryption that providethe degree of security they believe appropriate for their use. Taken together,an overall key management infrastructure is needed to make electronic commercepractical on a global scale. Some commercial products and services which provide emergency key recoveryare already available. Testing and refinement is needed before a widespread,robust infrastructure is put in place. The US government is committed tosupporting the development of such a key management infrastructure throughpilots and experimental trials. The State Department is expediting thereview of several export license applications that test commercial key recoveryon an international scale. An interagency working group is identifyingseveral potential governmental uses of commercial cryptography - both internaltransactions and in communications with the public - where key recoverycan be tested. A plan outlining these government tests will be availablein August. The government will be purchasing key recovery products forits own use, and will adopt a Federal standard for evaluating such productsto assure agency purchasers that the key recovery features operate properly. The Department of Commerce will be establishing an industry-led advisorycommittee to make recommendations regarding such a standard this Summer. While we are open to other alternatives, a key recovery system is the onlyapproach we know of that accommodates all public safety interests. Andeven it is imperfect. Some people will not join voluntary systems, preferringto run the risk of losing their keys and being unable to recover their encryptedinformation. Although in some countries (e.g., France) mandatory key escrowingis already in effect, we are pursuing a market-driven approach in part becausewe hope and believe that key recovery will develop as a cost-effective servicein an electronic commerce infrastructure. We are encourage in this effortby recent discussions we have had at the Organization for Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD) that are leading to international cryptography managementprinciples which support key recovery. Export Controls No matter how successful we are in realizing this vision, American usersof computer technology are demanding stronger encryption for internationaluse now. Although we do not control the use of encryption within the US,we do, with some exceptions, limit the export of non-escrowed mass marketencryption to products using a key length of 40 bits. (The length of theencryption key is one way of measuring the strength of an encryption product. Systems using longer keys are harder to decrypt.) US industry assertsthat it is losing overseas sales to its European and Japanese competitorsbecause it cannot include stronger cryptography as a component of its commercialsoftware and hardware products. It warns that loss of a significant shareof the world information systems market would cause serious economic damageto the US economy, and could reduce the US government's ability to influencethe long term future of global cryptography. It also argues that becausecustomers do not want to use one product in the US and a different one overseas,export controls are causing US firms to provide an unsatisfactory levelof protection to their electronic information, making them vulnerable toindustrial espionage by their competitors and foreign governments. While 40 bit encryption products are still strong enough for many uses,the Administration recognizes that some export liberalization may be usefulto build support for a key management regime. Accordingly, we are activelyconsidering measures that would provide limited, temporary relief from cryptographicexport controls in exchange for real, measurable commitments from industry(e.g., investments in products that support key recovery) toward the buildingof a key management infrastructure. The liberalization proposals underdiscussion, which would continue the current one-time review of productsby the National Security Agency, include: permitting products using longerkey lengths to be exported to specific industry sectors such as health careor insurance (similar to current policy for the financial sector); allowingexport of non-escrowed products to a list of trustworthy firms beyond thosesectors, with provisions for monitoring compliance to prevent product diversionto other firms; export of cryptography-ready operating systems; and, mostdramatically, the transfer of jurisdiction over commercial encryption productsfrom the State Department's munitions list to the Commerce Department'slist of dual-use technologies. Our goal is to obtain commitments from industryby the Fall. We must, however, be careful in any relaxation of controls. Other governments'law enforcement and national security needs to access material encryptedwith US products could drive them to erect trade barriers by imposing importcontrols on strong non-escrow encryption products. In addition, we do notwant to do anything that would damage our own national security or publicsafety by spreading unbreakable encryption, especially given the internationalnature of terrorism. Even 40 bit encryption, if widespread and not escrowed,defeats law enforcement. It is for these reasons that we oppose the legislation (S.1726) introducedin this Congress by Senator Burns and co-sponsored by Senator Lott and formerSenator Dole. Although it contains some provisions, such as the transferof export control jurisdiction for commercial cryptography to the CommerceDepartment, with which we could agree if constructed with appropriate safeguards,the bill is unbalanced, and makes no effort to take into account the seriousconsequences of the proliferation it would permit. The importance of the US information technology industry, the security stakes,and increasing Congressional interest make it clear that there is an urgentneed for clear policy and direction. The Administration's proposed approachis broadly consistent with industry suggestions and conclusions reachedby the National Academy of Sciences in its report. That report recognizesthe need to address a complex mix of commercial and security issues in abalanced manner. We agree with that need. We also agree with the report'srecommendation that export controls on encryption products need to be relaxedbut not eliminated, and are actively considering ways of providing shortterm relief. (We do not agree with the report's recommendation that we eliminatemost controls on 56-bit key length products.) Finally, we agree that keyescrow is a promising but not fully tested solution, and are promoting thekinds of testing the report recommends as a way of demonstrating the solution'sviability while providing stronger encryption internationally. We will continue discussion with industry, other members of the privatesector, the Congress, and governments at all levels to arrive at a solutionthat promotes a future of safe computing in a safe society. Cracking Coded Messages We should not underestimate how difficult is to decode encrypted electronicinformation. One approach advanced in the popular debate is to provideour law enforcement officials with more computing power. At first glance,this suggestion seems promising, because in theory any encrypted messagecan be decoded if enough computing cycles are applied. This approach failsfor five reasons: First, it relies on mathematical theory, not operational reality. Digitaltechnology reduces voice, faxes, images, and text in any language to indistinguishable1's and 0's. A great variety of encryption products are also available. Under ideal conditions -- if the type of communication or file, language,and encryption algorithm are known with certainty, and a short key is usedto encrypt the information -- a large, specially-designed computer coulddecode a single message relatively quickly. But State, local, and Federallaw enforcement officials do not operate in the clean confines of a high-techcomputer center. They must first capture the 1's and 0's and discern whatkind of encryption they have encountered. Second, after the decoding problem is isolated, acquiring a machine to decodea message is neither quick, easy or inexpensive. Commercially availablecomputers could not be used because they will not have sufficient capacity. It would, for example, take years for the computers used to process allsocial security claims, payments and earnings years to decode one messageusing the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a widely used system originallydeveloped by the US government that uses a 56-bit key. Third, this approach betrays a misunderstanding of how crimes are prevented. Used only in the most critical cases, legally authorized wiretaps providecrucial information just before a crime is to occur. Thus a near real-timeability to decode messages is needed. Days or weeks are too long to waitto find out that a terrorist attack is about to happen. Fourth, this approach fails to acknowledge the volume of messages that couldneed decoding. Each wiretap results in the collection of thousands of messagesrelevant to the investigative purpose of the wiretap. Even under the mostideal conditions, had these messages been encrypted, the computing resourcesrequired to decrypt them quickly would simply not be available. And thisexample does not include the additional burden of decrypting, if possible,any digital information such as computer disks that are seized as evidenceafter a crime has been committed. Finally, revealing the precise capabilities of law enforcement agenciesto decode messages, as would be necessary in order to present the fruitsof that work as evidence in court, could provide a tutorial to criminalelements bent on eluding law enforcement.

In a written statement issued Friday, the Vice Presidentannounced that the Administration will continue to push for the adoption ofa massive public key infrastructure to enable law enforcement access toencryption communications and continue to rely on cold war-era exportcontrols.[The full text of the announcement is available on CDT's Encryption Policy Issues Page: http://www.cdt.org/crypto/]CDT is disappointed that the Administration's latest statement offered nonew solutions to what is becoming a critical policy issue for the future ofthe Internet and the development of a secure and trusted global informationinfrastructure.Friday's announcement comes amid growing concern from bi-partisan membersof Congress, computer industry leaders, privacy advocates, and the public.Recent calls for changes in current US encryption policy include:* Bipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate designed to relax  US encryption export controls and encourage the widespread  availability of strong, easy to use encryption technologies.* The Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE) Forum, held on July  1st, where members of Congress, computer industry leaders, privacy  advocates and the public discussed the need to reform US encryption  policy.* The recent report by the National Research Council which criticizes  current policy as failing to address the needs of an information age  society.These developments represent a growing consensus among members of Congress,the computer industry, and privacy advocates that current US encryptionpolicy is harming the competitiveness of US industry and endangering theprivacy of computer users. Our understanding of this consensus does notmatch the conclusion the Vice President reaches that: "A consensus isemerging around the vision of a global cryptography system that permits theuse of any encryption method the user chooses, with a stored key to unlockwhen necessary". CDT sees no evidence of broad support for a key escrowapproach.While the Administration seems to acknowledge the importance of encryptionfor privacy and electronic commerce, neither the current policy nor itspredecessors have met the needs which virtually all involved in this debatenow see. Since 1992, the Administration has continued to offer solutionswhich fail to recognize the privacy needs of individual computer users andthe realities of the global economy.  While law enforcement and nationalsecurity considerations are important factors which must be addressed, theAdministration's current proposal, along with Clipper I and Clipper II,continues to put law enforcement and national security concerns above theprivacy and security needs of the American public.SUMMARY OF VICE PRESIDENT GORE'S STATEMENTWhile putting forward an initiative ostensibly designed to make encryptionmore available to computer users, the Administration would do so at a highprice: Individuals would be required to place their most private personalencryption keys in the hands of third parties.Today's statement is essentially a re-statement of the Clipper III proposalreleased in May.  Among other things, the Vice President:*  Called for the liberalization of export controls provided computer   users participate in a "global key management infrastructure"   designed to make personal encryption keys accessible to law   enforcement.*  Reiterated the Administration's opposition to the bipartisan   encryption legislation introduced this Spring in the House and   Senate, which would ease export controls.*  Announced that a Cabinet Committee will send detailed   recommendations regarding implementation of this proposal to the   President by early September.*  Indicated that the Administration "is considering" interim measures   until a key escrow system is in place, including:   -  Liberalizing export controls for certain industries,   -  Developing performance standards for key recovery systems that      will be eligible for export.   -  Launching key recovery pilot projects.   -  Moving jurisdiction over encryption export licenses from      the State Department to the Commerce Department (The Burns/Leahy      Pro-CODE bill contains a similar provision).The full text of the Vice President's Statement, along with the Clipper IIIproposal, the text of the Pro-CODE bill and other legislation, anddetailed background information on the encryption policy debate, isavailable on CDT's encryption policy resource page:   http://www.cdt.org/crypto/CDT believes that a far more sensible approach to encryption is offered bythe bipartisan legislation introduced this Spring to ease export controls,including:  S. 1726, the Pro-Code Act introduced by Senators Burns (R-MT),Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott (R-MS), Wyden (D-OR), Simpson (R-WY),Murray (D-WA), and others; S.1567, authored by Sen. Leahy with many of thesame co-sponsors; and H.R. 3011, introduced by in the House ofRepresentatives by Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA), TomCampbell (R-CA) Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), and a bi-partisan group of over 20others.NEXT STEPSCDT will continue to work with Senators Burns, Leahy, Pressler, Wyden andReps, Eshoo, Goodlatte, and others to encourage the widespread availabilityof strong encryption by pushing for passage of legislation to relax exportcontrols on encryption.  The full Senate Commerce Committee, chaired bySenator Larry Pressler (R-SD), is expected to hold hearings on the Pro-CODEbill during the week of July 22. CDT is working to cybercast that hearinglive on the Internet.

While most of us had hoped the Administration would take somebold steps forward, they have only crept ahead inches.  Considering wherethe Administration has been, I am thankful at least for this very timidmove.The Administration appears ready to sit down at the table and talkto Members of Congress, civil liberties groups and industry aboutlegislation that will ensure the freedom of Americans to use any encryptionsystems domestically, liberalize export controls, transfer jurisdictionover the export of encryption products to the Commerce Department from theState Department, and encourage development by industry--not thegovernment--of strong encryption for commercial use.  These are all keyelements of encryption legislation I have sponsored with Senators Burns,Lott,  Murray, Wyden and others.I remain concerned that the Administration places too much relianceon a system in which individuals must turn over their most private decodingkeys to another party.  But I look forward to working with theAdministration in a bipartisan manner to make sure that progress is madethis Congress.  There is much at stake here for our privacy and oureconomy. We urgently need, as the Vice President acknowledges, a "clearpolicy and direction."

May 30, 1996                                     ***  Good morning.  In this age of telecommunications and lightning-speed  advances in computing, keeping private information private gets tougher  all the time.  Without proper safeguards, personal financial  transactions, medical records, corporate secrets such as bidding  information and proprietary research reports may be compromised by  criminals and corporate spies.  Without proper safeguards, crucial  information systems such as those of the banking system and the public  switched telecommunications network may be vulnerable to intrusion by  terrorists, curious computer hackers, and unfriendly foreign governments.       One of the best ways to protect electronic information is through  encryption, which is the use of mathematical formulas to scramble  information into digital codes.  Once of concern only to spies and the  military, cryptography has now become a vital tool for protecting the  legitimate interests of  the nation's businesses and the privacy of its  citizens.  This change has created a dilemma for the U.S. government  because encryption also can be used in a wide range of illegitimate  activities.  Drug dealers, terrorists, and other criminals can use  cryptography to thwart even legally authorized search and surveillance by  law enforcement officials; foreign governments can encrypt information  that the U.S. needs to protect its national security.  Now the federal  government -- which in the past has sought to restrict the spread of  encryption --  must weigh the pros and cons of promoting broader use of  cryptography.       The National Research Council was asked by Congress to provide  policy makers with guidance in making this assessment. Our study  committee was made up of individuals with expertise in many relevant  fields: technical expertise in computers, communications, and  cryptography; policy experience in law enforcement, intelligence, civil  liberties, national security, diplomacy, and international trade;  business experience in telecommunications and computer hardware and  software, as well as in protecting information in the for-profit and  not-for-profit sectors.  It was formed to examine the appropriate balance  among various national security, law enforcement, business, and privacy  interests.       Our committee's broad conclusion is that the advantages of  cryptography in safeguarding information outweigh the possible  disadvantages of making apprehension and prosecution of criminals more  difficult.  Thus, we believe that federal policies should promote rather  than discourage the use of encryption.  For example, current export  controls impede the use of strong encryption by U.S. firms with foreign  customers and suppliers as well as reducing the availability of strong  encryption domestically. The government needs to make it easier for U.S.  companies operating internationally to use strong encryption, and for  U.S. technology vendors to develop and sell cryptography products both in  this country and abroad.  Indeed, maintaining world leadership for U.S.  information technology vendors is an important contribution to national  security, as well as being important to the economy.       Furthermore, the development of products with encryption should be  driven largely by market forces rather than by government-imposed  requirements or standards.  There are no legal limits on the kinds of  encryption that presently can be sold in the United States and  we  strongly endorse the idea that no law should bar the manufacture, sale,  or use of any form of encryption within the United States.       We do not believe that by adopting such a course the government  would necessarily be choosing the interests of business and individuals  over those of national security and law enforcement.  We say this for two  reasons.  First, availability of encryption technologies will benefit law  enforcement and national security.  Here's how: by making economic  espionage more difficult, cryptography supports law enforcement.  By  protecting elements of the civilian infrastructure such as banking,  telecommunications, and air traffic control networks, cryptography  safeguards national security.       The second reason is that current national policy -- which  discourages the use of cryptography despite its many valuable  applications -- can at most delay encryption's spread.  Already, the use  of such technologies is growing, and in the long run, we believe  widespread non-governmental use of cryptography in the United States and  abroad is inevitable.  The government should recognize this changing  reality and help law enforcement and national security authorities  develop the new technical capabilities they will need to conduct  investigations and surveillance in a world in which information will be  more protected and even unencrypted communications will be harder to  read.       Our report also urges that the government should explore escrowed  encryption rather than the aggressive promotion that is the case today.  Encrypted information is unintelligible to anyone lacking the keys to  unlock the digital code.  In escrowed encryption, the decoding key would  be held by a trusted third-party organization or institution.  This is  attractive to law enforcement agencies because with a court order, they  could obtain the key and unlock even the most unbreakable code.  However,  escrowed encryption is relatively untried and many unresolved issues  remain, ranging from the liability of these third parties to the  magnitude of the risk incurred by companies trusting these third parties  with the keys to their sensitive business plans and trade secrets.       Rather than aggressively promoting escrowed encryption, our  committee believes that the government should explore escrowed encryption  for its own purposes as a way of gaining operational experience with this  technology and making it more useful to the commercial sector.  Even when  that occurs, we say that adoption of escrowed encryption or of any other  specific technology or standard by the commercial sector should be  voluntary and based on business needs, not government pressure.            To make it easier for U.S. companies with foreign customers and  suppliers to protect their information with the best encryption  technologies, the committee believes that export controls should be  progressively relaxed, though not eliminated. Right now federal law makes  it hard to export strong encryption technology.  This helps protect the  government's ability to gather foreign intelligence.  However, it also  makes it more difficult for U.S. technology vendors to produce and sell  cryptography products both here and overseas, and it limits what's  available here because software companies are reluctant to develop  different products for U.S. and foreign markets.       And we call on the executive and legislative branches to develop  national cryptography policy on the basis of open public discussion.  In  the past, government officials have treated many aspects of cryptography  policy as "top secret," to be discussed only behind closed doors.  This  has led to considerable public distrust and resistance, which makes it  impossible to achieve consensus.       In our report we point to a number of specific areas such as  telecommunications and banking where the government should actively  promote the adoption of encryption. For example, the privacy of the  cellular phone and the security of the nation's telecommunications  networks should be enhanced through the use of cryptography.  In the case  of the cellular phone many people have at home, the digital signals sent  between the cell phone and the cell's ground station could be encrypted.  This would prevent eavesdroppers from listening in on conversations.       Overall, we believe that adoption of our recommendations would lead  to enhanced protection and privacy for individuals and businesses in a  many areas, while also bolstering the international competitiveness of  U.S. companies.       My colleagues and I will now entertain questions from the media.  Before asking a question, please step to an aisle microphone and state  your name and affiliation.

ClintonThe White HouseWashington, D.C. 20500Dear Mr. President: We are writing to ask you not to proceed with your Administration's key escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products. Many of us have sponsored H.R. 3011, the "Security and Freedom Though Encryption (SAFE) Act" which would ensure the continuedability of Americans to use and sell good encryption and would permitthe export of generally available software with encryption capabilitiesand other such software and hardware under license when certain conditions are met.  We understand that the Administration has developeda key escrow encryption proposal and is not at this time willing to ease export restrictions on encryption programs and products which are widelyavailable from domestic and foreign companies and the Internet. We share the concerns of a wide range of businesses and privacy intereststhat a key escrow approach will not adequately address security concerns.The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that the information theysend over communications and computer networks is secure is a prerequisiteto exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure.  For example, U.S. small businesses are beginning to harness the Internet to enterforeign markets.  The Internet in effect lowers the barriers to entry for these companies.  But they will not be able to rely on the Internet if their information is not secure. We also have serious concerns about the impact of the Administration's policy on the U.S. economy and job creation.  (Indeed, it is our strong beliefthe U.S. economic interests must be a primary consideration in encryption policy discussions with other countries, the OECD, and in other forums.  It is not clear that this has been the case in the discussions held up to this point). A recent report entitled "A Study of the International Market for Computer Software With Encryption" prepared by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Security Agency indicated that U.S. companies will lose market share given the availability of stronger encryption products overseas.  The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that unless the U.S. relaxes out-of-date export controls, the U.S. technology industry will lose $60 billion in revenues and 200,000 jobs by the year 2000.	 As Congress begins to consider H.R. 3011 we would greatly appreciate knowing whether the Administration plans to publish a final rule implementing a key escrow encryption proposal or, alternatively, will relax export controls on encryption programs and products which do not have a key escrow feature.

We started off by thanking the staff for putting together this wonderful set of hearings.  I would like to thank with equal enthusiasm the participants in these programs, and the audience, for playing a part in such an informed an thoughtful way.     This agency has a history of bringing people together, exchanging views, gathering facts, framing issues.  And I can't think of a more appropriate area to do that in than where the commercial world meets the future.  And that's the way I felt about these two days of hearings.     I am extremely encouraged by the efforts that have already taken place by people who are drafting guidelines, and I share Dan Jaffe's thought that there is some convergence here.  At least there is a convergence in the sense that all participants think this is an important problem that needs to be addressed.     There has been some talk, especially in the last hour or so, about whether voluntary guidelines ever work.  I don't think it's appropriate to go into a project like this with the assumption that voluntary guidelines will not work.     This agency has been burned in the past by groups who suggested voluntary guidelines and then they weren't worth the paper they were written on.  On the other hand, there are other voluntary groups that developed self-regulatory programs that worked very well.  And were supplemented, in some instances, by agency enforcement behind those guidelines.     It's one thing to be skeptical, and to be demanding and rigorous about what the guidelines are.  But I just don't see any -- I don't think it's appropriate to start off with the assumption that they won't work and that we have to have government regulation.     Believe it or not, there are some people who think government regulation doesn't work all that well either.  And in an era in which all of government must do more with less, we cannot afford to ignore the possibility that cooperation and collaboration will lead to the appropriate result.     We will prepare a report on these sessions.  The report will, I hope, reflect all, or most, of the views that were expressed here.  I think that several people have suggested focus groups on some of these subjects, and I gather there is already some interest on the part of independent groups of doing exactly that sort of thing.     There is too much information, too many issues have been explored here to try to digest them at this point, but we will have a report.  And with that report, we will see where we go from there.     I want to thank all of you for your excellent participation in these sessions.     (Whereupon, at 1:12 p.m., the workshop was adjourned.)

Markey Legislation For Immediate Release June 20, 1996 CDT APPLAUDS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) commends Congressman Markey(D-MA) on the introduction of the Communications Privacy and Consumer EmpowermentAct (CPCEA). The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission and the FederalCommunications Commission to ensure that the developing communications infrastructuresupports the core privacy principles of notice and individual control. The FTC is currently examining privacy on the Internet. The CPCEA directsthe FTC and FCC to report their findings to Congress within one year anddirects each to issue rules where they find a lack of privacy protection. Currently few people are aware of the vast amount of personal informationgenerated and captured -- and potentially used and disclosed -- during theuse of interactive communications media. Most individuals visit Web sites,read articles, and examine pictures under the false illusion that theiractivities are anonymous or at least unobserved. In an effort to increasepublic demand for privacy protection, CDT recently launched a privacydemonstration Web site -- http://www.cdt.org.privacy/ -- which greetseach visitor with detailed personal information including their name, emailaddress, computer and browser type and the universal resource locator (URL)indicating the Web site from which they came. While interactive media offers new challenges to privacy, CDT believes thatthe development and implementation of technologies that empower users ofinteractive communications media to affirmatively control personal informationcan fundamentally shift the balance of power between the individual andthose seeking information. CDT believes this technological shift is possibleand necessary, and offers us an unprecedented opportunity to advance individualprivacy. However, this shift will only occur if interactive media is harnessedto advance individual privacy. The CPCEA strongly embodies this approach. It looks to Government as theultimate guarantor of core privacy principles of notice and informed consentregarding personal information collection and dissemination on the informationhighway, but adopts a process which looks to the private sector and consumerand privacy organizations to work together to develop standards, practicesand individual control technologies---such as the Platform for InternetContent Selection (PICS), cyberpatrol, and surfwatch--- to empower peopleto control personal information about themselves during interactions withcommercial and non-commercial entities online. As Jerry Berman, CDT ExecutiveDirector stated, "It is designed to provide strong privacy protection,but avoid centralized, burdensome data board solutions which could cripplethe Internet and threaten free speech rights with the creation of a veritable'Privacy Exon'." "Rather than responding to the very real risks posed by new technologywith the Luddite-call of "smash the machine," we are calling fora reversal of the technological status quo by demanding that technologybe designed to empower people. We are pleased that Congressman Markey recognizesthe unique potential of the Internet to advance individual control overpersonal information," said CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman. CDT hails the introduction of the CPCEA, and believes that if enacted itwill help to spur all content providers and access providers to establishthe important privacy principles of "Knowledge, Notice, and No"as rules of the road for the Digital Age.

ClintonThe White HouseWashington, D.C. 20500Dear Mr. President: We are writing to ask you not to proceed with your Administration's key escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products. Many of us have sponsored H.R. 3011, the "Security and Freedom Though Encryption (SAFE) Act" which would ensure the continuedability of Americans to use and sell good encryption and would permitthe export of generally available software with encryption capabilitiesand other such software and hardware under license when certain conditions are met.  We understand that the Administration has developeda key escrow encryption proposal and is not at this time willing to ease export restrictions on encryption programs and products which are widelyavailable from domestic and foreign companies and the Internet. We share the concerns of a wide range of businesses and privacy intereststhat a key escrow approach will not adequately address security concerns.The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that the information theysend over communications and computer networks is secure is a prerequisiteto exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure.  For example, U.S. small businesses are beginning to harness the Internet to enterforeign markets.  The Internet in effect lowers the barriers to entry for these companies.  But they will not be able to rely on the Internet if their information is not secure. We also have serious concerns about the impact of the Administration's policy on the U.S. economy and job creation.  (Indeed, it is our strong beliefthe U.S. economic interests must be a primary consideration in encryption policy discussions with other countries, the OECD, and in other forums.  It is not clear that this has been the case in the discussions held up to this point). A recent report entitled "A Study of the International Market for Computer Software With Encryption" prepared by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Security Agency indicated that U.S. companies will lose market share given the availability of stronger encryption products overseas.  The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that unless the U.S. relaxes out-of-date export controls, the U.S. technology industry will lose $60 billion in revenues and 200,000 jobs by the year 2000.	 As Congress begins to consider H.R. 3011 we would greatly appreciate knowing whether the Administration plans to publish a final rule implementing a key escrow encryption proposal or, alternatively, will relax export controls on encryption programs and products which do not have a key escrow feature.

This historic legislation promises toinject the debate over privacy and security on the Internet into the 1996presidential campaign.The bill, entitled the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996", is designed to encourage the widespreadavailability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies forthe Internet. It is similar to a bill introduced in March by Senators Leahyand Burns, though the new bill does not contain criminal provisions orprovisions imposing liability for third party key holders.Over 25 public interest organizations, and computer and communicationscompanies, including Microsoft, Netscape, America Online, EFF, VTW, andAmericans for Tax Reform, expressed support for this effort in a lettersent today to the sponsors of the bill.  A list of signatories and excerptsof the letter are included below.Among other things, the "Pro-CODE" would:* Allow the export of "generally available" or "public domain"  encryption software such as PGP and popular World Wide Web browsers  without requiring NSA authority.* Allow the export of encryption hardware and software not available in  the "mass market" or "public domain" under an export scheme that would  allow up to roughly DES-strength (i.e., 56 bit key-length) security.  if a product of similar strength is commercially available from a  foreign supplier* Prohibit the government from imposing mandatory key-escrow encryption  schemes domestically, or from restricting the sale of commercial  encryption products within the United States* Prohibit the Department of Commerce from imposing government designed  standards for encryption technologies (such as Clipper and Clipper  II).For more information, including the text of the bill, analysis, andrelevant background materials, visit CDT's Cryptography Policy Issues Pageat (http://www.cdt.org/crypto/).CDT commends Senators Burns, Dole, Leahy, Wyden, Pressler, and the othersponsors of this proposal for their efforts to bring strong privacy andsecurity technologies into the hands of Internet users, and for creating anopportunity for a national debate on the need to reform US policy towardsencryption. We look forward to working with these and other members ofCongress, the computer and communications industry, public interest groups,and the Internet Community as the bill makes its way through Congress.------------------------------------------------------------------------------* SENATORS TO GO ONLINE TO DISCUSS BILLS, TAKE COMMENTS FROM NETIZENSIn an effort to bring the Internet Community into the debate and encouragemembers of Congress to work with the Net.community on vital Internet policyissues, Senator Burns and Senator Leahy will participate in live, onlinediscussions of the new legislation.

The eventwill bring together industry leaders, members of Congress, encryptionexperts, and others to discuss the need to reform US encryption policy.Similar events, to be held throughout the US and on the Net, are also beingplanned.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) BACKGROUND ON THE ENCRYPTION POLICY DEBATE* Why is this issue important to Internet users?Encryption technologies are the locks and keys of the Information age.Encryption technology allows vital personal and commercial communicationsto travel securely over insecure and inexpensive communications networkslike the Internet.For far too long, the debate over US encryption policy has been dominatedby the NSA, FBI, and Clinton Administration, who continue to insist thatprivacy, security, and the competitive advantage of the US computer andcommunications industry must take a back seat to national security and lawenforcement interests.While encryption products like PGP do allow the most computer-savvy amongus to communicate securely, there are few strong, widely available,easy-to-use encryption applications available to Internet users.  This isdue in part to the Federal regulations which prohibit the export of strongencryption.  As a result of these laws, US companies tend to build only oneversion of an encryption product, with relatively weak encryption, in orderto sell to the global market.  This results in the limited availability ofstrong encryption for domestic Internet users.Worse, the Clinton Administration has attempted to leverage the desire ofUS companies to sell strong encryption overseas to include features inproducts that will allow the Federal Government easy access to the plaintext of encrypted communications.  The Administration has used thestandards promotion power of the National Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST) to serve the narrow interests of the NSA as compared tothe broader interest of Internet users and US businesses.  These"key-escrow" proposals, known as Clipper and Clipper II, have met withstiff resistance from civil libertarians, Internet users, and the UScomputer and communications industries.While legitimate law enforcement and national security issues are importantfactors in this debate, the need for individual privacy and security forpersonal and commercial communications and data is vital to the future ofthe Internet and other interactive communications technologies.  As aresult, the outcome of this policy debate will have tremendous implicationson your privacy and the future of the Internet.------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS ISSUEFor more information on the Encryption Policy Debate, please visit CDT'sencryption policy issues page at http://www.cdt.org/crypto/You can also join CDT, VTW, EFF, EPIC, People for the American Way, WiredMagazine, and others in an online campaign to promote secure communicationsonline.

That issue is partof a larger debate over whether Internet service providers (ISPs) andcommercial online service providers should be charged access fees for theuse of the local telephone network. CDT along with other public interestreprsentatives, telephone companies, ISPs, and commercial online serviceproviders spoke at the forum: CDT's Presentation to the FCC Bandwidth Forum FCC Bandwidth Forum Web Site "Bell Atlantic Calls on FCC to Consider Internet Impact on Telephone Network" - Bell Atlantic web site Internet Access Coalition, an organization of industry groups opposed to the imposition of access charges for the use of local telephone networks. The FCC bandwidth forum comes amidst an FCC inquiry on the current state ofthe Internet infrastructure. Recently, several regional bell companieshave raised concerns that Internet usage is creating significantcongestion problems on their networks, and have suggested access charges asa solution. Online service providers and ISP's argued that the impositionof access charges would harm the future growth of the Net. CDT believes this issue is critically important to the future of theInternet, and is working to ensure that the future Internet infrastructuredevelops in a way that maximizes the democratic potential of the Net andencourages a decentralized, open architecture.

Efforts To Restrict Free Speech Online Support Free Speech On Line Last Update June 18, 1996 Victory in the CDA Case! On Wednesday June 12 at 9:00 am, a panel of three federal judges in Philadelphia, PA granted the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition's (CIEC) request for a preliminary injunction against the Communications Decency Act (CDA). In a unanimous decision, the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on the Internet. The latest information about the Philadelphia court decision and about CIEC: Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition Why WAS this page black? On Thursday Feb 1, 1996, Congress approved legislation to dramatically restrict the First Amendment rights of Internet users. With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally available today in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on World Wide Web sites or usenet newsgroups. With the stroke of President Clinton's pen, this bill transformed the Internet overnight from the freest communications medium to the most heavily regulated medium in the United States. The measure, known as the Communications Decency Act, was part of a massive telecommunications reform bill which President Clinton signed into law Thursday Feb. 8, 1996. In response, The Coalition to Stop Net Censorship asked everyone, everywhere, to turn their World Wide Web pages black to show just how broadly these new restrictions will impact the Internet. The protest was a tremendous success. It received coverage in virtually every story about the President signing the Telecommunications Reform bill in national and regional newspapers, radio programs, and televison such as CNN, Headline News, and ABC news. Over 1500 Web Sites Participated in the Protest, including: Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) Yahoo Netscape SurfWatch Software And many many others. For More Information CDT has organized CIEC - Citizens Internet Empowerment Coaltion, a broad coalition of Internet users, publishers, content providers and access providers filed a lawsuit on February 26, 1996 to challenge these new, unconstitutional content regulations.

The Petition is CLOSED More than 115,000 Signatures were collected in just under 5 months. Thank you to all who signed -- you made a difference! On August 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 420 - 4 to approve the Cox/Wyden Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Amendment to the Telecommunications Reform bill (HR 1555). The Cox/Wyden bill would prevent the FCC from regulating content on the Internet or other interactive media. The House also passed the Klink/Leahy study amendment. The Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act was NOT passed by the House. The House and Senate Telecommunications reform bills are currently being reconciled in a conference committee. No word yet on when the vote on final passage will occur. CDT and other online activist organizations are working to ensure that the Cox/Wyden bill is passed as part of the final telecommunications reform package.

Last Update 10/5/95 Below is the text of the petition Petition to Help Senator Leahy Fight the Communications Decency Act and to Prevent the Federal Government from Regulating Online Speach | Petition Rationale | Status of the CDA | Leahy's Proposal | Another Petition? | Supporting Orgs | More Info | The Petition Statement We the undersigned users of the Internet are strongly opposed to the "Communications Decency Act" (Title IV of S. 652), which is currently pending before the Senate. This legislation will severely restrict our rights to freedom of speech and privacy guaranteed under the constitution. Based on our Nation's longstanding history of protecting freedom of speech, we believe that the Federal Government should have no role in regulating the content of constitutionally protected speech on the Internet. We urge the Senate to halt consideration of the Communications Decency Act and consider in its place S. 714, the "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression In Interactive Media Study Bill", an alternative approach offered by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). PLEASE NOTE: Signatures are no longer being counted. The forms below are displayed for informational/educational purposes only.

Petition Rationale We oppose the "Communications Decency Act", sponsored by Senators James Exon (D-NE) and Slade Gorton (R-WA), for the following reasons: It criminalizes the transmission of constitutionally protected speech, including the private communications between consenting individuals; It would violate privacy rights by protecting system administrators who take steps to ensure that their networks are not being used to transmit prohibited content, even if those steps include reading all messages. It fails to account for the unique characteristics of interactive media, including the tremendous control users have over the content they or their children receive. It would give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction over online speech by giving the FCC authority to establish rules governing the distribution of content online; The Internet and other interactive communications technologies offer a unique opportunity for the free exchange of information and ideas, and embody the very essence of our nation's democratic traditions of openness, diversity and freedom of speech. As users of these technologies, we know perhaps better than anyone that there are other, less restrictive ways to protect children from controversial materials while preserving the First Amendment and the free flow of information. Senator Leahy's bill provides an opportunity to address the issues raised by the Communications Decency Act without restricting the free speech and privacy rights of users.

How Can I Recieve Updates on the Petition Effort? Sign The Petition Status of the CDA -- Senate Vote Expected Soon The Senate is expected to on vote the Communications Decency Act (CDA, a.k.a. the Exon Bill) within the next three weeks. The Communications Decency Act, in its current form, would severely restrict your rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression online, and represents a grave threat to the very nature and existence of the Internet as we know it today. Without your help now, the Communications Decency Act will likely pass and the net may never be the same again. Although the CDA has been revised to limit the liability of online service providers, it would still criminalize the transmission of any content deemed "obscene, lewd, lacivious, filthy, or indecent," including the private communications between consenting adults. Even worse, some conservative pro-censorship groups are working to amend the CDA to make it even more restrictive. Currently, Senator Exon is negotiating with conservative pro-censorship groups and commercial entities that would be affected by the CDA. The voices of Internet users must be heard now. We need to demonstrate that we are a political force to be reckoned with. In an effort to preserve your rights in cyberspace, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has introduced the only legislative alternative to the Communications Decency Act. Senator Leahy is willing to offer his bill as a substitute for the CDA, but needs your support behind his efforts. Senator Leahy's legislation would commission a study to examine the complex issues involved in protecting children from controversial content while preserving the First Amendment, the privacy rights of users, and the free flow of information in cyberspace. Sign the Petition ANOTHER PETITION? Yes. With a strong showing of support from the net.community, Senator Leahy can offer his bill as a substitute for the Communications Decency Act when the Senate votes on the issue later this month. Senator Leahy needs and wants to demonstrate to his colleagues in the Senate that the net.community is behind him in his efforts. We must rise to the task and demonstrate that we will not sit idly by as our rights are threatened. Senator Leahy, a strong civil liberties advocate, has been the Senate's most vocal critic of the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency Act, and has taken a leading role in defending the rights and civil liberties of Internet users. Senator Leahy has taken agreat political risk in representing the interests of Internet users on Capitol Hill. The time has come for us to show our appreciation and our support for his efforts. The previous petition against the Communications Decency Act generated over 108,000 signatures, and was instrumental in Senator Leahy's decision to offer his alternative As the Senate moves to vote on the CDA, we must act quickly to ensure that our collective voice continues to be heard. Sign the Petition WHAT IS LEAHY PROPOSING? Senator Leahy's bill, S. 714, would direct the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce to commence a 5 month study to examine: Current law enforcement authority to prosecute the distribution of pornography over computer networks; Whether any additional law or law enforcement resources are necessary; The availability of technological capabilities, consistent with the First Amendment and the free flow of information in Cyberspace, to protect children from accessing controversial commercial and non-commercial content; Ways to promote the development and deployment of such technologies. After conducting the study, the Justice Department must report to Congress on its findings, and, if necessary, recommend changes in current law. Leahy's bill represents the only substantive legislative alternative to the Communications Decency Act, and will buy important time to have a detailed and rational discussion about the issues involved in protecting children from controversial content, and avoid the rush to censorship which is occurring now on the Senate Floor. Without a strong show of support for Leahy's bill, the Communications Decency Act is very likely to pass.

Prosecution of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Other Violations of Criminal Law in Interactive Media Proceeding Under Current Law As the Internet and other interactive media become more fully integrated into the fabric of our society it is sad, but not surprising, that criminal behavior has begun to appear online. Already cases of consumer fraud and theft of intellectual property have been reported and prosecuted. Traffickers in obscenity and child pornography, too, have begun to use the Internet to facilitate their criminal behavior. Notwithstanding the recent appearance of crime online, cyberspace is not left in a state of anarchy. Federal criminal laws against transportation of obscenity, child pornography, and harassment have all been used successfully to prosecute criminal behavior online. More vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws may be necessary, but law enforcement agencies and some prominent pro-family groups agree current laws already enable prosecutions of online obscenity violations. The Justice Department has repeatedly stated that there are no gaps in current federal criminal laws prohibiting the distribution by computer of obscenity and child pornography. Following this logic, it is unnecessary to amend federal law to prohibit distribution of obscenity by computer, since existing law already criminalizes such conduct, as well as threats made by computer. A. There is no anarchy in cyberspace: Federal and state criminal laws already are used to prosecute criminal conduct in interactive media Tough obscenity, child pornography and harassment laws are already in the federal criminal code. Under existing Federal law trafficking in obscenity (18 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.1462, 1464, 1466), child pornography (18 U.S.C. Sec.2252), harassment (18 U.S.C. Sec.875(c)), illegal solicitation or luring of minors (18 U.S.C. Sec.2423(b)), and threatening to injure someone (18 U.S.C. Sec.875(c)) have already been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer networks. Notwithstanding all of the concern in the popular media and the United States Senate about this issue, all indications are that these and other laws fully cover all serious criminal behavior that may be perpetrated in cyberspace. The Department of Justice and the American Family Association agree that existing laws already criminalize obscenity online. The American Family Association, a prominent pro-family, anti-pornography group lead by a former federal prosecutor from the Reagan and Bush administrations wrote to Chairman Thomas Bliley: "[T]he federal criminal code currently prohibits distribution of both child pornography and obscenity by computer."[1] In a communication to Senator Leahy, the Justice Department agrees with this assessment: "[W]e have applied current law to this emerging problem. . . . The Department's Criminal Division has, indeed, successfully prosecuted violations of federal child pornography and obscenity laws which were perpetrated with computer technology." [2] Thus, while more enforcement resources may or may not be required, no case has been made that any new criminal laws are needed in this area. B. Violations of obscenity, child pornography, and other criminal law online are being prosecuted Even as the Congress rushes to enact new criminal laws, online obscenity and child pornography crimes are being prosecuted around the country under existing law. According to the Justice Department: "The Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section is aggressively investigating and prosecuting the distribution of child pornography and obscenity through computer networks, and the use of computers to locate minors for the purpose of sexual exploitation."[3] To the extent that any obstacles arise, Congress should examine whether there is a need for additional training and resources for enforcement. The Justice Department, the agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting these crimes, sees no urgent need for legislation and instead has urged -- prior to any congressional action -- "in-depth analysis" of the "number of complex legal and policy issues" raised by the need to protect children while respecting the First Amendment and privacy rights of computer users. The precise constitutional parameters, for example, of criminal obscenity laws and the application of community standards doctrine to interactive media are currently being decided by the courts. If Congressional investigation determines that there are actual gaps in current law, it may, then, be appropriate to investigate modernization or clarification of existing law. Ironically, the Communications Decency Act as passed by the United States Senate as part of the telecommunications reform bill, fails to add any protections against online stalking and child solicitation. Everyone is concerned about protecting children from threats online and off. The Senate-passed Communications Decency Act, however, only punishes indecency and obscenity, not stalking or solicitation. It offers no help to prosecutors or police in prevention of prosecution of online crimes against children. Footnotes 1 American Family Association, Letter to Rep.

Public Policy Reflecting Unique Nature of Interactive Media is Essential to Ensure the Potential of the National Information Infrastructure and Protect Children The Internet and other interactive communications media are fundamentally decentralized media. Unlike centralized broadcast radio and television services, there are no central control points through which either a single network operator or government censors can control particular content. On the Internet there are literally millions of speakers and publishers. This proliferation of individual speakers stands in sharp contrast to broadcast television or even cable television, where one may count five, ten or perhaps one hundred speakers, each of whom controls a channel. Federal broadcast content regulators can direct their regulations at the operators of a particular channel in order to enforce their regulations. However, content control on the Internet would have to be targeted at each and every one of the millions of US citizens and international users that speak daily online. Any attempt to impose centralized content control in a bureaucratic manner on this fundamentally decentralized medium is bound to stifle the growth of the medium, squander the democratic potential of the Internet, and may even cut the United States off from the growing global information infrastructure. A. Attempts at "Command and Control" regulation of content online will stifle innovation in interactive media As a decentralized medium, the Internet and other interactive services have flourished in a largely unregulated environment. Indeed, recent Congressional decisions to commercialize the Internet has lead to a tremendous increase in the number of users who have access to the Internet and great innovations such as the World Wide Web. Indeed, the innovative, entrepreneurial Internet marketplace has even produced a variety of software and services that help protect children from inappropriate material online. Imposition of content regulations and extension of Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction over standards and technologies would seriously retard the growth of the Internet marketplace. What's more, FCC content control is unlikely to be effective in protecting children. B. Heavy-handed content regulation will squander the democratic potential of interactive media As the popularity and accessibility of the Internet and commercial online services grows, and as the medium becomes easier to use, the political uses of the net have flourished. Political discourse is facilitated by a variety of different communications techniques possible online, including newsgroups, mailing list discussion groups, chat sessions, and a host of electronic publishing capabilities. Any regulation creating criminal penalties for communication of indecent material would have a substantial chilling effect on all who use interactive media. Such a chilling effect would severely inhibit the growth of the Internet as a political forum. Political groups[1] left,[2] right,[3] and center are using the Internet to communicate, to organize, and to advocate their own views. Advocacy organizations have found World Wide Web services are critical to political education activities, and an increasing number of grass roots and community groups are coming to rely on the Internet to keep in touch with members and constituents. In fact, even some Senators offices are using the World Wide Web to communicate with and solicit feedback from constituents.[4] As a nation we should be encouraging political discourse in this new medium, because of it potential to raise the level of political discussion beyond the sound bite and to involve more citizens in the political process. Encouraging political discourse in interactive media requires that all users are assured that their First Amendment and privacy rights will be respected fully. Indeed, the Internet and other online services are fast becoming a new public forum for political discourse for American citizens. In order to preserve the freedom and openness of this new political arena, it is critical to avoid creating a chilling effect on individual expression.

Parental and User Control Technologies Available Today to Screen Unwanted Content Overview -- Dealing With Inappropriate Material in Cyberspace Through Technology Interactive media such as the Internet and commercial online services such as America Online and Prodigy offer users tremendous control over the information that they and their children receive. Unlike traditional mass media which "assaults" viewers with content, interactive media requires users to seek out information from any number of the millions of available World Wide Web sites, online file archives (ftp, and gopher), and from any of the more than 3000 Usenet newsgroups. The vast majority of the content available on interactive media is related to normal every day topics such as politics, educational resources, sports, consumer information, shopping, to name just a few. In addition, millions of people use the Internet every day to conduct business, socialize, organize political activities, and communicate on issues of interest to them. However, just like in the terrestrial world, there are areas of cyberspace which may contain materials that are not appropriate for children. Preventing children from successfully gaining access to such material is an important issue which must be addressed. However, because cyberspace is a global network with millions of users, active policing of content by governments, besides the obvious implications for free speech and privacy rights, is simply not a practical or effective solution. There is a growing market for applications that empower users and parents to control their children's access to inappropriate materials on the Internet and commercial online services. This document provides an extensive (though by no means exhaustive) overview of some of the technologies currently available. All but two of the tools mentioned here are currently available to consumers across the country. Four categories of technological options are examined here, each provides a slightly different, but equally effective, point of intervention. 1. Commercial Online Services Parental Control Features The Parental Control Feature of three of the most popular commercial online services (America Online, Prodigy, an Compuserve) are illustrated. These features are embedded in the service and are available to all subscribers of these services at no additional charge. 2. Features for the Home PC and Direct Internet Access For families that do not subscribe to one of the commercial online services but instead receive direct access to the Internet, there are a variety of products that run right on the home PC (SurfWatch, NET NANNY, and CYBERsitter). Some of these products are also compatible with and can run in addition to the parental control features available on the commercial services. 3. Applications for Schools and Businesses Schools and corporations can employ server based technologies such as the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack to prevent users from accessing inappropriate content while in the classroom or at the office. 4. Proposals for the Future In addition to these examples of products currently on the market, there is a innovative proposal being offered by Nathaniel Borenstein and Darren New. KidCode, a proposed Internet protocol, is a voluntary rating system that can prevent children from accessing content that may not be appropriate. A. Child Protection in Commercial Online Services Commercial online services such as America Online, Compuserve, and Prodigy offer technologies that allow parents to block their children's access to certain online forums where children might be exposed to inappropriate content. Other services run filtering software which automatically screens messages posted to public forums that contain language inappropriate to children. 1. America Online Parental Control Features America Online (AOL), one of the large commercial online service providers, contains a feature which allows parents to prevent their children from accessing interactive discussion forums (a.k.a. "Chat Rooms"). A small minority of these forums, which are areas provided by America Online and are accessible only to AOL's subscribers, sometimes contain language and other discussion which may not be suitable for children. Parents are empowered to prevent their children from accessing these areas simply by selecting a menu option and entering a password. The block out function cannot be de-activated without the password. America Online also offers parents the ability to block access to Usenet newsgroups based on keywords, subject matter, or specific newsgroups. For example, parents can configure their system to block access to newsgroups containing the word "sex", or can block access to specific news groups such as "alt.sex.binaries.pictures". This mechanism is not exclusive to sexually explicit materials -- the software can be configured to block access to groups based on any keyword. Configuring this system is as simple as clicking a button and describing the keywords or groups to be blocked. Concerned parents, even if they are less computer literate than their childnre, have easy access to these control features. AOL provides telephone help, detailed instructions and advice for parents. There is no additional cost for this service, and, like the other parental control features on AOL, the feature cannot be turned off without a password known only to the parent. Finally, on July 17, 1995, America Online announced that they had entered a partnership with SurfWatch Software (described below). Starting in the fall of 1995 AOL will provide SurfWatch as part of is regular service, preventing children from accessing sites on the Internet known to contain sexually explicit material. SurfWatch will run continuously, unless disabled by the parent, and will provide a further layer of protection for children who use America Online. 2. Prodigy Internet access restrictions Prodigy runs special screening software that monitors messages posted to public bulletin boards and chat rooms on the Prodigy network, and automatically blocks messages which contain language (such as the "seven dirty words"), and other content deemed inappropriate for children. Like all the major commercial online services, Prodigy offers users access to the Internet. Prodigy will not provide customers access to the Internet without the authorization by the head of the household (the principal account holder). The authorization is made at the time of the account setup and requires credit card verification. This additional child protection feature is designed to ensure that parents are aware that their child has access to the Internet where Prodigy cannot control the content. Finally, Prodigy offers parents the ability to monitor which sites their child has visited on the World Wide Web. Each time a site is visited, the Prodigy software records that site in a log which can be displayed at a later time. Parents can keep track of where their children have gone in cyberspace, and can instruct their children not to visit sites which may contain inappropriate materials (based on their own personal values). 3. Compuserve: Internet in a Box for kids Compuserve, another of the large commercial online services, recently announced a partnership with SPRY Inc. (makers of the popular "Internet in a Box") and is currently developing two child protection features: Internet In a Box for Kids, and KidNet. Internet In a Box for Kids contains a program called Crossing Guard, which will allow parents to control their children's access to the by blocking access to sites that may contain inappropriate materials. Crossing Guard will also allow parents to monitor their children's online activities and set timers to control when and how long their children can surf the net. Parents who purchase Internet In a Box for Kids will automatically become subscribers to KidNet, an electronic community designed specifically for kids. The site will allow members to congregate, chat, exchange information, shop, and play interactive games. All content on KidNet will be closely monitored to ensure that it is appropriate for children. The area will also be designed to offer teachers and adults access to educational sites, school networks and other resources for education and information geared to kids. KidNet will also include a home page builder that will allow kids to develop their own Internet resources. The product will begin shipping in the Fall of 1995. Information is currently available at the Compuserve/Spry Home Page: http://www.spry.com B. Parental Empowerment Applications for the Home PC and Direct Internet Access Although many parents subscribe to commercial online services such as those mentioned above, access to the global information highway is not limited to commercial online services. Many parents, educational institutions, and corporations choose to access the directly through an Internet Access Provider. Unlike commercial online services, access providers generally do not provide any of their own content. Because of this, parental control features must be initiated on the Home PC. There are a variety of software developers working on parental control features for this market. Some of these applications can be used in conjunction with commercial online services, over and above the parental control features provided by commercial services, while others are designed specifically for direct access. 1. 'Surf Watch' Surf Watch Software is designed to provide parental control for families who do not subscribe to commercial online services. SurfWatch allows parents to block their children's access to Usenet newsgroups, World Wide Web sites, gopher and file archives (ftp sites) which are known to contain sexually explicit material. When activated with a private password held only by a parent, Surf Watch completely prevents any user from accessing these areas. The program is launched when the computer is started up, and operates when the parent is not present. SurfWatch employs a group of professional "net.surfers" to find out and log sites on the where sexually explicit material is located. Sites are reviewed by a group of concerned parents and educators to determine the nature of the content, and those sites which meet specific criteria are added to a list which is embedded in the program. SurfWatch software resides on the home PC. When activated, the program cross-checks every attempt to access Usenet newsgroups, world wide web, gopher, and ftp sites. Sites which are included on the list are blocked automatically. Because the new sites are constantly appearing on the net, SurfWatch provides a subscription service that automatically updates the list of sites to be blocked, without any intervention required from the user. Subscribers can receive updates as frequently as they choose. Surf Watch Software maintains the list of sites the program will block, and will make custom lists available if requested. SurfWatch will also soon provide users the ability to add an delete sites to their own custom lists SurfWatch is available now for under $50.00. Information on SurfWatch is available on the world wide web: http://www.surfwatch.com/ 2. NET NANNY NET NANNY, developed by Net Nanny Ltd. of Vancouver BC Canada, is designed to prevent children from accessing areas on the Internet that a parent deems inappropriate, prevent children from giving their name, address, telephone number, credit card, or other personal information to strangers via email or chat rooms, and can log off an online service or shut down the computer when the child attempts any of these activities. The program contains a dictionary in which the parent can enter the names of sites known to contain sexually explicit or other[1] material (e.g., the Usenet newsgroup "alt.sex" hierarchy, or the web site http://www.playboy.com). Parents may also enter phrases such as "what's your name?", "what's your phone number", "where do you live", or "are your parents home?". If anyone attempts to ask these questions, NET NANNY will automatically log off the network or shut down the computer. NET NANNY can also be configured to block access to files on the PC's hard drive, floppy drive and CD-ROM, to prevent a child from accessing and altering the parent's financial records, work related files, and programs and files intended only for adults. Finally, the program keeps a log of all activity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents to monitor their children's use of the computer. By using this feature, parents can determine if their children are using the computer to access inappropriate material, and can then augment the Dictionary to prevent further access. NET NANNY is compatible with commercial online services and direct Internet access providers. The program is launched when the computer is started up, and operates when the parent is not present. The program is available for Windows users for $49.95. More information can be found on the World Wide Web: http://www.netnanny.com/netnanny 3. 'CYBERsitter' CYBERsitter, developed by Solid Oak Software in Santa Barbara California, allows parents to monitor their children's computer activity and can prevent a child from downloading image, sound, and video files. It will also prevent children from accessing files on the home PC hard drive such as financial information, business related files, CD-ROM titles, and anything else a parent determines their children should not have access to. The program is launched when the computer is started up, and operates when the parent is not present. CYBERsitter keeps a log of all activity on the computer, including access to the, commercial online services, and local files on the hard drive, CD-ROMs and floppy disks, enabling parents to monitor their children's use of the computer. CYBERsitter is available for $29.95. More information, and a free demonstration version of the product (for Windows) is available on the world wide web: http://www.solidaok.com/~solidoak C. Solutions in the Schools and Businesses -- Server Based Applications In addition to the commercial online services and home access environments, may schools (from K-12 to universities) and corporations are beginning to provide access to the Internet. Many of these organizations are becoming increasingly concerned about the availability of not only sexually explicit materials, but also games, sports information, gambling sites, and other areas which may not be appropriate for access during school and work hours. Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to block specific sites from access by all uses on the network, and to track an monitor use of the Internet. 1. Netscape Proxy Server The Netscape Proxy Server, developed by Netscape Communications Corporation (the developer of the popular World Wide Web browser), allows schools and business to block access to specific sites on the Internet, individual computers (IP addresses) and other information. The Server operates in the background and does not require teachers or employees to have sophisticated programming knowledge or configure any feature. The systems administrator is responsible for operating the server and for maintaining the list of sites to be blocked. The Server can be configured to block access to specified World Wide Web, file archives (ftp), and Gopher sites on the for users on the network on which the server is deployed. In other words, a school or business which runs the Netscape proxy server can prevent students or employees from accessing sites known to contain sexually explicit materials, information about drugs, gambling, sports, games, and anything else determined to be inappropriate for users on the network. 2. WEBTrack WEBTrack, developed by Webster Network Strategies in Naples Florida, allows businesses to block access to certain pre-determined sites on the Internet. The product gives businesses the capability to restrict access to 15 categories of World Wide Web, Gopher, and ftp sites (including sexually explicit material, games, gambling, job search information, drugs, online merchandising, sports, humor, and others), while allowing full access to a wide variety of resources. The product is designed to promote the use of the Internet for business purposes while restricting recreational use. On July 17, 1995, Webster Network Strategies announced that it would provide its software free to K-12 schools, ensuring that all of America's children who access the Internet from the classroom will not be able to stumble upon inappropriate material. WEBTrack also allows corporate systems administrators to monitor employee use of the network in order to determine if an employee is using the to access materials which violate stated corporate policy. WEBTrack is available for most major network servers, and costs approximately $7,500. Updates of the site list are available on a subscription basis for $1,500 per year. D. Future Applications and Protocol Solutions 1. Information Highway Parental Empowerment Group A consortium assembled by Microsoft, Netscape Communications, and Progressive Networks recently announced plans to develop technical standards to enable voluntary rating of a variety of content available through the Internet and other online services. These standards would enable content creators to voluntarily label their own content so that individuals and families can block the material, if they chose. In addition, the Information Highway Parental Empowerment Group (IHPEG) will create standards to allow "third-party" rating of content online. Much as TV Guide rates TV shows on broadcast television, IHPEG would enable multiple third-party rating of content available online. 2. KidCode Among the more innovative of proposals on the drawing boards is KidCode, currently being developed by Nathaniel Borenstein and Darren New. KidCode, a proposal for an Internet protocol designed to block access to sites based on a common voluntary rating system, is in the early stages of development, but would be compatible with all of the parental control applications currently on the market. KidCode is a proposed convention for labeling World Wide Web and other sites on the Internet as containing material which may not be suitable for children. There are an infinite number of possible categories (e.g., sexually explicit material, violent material, drug related material, etc.). Content providers and individuals who create web 'Home Pages' could voluntarily incorporate a standardized KidCode tag in the address of the site. Browser applications would be configured to read these tags and determine if the content on the site is appropriate for the viewing. In addition, KidCode can accommodate third party ratings, age verification, and other factors. Finally, because KidCode is a voluntary rating system that may not be employed by every content provider on the, it can be configured to block access to sites that do not contain KidCode tags. In other words, if a site chooses not to use KidCode, a child using a KidCode enabled program would not be able to access that site regardless of the content it contains. The Borenstein-New KidCode proposal is still in the early stages of development and has not yet been deployed.

Prospects for the future The products described here represent only a fraction of what is currently available to empower parents to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. Moreover, these are only the beginning, as the industry is committed to developing more and better solutions, and the open nature of the Internet provides a wealth of possibilities for parental empowerment tools that may not yet have been imagined. The availability of material on the Internet which may be inappropriate for children is a serious issue and one of `legitimate concern, However, because the Internet is a global network with millions of users, top-down, command and control content restrictions simply cannot effectively control the availability of such materials. The only effective way to protect children from inappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage the continued development and deployment of tools that empower parents to control their children's online activities based on their own individual tastes and preferences. The products descried here provide parents these tools, and can do so without the need for burdensome legislation or government imposed content restrictions. Footnotes 1 NOTE: The list of blocked sites is entirely determined by the parent. The parent can block access to sites that contain any materials they do not wish their children to access, including but not limited to games, drugs, rap music, violence, or guns. A Net Nanny spokesman indicated that pre-programmed lists will be available from the company soon.

Content Restrictions in Interactive Media IV. Censorship of Indecent Communications In Interactive Media Suffers Fundamental Constitutional Infirmity Indecency restrictions have the acknowledged important purpose of protecting minors from access to controversial and inappropriate sexually explicit material. However, such restrictions, especially if imposed on new interactive media, would be subject to serious constitutional challenge. This section of the report will demonstrate five key constitutional points: Censorship of indecent communications prohibited: General bans on indecent material are unconstitutional. Impermissibly intrusive means of achieving legitimate goal: First Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on speech adopt the "least restrictive means" available for achieving a compelling purpose. Due to the availability of programs such as Surf Watch and the parental control features on America Online and other commercial services, blanket indecency restrictions are clearly not the "least restrictive means", and are unconstitutional on their face. Invasion of privacy: By criminalizing the content of private, non-obscene messages, the Senate-passed Communications Decency Act would force an invasion of the realm of private electronic communications and end the individual's ability to control the content of information he or she chooses to access in private. Creation of private censors: Holding service providers criminally-liable for the content of all messages that they carry will force providers to become private censors and prescreen all communications traveling across their system. Most importantly, statist, bureacratic command and control regulation of indecent material online fails to take advantage of the empowering aspects of new interactive media, which can allow parents and other users to exercise control over the information that to which they and their children have access. Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium. First and foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice over the information to which they and their children have access. In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate information. Furthermore, given the heavily fact-based determination required to justify regulation of indecency, legislative findings based on open hearings and a public record are essential before any legislation could pass constitutional muster. Indecency restrictions for interactive media would enshrine in statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media. For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to access the identical information over the Internet. Both the interactive media and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First Amendment free speech rights. Before Congress elects to diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, we believe that careful, public consideration is required. A. General prohibitions against indecent communications are unconstitutional A general prohibition against indecent communications in interactive media would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The principle that each person should decide for him or herself the "ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration and adherence" lies at the heart of the First Amendment. Turner Broadcasting v. FCC, 114 U.S. 2445 (1994) This principle has been interpreted to mean that individuals should be able to speak freely and frankly about issues of their choosing, without fear of reprisal because many people may not agree with or appreciate the nature and content of their messages. At the same time, the Supreme Court has recognized that despite this fundamental guarantee, there are certain kinds of speech that fall into a category of unprotected speech -- obscenity is one such category, indecency is not.[1] Because of the difficulty in defining obscenity in the context of the First Amendment, it took numerous attempts for the Supreme Court to find five justices to agree on defining principles.[2] Finally, in 1973 the Supreme Court in Miller v. California,[3] established the definition of obscenity and the narrow area of sexually explicit speech that is unprotected by the Constitution.[4] Since that time, the definition has not been expanded or changed. By contrast, indecent speech which may include important political views, even if crudely stated, is protected by the First Amendment. As such, government cannot enact a ban on such speech without illustrating a compelling governmental interest, and any restrictions on such speech must be accomplished in the least restrictive manner.[5] B. Restrictions on indecent communications are unconstitutional for failure to adopt least restrictive means 1. Censorship of indecent, but not obscene, communications for the purpose of protecting minors must employ the least restrictive means available to accomplish their goal Indecent communications are protected by the First Amendment, unlike obscenity which is altogether unprotected. Sable Communications of California v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Indecent communications, which do not rise to the level of obscenity, can only be limited in order to serve a compelling state purpose and must be done using the least restrictive means possible. Id. at 125. The Sable court found that the protection of minors from access to indecent material is a compelling state purpose, but that "it is not enough that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Id.6 As a threshold matter, the Sable court found that the constitutional basis for upholding indecency regulations in broadcast media articulated in Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 US 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed. 2d 1073 (1978), were inapplicable in any other media besides over-the-air broadcasting.7 492 U.S. at 127. Pacifica upheld the FCC content regulation based on the dual finding that 1) radio was a "uniquely pervasive medium"8 that intruded (dirty words and all) into peoples homes, and 2) the only way to protect children from exposure to objectionable content was to keep it off the air altogether.9 Sable rejects this finding of "pervasiveness" as "emphatically narrow" and irrelevant to other media such as telephone audiotext services. 492 U.S. at 127 Thus, the Sable "least restrictive means" standard became the test by which all regulations on access to indecent, but constitutional-protected, material were judged. Nearly ten years of litigation along with adjustment of the statute and regulation were required before the current statute was found constitutional under this standard. See Dial Information Services v. Thornburg, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir., 1991)(finding FCC regulations implementing Sec. 223(b) constitutional). During the course of the dispute over the application of Sec. 223 to audiotext services, courts considered and rejected a number of means by which carriers were required to shield minors from access to indecent information. First, time channeling rules, requiring that services only be accessible during hours when children were asleep, were found to violate the First Amendment because they had the effect of denying access to adults as well as children. Carlin Communications v. FCC, 749 F.2d 113, 121 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I). Next, the courts rejected a requirement that carriers provide access to indecent services only once customers entered access codes or passwords, which were to be issued after verification that the customer was over 18. Carlin Communications v. FCC, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1986)(Carlin II). The finding of the Dial court, approving the constitutionality of Sec. 223 and associated regulations depended on the legislative determination that the telephone company blocking of service pending age verification or use of a credit card are the only means to enable parents to restrict their children from access to indecent audiotext services.10 2. Background on dial-a-porn rules: As was the case for broadcast indecency restrictions considered in Pacifica, the dial-a-porn restrictions were only found constitutional because of the uniquely intrusive and uncontrollable nature of the audiotext services. A key legislative motivation for imposing these rules during the 1980s was that indecent information available through audiotext services in the telephone system were openly available to children in such a way that it was difficult for parents to control access by their children. The views of Congressman Bliley recounts the prevailing view of the need for the legislation: "It constitutes an attractive nuisance in every home in America where children are present. There is no completely effective way to prevent children from being exposed to "indecent" or "obscene" dial-a-porn so long as it is lawfully and commercially marketed. . . ." Bliley continues: "Telephones are precisely like radio and television because of their easy accessibility to children and the virtual impossibility for parents to monitor their use . . . . [D]ial-a-porn is presently in the home whether the homeowner wants it or not. Today one cannot have telephone service in the privacy of one's family environment without being required to [have] dial-a-porn with it. Families with children must give up telephone service to be "left alone" from exposure of their children to this intruder."[11] The current statute and Federal Communications Commission regulations promulgated thereunder were found constitutional after nearly ten years of litigation and efforts by Congress and the Commission to bring the statute within constitutionally acceptable bounds. Indecency restrictions applied to interactive media would require a wholesale review of the constitutionality as applied to new media such as online services and the Internet. Interactive media operates in such a different manner, that the constitutional issues must be considered afresh given the new factual backdrop. Mere extension of the current dial-a-porn rules to new media would be found unconstitutional in interactive media given the standards set out by the courts reviewing the Sec. 223 rules as they applied to older telephone technology. 3. Reliance on government censorship to restrict access to indecency fails to take into account the fact that interactive media offers parents a much greater degree of control then broadcast services or 900 number services. Indecency restrictions in interactive media would presumably be motivated by the same goal of protecting minors as the existing statute. However, the means adopted for achieving the goal are impermissible under the First Amendment because they are not the least restrictive means of accomplishing the legitimate government purpose. Interactive media is materially different from analog telephone and audiotext technology in that it offers users the ability to exercise control over precisely what information one accesses. Given the dramatic difference between telephone technology and interactive services such as the Internet and other interactive media, we believe that blocking by the carrier as demanded by Sec. 223 would not meet the "least restrictive means" test. Just as the Sable court found broadcast indecency regulations inapplicable to the telephone system because of differences in the medium, regulations designed for audiotext services in the telephone system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media. Indeed, indecency restrictions on material transport by US Mail have also been struck down by the Supreme Court precisely because "the receipt of mail is far less intrusive and uncontrollable"[12] than broadcast information that was the subject of the Pacifica case. Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude certain types of information from access.[13] With such filtering technology, users, instead of the government or network operators, can exercise control over the information content that they receive in an interactive network environment. User control could be exercised in two ways. First, one could screen out all messages or programs based on information in the header. If a parent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie or from participating in a particular online discussion group, then the computer or other information appliance used by the child could be set by the parent to screen out the objectionable content. Such features can often be protected with passwords which would be assigned, for example, by the responsible adults in the house. Second, the same systems can be used to enable blocking of content based on third-party rating systems. Given the flexibility of interactive technology, we need not rely on just one rating system. In fact, a single rating system or a single set of filters would merely replace a single government censor with a single private censor, with no real gain for the free flow of information. Properly implemented, interactive media can accommodate multiple filtering systems, giving users and parents the opportunity to select and block information based on a true diversity of criteria. The national Parent Teachers Association or different religious organizations could set up rating systems which would be available on the network to those who desired them. Rather than relying on the judgment of the government, or of the service provider, viewers can limit access to content based on the judgment of a group whose values they share. Interactive media can enable individuals and parents to prevent themselves or their children from using their PCs or TVs (in particular, their children) from accessing certain kinds of content. With such control mechanisms within the practical reach of parents, the governmental purpose generally cited for indecency regulations -- the protection of children -- could be accomplished without government content restrictions. In particular, the reasoning of Pacifica (unsought intrusion of the indecent message into homes) and Sable (inability of parents to exercise control) would no longer justify most content regulation in new interactive media. C. Forcing online service providers to become private censors impairs First Amendment values by restricting the free flow of information Holding carriers responsible for the content of all information and communication on their systems is a grave policy error which will restrict the free flow of information and is contrary to First Amendment and presonal privacy values. If service providers are held liable for all of the content on their networks, then they will be forced to attempt to screen all content before it is allowed to enter the system. In many cases, this would simply be impossible. But even where it is possible, such prescreening can severely limit the diversity and free flow of information in the online world. To be sure, some system operators will want to offer services that prescreen content. However, if all systems were forced to do so, the usefulness of digital media as communication and information dissemination systems would be drastically limited. Where possible, we must avoid legal structures that force those who merely carry messages to screen their content. Relying on user control is a real alternative to the draconian approach now being considered and sure to be proposed again and again. A media environment in which parents -- or anyone else who has particular preferences about the content of information to which he or she is exposed -- would give users the control that courts have determined they lack in the mass media, without involving the government in content control which we believe would not survive appropriate First Amendment scrutiny in this new medium. D. Banning private, sexually-explicit communications violates constitutional privacy rights Regulation of private, indecent communications between individuals raises constitutional privacy concerns. The Supreme Court has made clear that absolute restrictions on indecency cannot pass constitutional muster under the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of personal privacy. Though the Court has explicitly recognized that while the government may have an interest in protecting in public, Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973) or in a place that caters to the public, Schad v. Mt Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 (1981); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972). it does not have a right to ban information maintained in private. Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969). "If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch." Id. at 598. If enacted, the Senate-passed Communications Decency Act would empower federal authorities to intrude on the private communications and information used by individuals, in clear violation of Stanley. As reflected in passage of the Video Privacy and Library Protection Act of 1988 (protecting records of video rentals), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 (18 U.S.C Sec. 2510), Congress has long recognized the privacy interest in information that we read and otherwise use. A number of surveys have confirmed that Americans care deeply about their privacy. In a 1983 analysis of their survey results, Louis Harris & Associates concluded: Particularly striking is the pervasiveness of support for tough new [privacy protection] ground rules governing computers and other information technology . . . . This support permeates all subgroups in society and represents a mandate for initiatives in public policy. (L. Harris, The Road after 1984: A Nationwide Survey of the Public and its Leader on the New Technology and its Consequences for American Life, December, 1983). Enforcement of indecency restrictions by online service providers would require that online service providers violate the privacy rights, and statutory protections established by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, in order to assure that criminal violations do not occur. ECPA established that users of online communications systems have a substantial privacy interest in the communications that they transmit over computer networks. ECPA also set out clear conditions under which law enforcement agencies, and, in narrow cases, system operators, could access these private communications. Holding system operators liable would presume a dramatic change in the privacy protected established in ECPA, thereby forcing service providers and system operators to invade the privacy of user communications. While there may be some justification for regulation of communication and information made public, there must be no intrusion on private or closed group communications unless there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing. E. Constitutional alternatives to the Communications Decency Act censorship regime Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from access to material considered inappropriate by their parents would include: Maximum reliance on technology to empower parents: Interactive media offers parents and other users the ability to filter certain kinds of content. Instead of relying on government content restrictions, or even government-imposed rating systems, parents should be able to block the delivery of certain information to their children. Clear protection for constitutionally-permissible speech: Any alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection for constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd or filthy. Controversial speech must be treated separately than that which is clearly obscene and unprotected. Emphasis on enforcement of existing statutes: Federal and state law already prohibits transportation of obscenity, child pornography, as well as, in many instances threats, stalking and harassment. To the extent that there are obstacles to enforcing these laws in the new on-line environment, Congress should examine whether or not more resources for enforcement are required, including training for law enforcement in interactive services and cooperative efforts with the industry. The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new interactive communications systems raises many difficult issues of public policy and constitutional law. Before proceeding with legislation, Congress must provide the opportunity for public hearings to identify clearly the problems that exist, and to identify solutions that are appropriate to the new technology. Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of constitutional litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on the development and growth of a very promising new communications medium. Footnotes 1 In very limited circumstances, the Supreme Court has found indecency to be "unprotected" speech. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1969)(holding indecency unprotected where distributed to minors). See the discussion of proposed Section 223(b) below. 2 See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957) and Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966) 3 413 U.S. 15 (1973)(adopting standards that were later rejected by the Supreme Court). Given the national and international reach of new interactive media, determinations of obscenity based on traditional "community standards" doctrine also raises a whole host of questions. 4 The Court in Miller held that the guidelines for determining obscenity are as follows: "(a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value." (citations omitted). 5 Sable Communications of Cal. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989). 6 See also Carlin Communications v. FCC, 837 F.2d 546, 555 (2nd Cir. 1988). 7 Pacifica held that the FCC had authority to enforce a rule which barred the comedian George Carlin and others from repeating the "seven dirty words" in over-the-air radio broadcasts. Pacifica did not,however, specifically approve the substance of the indecency rule promulgated by the Commission. 8 Id. at 748 9 Id at 749-50. The Pacifica court recognized that the radio station (WBAI in New York City) had actually broadcast a warning as to the possibly objectionable content, but that this warning failed to protect those who tuned in after it was given. Id. at 731. 10 Rep. Blilely asserts as much in his comments on the legislation. He states, "...It became clear that there was not a technological solution that would adequately and effectively protect our children from the effects of this material. We looked for effective alternatives to a ban -- there were none." 134 Cong. Rec. H1691. 11 134 Cong. Rec. H1693-4 (daily ed. April 19, 1988)(statement of Rep. Blilely)(emphasis added). 12 Bolger v.

They are if you're one of ahandful of Congressional staffers trying to field them. Tuesday, December12th was the Internet's Day of Protest. A variety of net-activists andtelecommunications-related services exhorted the on-line community to calla selected group of Senators and Representatives to declare theiropposition to the threat of Internet censorship. And call they did. As the Senate members of the Telecommunications Reform conferencecommittee contemplated portions of legislation that would censor"indecent" material on-line, their staffers were being overwhelmed withphone calls. Senator Inouye's office said they were "getting lots and lotsof calls and faxes." Senator Lott's said they were "flooded with calls." At Senator Stevens' office there were so many calls they couldn't keepa complete tally.At Senator Exon's office, the fax machine was "backed up."  And at onepoint, activists couldn't even get through to Senator Gorton's office toask. Exon is the Senator whose Communications Decency Act started thenearly year-long struggle between those who would create specialregulations to restrict speech on-line (even, in certain instances,private email between two individuals) to a greater extent than eventraditional broadcast media; regulations that, according to the ACLU andmany other civil liberties groups, will certainly be proven to beunconstitutional if passed into law. "We've never seen anything like it," said Stanton McCandish of theElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The EFF is one member of the on-linecoalition that has been fighting an array of censorship legislation sincethis spring, when Senator Exon introduced his Communications Decency Act. "We may have almost overwhelmed our provider," said Shabbir Safdar, headof Voter's Telecommunications Watch (VTW). VTW is the organization thatorganized the on-line coalition. Their on-line connectivity is provided byPanix.com, a New York-area Internet service provider. "Panix has beendoing some maintenance work today, so it's hard to tell," Safdarcontinued. "But we think it's actually made a dent in their connection to the rest of the Net." How many calls were actually made? No one can tell. For Leslie Miller, areporter for USA Today, it took much of the afternoon to get some countsfrom Congressional staffers, and she couldn't get any report from theSenate's Sergeant-At-Arms, the office nominally responsible for theSenate's telephone system. VTW may be the only organization that canreally make an educated guess. "In our Alerts we ask that people drop us an email note after they call,"explained VTW board member Steven Cherry. "The message count peaked in thelate afternoon at over 70 per minute. Many of those were from people whocalled several offices. By 7:30 P.M. (EST) we had gotten 14,000 messages.By Wednesday morning the count was over 18,000. And of course there arethe people who called but didn't send us email. So all told, our veryrough guess is there were well over 50,000 phone calls and faxes made onthe one day." "The Net is coming of age, politically," said Jerry Berman, Director ofthe Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), another member of theon-line coalition. Safdar, of VTW, concurred, saying, "I think Washingtongot the message today that there's a new grass-roots interest grouparound, and we're going to be a big part of the 1996 elections." (VTW'sinitial election activities can be found at http://www.vtw.org/pledge.)In addition to the Day of Protest, rallies are scheduled on Thursday,December 14th, in San Francisco and Seattle, and a protest will be heldthat day at 2:00 in New York City. The protest in New York will be held at the CyberCafe, at 273A LafayetteSt, New York NY, 10012.

On Tuesday December 12 1995, over 20,000 concerned net.citizens flooded key members of Congress with phone calls, faxes, and email messages urging them to opposelegislation which would prohibit the transmission of "indecent" material online. This was the largest demonstration of the strength of the Internet Community to date. Thank you to those who participated. Congress has not yet completed work on the final Telecommunications Reform Legislation, which includes the Communications Decency Act. There is still time to contact your representatives in Congress and urge them to protect the Internet and preserve its potential for democracy, education, and commerce.

Once an individual has access to the Internet,there are a wide variety of different methods of communicationand information exchange over the network. These numerousmethods of communication and information retrieval are constantlyevolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely. The most common methods of communications on the Internet (aswell as within the major online services) can be roughly groupedinto six categories: one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"), distributed messagedatabases (such as "USENET newsgroups"), real time communication(such as "Internet Relay Chat"), real time remote computerutilization (such as "telnet"), and remote information retrieval(such as "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide Web"). Most ofthese methods of communication can be used to transmit text,data, computer programs, sound, or visual images. 53. One-to-one messaging. The simplest method ofcommunication on the Internet is via electronic mail, or "e-mail," the modern equivalent to a first class letter. Anindividual can address and transmit a message to one or morespecific other individuals. E-mail on the Internet is not routedthrough any central control point, and can take numerous andvarying paths to the recipients. Unlike postal mail, simple e-mail is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed onintermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unlessthe message is encrypted). 54. One-to-many messaging. The Internet also containsautomatic mailing list services (such as "listserv") that allowsimple and efficient communications about particular subjects ofinterest. For example, individuals can subscribe to a "listserv"mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them. Theindividual can submit messages on the topic to the listserv thatare automatically forwarded (via e-mail) to anyone who hassubscribed to the mailing list. A recipient of such a messagecan reply to the message and have the reply also distributed toeveryone on the mailing list. This service provides thecapability to keep abreast of developments or events in aparticular subject area. Most listserv-type mailing listsautomatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing listsubscribers. There are thousands of such mailing list serviceson the Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands ofsubscribers. 55. Distributed message databases. Similar infunction to listservs -- but quite different in howcommunications are transmitted -- are distributed messagedatabases such as "USENET newsgroups." Like listservs,newsgroups are open discussions and exchanges on particulartopics. Users, however, need not subscribe to the discussionmailing list in advance, but can instead access the database atany time. An individual user can post a message to a newsgroup,and the message is then automatically forwarded to all othercomputers that furnish access to the newsgroups (but not to anyindividual users). The messages are temporarily stored on eachreceiving computer, where they are available for review andresponse. The messages are automatically and periodically purgedfrom each system to make room for new messages. Responses tomessages -- like the original messages -- are automaticallydistributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup. There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand differentsubjects. In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted tonewsgroups each day, and those messages were distributed to theapproximately 190,000 computers or computer networks thatparticipate in the USENET newsgroup system. Messages posted tonewsgroups are not stored on or channelled through any centralcomputer or location. 56. Real time communication. In addition totransmitting messages that can be later read or accessed,individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog --in "real time" -- with other individuals on the Internet. In itssimplest forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and"Internet Relay Chat" allows two or more individuals to typemessages to each other that almost immediately appear on theother individuals' computer screens. In addition, commercialonline services such as America Online, CompuServe, eWorld, theMicrosoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systemsallowing their members to converse. 57. Real time remote computer utilization. Anothermethod to utilize information on the Internet is to access andcontrol remote computers using "telnet." For example, usingtelnet, a researcher at a university would be able to utilize thecomputing power of a supercomputer located at a differentuniversity. A student can use telnet to connect to a remotelibrary to access the library's online card catalog program. Or,individuals can link via telnet to a computer to interactdirectly and communicate with other users linked to the samecomputer. Accessing a computer via telnet occurs in "real time,"and content and communication accessed via telnet is oftencreated only at the time of the communication. 58. Remote information retrieval. The final majorcategory of communication may be the most important and wellknown use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval ofinformation located on remote computers. There are numerousmethods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet. Asimple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list thenames of computer files available on a remote computer, and totransfer one or more of those files to an individual's localcomputer. Another approach uses a program and format named"gopher" to guide an individual's search through the resourcesavailable on a remote computer. A third approach, and fastbecoming the most well known on the Internet, is the "World WideWeb." The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language calledhypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" theWeb can display HTML documents containing text, images, andsound. Any HTML document can include links to other types ofinformation or resources, so that while viewing an HTML documentthat, for example, describes resources available on the Internet,an individual can "click" using a computer mouse on thedescription of the resource and be immediately connected to theresource itself. Such "hyperlinks" allow information to beaccessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allowindividuals to locate and efficiently view related informationeven if the information is stored on numerous computers allaround the world. 59. With the exception of point-to-point mail, noinformation flows through cyberspace to a particular individualunless the individual requests the information. Listservs,newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World WideWeb all require an affirmative request by the Internet user priorto the user receiving information over the Internet. Further-more, when a user makes such an affirmative request it is usuallyclear what type of content will be delivered. Thus, unlike radioor television, there is no significant risk that a user will be"assaulted" with unsolicited and undesired content. 60. The vast majority of transmissions of content fromspecific sites on the Internet are in response to electronicrequests the user could not have anticipated more than a fewseconds or moments before making the request. Becauseinformation is located on millions of computers around the world,with no central organization or control, a user cannot possiblyknow which computers might have useful information until startinga search. Instead, the user could access any of dozens ofdifferent search databases, obtain a list of sites that might beof interest, and then immediately link to one or more of thesites. Indeed, the very theory of "hyperlinks" and the hypertextmarkup language (HTML) (the foundation of the World Wide Web) isthat the user can jump from site to site to site without everneeding to know where physically in the world the next site islocated. Thus, there is no way for a user to pre-register withevery computer that might contain useful content on a particulartopic. Moreover, when an individual is researching a topic onthe Internet, he or she might access dozens of newsgroups, telnetcomputers, and ftp, gopher, and Web sites around the world in amatter of minutes. If a researcher was required to requestaccess from content providers prior to actually viewing theinformation (and prove to the provider that the researcher wasnot a minor), the Internet would be transformed from a dynamicand instantaneous content searching tool into a cumbersome,multi-step, much slower, and much less useful research tool. Thevibrancy and immediacy that sparked the Internet's recentextraordinary expansion and development would be lost. 61. The inability to predict where on the Internet auser would want to access information is not limited to research,and applies equally to any attempt by a user to accessinformation on the Internet when the individual does not know inadvance the precise location of that information. There aremillions of computers on the Internet that contain content, andit would be practically and economically impossible for the tensof millions of Internet users to pre-register with each of thosemillions of content sites, and equally impossible for thosemillions of content sites to maintain and instantaneously updatelists of registered users. 62. For both the speaker and the listener,communications on the Internet bear virtually no similarity tocommunications on television and radio. With radio andtelevision, the number of speakers is limited by the availablespectrum, the ability to speak is limited by the high cost ofspeaking, and listeners are merely passive recipients of thecommunications. With the Internet, the number of speakers isboundless, anyone can speak for pennies a day (or for free at hisor her public library), and listeners can respond and engage thespeaker in an interactive and on-going dialogue. Furthermore,unlike television and radio, on the Internet viewers andlisteners generally receive only the communications theyaffirmatively request, and are not a passive or "captive"audience. Moreover, unlike with television and radio, on theInternet a speaker can reach the entire world (at no additionalcost) yet at the same time can direct his or her speech toindividuals who share an interest in a particular subject. Inthe twenty-first century, the Internet -- if allowed to flourishunhindered by government censorship -- can revive the now-little-used public square and convert it into a global medium ofcommunication and discourse.

Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 151. With respect to constitutionally protectedcommunications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms andpractical effect, bans a substantial amount of speech by and toadults, including speech by and to plaintiffs, their members, andtheir subscribers, patrons and customers, in violation of theFirst Amendment of the United States Constitution. COUNT 2 152. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 153. With respect to constitutionally protectedcommunications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms andpractical effect, unduly burdens and deters a substantial amountof speech by and to adults, including speech by and toplaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, patrons, andcustomers, in violation of the First Amendment of the UnitedStates Constitution. COUNT 3 154. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 155. Sections 502(1) and 502(2) of the Act undulychill and compel self-censorship of constitutionally protectedspeech of plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers,patrons, and customers, in violation of the First Amendment ofthe United States Constitution. COUNT 4 156. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 157. Section 502(2) of the Act, 47 U.S.C. § 223(d), isfatally overbroad. In particular, it bans, burdens, andcriminalizes speech that is constitutionally protected foradults, and for older minors, restricting both adults and 17year-olds to communications appropriate for 7 year olds. And itbans, burdens, and criminalizes a much broader range ofconstitutionally protected expression than is constitutionallypermissible. Accordingly, the provision violates the FirstAmendment. COUNT 5 158. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 159. Any blocking system to be imposed by the contentprovider/speaker would require advance identification of thoseseeking access to a particular Web site, chat room, discussiongroup, or other online forum that might potentially containcommunications that could be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" to persons under 18. See 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(5)(B). A requirement of advance identification would make it impossiblefor users to engage in constitutionally protected anonymousspeech on matters of public and private importance. For manyusers, such anonymity is critical to their participation in thespeech. 160. For such users, the Act will require them tochoose between anonymity and losing access to suchcommunications. As a result, in many cases, their FirstAmendment rights to read and view constitutionally protected textand images will be infringed. 161. Section 502(2) accordingly violates the FirstAmendment. COUNT 6 162. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 163. Plaintiffs are unable to determine withreasonable certainty which constitutionally protected expressionCongress sought to proscribe in § § 223(a)(1)(B) and (d). Inparticular, the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive asmeasured by contemporary community standards" are entirelysubjective; as a matter of law depend on the context in which thecommunications arise; are undefined and undefinable in thecyberspace context; have entirely different meanings dependingupon the age of the recipient even though the Act treats allminors of all ages the same; and give no indication as to whichcommunity governs the inquiry. In these, and other ways, the Actdoes not put reasonable persons on notice of what communicationsare prohibited. As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, andsubscribers, patrons, and customers are forced to guess at whichspeech on interactive computer services may give rise to criminalprosecution. 164. The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and"patently offensive as measured by contemporary communitystandards," and of other provisions of the Act, and the draconianpenalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, theirmembers, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, andsubstantial numbers of other providers of content to theInternet, to self-censor far more speech than would in fact beprohibited in order to comply with their understanding of theAct's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal prosecution,and will thus chill constitutionally protected expression. 165. The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and"patently offensive as measured by contemporary communitystandards," and of other provisions of the Act, invites arbitraryenforcement. 166. The Act is, accordingly, so vague as to violatethe First and Fifth Amendments. COUNT 7 167. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 168. Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the defensesunder the Act will not be construed as broadly as Congressintended, and will therefore subject their dissemination orfacilitation of constitutionally protected speech to criminalprosecution and conviction in several significant contexts. 169. The "good faith defense," which is the onlydefense even arguably available to non-commercial content-providers, gives insufficient guidance to content-providers as towhether their dissemination of constitutionally protected speechis prohibited. Plaintiff content-providers have no means ofascertaining whether a jury will determine that they have taken"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under thecircumstances" to restrict minors' access to material that is"indecent" or "patently offensive as measured by contemporarycommunity standards." Act 502(2), to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(5)(A). 170. Similarly, service providers who host Web sitesor other online sites, without controlling content, but on whosefacilities others' communications reside, reasonably fear anaggressive prosecutor will argue, contrary to plaintiffs'understanding of Congressional intent, that such actions willconstitute a "display" of such communications under § 223(d)(1)(B), and that such services are not protected by the"access provider" defense, even though the service providers'role clearly "does not include the creation of the content of thecommunication." § 223(e)(1). 171. For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot withreasonable certainty rely on the access provider defense, § 223(e)(1), to exempt access providers' operation of USENET newsservers that automatically store content posted by users, whichremains on their servers for a number of days and is available tosubscribers. 172. For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot withreasonable certainty determine whether the defense, § 223(e)(1),applies to ISPs who assist content providers in establishing oroperating Web pages or other online sites, and who, althoughhaving no control of content, might be deemed to be a"conspirator" under § 223(e)(2) if they knowingly arrange foraccess to valuable, constitutionally protected material that maybe deemed "indecent." 173. As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, andtheir subscribers, patrons, and customers, are forced to guess atwhether their activities may give rise to criminal prosecution. 174. The uncertainty of how prosecutors or the courtswill construe the defenses, the fact that they are only defenses,which must be raised and proved after a defendant has alreadybeen subjected to the humiliation, stigma, and expense of acriminal prosecution, and the draconian penalties for a wrongguess, will force plaintiffs, their members, and theirsubscribers, patrons, and customers, and a substantial number ofother providers of content to the Internet, to self-censor speechprotected by the First Amendment in order to comply with theirunderstanding of the Act's requirements, or to avoid potentialcriminal prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionallyprotected expression. 175. The vagueness of these provisions invitesarbitrary enforcement. 176. Sections 502(1) and (2), accordingly, are sovague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments. COUNT 8 177. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149. 178. Sections 502(1) and (2) of the Act violate theFirst Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their members, and theirsubscribers, patrons, and customers, insofar as they single outfor special bans or burdens speakers engaged in one class ofconstitutionally protected speech by one specific medium, and donot similarly ban or burden speakers engaged in other classes ofspeech, or in the same speech via other mediums, withoutsufficient justification. WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: A. Declare that Sections 502(1) and (2) of theCommunications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § § 223(a)(1)(B),223(a)(2), and 223(d), are unconstitutional; B. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendantsfrom enforcing those provisions. C. Award plaintiffs such costs and fees as are allowedby law; and D.

Individuals have a wide variety of avenues toaccess cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular. Interms of physical access, there are two common methods toestablish an actual link to the Internet. First, an individualcan use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (andusually permanently) connected to a computer network that isitself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet. Second,an individual can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" toconnect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computernetwork that is itself directly or indirectly connected to theInternet. As detailed below, both direct and modem connectionsare made available to individuals by a wide variety of academic,governmental, or commercial entities. 42. Students, faculty, researchers, and othersaffiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities inthe United States can access the Internet through theireducational institutions. Such access is often via directconnection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using amodem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campuslocation. Internet access is considered to be so important tothe modern educational process that many colleges anduniversities install "ports" or outlets for direct networkconnections in each dormitory room or provide access viacomputers located in common areas in dormitories. Such accessenables students and professors to use information and contentprovided by the college or university itself, and to use the vastamount of research resources and other information available onthe Internet worldwide. 43. Similarly, Internet resources and access aresufficiently important to many corporations and other employersthat those employers link their office computer networks to theInternet and provide employees with direct or modem access to theoffice network (and thus to the Internet). Such access isespecially important, for example, to any corporation involved inscientific or medical research or manufacturing to enablecorporate employees to exchange information and ideas withacademic researchers in their fields. 44. Individuals who lack access to the Internetthrough their schools or employers still have a variety of waysthey can access the Internet. Many communities across thecountry have established "free-nets" or community networks toprovide their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and toprovide local-oriented content and discussion groups). The firstsuch community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community ComputerSystem, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist inscores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,California. Individuals typically can access free-nets at littleor no cost via modem connection or by using computers availablein community buildings. Free-nets are often operated by a locallibrary, educational institution, or non-profit community group. 45. Individuals can also access the Internet throughmany local libraries. Libraries often offer patrons use ofcomputers that are linked to the Internet. In addition, somelibraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. Increasingly, patrons are using library services and resourceswithout ever physically entering the library itself. Such director modem access is typically provided by libraries at no cost tothe individual user. 46. Individuals can also access the Internet bypatronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffeeshops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- canuse computers provided by the shop to access the Internet. SuchInternet access is typically provided by the shop for a smallhourly fee. 47. Individuals can also access the Internet throughcommercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" thattypically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computernetwork linked to the Internet. Many such providers -- includingthe members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a modestmonthly or hourly fee. Some Internet service providers, however,are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low costaccess to the Internet. For example, the International InternetAssociation offers free modem access to the Internet uponrequest. Also, an increasing number of trade or other non-profitassociations offer Internet access as a service to members. 48. Another simple and common way that individuals canaccess the Internet is through one of the major nationalcommercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple'seWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy. Theseonline services offer nationwide computer networks (so thatsubscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number), and theservices provide extensive and well organized content withintheir own proprietary computer networks. In addition to allowingaccess to the extensive content available within each onlineservice, the services also allow subscribers to link to the muchlarger resources of the Internet. Full access to the onlineservice (including access to the Internet) can be obtained formodest monthly or hourly fees. The major commercial onlineservices have almost twelve million individual subscribers acrossthe United States. 49. In addition to using the national commercialonline services, individuals can also access the Internet usingsome (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computerservices, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs." Withan investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of atelephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacygroups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, orcustomers can exchange ideas and information. BBSs range fromsingle computers with only one telephone line into the computer(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with manytelephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneoususers), to multiple linked computers each servicing multipledial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirectlinks to the Internet. Some BBS systems charge individuals anominal fee for access, while many others are free to theindividual users. 50. Although commercial access to the Internet isgrowing rapidly, many individual users of the Internet -- such ascollege students and staff -- do not individually pay for access(except to the extent, for example, the cost of computer servicesis a component of college tuition). These and other Internetusers can access the Internet without any requirement that theyprovide a credit card or other form of payment. 51. In part because the Internet is an unregulated"network of networks" with literally millions of access pointsand tens of millions of users, individual Internet users often donot have their own "username" or identification code that wouldindicate to others on the Internet the identity of the user. Many users access the Internet anonymously or through a methodthat would not allow for clear identification by a remote contentprovider. Go back to the index.

The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smallergroups of linked computer networks: a network of networks. Thisis best understood if one considers what a linked group ofcomputers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what itdoes. Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called"local area networks"). For example, in many United StatesCourthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purposeof exchanging files and messages (and to share equipment such asprinters). These are networks. In the language of the Act,these networks would each be termed an "interactive computerservice." 32. Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked toother computers or networks (although the Act still directlyapplies to such closed local area networks). Many networks,however, are connected to other networks, which are in turnconnected to other networks in a manner which permits eachcomputer in any network to communicate with computers on anyother network in the system. This global web of linked networksand computers is the Internet. 33. This amalgam of computers and computer networks --some owned by governmental and public institutions, some owned bynon-profit organizations, and some privately owned -- lacks anycentral control or supervision. The resulting whole is adecentralized, unrestricted global medium of communications -- or"cyberspace" -- that links individuals, institutions,corporations, and governments around the world. Thiscommunications medium allows any of the literally tens ofmillions of people with access to the Internet to exchange ideas,research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound, or simpleelectronic mail with others on the Internet. Thesecommunications can occur virtually instantaneously, and can bedirected either to specific individuals, to a broader group ofindividuals interested in a particular subject, or to the worldas a whole. 34. The Internet had its origins in 1969 as anexperimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency("ARPA"). First called ARPANET, the network linked computers andcomputer networks owned by the military, defense contractors, anduniversity laboratories conducting defense-related research. Thenetwork later allowed researchers across the country to accessdirectly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located ata few key universities and laboratories. As it evolved farbeyond its research origins in the United States to encompassuniversities, corporations, and individuals around the world, theARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally justthe "Internet." 35. From its inception, the network was designed to bea decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant linksbetween computers and computer networks, capable of rapidlytransmitting communications without direct human involvement orcontrol, and with the automatic ability to re-routecommunications if one or more individual links were damaged orotherwise unavailable. Among other goals, this redundant, self-healing system of linked computers was designed to allow vitalresearch and communications to continue even if portions of thenetwork were damaged. 36. To achieve this resilient nationwide (andultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouragedthe creation of multiple links to and from each computer (orcomputer network) on the network. Thus, a computer located inWashington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicatedtelephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or onthe Eastern seaboard. Each of those computers would in turn belinked to numerous other computers, which themselves would belinked to other computers. 37. A communication sent over this redundant series oflinked computers could travel any of dozens of routes to itsdestination. Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sentto a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to acomputer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and SaltLake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto. If the messagecould not travel along that path (because of military attack,simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message wouldautomatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) bere-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and thento Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, andfinally to Palo Alto. This type of transmission, and re-routing,would likely occur in a matter of seconds. 38. At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (itsubsequently ceased to exist), similar decentralized networksdeveloped to link universities, research facilities, businesses,and individuals around the world. These other formal or loosenetworks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. Eventually, each of these networks (many of which wereoverlapping) were themselves linked together, allowing users ofany computers linked to any one of the networks to transmitcommunications to users of computers on other networks. It isthis series of linked networks (themselves linking computers andcomputer networks) that is commonly known today as the Internet. 39. No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, ornon-profit -- controls, governs, or runs the Internet. It existsand functions solely as a result of the fact that hundreds ofthousands of separate operators of computers and computernetworks independently decided to use a common data transferprotocol to exchange communications and information with othercomputers (which in turn exchange communications and informationwith still other computers). There is no centralized storagelocation, control point, or communications channel for theInternet, and it would be impossible for any single entity toregulate the information conveyed on the Internet. 40. The nature of the Internet is such that it isimpossible to determine its size. However, it is indisputablethat the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in thepast few years. In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked tothe Internet, and by 1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000computers. By 1993, however, over 1,000,000 computers werelinked. Today, it is estimated that over 9,400,000 hostcomputers worldwide are linked to the Internet, and this countdoes not include the tens of millions of personal computers usedby individuals to access the Internet using modems (as detailedbelow). In all, reasonable estimates are that over 40 millionindividuals around the world can and do access the enormouslyflexible communication medium of the Internet. That figure isexpected to grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999. Go back to the index. Go to next section.WT02-B06-122IA095-001027-B017-167http://www.cdt.org:80/ciec/prelim.html 205.177.10.31 19970215013712 text/html 6475HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:35:56 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Preliminary Statement Preliminary Statement 1. During much of this century the mass media,particularly radio and television, have been characterized by alimited number of speakers transmitting programming andinformation to essentially passive audiences. The communicationsmedium of the twenty-first century -- the Internet and"cyberspace" generally -- is changing that, and will allowhundreds of millions of individuals to engage in interactivecommunication, on a national and global scale never beforepossible. The public square of the past -- with pamphleteering,soap boxes, and vigorous debate -- is being replaced by theInternet, which enables average citizens to participate innational discourse, publish a newspaper, distribute an electronicpamphlet to the world, and generally communicate to and with abroader audience than ever before possible. It also enablesaverage citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world-wide range of information, while simultaneously protecting theirprivacy, because in this new medium individuals receive only thecommunications they affirmatively request. 2. In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223) (the "Act"), Congressacknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinaryadvance in the availability of educational and informationalresources to our citizens," and acknowledged that interactivecomputer services "offer users a great degree of control over theinformation that they receive." Congress therefore declared"[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to promote thecontinued development of the Internet and other interactivecomputer services; [and] to preserve the vibrant and competitivefree market that presently exists for the Internet and otherinteractive computer services, unfettered by Federal or Stateregulation." Act § 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 230). Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of the Act that wereintended only to protect minors from communications deemedinappropriate for them will have the effect, perhaps unintended,of depriving adults of communications that are appropriate, andindisputably constitutionally protected, for them. Because ofthe way the Internet works, the Act's prohibition ofcommunications that may be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for minors will effectively ban those samecommunications between adults, reducing the adult population incyberspace to only what is appropriate for minors. The bannedspeech includes valuable works of literature and art, informationabout health and medical issues, and examples of popular culture. It also includes robust human discourse about politics, currentevents, and personal matters that may at times include harsh,provocative, or even vulgar language, all of which isconstitutionally protected for adults. 3. Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individualsand entities from the computer and communications industries andthe general public who are harmed by the Act. Plaintiffs includepublishers and creators of content on the Internet; "onlineservices," "Internet service providers," libraries, and otherswho provide access or connection to the Internet; and speakers,listeners, and users on the Internet. The Act's effective ban ofa broad category of communication that is constitutionallyprotected for adults directly harms the First Amendment rights ofplaintiffs, and of the tens of millions of adult speakers andlisteners who are "online" and linked through this newcommunications medium. Plaintiffs also include parents, who seekto protect the rights of parents to decide what is appropriatefor their children to receive through interactive computercommunications. 4. The speech at issue in this case does not includeobscenity, child pornography, harassing speech, speech intendedto entice or lure minors into inappropriate activity, or otherspeech that lacks First Amendment protection even for adults. This complaint does not challenge governmental regulation ofthose categories of non-protected speech, and the relief soughtherein will not affect the government's ability to prosecute thecommunication of those categories of speech, all of which arealready prohibited by existing law. 5. The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(d)), prohibits the"display" of material deemed "patently offensive" "in a manneravailable to a person under 18 years of age" (emphasis added). That provision is subject to certain defenses, which the sponsorof the Act and Congress apparently believed would enable speakersto restrict access by minors while simultaneously permittingaccess by adults. But those defenses, which were merely liftedfrom the "dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quitedifferent medium of cyberspace. Because of the manner in whichinformation is stored, transmitted, and received on the Internet,this provision has the (perhaps unintended) result of banningspeech between adults that is suitable and constitutionallyprotected for adults. 6. The Act is also unconstitutional because there arealternative ways of protecting minors from material inappropriatefor them that would not abridge the First Amendment rights ofadults, and would be more effective in protecting minors than themechanism Congress imposed. The speaker-based blocking requiredby the Act will not protect minors from access to words andimages posted on the Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who arenot effectively subject to prosecution under the Act, or even bydomestic speakers who intentionally or inadvertently violate theAct. But user-based blocking technology enables parents andother users to block or screen whatever words or images they deeminappropriate, regardless of where posted, at little or no cost. For these reasons, every application of the Act unnecessarily andunconstitutionally abridges the First Amendment rights of adults,and does so even though there are less drastic alternatives thatwould be more protective of minors.

The protest, organized by CDT, VTW, and several other online activist organizations, was designed to illustrate the far reaching impact these new restrictions will have on all Internet users. Over 1500 sites, from Members of Congress, commercial sites, search engines, and individual home pages, joined together to illustrate that on the Internet, every user is a publisher, and that the new content regulations threaten the First Amendment rights of all Internet users. CDT, VTW, and the other ogranizers of the 'black Thursday' protest wish to extend our sincere thanks to all who participated in this protest. It was by far the larges and most successful Internet based demonstration in history.

Because of the realities of the Internet, the Acteffects a total ban on certain constitutionally protected speechto adults. The Act reduces discourse on major portions of theInternet to that which is appropriate for a young child. 96. Virtually all of the tens of millions of users ofthe Internet -- except those who at all times stand mute in thediscourse that occurs on the Internet -- are content providerswho are subject to the terms of the Act. An individual is acontent provider subject to the Act if he sends a single e-mail,or participates in a listserv discussion, or contributes to aUSENET newsgroup, or responds to a survey on the World Wide Web,or establishes a personal "home page" on the Web, or converseswith a friend through a real time service, or simply places afile in a publicly available area of a computer or network. 97. In other words, virtually any use of the Internetmakes someone a content provider subject to the criminalpenalties of the Act. Commercial content providers -- whotypically require a credit card for users' payment -- may be ableto use the credit card defense allowed by the Act. But for non-commercial content providers, who are responsible for a majorpart of communications on the Internet, there is no practical waythe speaker can control who can access the message. Thus, forthe vast majority of speech on the Internet, it is impossible forthe speaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in amanner available" to a person under 18. Act § 502(2). 98. Because of this impossibility, Section 502(2) ofthe Act effectively requires that almost all discourse on theInternet be at a level suitable for young children. Thisprovision has the effect of a flat ban on an entire category ofconstitutionally protected speech between adults. 99. As used by millions of people daily, the primarymethods to access information on the Internet do not permitindividual or non-commercial content providers to control who onthe Internet can access their content. From the perspective ofthe content provider, information that is publicly available onthe Internet is available to all users of the Internet, evenusers who might be minors. 100. None of the major methods of accessinginformation -- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups,chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher, and the World Wide Web -- hasthe ability to track the millions of individuals who access theInternet and screen out those who are under eighteen years ofage. Although password-required access to content is possible(and is used in some circumstances), a password-access systemwould effectively remove from public access an enormous volume ofvaluable content on the Internet, and would reduce theinformation available to adults on the Internet to only contentdeemed suitable for minors. 101. The vast majority of content providers on theInternet are individuals who post messages to newsgroups andlistservs, and who create content on the World Wide Web. Thoseindividual content providers could not possibly create andmaintain a database of specific Internet users who request accessto the content and who prove they are 18 or older. Nor couldindividuals or other non-commercial content providers practicallyadminister or economically afford an instantaneous credit cardverification system. Such a requirement would effectivelypreclude any communications by those content providers that couldbe deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors. 102. Even larger organizations that provide content onthe Internet cannot practically or economically track themillions of Internet users to determine whether those users areminors or adults. 103. Moreover, even if pre-registration by contentusers were practically or economically possible, the value of thecontent would be dramatically diminished because so few contentusers would anticipate the need to pre-register for a particularsite. A huge percentage of Internet traffic is by users engagedin spontaneous and unpredictable research or searches forcontent, and a pre-registration requirement would effectively endthis type of search. 104. As described above, the World Wide Web is aspontaneous and serendipitous communications medium, in which auser can jump from site to site to site depending on what contentlooks most useful or interesting, without any pre-registration oradvance request. Requiring pre-registration for all sites thatmight contain content arguably covered by the Act (if such pre-registration were practically possible) would drastically reducethe usefulness of the World Wide Web. 105. For other methods of providing content on theInternet, it is flatly impossible for a content provider tocontrol who can access the content. With USENET newsgroups, forexample, once a content provider posts a message to a newsgroup,that message is automatically distributed to over 190,000computers around the world, and the individual content providerhas no ability whatsoever to control who is permitted to accessthe content on those 190,000 computers. Under the Act, allcontent posted to USENET newsgroups must be reduced to a levelappropriate for young children. Similarly, Internet mailing listservices such as "listserv" also do not allow the speaker tocontrol who receives the communication, and thus speech via amailing list service would also be reduced to the levelappropriate for young children.

Signed into law on February 8, 1996, theCommunications Decency Act criminalizes the display anddistribution of constitutionally protected expressive material. 82. The Act contains two primary criminal provisions. Violation of either provision is a felony, punishable by as muchas two years in prison and substantial fines. 83. Section 502(2) of the Act, to be codified at 47U.S.C. § 223(d), broadly prohibits knowingly using any"interactive computer service" to send to a specific person orpersons under 18 years of age, or to "display," "in a manneravailable to" a person under 18, certain "patently offensive"communications. Section 502(2) provides, in pertinent part: (d) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly-- (A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or (B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the communication; or (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under such person's control to be used for an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity, shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, orimprisoned not more than two years, or both. Act § 502(2). 84. "Interactive computer service" is defined as "anyinformation service, system, or access software provider thatprovides or enables computer access by multiple users to acomputer server, including specifically a service or system thatprovides access to the Internet and such systems operated orservices offered by libraries or educational institutions." Act § 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(h)(2)) referring toAct § 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(2)). 85. The terms "patently offensive," "contemporarycommunity standards," and "display" are nowhere defined in theAct. 86. Another section of the Act, Section 502(1), to becodified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(B), prohibits and criminalizesthe use of a "telecommunications device" knowingly to make orcreate and "initiate[] the transmission of, any comment, request,suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is. . . indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communicationis under 18 years of age." Another provision of the same sectionmakes it a crime to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunicationsfacility under [a person's] control to be used for any activityprohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used forsuch activity." Act § 502(1) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.§ 223(a)(2)). 87. "Telecommunications device" is defined to excludean "interactive computer service." Act § 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(h)(1)(B)). 88. The term "indecent" is not defined. 89. The Act establishes several defenses a defendantmay assert in a criminal prosecution under the Act. First, noperson shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d)solely for providing access or connection to or from afacility, system, or network not under that person'scontrol, including transmission, downloading,intermediate storage, access software, or other relatedcapabilities that are incidental to providing suchaccess or connection that does not include the creationof the content of the communication. Act § 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(1)). 90. The phrase "not under that person's control" isnowhere defined in the Act. 91. This defense is not available "to a person who isa conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation orknowing distribution of communications that violate this section,or who knowingly advertises the availability of suchcommunications." Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(2)). Nor is this defense available to "a person who provides access orconnection to a facility, system, or network engaged in theviolation . . . that is owned or controlled by such person." Id.(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(3)). The level or natureof control is not defined. 92. In addition, the Act provides a defense to acriminal prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) foruse of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if thedefendant (A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective,and appropriate actions under the circumstances torestrict or prevent access by minors to a communicationspecified in such subsections, which may involve anyappropriate measures to restrict minors from suchcommunications, including any method which is feasibleunder available technology; or (B) has restricted access to such communication byrequiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,adult access code, or adult personal identificationnumber. Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(5)). Congress did notprovide any details as to what might be considered a "good faith,reasonable, effective, and appropriate action[]." Congress didallow the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") to promulgatenonbinding guidelines as to what might be an "appropriateaction," but it now appears that even those guidelines will notbe issued until sometime in 1997 at the earliest, and compliancewith the guidelines will not insulate speakers from prosecutionor conviction under the Act. 93. Congress made no findings in connection withenacting Section 502 of the Act. Congress made no findings as toits purpose or interest in criminalizing online communication of"indecent" or "patently offensive" materials to, or that would beavailable to, persons under age 18. In considering the Act,Congress made no inquiry into or findings regarding the extent towhich such materials were available to persons under 18. Congress made no inquiry into or findings whether the meansCongress chose to address whatever interest it had wouldsubstantially further that interest. Congress made no inquiryinto or findings whether any less restrictive means wouldsubstantially further its interest. 94. In another section of the Act, however, Congressdid make the following relevant findings: (1) The rapidly developing array of Internet andother interactive computer services available toindividual Americans represent an extraordinary advancein the availability of educational and informationalresources to our citizens. (2) These services offer users a great degree ofcontrol over the information that they receive, as wellas the potential for even greater control in the futureas technology develops. (3) The Internet and other interactive computerservices offer a forum for a true diversity ofpolitical discourse, unique opportunities for culturaldevelopment, and myriad avenues for intellectualactivity. (4) The Internet and other interactive computerservices have flourished, to the benefit of allAmericans, with a minimum of government regulation. (5) Increasingly Americans are relying oninteractive media for a variety of political,educational, cultural, and entertainment services.

The overwhelming majority of content on theInternet is non-sexual in nature, and is not even arguably"indecent" or "patently offensive," even for minors. However, asignificant amount of the content on the Internet could arguablybe deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in somecommunities, and the Act bans or burdens all of that content. 107. Although imposing extreme burdens on theInternet, the Act will in fact have very little impact on theavailability to persons under 18 of "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" images or communications on the Internet. At least inpart because Congress held no hearings on the Act, did notcollect information about how the Internet works, and onlyhaphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, the Act doesnot accomplish or even significantly further the ostensible goalof limiting access by persons under 18 to "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" images. There are at least two reasons whyimplementation of the Act will be highly ineffective as alimitation on such access. 108. First, a high percentage of sexual content on theInternet originates outside of the United States, and it is notpossible to prevent that content from being "available" in theUnited States. To the extent the Act imposes any burdens ondomestic commercial providers of such communications, thoseproviders will have the option of moving their operationsoverseas. 109. Second, the existence of "anonymous remailers"means that any content -- indecent or otherwise -- can be placedonto the Internet anonymously, and the government would be unableto identify the content provider. Anonymous remailer systems --which often are located overseas -- will automatically receive acommunication and forward it to a destination after havingremoved all trace of the origin of the communication. 110. At bottom, therefore, the Act does little tolimit the ability of commercial or non-commercial entities toprovide "indecent" or "patently offensive" images on theInternet. 111. A critical difference between the Act's attemptto regulate indecency on the Internet and prior governmentalattempts to regulate indecency (over radio, television, andtelephone sex lines, for example) is that there are tens ofmillions of speakers on the Internet, with no bottleneck throughwhich all of the speech must pass. 112. There are alternative means that are far moreeffective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" communications. The only place where it ispractically possible to screen out commercial indecency, non-commercial indecency, domestic indecency, overseas indecency,intentional indecency, inadvertent indecency, and anonymousindecency is in the computer that is attempting to receive thespeech. 113. The government's legitimate interest in aidingparental control over the Internet material their children accessmay be served by several means that are both less restrictive andmore effective than a blanket ban on "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" communications. Parents have control over theirchildren's access to communications through interactive computerservices. For example, parents can deny their child access tothe computer; parents can supervise their child's use ofinteractive computer services; parents can decline to subscribeto interactive computer services until their child is older;parents can take advantage of the free screening and blockingoptions available at no extra charge from commercial onlineservices; and parents can obtain software (some of it free, andmost of it for a very modest cost) for their home computers toscreen material they find objectionable. 114. Commercial online services such as AmericaOnline, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offertechnologies that allow parents to block their children's accessto certain online forums and areas where children might beexposed to inappropriate content. These online services, forexample, include a feature that allows parents to prevent theirchildren from accessing interactive discussion forums (chatrooms). They also offer parents the ability to block access toall or portions of the Internet, including the World Wide Web andUSENET newsgroups, based on keywords, subject matter, or specificnewsgroups. These tools can be configured to block access togroups based on any keyword. 115. In addition, a variety of software providers havedeveloped applications to use in conjunction with commercialonline services, over and above the parental control featuresprovided by commercial services, while others are designedspecifically for direct access. SurfWatch, for example, allowsparents to block their child's access to USENET newsgroups, WorldWide Web, gopher, and ftp sites with sexually explicit content. When activated with a private password held only by a parent,SurfWatch completely prevents any user from accessing theseareas. The service automatically updates the list of blockedsites, without any intervention required from the user. NETNANNY, another example, contains a dictionary in which the parentcan enter the names of sites that contain sexually explicit orother material. Parents may also enter phrases which iftransmitted or received will automatically disconnect thenetwork. Among other things, the program also keeps a log of allactivity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents to monitortheir children's use of the computer. 116. Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server andWEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to blockspecific sites from access by all users on the network, and totrack and monitor use of the Internet. 117. Because the Internet is a global network withmillions of users, speaker-based content restrictions cannoteffectively control the availability of materials inappropriatefor children. The only effective way to protect children frominappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage thecontinued development and deployment of user-based tools thatempower parents to control their children's online activitiesbased on the parents' views of what is appropriate for theirchildren. The products described here, and others like them,provide parents these tools, and can do so without the need forcriminalizing or banning the distribution to adults ofconstitutionally protected communications.

The diversity of content on the Internet is asbroad as the Internet itself. Content can be found on millionsof computers worldwide, and ranges from academic research to artto humor to literature to medical information to music to news tovirtually anything else. Moreover, at any one time, the Internetserves as the communication medium for literally tens ofthousands of global conversations, political debates, and socialdialogues. For example, on the Internet, one can view the fulltext of the Bible, all of the works of Shakespeare, and numerousother classic works of literature. One can browse throughpaintings from museums around the world, or view in close-updetail the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or see the latestphotographs transmitted by the Jupiter space probe. One can evenhear pieces of music or view clips of movies and videos over theInternet. 64. There is a significant amount of content on theInternet that could be considered "indecent" for minors in somecommunities in the United States, but which most people wouldconsider to be extremely valuable and appropriate for adults, andwhich, in any event, is constitutionally protected for adults. Such content includes, for example, great works of art andliterature (containing depictions and descriptions of nudes andsexual conduct), examples of modern popular culture (containingpopular music, lyrics, movie images, or literature with sexualcontent), medical information (containing depictions anddescriptions relating to child birth, sexually transmitteddiseases, and sexually related medical conditions), andhistorical and scientific information (containing, for example,accounts of historic criminal trials or other historical,sociological, and anthropological works). Such content, andother content typically provided by non-commercial providers, iseffectively banned by the Act. 65. The fear that some communities in the UnitedStates would conclude that this type of valuable material is"indecent" for minors is well founded. Communities across thecountry have banned or sought to ban classic works of literature,such as Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying byWilliam Faulkner, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by MarkTwain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in theRye by J.D. Salinger, and I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by MayaAngelou, as "indecent" for minors. Even the American HeritageDictionary and parts of the Bible have been attacked as being"indecent" for minors. All of these works (some of which areavailable in whole or in part on the Internet), and works withsimilar content, are effectively banned by the Act. 66. In addition to the above type of content that isbanned by the Act, a tremendous amount of common human discourseis banned by the Act. In the course of conversations,discussions and debates, many citizens use language and imagerythat in some communities would be viewed as "indecent" forminors. Vigorous and heated debate often occurs with harsh orvulgar words. Many people, and many speakers on the Internet,use in common discourse words that describe "sexual or excretoryactivities or organs" in terms that might be deemed to be"patently offensive" for minors. The use of vulgar words in adialog with friends -- which would be perfectly legal over thetelephone or in a letter or on a basketball court -- would beillegal under the Act if sent over the Internet. 67. There are many examples on the Internet ofvaluable content that can be displayed only subject to the threatof criminal liability and prosecution. 68. For example, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display ofwritten descriptions of sexual intercourse. 69. There are available on the Internet importantworks of literature that include descriptions of sexualintercourse. 70. Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display ofimages of nude men and/or women. 71. There are available on the Internet numerousimportant works of art -- paintings, drawings and photographs bygreat masters and modern artists alike -- that depict nude menand/or women. An example of such a work of art is Manet'sOlympia. 72. Similarly, content providers would reasonably fearprosecution under the Act for engaging in a vigorous onlinedebate in which there is repeated use of the "seven dirty words"at issue in the decision in Federal Communications Commission v.Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). 73. There are on the Internet -- on a daily basis --vigorous political, social, and other dialogues and debates thatinclude unrestricted use of one or more of the "seven dirtywords." 74. Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the display on a World WideWeb "home page" of vulgar statements of the type at issue inCohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971). 75. The Supreme Court has specifically held that theuse of the vulgar statement in Cohen is protected expression,even when displayed in public areas when children are present. 76. Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the display of a parody thatmakes explicit assertions about the "sexual or excretoryactivities or organs" of a well known public figure, as was atissue in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988). 77. The Supreme Court specifically held in Falwellthat a parody that made explicit assertions about the "sexual orexcretory activities or organs" of a well known public figure isprotected expression. 78. Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display ofdetailed information concerning birth control and thetransmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 79. The Supreme Court specifically held in Bolger v.Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), that suchcommunications are protected expression and can be mailed,unsolicited, into homes. 80. There is a tremendous amount of valuable contenton the Internet that is constitutionally protected for adults,but is nevertheless subject to prosecution under the Act. Go back to the index.

The plaintiffs (and the plaintiffs' members,subscribers, patrons, and customers) interact with and use theInternet, and cyberspace generally, in a wide variety of ways,and they are burdened by the Act in an equally wide variety ofways. Plaintiffs include content providers on the Internet,access providers to the Internet, and users of the content on theInternet. The Act burdens plaintiffs in all of these capacities. 119. Plaintiffs who are content providers (or whosemembers or customers are content providers) are expressly subjectto the Act. Under the Act, anyone who speaks on the Internet isa content provider. These plaintiffs do not understand whatstandard for indecency should be used under the Act, how thestandard applies to the plaintiffs' speech, or how numerous otherprovisions of the Act are to be understood and applied. Theseplaintiffs provide content that would likely or possibly be foundto be indecent as to a young child in some communities. Accordingly, they are subject to prosecution under the Act. These plaintiffs will either self-censor their speech or willcontinue to speak under the threat of prosecution. 120. Plaintiffs who are, or whose members are, accessproviders (including "Internet service providers" or "ISPs") areexpressly subject to the Act. As access providers theseplaintiffs enable their customers and users to use plaintiffs'facilities to link to the Internet. Although the Act providesdefenses for access providers, access providers reasonably fearthat these defenses will not be construed and applied as broadlyas Congress intended, and they therefore fear they may bedirectly subject to prosecution under the Act. These plaintiffswill continue to provide access under the threat of prosecution. 121. All plaintiffs (and their members and customers)are users of the Internet. These plaintiffs and other users havea right to engage in ordinary human discourse free from thethreat of prosecution created by the Act. In particular, theseplaintiffs and other users have a right to receive content thatis criminalized under the Act. 122. Plaintiffs AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ("ALA")and FREEDOM TO READ FOUNDATION ("FTRF") sue on behalf ofthemselves, their members, who are libraries and librariansacross the country, and their members' patrons. These librariesrecognize that the Internet offers their patrons a uniqueopportunity to access information, and many libraries providetheir patrons with facilities the patrons can use to access theInternet. Many libraries also have their own World Wide Websites on the Internet. Thus, in addition to providing patronswith access to the Internet, where they can access informationposted by third parties, libraries post their own material on theInternet. Many libraries post their card catalogues, postinformation about current events, sponsor chat groups, posttextual information or art on the library Web site, or postlicensed online versions of reference and other materials fromtheir library collections. Patrons could, for example, accessthe Web site of a library anywhere in the country to peruse itscard catalogue, review an encyclopedia reference, or check adefinition in the dictionary. These libraries and librarians areinjured by the Act. Because of fear of prosecution, they will bechilled from posting materials on the Internet that might bedeemed "patently offensive" or "indecent" for minors by somecommunities. Given the global and unrestricted nature of theInternet, the lack of precision in the definition of "indecency,"and the past attempts by some persons to ban literature andreference items from library collections, many of ALA's andFTRF's members may choose not to post a substantial amount ofexpressive material at all -- material that many adults mightconsider useful for themselves or their own children -- ratherthan risk prosecution for posting material that someone in someother part of the nation might deem "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for minors. As a result of the Act, the librarypatrons ALA and FTRF members serve will be limited in theconstitutionally protected information that would otherwise beavailable to them on the Internet. These plaintiffs (and theirmembers) sue in their capacity as content providers, accessproviders, and users of the Internet, and on behalf of theirpatrons who are content providers and users of interactivecomputer services. 123. Plaintiffs AOL, COMPUSERVE, MSN, and PRODIGY sueon their own behalf and on behalf of their subscribers. Asonline service providers, these plaintiffs are content providersand access providers, and their customers are content providersand users of the Internet. These plaintiffs create content andmake it available both to their customers and to the entire worldof Internet users. They also allow their customers to createcontent on the Internet (including the creation of personal Webpages). As speakers, these plaintiffs and their customers arechilled by the Act in what they can say on the Internet and ontheir own online services. As access providers, these plaintiffsfear they may be at risk of prosecution under the Act for whatothers say. And as users, these plaintiffs and their customersare limited by the Act to the ability to access only content thatis suitable for a young child. 124. Plaintiff MICROSOFT CORPORATION ("Microsoft")sues on its own behalf as a content provider, access softwareprovider, and user of the Internet. Microsoft provides contenton the Internet through MSN, on its own Web sites, and throughpostings, messages, and other contributions to the Internet. Microsoft's diverse content includes compilations of musical,artistic, literary and encyclopedic information, news and currentevents, and other content. Some of this content might beconsidered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in some communityin the nation, exposing Microsoft to the risk of prosecutionunder the Act. As an access software provider, Microsoft sellsor plans to sell software for accessing and exploring theInternet, for establishing and maintaining Internet servers andrelated services, and for creating Web sites and other Internetcontent. As users, Microsoft and its employees are chilled inwhat they can say and the frankness of their discussion incommunications posted to or transmitted over the Internet, andare exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act. Microsoftbelieves that the defenses provided in Section 502(2) of the Actare provided only to access providers, not to content providersand/or users, and that as to access providers, including accesssoftware providers, they are inadequate, incomplete, and exposeMicrosoft to potential prosecution under the Act. In addition,the chilling effect of the Act on other content providers andusers of the Internet will damage Microsoft by reducing themarket for access software, services software, and content-creation software. 125. Plaintiff APPLE COMPUTER, INC. ("Apple") sues onits own behalf as a content provider, access software providerand user of the Internet. Apple provides content on the Internetthrough eWorld, on its own Web sites, and through postings,messages and other contributions to the Internet. Because of thevagueness of the Act, Apple is uncertain whether some of thiscontent might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" insome community in the nation, exposing Apple to the risk ofprosecution under the Act. As users, Apple and its employees arechilled in what they can say and the frankness of theirdiscussion in communications posted to or transmitted over theInternet, and are exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act. In addition, the chilling effect of the Act on other contentproviders and users of the Internet will damage Apple by reducingthe market for Internet software. 126. Plaintiff COMMERCIAL INTERNET EXCHANGEASSOCIATION ("CIX") sues on behalf of its member Internet serviceproviders ("ISPs") and the customers of their members. CIXmembers typically serve as passive carriers who offer access ortransmission, and related incidental capabilities, for theInternet transmissions of others; as such they are clearlycovered by the defense of § 223(e)(1). However, because ofambiguity in this defense, CIX members who operate news serversthat carry USENET content are uncertain whether they may be heldliable for the content of others that resides temporarily onmembers' USENET news servers, and is accessed by users from suchservers. In addition, many CIX members also assist contentproviders in establishing and operating Web sites. In thiscapacity CIX members will often be at risk of prosecution underthe Act for what others say. Due to fear of prosecution, CIXmembers are chilled from assisting providers of valuable contentthat may be deemed indecent. Furthermore, CIX members have astrong interest in the continued growth of the Internet as ameans of communication, and in their subscribers' rights to freeexpression over the Internet. The Act undermines both interests. 127. Plaintiff NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES,INC. ("NETCOM") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of itssubscribers. As a provider of Internet access and services,NETCOM is both a content provider and an access provider. NETCOM's individual subscribers create content on the Internet,such as through the posting of personal web pages, and make thatcontent available both to their own customers and to the entireworld of Internet users. As speakers, NETCOM and its subscribersare chilled in what they can say on the Internet and on their ownInternet sites. As an access provider, NETCOM cannot controlwhat others say, yet faces the risk of prosecution under the Actfor the speech of others made available through its systems. Asusers of the Internet, NETCOM and its subscribers are limited bythe Act to accessing and producing only content that is suitablefor a young child. 128. Plaintiff OPNET, INC. ("OpNet") sues on its ownbehalf and on behalf of its subscribers. As a provider ofInternet access and services to subscribers, OpNet facesuncertainty as to the applicability of the Act's defenses. OpNetalso fears that it will be construed to have liability forcontent posted by third parties through its systems. 129. Plaintiff INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION("ISA") sues on behalf of its members, who include the majorcommercial online services, and other content providers, accessproviders, and users of the Internet. As with the onlineservices, ISA's members risk prosecution for engaging in, orserving as a conduit for, constitutionally protected speech thatmight be deemed indecent. Accordingly, the Act will chill ISAmembers from exercising their First Amendment rights. 130. Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS("AAP") sues on behalf of its members, who are content providerson, and users of, the Internet. Although rooted in printpublishing, AAP's members are very actively involved in theInternet. AAP's members create electronic products to accompanyand supplement their printed books and journals; create customeducational material on the Internet, publishing on and todemand; communicate with authors and others, receivingmanuscripts, and editing, typesetting, and designing bookselectronically; transmit finished product to licensed end-usercustomers; communicate with bookstores and other wholesale andretail accounts; and promote authors and titles online. Many ofAAP's members have Web sites and provide content to the world onthe Internet. Some of the content provided by AAP's membersmight be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minorsin some communities (as most of the efforts to ban books incommunities have been directed at books published by AAP'smembers). 131. Plaintiff AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS("ASNE") sues on behalf of its members, who are editors of dailynewspapers throughout the United States that, in addition topublications in print form, are now or soon will be published inelectronic formats available to the public on the Internet orthrough online service providers. Historically, the FirstAmendment guarantee of "freedom of the press" has protectednewspapers from government-imposed content restrictions which,like those in the Act, prohibit and punish the dissemination ofmaterials considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" withrespect to non-adult readers. By its terms, however, the Act canbe applied to the press in the same manner that it can be appliedto any other person. ASNE members, who make the editorialdecisions regarding what content will be published in the dailyeditions of their newspapers, are concerned that the Act willrequire them to censor the online version of their print editionsaccording to these vague and overbroad statutory standards,thereby restricting the content of the "electronic" edition ofthe daily newspaper in ways that the First Amendment does nottolerate with respect to the traditional hard-copy print edition. For this reason, ASNE believes the Act imposes an unprecedentedbut very real threat of unconstitutional press censorship whichcould throttle the Internet's potential to greatly enhance thediversity, availability, timeliness, quality, and utility ofdaily newspapers by creating a powerful disincentive forpublication through the use of interactive media technologies. 132. Plaintiff NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA("NAA") files this lawsuit on behalf of its members, a majorityof which are daily newspapers in the United States. Approxi-mately 175 daily newspapers in North America are currentlyavailable on the Internet, via commercial online services orthrough local bulletin board services. As content providers,newspapers have utilized the Internet to provide electronicversions of their printed product. In fact, many newspapersprovide archives of their print product online. As accessproviders, newspapers have established electronic forums forlocal communities to communicate and to conduct business. Whilethe content in newspapers is considered neither indecent norpatently offensive when published on newsprint, it now may bewhen published electronically. The dual standard imposed by theAct will force newspapers to edit out content from publicationsoffered on the Internet -- content that is constitutionallyprotected and not subject to challenge in printed form. In manycases, newspaper publishers will be forced to edit contentcontained in the archived electronic version of the newspaperalready placed on the Internet long before the Act went intoeffect. Thus, the Act will seriously infringe upon the rights ofNAA members to publish constitutionally protected news andinformation. 133. Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF PUBLISHERS, EDITORS ANDWRITERS ("APEW") sues on behalf of its members, who write andpublish in print and online. Members of APEW include the SanFrancisco Guardian, the largest and oldest independently ownedalternative newsweekly in the United States; the Internet PressGuild, an unincorporated association of writers, authors andjournalists who publish their works online; the California FirstAmendment Coalition, a nonprofit, public interest corporationwhose membership comprises approximately 700 individuals andorganizations, including most of California's daily newspapers,many weekly and student newspapers, broadcasters, law firms andothers; and individual writers and editors including Jim Warren,a columnist and advocate for open government, and owner andeditor of the listserv GovAccess; Professor David Farber of theUniversity of Pennsylvania; John Quarterman, a columnist andSecretary of Matrix Information and Directory Services, Inc.; T.Bruce Tober, a freelance writer who researches and writes aboutthe Internet for a variety of print and online publications;Stephanie Stefanac, Editor of MacWorld Online, a monthly tradepublication for users of the Macintosh computer manufactured byApple Computer Co.; and Rogier van Bakel, a Contributing Editorto Wired Magazine. The members of APEW face criminalprosecutions under the Act for the online publication of workswhich some communities might find "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive." The vagueness of the Act leaves APEW membersuncertain whether the publication of their works over theInternet would be a crime. 134. Plaintiff SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTSsues on its own behalf and on behalf of its members. TheSociety's membership produces a tremendous volume of content madeavailable over the Internet: news stories, special interestarticles, columns, and opinion pieces, among many others. Eachyear brings a dramatic increase in the importance of electronicmedia as a venue for distributing the news and opinion piecesproduced by professional journalists. The members of the Societyfear that their right and ability, traditionally protected by theFirst Amendment, to engage in an unfettered marketplace of ideasand expression will be severely compromised by the CommunicationsDecency Act. In addition, the Society operates a listservecalled "SPJ-L," a forum among more than 1,000 Internet users(both Society members and non-members) from roughly 25 countriesto discuss and debate primarily journalism-related issues. Though, or perhaps because, it typically addresses topics of theutmost seriousness and importance for journalists, the languageused in messages posted on SPJ-L can be offensive, harsh, andvulgar. The Society does not edit these messages for content. By continuing to provide this forum for discussion and debate,the Society risks prosecution under the Act. Its members, whosewritings and other speech would be protected by the FirstAmendment in the context of other media, will be chilled by theAct from engaging in constitutionally protected speech over theInternet. 135. Plaintiff HOTWIRED VENTURES LLC ("HotWiredVentures") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of itssubscribers. HotWired Ventures operates an online magazine namedHotwired. Some of HotWired's editorial content might beconsidered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in somecommunities. HotWired features articles containing facts aboutand opinions on popular culture. These articles sometimescontain vulgar language and references to, inter alia, sexualacts and sexual organs. One area of HotWired's editorial focusis cyberspace-related issues, including governmental attempts tocensor and regulate the Internet. These articles sometimesemploy vulgar language in expressing opinions about this topic,and may contain references to, and discussions of, examples ofmaterial that might be deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent"under the Act. In addition, HotWired operates a regular sectioncalled Piazza, an interactive discussion area where members cancommunicate with each other both through asynchronous postingscalled "threads" and in real time "chat rooms," sharing opinionsand engaging in outspoken discourse which can involve vulgarlanguage and may involve sexually explicit subject matter. Plaintiff WIRED VENTURES, LTD. ("Wired Ventures") sues on its ownbehalf and on behalf of its subscribers. Wired Venturespublishes Wired Magazine, a print publication. Like HotWired,Wired publishes articles and short fiction that sometimes containvulgar language and references to sexual acts or sexual organs. Many articles published in Wired are also published online byHotWired. Thus, some articles that are perfectly legal forminors or adults in print form are nevertheless banned from theInternet. The Act creates the anomalous situation that apublication that is a leading commentator on issues and eventsonline may not under the Act be able to publish online articlesabout the Internet that can be published in print. HotWiredVentures and Wired Ventures believe that the Act would severelyinfringe their right to publish constitutionally protectedmaterial and their readers' right to choose to read suchmaterial. 136. Plaintiff AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION("ABA") sues on behalf of its member bookstores (as contentproviders and users) and their patrons (as users of theInternet). Although ABA's members are not "adult bookstores,"many of ABA's members sell materials that deal frankly with thesubject of human sexuality. Some member bookstores have theirown Web pages that discuss the content of books the stores sell. Most member bookstores use the Internet and electroniccommunications to obtain information and excerpts of books frompublishers. ABA members' right to learn about, acquire, anddistribute constitutionally protected materials, and theirpatrons' right to purchase such constitutionally protectedmaterials, will be seriously infringed by the Act. 137. Plaintiff FAMILIES AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP("FAIC") is a national organization of parents dedicated to theproposition that they, not the government, should decide whattheir children should be able see or receive. FAIC sues onbehalf of its members. As parents, FAIC's members are deprivedof the opportunity to raise their children as they see fit. Asusers of the Internet, the Act violates FAIC's members' rights toreceive material suitable for adults. 138. Plaintiff CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION("CIEC") sues on behalf of its members as content providers,access providers, and users of the Internet. In particular, CIECand its members are injured because the Act deprives parents ofthe ability to determine the content their children, includingolder teenagers, should have access to on the Internet. 139. Notwithstanding the defenses set forth in theAct, and the fact that Congress expressly directed courts toconstrue those defenses broadly, plaintiffs reasonably fearprosecution under 47 U.S.C. § 223(d)(1)(B), as enacted by Section502(2), for knowingly permitting their services or computers tobe used to display indecent material in a manner available topersons under age 18, or to transmit such material to specificpersons under age 18. Unless and until the defendants or theCourts make clear that these defenses must be broadly construed,there is nothing to prevent an aggressive prosecutor, in aparticularly intolerant community, from bringing a prosecutionand urging that the defenses be construed more narrowly thanplaintiffs believe Congress intended. 140. For these reasons, plaintiffs reasonably fearthat the defense in 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(1) may not protect onlineservice providers from criminal conviction for indecentexpression by third parties when that expression is located onthe providers' computers (such as when an individual computeruser posts a vulgar message to an online discussion). Plaintiffsreasonably fear that the defense may apply only to the extent anonline service acts as a mere conduit to enable its subscribersto gain access to another network. 141. The speech at issue in this case is fullyprotected by the First Amendment. "Indecent" speech or "patentlyoffensive" communications, while considered by some to beoffensive or sexually suggestive, are not obscene. Such speechcan have serious literary, artistic, political or other merit,and thus has considerable value to adults and to society as awhole. 142. The Internet, and cyberspace generally, carries asignificant amount of communications, images and text that mightbe deemed inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" foryounger children (for example, in elementary school), but whichwould not, under the same community standards, be deemedinappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" for olderminors (for example, in high school or early college). The Actmakes no distinction between these age groups, and wouldcriminalize a university professor's distribution -- using theuniversity's interactive computer service -- of "indecent" butclassic works of literature to a 17-year-old freshman. 143. Dissemination of many of the same communicationswhose dissemination via interactive computer services is madecriminal by the Act would not be unlawful if disseminated bytraditional print media (e.g., newspaper or magazine) or by usingthe United States mail. Thus, many of the very samecommunications the Act makes it unlawful to make available tominors through interactive computer services can lawfully be madeavailable through other media, and are, in fact, so available. 144. Any government regulation of "indecent" or"patently offensive" speech may withstand constitutional scrutinyonly if it both serves a "compelling interest" and is "the leastrestrictive means" to advance that interest, and only if thebenefit gained from the Act outweighs the loss ofconstitutionally protected rights. 145. The government has no legitimate, much less"compelling," interest in preventing adults from sending orreceiving "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech. Thegovernment has no legitimate, much less "compelling," interest inpreventing older children from sending or receiving speech thatwould only be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" ifcommunicated to younger children. 146. One legitimate interest the government does have-- and the only interest articulated in the Act (§ 509, to becodified at 47 U.S.C. § 230) -- is to assist parents insupervising their children's access to expressive materials. TheAct does not, however, further that interest. Indeed, the Actinterferes with that interest because parents who decide theirchildren, whether 7 or 17, should have access to some materialsthat some community might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive"for those children are prevented from exercising their parentaljudgment by the Act's blanket prohibition on all access by allpersons under 18 to all such materials. 147. Even if the government had a legitimate interest,more broadly, in preventing interactive computer service accessby all persons under 18 to communications that some communitymight deem "indecent" or "patently offensive" to them, the Actwould not materially further that interest. Among other things,communications of foreign origin are freely accessible on theInternet, and the United States government has no means toprosecute foreign content-providers for violation of the Act, orto deter such postings. Furthermore, existing statutes and otherprovisions in the Act already prohibit the use of computers todisseminate obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech,enticing or luring minors into inappropriate activities, andother speech that is not protected even for adults. 148. Even if the Act could be viewed as substantiallyfurthering a compelling governmental interest in protectingminors from "indecent" or "patently offensive" communications, itis not the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. The screening and blocking tools described above achieve thatinterest far more effectively than does the Act itself, and withno adverse impact on the constitutional rights of adults. Efforts by government to spur the further development of suchtools would further the claimed governmental interest moredirectly and materially than does the Act. 149. Even if the Act could be viewed as the leastrestrictive means to further a compelling governmental interestin protecting minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive"communications, any benefit gained from the Act would be faroutweighed by the loss of constitutionally protected rights ofadults, because only some applications of the Act will in factprotect minors, but every application of the Act will punish ordeter speech that is constitutionally protected for adults.

Under the proposal,products will be reviewed to verify that they satisfy thecriteria and, if so, they will be transferred to the CommodityControl List administered by the Department of Commerce where theproducts can be exported under a general license (in much thesame way that 40-bit RC2/RC4 encryption is licensed today).We are working toward creating broadly stated criteria that arein the nature of performance specifications.  To meet thesecriteria, encryption products will need to implement key escrowmechanisms that cannot be readily altered or bypassed so as todefeat the purposes of key escrowing.The criteria, when finalized and published, will state theobjectives, but not the exact technical method(s), by which thoseobjectives are satisfied.  This is to provide software publishersthe flexibility to design methods for meeting our statedobjectives in a manner that is compatible with the design oftheir products.  There are, therefore, a number of questions wemust work together to answer in order to draft effectivecriteria.  These questions are:*    Avoiding multiple encryption -- How can the product be     designed so as to prevent doubling (or tripling, etc.) the     key space of the algorithm?*    Disabling the key escrow mechanism -- How can products be     made resistant to alteration that would disable or     circumvent the key escrow mechanism?  How can the "static     patch" problem be avoided?  How can this be tested?*    Access to escrow information -- What mechanisms must be     designed into encryption products to allow authorized access     to escrowed keys?  This likely includes the identity of the     key escrow agent(s) and a serial number for the key escrow     agent to use to identify the key(s)/component(s) necessary     to decrypt the message.  What other information will be     necessary to be provided to the escrow agent to identify the     necessary key(s)/component(s)?  Are there other comparable     viable approaches?*    Non-escrowed use -- How can products be made so that they do     not function with non-escrowed products (or tampered     escrowed products)?  How can this be tested?*    Limiting surveillance -- How can products be designed so     that information both sent and received by the user can be     decrypted without release of keys of other users?*    Practical Key Access -- How can mechanisms be designed so     that repeated involvement of escrow agents is not required     for decryption for multiple files/messages during the     specified access period?*    Assurance that keys are escrowed -- How can it be assured     that key escrow products are indeed satisfactorily escrowed?     For example, products could be required to be escrowed at     time of manufacture or be made inoperable until properly     escrowed.*    Ability to re-escrow keys -- How can products be designed so     that new keys can be escrowed at the user's discretion with     a U.S. Government approved escrow agent?*    Certified escrow agents -- Can products be designed so that     only escrow agents certified by the U.S. government     (domestic, or under suitable arrangements, foreign) are     utilized?  What should be the criteria for an acceptable     U.S. escrow agent?                         --------------With your input, we are hopeful that this effort will lead todefinitive criteria, which will facilitate the development ofexportable products and help minimize the time required to obtainexport licenses.  The Administration seeks to finalize suchcriteria and make formal conforming modifications to the exportregulations before the end of 1995.

On the same date, the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting atNIST was also announced.  The two principal topics at the meetingwill be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bitsoftware key escrow encryption and 2) desirable characteristicsfor key escrow agents. In order to help make most productive use of the limited timeavailable at the upcoming meeting and to better focusdeliberation, the following criteria are being distributed fordiscussion purposes.  Since it is important that final criteriabe clear, straightforward, consistent, and implementable, pleasereview these draft criteria and be prepared to discuss how they may be refined and made more specific.                            --- Draft Export Criteria ---for Software Key Escrow Encryption Software key escrow encryption products meeting the followingcriteria will be granted special export licensing treatmentsimilar to that afforded other mass-market software products withencryption.  1.    The product will use an unclassified encryption algorithm      (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits.2.    The product shall be designed to prevent multiple      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).3.    The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be      accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product,      and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in      accordance with #10.  If such keys are not escrowed during      manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key      is escrowed in accordance with #10.4.    The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with      each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by      authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow      agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow      agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to      decrypt that message.5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a      block of code by a modified block).6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.7.    The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's      encrypted information regardless of whether that user is      the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted      information.8.    The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated      involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of      multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized      access.9.    In the event any such product is or may be available in the      United States, each production copy of the software shall      either have a unique key required for decrypting messages      or files that is escrowed in accordance with #10, or have      the capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and      any new key to be escrowed in accordance with #10.10.   The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only with      escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or by      foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has      formal agreements consistent with U.S. law enforcement and      national security requirements.Note: Software products incorporating additional encryptionmethods other than key escrow encryption methods will beevaluated for export on the basis of each encryption methodincluded, as is already the case with existing products. Accordingly, these criteria apply only to the key escrowencryption method incorporated by a software product, and not toother non-escrowed encryption methods it may incorporate.  Forinstance, non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bitsor less will continue to be exportable under existing exportregulations.

This new medium raises fundamental questions about the appropriate balance between the needs of the market, of American families, and basic constitutional free speech and privacy guarantees that Americans value so deeply. In order to protect families and children in this open, global network, we should first rely on the entrepreneurial spirit of the interactive services market to build parental empowerment tools, and encourage the industry to work together to ensure that such solutions are widely available. The interactive media market must not be regulated like telegraphs, broadcast radio and television, and telephones, thereby stifling the development of an important new communications medium with burdensome regulations. Rather, we should identify policies that enable the interactive media market to flourish like the personal computer industry, and provide parents the ability to protect their children from inappropriate material that is internationally-available. In answer to questions posed to the Interactive Working Group by Senator Patrick Leahy earlier this year, this report contains an assessment of: general policy issues at stake in the regulation of content on the National Information Infrastructure; software and services available today that enable parents to restrict their children from access to inappropriate material online; the current state of criminal law regarding obscenity, child pornography, and harassment online; threats to free speech, free press and individual privacy raised by proposed regulation of indecency in interactive media. We begin with a brief overview of the contents of the report: A. A New Regulatory Model for Interactive Media is needed to Ensure Free Speech and Continued Innovation in the National and International Information Infrastructure The Internet is a global information and communications system which is becoming a critical resource for organizations and individuals around the world. Businesses, schools, libraries, researchers, community groups, and individuals are all coming to rely on the Internet as a vital communications system and information resource. The Internet and other interactive media include electronic mail, the World Wide Web, online discussion groups, and other multimedia information resources. Providers of interactive media services range from large and small online services and bulletin boards, to those who provide services for their own use such as schools, libraries, and large and small businesses. To ensure the continued growth of the new interactive media market, national policy for the Internet must: preserve the vibrant free market in interactive media, free from regulation of constitutionally-protected communications and information; preserve full constitutional free speech and privacy protections in new interactive media; encourage the industry to work together to develop blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children's access to offensive material; ensure emerging media not be used for criminal activity such as stalking, trafficking in obscenity, and the creation of child pornography. B. Currently Available Blocking and Filtering Technology, combined with public education, can empower parents to protect their children from inappropriate material online While the vast majority of content on the Internet is intended for legitimate educational, cultural, political, or entertainment value. Some material on the Internet, however, may not be appropriate for children. Moreover, much of this material is accessible from the United States but transmitted from other countries, beyond the practical reach of U.S. law. In order to protect children we must rely on powerful new blocking and filtering technology to empower parents to make choices about the material which their children can access. Entrepreneurial effort has already produced blocking and filtering products for families and schools: The inherent power of computer software allows the creation of computer programs which enable parents to block material from the reach of their children automatically, without the need for constant parental supervision. Such software can be easily installed by parents, even those who are not computer experts. The global and decentralized nature of interactive media requires new approaches to child protection: Censorship of centralized media such as radio and television may be effective at keeping the "seven dirty words" off the airwaves. However, on the Internet, with tens of millions of content creators all over the world, US law, no matter how tough, will never be able to keep offensive material out of the reach of kids. Industry-wide initiatives are developing standard label and blocking conventions to increase the effectiveness of blocking: The flexibility of interactive media allows multiple rating systems to co-exist so that individuals and families can chose a rating system that best reflects their own values. No single government-mandated system could be as comprehensive or flexible as voluntary private sector alternatives. Individual and parental choice assures full respect for the free speech rights in interactive media: Relying on individuals and parents, not the government, to make choices about the content that they and their families receive assures maximum respect for First Amendment rights of adults to receive and transmit constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not federal bureaucrats, to determine what information is most consistent with their own moral values. Any changes in federal law should seek to remove the Hobson's choice faced by all who provide access to the Internet. In order to protect children, legal disincentives facing those who would create 'child safe' areas should be removed. Recent case law discourages online providers from screening material that is inappropriate for children: In the recent Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Company, No. 31063/94 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 24, 1995) case, Prodigy was found to be a "publisher" of libelous statements made by a subscriber on one of its online bulletin boards. Such added exposure to legal liability is a substantial disincentive to the creation of 'child safe' interactive services. Neither federal nor state law should punish service providers for creating child-safe services. The marketplace should be free to create a variety of online forums, some that provide only material appropriate for children, and others that are more open and designed for a wider audience. C. There is No Anarchy in Interactive Media: Vigorous enforcement of current criminal laws will protect all users from obscenity, child pornography, and harassment online Law enforcement agencies and some prominent pro-family groups agree current laws already enable prosecutions of online obscenity violations. More vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws may, however, be necessary. Following this logic, it is unnecessary to amend federal law to prohibit distribution of obscenity by computer, since existing law already criminalizes such conduct, as well as threats and harassment by computer. The Department of Justice and American Family Association state that existing laws already criminalize obscenity online. Tough obscenity, child pornography and harassment laws are already in the federal criminal code: Under existing Federal law trafficking in obscenity (18 U.S.C. ��1462, 1464, 1466), child pornography (18 U.S.C. �2252), harassment (18 U.S.C. �875(c)), illegal solicitation or luring of minors (18 U.S.C. �2423(b)), and threatening to injure someone (18 U.S.C. �875(c)) have already been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer networks. Online obscenity and child pornography crimes are being prosecuted around the country: These laws are being enforced, as is evident by numerous prosecutions around the country. The Senate-passed legislative proposals fail to add any protections against online stalking and child solicitation: Everyone is concerned about protecting children from threats online and off. Ironically, the Senate-passed Communications Decency Amendment only punishes indecency and obscenity, not stalking or solicitation. Neither prosecutors nor police receive any additional help in the prevention or prosecution of online crimes against children. D. Bans on indecent communications online are unconstitutional The unique nature of interactive media demands that policy makers carefully evaluate the application of the First Amendment in a new light. Essential to the Court's approval of indecency restrictions in the broadcast media was the fact that listeners had insufficient control over programming to which they were exposed. Any effort to impose similar indecency restrictions on interactive media, however, will not pass constitutional scrutiny given the high degree of user control in this new medium. To assure the First Amendment free flow of information and protect individual privacy rights, liability for online service providers must be carefully limited: If online system and service providers are held criminally liable for obscene or indecent material created by their users, and not intentionally purveyed by the provider, then public service providers and private system operators will be forced to become private censors in order to limit their own legal risk. Just as current law limits the liability of phone companies, mail services, and other carriers for the content of material which the carrier merely transports, online service provider liability should be limited in order to assure the free flow of information on the National Information Infrastructure. Ability of users and parents to control the material to which they have access places constitutional limits on the degree to which the government can censor material based on its content: The First Amendment has been interpreted to allow restrictions on indecent speech only if such government restrictions are the "least restrictive means" of protecting children or accomplishing other important government goals. Given that parents are able to protect their children from unwanted material using screening tools, government restrictions are unnecessary and therefore unconstitutional. Online service providers should not be forced to become private censors: If online services or individual system operators are held liable for all of their users' communications, the services will be forced to impose stringent censorship rules on their users in order to limit the corporate liability of the service provider. Such rules would create a chilling effect on users of interactive media. There are great constitutional difficulties in defining "indecency": Neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court have ever established a single definition for what constitutes "indecent" material. The FCC has offered different definitions for indecency depending on the communications medium. Embarking on such a process for interactive media would be fraught with Constitutional disputes and challenges in court. Efforts to ban indecency on dial-a-porn services lead to ten years of constitutional litigation, thus delaying the enforcement of those regulations considerably. The Federal Communications Commission should not be given power to regulate content in interactive media: The inherent complexity and constitutional difficulties of regulating indecency would involve the FCC in lengthy and burdensome rulemaking to implement any indecency ban. Such extension of FCC control over new media will create unnecessary bureaucratic intrusions that hinder the development of new interactive media and private sector screening options.

Nearly ten yearsago, we began work on the Electronic Communications Priva cy Act ("ECPA"), in recognition of the fact that new computer and communications technologies would only flourish in an environment where the privacy rights of users, the intellectual property rights of content providers, and the obligations of service pr oviders are clear under statute. We continued that work last year in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA"). Today, as interactivecommunications systems expand in the consumer market, there is a critical need to clarify the First Amendment rights and responsibilities of information providers, users and carriers. As you know, a number of bills have been introduced in the Senate that would regulate a wide range of controversial content on interactive information services, including the Internet. This legislation is motivated by two important goals. First, parents s hould be able to control their children's access to controversial material. Second, adult users should be able to exercise reasonable control over the information they receive so they may avoid material offense to them.The proposed legislative solutions to achieve these goals raise serious concerns about the free flow of information in new communications media, and threaten to squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new industry along with it. I understand that industry and public interest organizations have independently come together to form the Interactive Working Group in order to address these issues. My hope is that the group will explore public policy and technology options for addressin g the problems of children's access to obscene content in a manner which promotes parental empowerment and First Amendment values. I would appreciate the Interactive Working group Consideration of and recommendation onthe following issues: 1. THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: What effect will content regulation have on the development of the national and global information infrastructure, including the Internet and other interactive services? 2. CURRENT LAW AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: What is the current lawregulating obscenity and harassment online? What gaps, if any, are there in current federal and state laws which hamper prosecution of criminal activity, including violations ofthe copyright and obscenity laws, in interactive media ? 3. TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS: Does interactive technology enable parents to control their children's access to information in online services today? If not, what steps would be required to enable such parental control? Can the Working Group provide demonstrations of these user control technologies? 4. CONSTITUTIONAL FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY ISSUES: What are the First Amendment implications of content regulation in interactive media? What is the impact of carrier liability for content on ECPA, CALEA and constitutional privacy protections? Since the passage of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and again in CALEA, we have always worked to assure a proper balance of constitutional liberties, competitiveness and legitimate government interest in the regulation of new communications te chnologies. As I receive input from a number of sources on these important issues, I look forward to your advice as well. My staff is available to meet with members of your group to discuss these issues further.

Lewis (Posted With Permission From The Author) In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood pressure, thedebate over data encryption has not yet reached the same levels as guncontrol. But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set the stagefor an equally divisive national debate over the rights of businesses andindividuals to keep secrets when using telephones, computers and otherforms of electronic communications. In effect, the Administration drew a line in the virtual sands ofcyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit Americans to putstronger cryptographic locks on their electronic data only if a spare keyto those locks is made available on demand to law enforcement agencies. There looms the conflict. Although the current debate is aboutexport controls on an esoteric form of software that most Americans do notuse, the "export" issue is ultimately irrelevant in today's era of globalelectronic voice and data networks, where passwords, not passports, arechecked at the gates. Simply placing a common privacy program on anInternet-connected computer in Austin, Tex., is effectively no differentfrom sending a shrink-wrapped copy of the program to Moscow. The real issue is how much privacy the Government is willing toallow its own citizens, and the latest word from the Clinton Administrationis that the right to electronic privacy, like the right to bear arms, isnot absolute. *** Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this digital era,secret writing applies not just to notes handed from one spy to another,but also to telephone calls between individuals, funds transfers betweenbanks, bank and credit card records, electronic mail, faxes, and an endlessvariety of computer files. The Clinton Administration has been clear and consistent inoutlining its basic position on cryptographic systems. The goal is to allowAmerican citizens and companies to use the strongest possible cryptographictechnology, while at the same time preserving the ability of lawenforcement agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of theeffort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child pornographers and othermiscreants. In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too strong. One way to measure the strength of cryptographic software is thelength of the software key necessary to encode and decode a message. Thelonger the key, in terms of digital bits, the harder it is for anunauthorized user to decipher the message. In recent years, the Government has generally permitted Americansto export cryptographic software with key lengths up to 40 bits. Expertssay that 40-bit keys are secure from casual snooping, but will fall quicklyto a determined codebreaker. The fact that the Government allows 40-bitencryption systems to be exported is a pretty good indication that theNational Security Agency can break them easily. There are literally hundreds of stronger cryptography programsreadily available outside the United States, and these stronger programsare attractive to businesses that want to safeguard their data fromInternet bandits and corporate and government spies. Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis of thesoftware export controls issue, the Government unveiled what it said wasthe best possible compromise. Under the new policy, companies can export encryption algorithmsusing 64-bit keys, which are much more secure, but only if spare keys aremade available to law enforcement agents under standard legal procedures.Otherwise, the 40-bit limit continues to apply. The "spare key" technology, officially known as key escrow, isanathema to many privacy advocates who fear Government abuses. TheGovernment first proposed a key escrow system with its so-called ClipperChip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a voluntarystandard. Unlike Clipper, which was based on a classified algorithm calledSkipjack that only a few people outside the Government were allowed toexamine, the new policy allows people to use any algorithm they choose --as long as it uses a key no larger than 64 bits, and as long as the keysare entrusted to a domestic third party accessible to the Government, andas long as the key escrow mechanisms cannot be readily altered or bypassed. Also unlike Clipper, which required a special tamper-proofmicroprocessor that would have added cost, complexity and extra powerrequirements to communications devices, the new proposals can beimplemented entirely in software. Key escrow systems make a lot of sense for most American companies,at least for internal use. Having a spare set of keys lessens the risk of adisgruntled employee or saboteur locking up vital company files. But key escrow is also unpopular with American computer andsoftware companies, who say it prevents them from competing against foreigncompanies that have no similar constraints, and with many multinationalcorporations, who say it prevents them from working with foreign companiesthat don't especially care for the idea of Uncle Sam holding the keys totheir data banks. "If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't thinkit achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Distinguished Engineer atSun Microsystems who attended the meetings. "I didn't see anybody who wasenthusiastic." *** Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of NIST, suggested that thehearings last week were intended to elicit public comment, and that theAdministration's final position on cryptographic policy are still underanalysis. However, the emergence of key escrow issues at the NIST proceedingssuggest that key escrow is emerging as a non-negotiable demand by somefactions of the Clinton Administration, especially the Justice Departmentand the Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh. Mr. Freehsincerely believes that data encryption is a weapon, and has publiclycalled for domestic restrictions on civilian cryptography. "If this fails," said one observer familiar with the Administration's thinking on the proposed change in cryptographic policy, "it's going to lead to a very devisive debate. And the irony, for libertarians who oppose key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced that Louis Freeh cannot be true to his job without proposing domesticcontrols on data encryption." "He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is theJustice Department," said the observer, who spoke on the condition he notbe identified. Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has yetarrived at a concrete position, even after more than a year of study anddebate. "I don't think it's a final offer," said John Gilmore, a member ofthe board of directors of Cygnus Support Inc., a computer company inMountain View, Calif. "It looks to me like a weak strawman, a first offer,a proposal to dance." The question is whether American citizens and businesses have thepatience to wait for the music to start. And the issue may be moot, anyway. "The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided to ignoreexport controls in designing the security infrastructure for the nextgeneration of Internet protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998will provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication, withoutkey escrow, internationally. The protocols will be implementedindependently in a dozen different countries." In other words, the international Internet community is alreadyplanning to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by theClinton Administration. Cryptography that is stronger and better than theGovernment's proposed system will become an integral part of the Internet,and American companies and individuals would be foolish not to use it. At that point, millions of Americans will come in direct conflictwith Government policy, and the popular gun-control bumper sticker may bereplaced by one that says, "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws willhave cryptography."

INTRODUCTION                       Procedural Background          Before us are motions for a preliminary injunctionfiled by plaintiffs who challenge on constitutional grounds provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA or "theAct"), which constitutes Title V of the Telecommunications Act of1996, signed into law by the President on February 8, 1996.[1] Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104,  502, 110Stat. 56, 133-35.  Plaintiffs include various organizations andindividuals who, inter alia, are associated with the computerand/or communications industries, or who publish or postmaterials on the Internet, or belong to various citizen groups. See ACLU Complaint ( 7-26), ALA First Amended Complaint ( 3,12-33).            The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, theAttorney General of the United States, and the United StatesDepartment of Justice.  For convenience, we will refer to thesedefendants as the Government.  Plaintiffs contend that the twochallenged provisions of the CDA that are directed tocommunications over the Internet which might be deemed "indecent"or "patently offensive" for minors, defined as persons under theage of eighteen, infringe upon rights protected by the FirstAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.          Plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 96-963, in which thelead plaintiff is the American Civil Liberties Union (theACLU),[2] filed their action in the United States District Courtfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the day the Act wassigned, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoinenforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15,1996, following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L.Buckwalter, to whom the case had been assigned, granted a limitedtemporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum that 47U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B) ("the indecency provision" of the CDA) wasunconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief Judge DoloresK. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit, having been requested by the parties andthe district court to convene a three-judge court, pursuant to 561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a court consisting of, inaddition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of the samedistrict, and herself, as the circuit judge required by 28 U.S.C. 2284.          After a conference with the court, the parties enteredinto a stipulation, which the court approved on February 26,1996, wherein the Attorney General agreed that:          she will not initiate any investigations or          prosecutions for violations of 47 U.S.C.           223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment          of this provision until the three-judge court          hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary          Injunction . . . and has decided the motion.The Attorney General's commitment was qualified to the extent that:          her full authority to investigate or          prosecute any violation of  223(a)(1)(B), as          amended, and  223(d) as to conduct which          occurs or occurred during any period of time          after enactment of these provisions          (including for the period of time to which          this stipulation applies) should the Court          deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is          granted, should these provisions ultimately          be upheld.Stipulation,  4, in C.A. No. 96-963.          Shortly thereafter, the American Library Association,Inc. (the ALA) and others[3] filed a similar action at C.A. No.96-1458.  On February 27, 1996, Chief Judge Sloviter, againpursuant to  561(a) of the CDA and upon request, convened thesame three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2284.  The actionswere consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), "for allmatters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminaryinjunction in these cases, including the hearing on suchmotions."          The parties were afforded expedited discovery inconnection with the motions for preliminary injunction, and theycooperated with Judge Dalzell, who had been assigned the casemanagement aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery wasproceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the courtbegan receiving evidence at the consolidated hearings which wereconducted on March 21 and 22, and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  Inorder to expedite the proceedings, the parties worked closelywith Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of theunderlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief beforethe court by sworn declarations, so that the hearings werelargely devoted to cross-examination of certain of the witnesseswhose declarations had been filed.  The parties submittedproposed findings of fact and post-hearing memoranda on April 29,and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.[4]                   Statutory Provisions at Issue          Plaintiffs focus their challenge on two provisions ofsection 502 of the CDA which amend 47 U.S.C.  223(a) and223(d).          Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any personin interstate or foreign communications who, "by means of atelecommunications device,"[5] "knowingly . . . makes, creates, orsolicits" and "initiates the transmission" of "any comment,request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication whichis obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of thecommunication is under 18 years of age," "shall be criminallyfined or imprisoned." (emphasis added).            Section 223(d)(1) ("the patently offensive provision"),makes it a crime to use an "interactive computer service"[6] to"send" or "display in a manner available" to a person under age18, "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or othercommunication that, in context, depicts or describes, in termspatently offensive as measured by contemporary communitystandards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardlessof whether the user of such service placed the call or initiatedthe communication."           Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds theprovisions in  223(a)(2) and  223(d)(2), which make it a crimefor anyone to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunications facilityunder [his or her] control to be used for any activityprohibited" in  223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1).  The challengedprovisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two yearsimprisonment, or both for each offense.            Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with thestatute to the extent that it covers obscenity or childpornography, which were already proscribed before the CDA'sadoption.  See 18 U.S.C.  1464-65 (criminalizing obscenematerial); id.  2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography); seealso New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v.California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).          Plaintiffs in the ACLU action also challenge theprovision of the CDA that criminalizes speech over the Internetthat transmits information about abortions or abortifacient drugsand devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C.  1462(c).  Thatsection now prohibits the sending and receiving of informationover the Internet by any means regarding "where, how, or of whom,or by what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing designed,adapted, or intended for producing abortion] may be obtained ormade".  The Government has stated that it does not contestplaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of the provision ofthe CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C.  1462(c).[7]           As part of its argument that the CDA passesconstitutional muster, the Government cites the CDA's "safeharbor" defenses in new  223(e) of 47 U.S.C., which provides:          (e)  Defenses          In addition to any other defenses available          by law:               (1)  No person shall be held to have violated          subsection (a) or (d) of this section solely for          providing access or connection to or from a          facility, system, or network not under that          person's control, including transmission,          downloading, intermediate storage, access          software, or other related capabilities that are          incidental to providing such access or connection          that does not include the creation of the content          of the communication.               (2)  The defenses provided by paragraph (1)          of this subsection shall not be applicable to a          person who is a conspirator with an entity          actively involved in the creation or knowing          distribution of communications that violate this          section, or who knowingly advertises the          availability of such communications.               (3)  The defenses provided in paragraph (1)          of this subsection shall not be applicable to a          person who provides access or connection to a          facility, system, or network engaged in the          violation of this section that is owned or          controlled by such person.               (4)  No employer shall be held liable under          this section for the actions of an employee or          agent unless the employee's or agent's conduct is          within the scope of his or her employment or          agency and the employer (A) having knowledge of          such conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct,          or (B) recklessly disregards such conduct.               (5)  It is a defense to a prosecution under          subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d) of this section, or          under subsection (a)(2) of this section with          respect to the use of a facility for an activity          under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person --               (A)  has taken, in good faith, reasonable,          effective, and appropriate actions under the          circumstances to restrict or prevent access by          minors to a communication specified in such          subsections, which may involve any appropriate          measures to restrict minors from such          communications, including any method which is          feasible under available technology; or               (B)  has restricted access to such          communication by requiring use of a verified          credit card, debit account, adult access code, or          adult personal identification number.               (6)  The [Federal Communications] Commission          may describe measures which are reasonable,          effective, and appropriate to restrict access to          prohibited communications under subsection (d) of          this section.  Nothing in this section authorizes          the Commission to enforce, or is intended to          provide the Commission with the authority to          approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such          measures.  The Commission shall have no          enforcement authority over the failure to utilize          such measures. . . .                                II.                         FINDINGS OF FACT          All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legalquestions at issue in these cases, it is necessary to have aclear understanding of the exponentially growing, worldwidemedium that is the Internet, which presents unique issuesrelating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence anddue process requirements to this new and evolving method ofcommunication.  For this reason all parties insisted on havingextensive evidentiary hearings before the three-judge court.     The court's Findings of fact are made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.52(a).  The history and basic technology of this medium are notin dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the followingFindings of fact are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs ofa stipulation[8] the parties filed with the court.[9]                     The Nature of Cyberspace  The Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace          1.   The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity,but rather a giant network which interconnects innumerablesmaller groups of linked computer networks.  It is thus a networkof networks.  This is best understood if one considers what alinked group of computers -- referred to here as a "network" --is, and what it does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and areoften called "local area networks").  For example, in many UnitedStates Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for thepurpose of exchanging files and messages (and to share equipmentsuch as printers).  These are networks.            2.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked toother computers or networks.  Many networks, however, areconnected to other networks, which are in turn connected to othernetworks in a manner which permits each computer in any networkto communicate with computers on any other network in the system. This global Web of linked networks and computers is referred toas the Internet.          3.  The nature of the Internet is such that it is verydifficult, if not impossible, to determine its size at a givenmoment.  It is indisputable, however, that the Internet hasexperienced extraordinary growth in recent years.  In 1981, fewerthan 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 1989, thenumber stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over1,000,000 computers were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 hostcomputers worldwide, of which approximately 60 percent locatedwithin the United States, are estimated to be linked to theInternet.  This count does not include the personal computerspeople use to access the Internet using modems.  In all,reasonable estimates are that as many as 40 million people aroundthe world can and do access the enormously flexible communicationInternet medium.  That figure is expected to grow to 200 millionInternet users by the year 1999.           4.  Some of the computers and computer networks thatmake up the Internet are owned by governmental and publicinstitutions, some are owned by non-profit organizations, andsome are privately owned.  The resulting whole is adecentralized, global medium of communications -- or "cyberspace"-- that links people, institutions, corporations, and governmentsaround the world.  The Internet is an international system.  Thiscommunications medium allows any of the literally tens ofmillions of people with access to the Internet to exchangeinformation.  These communications can occur almostinstantaneously, and can be directed either to specificindividuals, to a broader group of people interested in aparticular subject, or to the world as a whole.          5.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as anexperimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency("ARPA"), and was called ARPANET.  This network linked computersand computer networks owned by the military, defense contractors,and university laboratories conducting defense-related research. The network later allowed researchers across the country toaccess directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputerslocated at a few key universities and laboratories.  As itevolved far beyond its research origins in the United States toencompass universities, corporations, and people around theworld, the ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," andfinally just the "Internet."          6.  From its inception, the network was designed to bea decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant linksbetween computers and computer networks, capable of rapidlytransmitting communications without direct human involvement orcontrol, and with the automatic ability to re-routecommunications if one or more individual links were damaged orotherwise unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant systemof linked computers was designed to allow vital research andcommunications to continue even if portions of the network weredamaged, say, in a war.          7.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (andultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouragedthe creation of multiple links to and from each computer (orcomputer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located inWashington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicatedtelephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or onthe Eastern seaboard.  Each of those computers could in turn belinked to other computers, which themselves would be linked toother computers.          8.  A communication sent over this redundant series oflinked computers could travel any of a number of routes to itsdestination.  Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sentto a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to acomputer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and SaltLake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the messagecould not travel along that path (because of military attack,simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message wouldautomatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) bere-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and thento Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, andfinally to Palo Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing,would likely occur in a matter of seconds.          9.   Messages between computers on the Internet do notnecessarily travel entirely along the same path.  The Internetuses "packet switching" communication protocols that allowindividual messages to be subdivided into smaller "packets" thatare then sent independently to the destination, and are thenautomatically reassembled by the receiving computer.  While allpackets of a given message often travel along the same path tothe destination, if computers along the route become overloaded,then packets can be re-routed to less loaded computers.          10.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (itsubsequently ceased to exist), similar networks developed to linkuniversities, research facilities, businesses, and individualsaround the world.  These other formal or loose networks includedBITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET.  Eventually, each of thesenetworks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linkedtogether, allowing users of any computers linked to any one ofthe networks to transmit communications to users of computers onother networks.  It is this series of linked networks (themselveslinking computers and computer networks) that is today commonlyknown as the Internet.          11.  No single entity -- academic, corporate,governmental, or non-profit -- administers the Internet.  Itexists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds ofthousands of separate operators of computers and computernetworks independently decided to use common data transferprotocols to exchange communications and information with othercomputers (which in turn exchange communications and informationwith still other computers).  There is no centralized storagelocation, control point, or communications channel for theInternet, and it would not be technically feasible for a singleentity to control all of the information conveyed on theInternet.                How Individuals Access the Internet          12.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues toaccess cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular.  Interms of physical access, there are two common methods toestablish an actual link to the Internet.  First, one can use acomputer or computer terminal that is directly (and usuallypermanently) connected to a computer network that is itselfdirectly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second, onecan use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to connect over atelephone line to a larger computer or computer network that isitself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Asdetailed below, both direct and modem connections are madeavailable to people by a wide variety of academic, governmental,or commercial entities.          13.  Students, faculty, researchers, and othersaffiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities inthe United States can access the Internet through theireducational institutions.  Such access is often via directconnection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using amodem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campuslocation.  Some colleges and universities install "ports" oroutlets for direct network connections in each dormitory room orprovide access via computers located in common areas indormitories.  Such access enables students and professors to useinformation and content provided by the college or universityitself, and to use the vast amount of research resources andother information available on the Internet worldwide.          14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access aresufficiently important to many corporations and other employersthat those employers link their office computer networks to theInternet and provide employees with direct or modem access to theoffice network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might beused by, for example, a corporation involved in scientific ormedical research or manufacturing to enable corporate employeesto exchange information and ideas with academic researchers intheir fields.          15.  Those who lack access to the Internet throughtheir schools or employers still have a variety of ways they canaccess the Internet.  Many communities across the country haveestablished "free-nets" or community networks to provide theircitizens with a local link to the Internet (and to provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first suchcommunity network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community ComputerSystem, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist inscores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at littleor no cost via modem connection or by using computers availablein community buildings.  Free-nets are often operated by a locallibrary, educational institution, or non-profit community group.          16.  Individuals can also access the Internet throughmany local libraries.  Libraries often offer patrons use ofcomputers that are linked to the Internet.  In addition, somelibraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. Increasingly, patrons now use library services and resourceswithout ever physically entering the library itself.  Librariestypically provide such direct or modem access at no cost to theindividual user.            17.  Individuals can also access the Internet bypatronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffeeshops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- canuse computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.  SuchInternet access is typically provided by the shop for a smallhourly fee.           18.  Individuals can also access the Internet throughcommercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" thattypically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computernetwork linked to the Internet.  Many such providers -- includingthe members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however,are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low costaccess to the Internet.  For example, the International InternetAssociation offers free modem access to the Internet uponrequest.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profitassociations offer Internet access as a service to members.           19.  Another common way for individuals to access theInternet is through one of the major national commercial "onlineservices" such as America Online, CompuServe, the MicrosoftNetwork, or Prodigy.  These online services offer nationwidecomputer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a localtelephone number), and the services provide extensive and wellorganized content within their own proprietary computer networks. In addition to allowing access to the extensive content availablewithin each online service, the services also allow subscribersto link to the much larger resources of the Internet.  Fullaccess to the online service (including access to the Internet)can be obtained for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The majorcommercial online services have almost twelve million individualsubscribers across the United States.          20.  In addition to using the national commercialonline services, individuals can also access the Internet usingsome (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computerservices, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs."  Withan investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of atelephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacygroups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, orcustomers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range fromsingle computers with only one telephone line into the computer(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with manytelephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneoususers), to multiple linked computers each servicing multipledial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirectlinks to the Internet.  Some BBS systems charge users a nominalfee for access, while many others are free to the individualusers.           21.  Although commercial access to the Internet isgrowing rapidly, many users of the Internet -- such as collegestudents and staff -- do not individually pay for access (exceptto the extent, for example, that the cost of computer services isa component of college tuition).  These and other Internet userscan access the Internet without paying for such access with acredit card or other form of payment.             Methods to Communicate Over the Internet          22.   Once one has access to the Internet, there are awide variety of different methods of communication andinformation exchange over the network.  These many methods ofcommunication and information retrieval are constantly evolvingand are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The mostcommon methods of communications on the Internet (as well aswithin the major online services) can be roughly grouped into sixcategories:                (1)  one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),                (2)  one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"),               (3)  distributed message databases (such as                    "USENET newsgroups"),                (4)  real time communication (such as "Internet                    Relay Chat"),                (5)  real time remote computer utilization (such                    as "telnet"), and                (6)  remote information retrieval (such as "ftp,"                    "gopher," and the "World Wide Web").  Most of these methods of communication can be used to transmittext, data, computer programs, sound, visual images (i.e.,pictures), and moving video images.          23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communicationon the Internet is via electronic mail, or "e-mail," comparablein principle to sending a first class letter.  One can addressand transmit a message to one or more other people.  E-mail onthe Internet is not routed through a central control point, andcan take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postalmail, simple e-mail generally is not "sealed" or secure, and canbe accessed or viewed on intermediate computers between thesender and recipient (unless the message is encrypted).          24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also containsautomatic mailing list services (such as "listservs"), [alsoreferred to by witnesses as "mail exploders"] that allowcommunications about particular subjects of interest to a groupof people.  For example, people can subscribe to a "listserv"mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  Thesubscriber can submit messages on the topic to the listserv thatare forwarded (via e-mail), either automatically or through ahuman moderator overseeing the listserv, to anyone who hassubscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a messagecan reply to the message and have the reply also distributed toeveryone on the mailing list.  This service provides thecapability to keep abreast of developments or events in aparticular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing listsautomatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing listsubscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list serviceson the Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands ofsubscribers.  Users of "open" listservs typically can add orremove their names from the mailing list automatically, with nodirect human involvement.  Listservs may also be "closed," i.e.,only allowing for one's acceptance into the listserv by a humanmoderator.          25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar infunction to listservs -- but quite different in howcommunications are transmitted -- are distributed messagedatabases such as "USENET newsgroups."  User-sponsored newsgroupsare among the most popular and widespread applications ofInternet services, and cover all imaginable topics of interest tousers.  Like listservs, newsgroups are open discussions andexchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need notsubscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but caninstead access the database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroupsare "moderated" but most are open access.  For the moderatednewsgroups,[10] all messages to the newsgroup are forwarded to oneperson who can screen them for relevance to the topics underdiscussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc,peer to peer connections between approximately 200,000 computers(called USENET "servers") around the world.  For unmoderatednewsgroups, when an individual user with access to a USENETserver posts a message to a newsgroup, the message isautomatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers thatfurnish access to the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to theservers adjacent to those servers, etc.  The messages aretemporarily stored on each receiving server, where they areavailable for review and response by individual users.  Themessages are automatically and periodically purged from eachsystem after a time to make room for new messages.  Responses tomessages, like the original messages, are automaticallydistributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup orforwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup. The dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the worldis an automated process that does not require direct humanintervention or review.           26.  There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousanddifferent subjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages wereposted to newsgroups each day, and those messages weredistributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or computernetworks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Oncethe messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computersor computer networks, they are available to individual users ofthose computers or computer networks.  Collectively, almost100,000 new messages (or "articles") are posted to newsgroupseach day.          27.  Real time communication.  In addition totransmitting messages that can be later read or accessed,individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog, in"real time", with other people on the Internet.  In its simplestforms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and "InternetRelay Chat" (or IRC) allows two or more to type messages to eachother that almost immediately appear on the others' computerscreens.  IRC is analogous to a telephone party line, using acomputer and keyboard rather than a telephone.  With IRC,however, at any one time there are thousands of different partylines available, in which collectively tens of thousands of usersare engaging in conversations on a huge range of subjects. Moreover, one can create a new party line to discuss a differenttopic at any time.  Some IRC conversations are "moderated" orinclude "channel operators."          28.  In addition, commercial online services such asAmerica Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigyhave their own "chat" systems allowing their members to converse.          29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Anothermethod to use information on the Internet is to access andcontrol remote computers in "real time" using "telnet."  Forexample, using telnet, a researcher at a university would be ableto use the computing power of a supercomputer located at adifferent university.  A student can use telnet to connect to aremote library to access the library's online card catalogprogram.            30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final majorcategory of communication may be the most well known use of theInternet -- the search for and retrieval of information locatedon remote computers.  There are three primary methods to locateand retrieve information on the Internet.            31.  A simple method uses "ftp" (or file transferprotocol) to list the names of computer files available on aremote computer, and to transfer one or more of those files to anindividual's local computer.            32.  Another approach uses a program and format named"gopher" to guide an individual's search through the resourcesavailable on a remote computer.                          The World Wide Web          33.  A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet, is the "World Wide Web."  The Web utilizesa "hypertext" formatting language called hypertext markuplanguage (HTML), and programs that "browse" the Web can displayHTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation andmoving video.  Any HTML document can include links to other typesof information or resources, so that while viewing an HTMLdocument that, for example, describes resources available on theInternet, one can "click" using a computer mouse on thedescription of the resource and be immediately connected to theresource itself.  Such "hyperlinks" allow information to beaccessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow people tolocate and efficiently view related information even if theinformation is stored on numerous computers all around the world.          34.  Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created toserve as the platform for a global, online store of knowledge,containing information from a diversity of sources and accessibleto Internet users around the world.  Though information on theWeb is contained in individual computers, the fact that each ofthese computers is connected to the Internet through W3Cprotocols allows all of the information to become part of asingle body of knowledge.  It is currently the most advancedinformation system developed on the Internet, and embraces withinits data model most information in previous networked informationsystems such as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.            35.  History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN,the European Particle Physics Laboratory, and was initially usedto allow information sharing within internationally dispersedteams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed at the HighEnergy Physics community, it has spread to other areas andattracted much interest in user support, resource recovery, andmany other areas which depend on collaborative and informationsharing.  The Web has extended beyond the scientific and academiccommunity to include communications by individuals, non-profitorganizations, and businesses.          36.  Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a seriesof documents stored in different computers all over the Internet. Documents contain information stored in a variety of formats,including text, still images, sounds, and video.  An essentialelement of the Web is that any document has an address (ratherlike a telephone number).  Most Web documents contain "links." These are short sections of text or image which refer to anotherdocument.  Typically the linked text is blue or underlined whendisplayed, and when selected by the user, the referenced documentis automatically displayed, wherever in the world it actually isstored.  Links for example are used to lead from overviewdocuments to more detailed documents, from tables of contents toparticular pages, but also as cross-references, footnotes, andnew forms of information structure.            37.  Many organizations now have "home pages" on theWeb.  These are documents which provide a set of links designedto represent the organization, and through links from the homepage, guide the user directly or indirectly to information aboutor relevant to that organization.            38.  As an example of the use of links, if theseFindings were to be put on a World Wide Web site, its home pagemight contain links such as those:  *THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE *CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE*HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET*METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET           39.  Each of these links takes the user of the sitefrom the beginning of the Findings to the appropriate sectionwithin this Adjudication.  Links may also take the user from theoriginal Web site to another Web site on another computerconnected to the Internet.  These links from one computer toanother, from one document to another across the Internet, arewhat unify the Web into a single body of knowledge, and whatmakes the Web unique.  The Web was designed with a maximum targettime to follow a link of one tenth of a second.          40.  Publishing.  The World Wide Web existsfundamentally as a platform through which people andorganizations can communicate through shared information.  Wheninformation is made available, it is said to be "published" onthe Web.  Publishing on the Web simply requires that the"publisher" has a computer connected to the Internet and that thecomputer is running W3C server software.  The computer can be assimple as a small personal computer costing less than $1500dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar mainframecomputer.  Many Web publishers choose instead to lease diskstorage space from someone else who has the necessary computerfacilities, eliminating the need for actually owning anyequipment oneself.            41.  The Web, as a universe of network accessibleinformation, contains a variety of documents prepared with quitevarying degrees of care, from the hastily typed idea, to theprofessionally executed corporate profile.  The power of the Webstems from the ability of a link to point to any document,regardless of its status or physical location.            42.  Information to be published on the Web must alsobe formatted according to the rules of the Web standards.  Thesestandardized formats assure that all Web users who want to readthe material will be able to view it.  Web standards aresophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meetthe publishing needs of many large corporations, banks, brokeragehouses, newspapers and magazines which now publish "online"editions of their material, as well as government agencies, andeven courts, which use the Web to disseminate information to thepublic.  At the same time, Web publishing is simple enough thatthousands of individual users and small community organizationsare using the Web to publish their own personal "home pages," theequivalent of individualized newsletters about that person ororganization, which are available to everyone on the Web.            43.  Web publishers have a choice to make their Websites open to the general pool of all Internet users, or closethem, thus making the information accessible only to those withadvance authorization.  Many publishers choose to keep theirsites open to all in order to give their information the widestpotential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose tomaintain restrictions on access, this may be accomplished byassigning specific user names and passwords as a prerequisite toaccess to the site.  Or, in the case of Web sites maintained forinternal use of one organization, access will only be allowedfrom other computers within that organization's local network.[11]          44.  Searching the Web.  A variety of systems havedeveloped that allow users of the Web to search particularinformation among all of the public sites that are part of theWeb.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler,and Lycos are all services known as "search engines" which allowusers to search for Web sites that contain certain categories ofinformation, or to search for key words.  For example, a Web userlooking for the text of Supreme Court opinions would type thewords "Supreme Court" into a search engine, and then be presentedwith a list of World Wide Web sites that contain Supreme Courtinformation.  This list would actually be a series of links tothose sites.  Having searched out a number of sites that mightcontain the desired information, the user would then followindividual links, browsing through the information on each site,until the desired material is found.  For many content providerson the Web, the ability to be found by these search engines isvery important.            45.  Common standards.  The Web links togetherdisparate information on an ever-growing number of Internet-linked computers by setting common information storage formats(HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many differentformats, and stored on computers which are not otherwisecompatible, the basic Web standards provide a basic set ofstandards which allow communication and exchange of information. Despite the fact that many types of computers are used on theWeb, and the fact that many of these machines are otherwiseincompatible, those who "publish" information on the Web are ableto communicate with those who seek to access information withlittle difficulty because of these basic technical standards.            46.  A distributed system with no centralized control. Running on tens of thousands of individual computers on theInternet, the Web is what is known as a distributed system.  TheWeb was designed so that organizations with computers containinginformation can become part of the Web simply by attaching theircomputers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide Websoftware.  No single organization controls any membership in theWeb, nor is there any single centralized point from whichindividual Web sites or services can be blocked from the Web. From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized controlpoint.            47.  Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open,distributed, decentralized nature stands in sharp contrast tomost information systems that have come before it.  Privateinformation services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis, and Dialog,have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can beaccessed from the Internet with the appropriate passwords andaccess software.  However, these databases are not linkedtogether into a single whole, as is the World Wide Web.            48.  Success of the Web in research, education, andpolitical activities.  The World Wide Web has become so popularbecause of its open, distributed, and easy-to-use nature.  Ratherthan requiring those who seek information to purchase newsoftware or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for eachnew database of information they seek to access, the Webenvironment makes it easy for users to jump from one set ofinformation to another.  By the same token, the open nature ofthe Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their intendedaudiences without having to know in advance what kind of computereach potential reader has, and what kind of software they will beusing.          Restricting Access to Unwanted On-Line Material[12]PICS          49.  With the rapid growth of the Internet, theincreasing popularity of the Web, and the existence of materialonline that some parents may consider inappropriate for theirchildren, various entities have begun to build systems intendedto enable parents to control the material which comes into theirhomes and may be accessible to their children.  The World WideWeb Consortium launched the PICS ("Platform for Internet ContentSelection") program in order to develop technical standards thatwould support parents' ability to filter and screen material thattheir children see on the Web.            50.  The Consortium intends that PICS will provide theability for third parties, as well as individual contentproviders, to rate content on the Internet in a variety of ways. When fully implemented, PICS-compatible World Wide Web browsers,Usenet News Group readers, and other Internet applications, willprovide parents the ability to choose from a variety of ratingservices, or a combination of services.          51.  PICS working group [PICS-WG] participants includemany of the major online services providers, commercial internetaccess providers, hardware and software companies, major internetcontent providers, and consumer organizations.  Among activeparticipants in the PICS effort are:                        Adobe Systems, Inc.               Apple Computer               America Online               AT&T               Center for Democracy and Technology               CompuServe               Delphi Internet Services               Digital Equipment Corporation               IBM               First floor               First Virtual Holdings Incorporated               France Telecom               FTP Software               Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan               Information Technology Association of America               Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et                     en Automatique (INRIA)               Interactive Services Association               MCI               Microsoft               MIT/LCS/World Wide Web Consortium               NCD               NEC               Netscape Communications Corporation               NewView               O'Reilly and Associates               Open Market               Prodigy Services Company               Progressive Networks               Providence Systems/Parental Guidance               Recreational Software Advisory Council               SafeSurf               SoftQuad, Inc.               Songline Studios               Spyglass               SurfWatch Software               Telequip Corp.               Time Warner Pathfinder               Viacom Nickelodeon[13]          52.  Membership in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-section of companies from the computer, communications, andcontent industries, as well as trade associations and publicinterest groups.  PICS technical specifications have been agreedto, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy productsand services based on the PICS-standards.          53.  Until a majority of sites on the Internet havebeen rated by a PICS rating service, PICS will initially functionas a "positive" ratings system in which only those sites thathave been rated will be displayed using PICS compatible software. In other words, PICS will initially function as a site inclusionlist rather than a site exclusion list.  The defaultconfiguration for a PICS compatible Internet application will beto block access to all sites which have not been rated by a PICSrating service, while allowing access to sites which have a PICSrating for appropriate content.[14]Software          54.  For over a year, various companies have marketedstand alone software that is intended to enable parents and otheradults to limit the Internet access of children.  Examples ofsuch software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The InternetFilter, Net Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape ProxyServer, and WebTrack.  The market for this type of software isgrowing, and there is increasing competition among softwareproviders to provide products.Cyber Patrol          55.  As more people, particularly children, began touse the Internet, Microsystems Software, Inc. decided to developand market Internet software intended to empower parents toexercise individual choice over what material their childrencould access.  Microsystems' stated intent is to develop aproduct which would give parents comfort that their children canreap the benefits of the Internet while shielding them fromobjectionable or otherwise inappropriate materials based on theparents' own particular tastes and values.  Microsystems'product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.          56.  Cyber Patrol was first introduced in August 1995,and is currently available in Windows and Macintosh versions. Cyber Patrol works with both direct Internet Access providers(ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and Commercial Online ServiceProviders (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy, Microsoft). Cyber Patrol is also compatible with all major World Wide Webbrowsers on the market (e.g., Netscape, Navigator, Mosaic,Prodigy's Legacy and Skimmer browsers, America Online, Netcom'sNetCruiser, etc.).  Cyber Patrol was the first parentalempowerment application to be compatible with the PICS standard. In February of 1996, Microsystems put the first PICS ratingsserver on the Internet.            57.  The CyberNOT list contains approximately 7000sites in twelve categories.  The software is designed to enableparents to selectively block access to any or all of the twelveCyberNOT categories simply by checking boxes in the Cyber PatrolHeadquarters (the Cyber Patrol program manager).  Thesecategories are:          Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or          emotional acts against any animal or person which are          primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene          words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses          George Carlin's seven censored words more often than          once every fifty messages or pages.            Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human          anatomy except when exposing genitalia.            Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.            Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text          exposing anyone or anything involved in explicit sexual          acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including          masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and          involving nude or partially nude people in          heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual          encounters.  Also includes phone sex ads, dating          services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.            Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or          descriptive text of anyone or anything which are          crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or          showing scatological impropriety.  Includes such          depictions as maiming, bloody figures, indecent          depiction of bodily functions.            Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination          against any race or ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist          jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one race over          another.            Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil,          wickedness.  Sects or groups that potentially coerce          individuals to grow, and keep, membership.            Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of          illegal drugs for entertainment.  This would exclude          current illegal drugs used for medicinal purposes          (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes          substances used for other than their primary purpose to          alter the individual's state of mind such as glue          sniffing.            Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative          behaviors, radicalism, advocacy of extreme political          measures.  Topics include extreme political groups that          advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.            Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos,          betting, numbers games, on-line sports or financial          betting including non-monetary dares.            Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a          dubious nature which may be illegal in any or all          jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain          letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.            Alcohol, Beer & Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale          or consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Also includes          sites and information relating to tobacco products.            58.  Microsystems employs people to search the Internetfor sites containing material in these categories.  Since newsites are constantly coming online, Microsystems updates theCyberNOT list on a weekly basis.  Once installed on the home PC,the copy of Cyber Patrol receives automatic updates to theCyberNOT list over the Internet every seven days.            59.  In February of 1996, Microsystems signed alicensing arrangement with CompuServe, one of the leadingcommercial online services with over 4.3 million subscribers. CompuServe provides Cyber Patrol free of charge to itssubscribers.  Microsystems the same month signed a licensingarrangement with Prodigy, another leading commercial onlineservice with over 1.4 million subscribers.  Prodigy will provideCyber Patrol free of charge of its subscribers.            60.  Cyber Patrol is also available directly fromMicrosystems for $49.95, which includes a six month subscriptionto the CyberNOT blocked sites list (updated automatically onceevery seven days).  After six months, parents can receive sixmonths of additional updates for $19.95, or twelve months for$29.95.  Cyber Patrol Home Edition, a limited version of CyberPatrol, is available free of charge on the Internet.  To obtaineither version, parents download a seven day demonstrationversion of the full Cyber Patrol product from the MicrosystemsInternet World Wide Web Server.  At the end of the seven daytrial period, users are offered the opportunity to purchase thecomplete version of Cyber Patrol or provide Microsystems somebasic demographic information in exchange for unlimited use ofthe Home Edition.  The demographic information is used formarketing and research purposes.  Since January of 1996, over10,000 demonstration copies of Cyber Patrol have been downloadedfrom Microsystems' Web site.          61.  Cyber Patrol is also available from Retail outletsas NetBlocker Plus.  NetBlocker Plus sells for $19.95, whichincludes five weeks of updates to the CyberNOT list.            62.  Microsystems also sells Cyber Patrol into agrowing market in schools.  As more classrooms become connectedto the Internet, many teachers want to ensure that their studentscan receive the benefit of the Internet without encounteringmaterial they deem educationally inappropriate.            63.  Microsystems is working with the RecreationalSoftware Advisory Council (RSAC), a non-profit corporation whichdeveloped rating systems for video games, to implement the RSACrating system for the Internet.            64.  The next release of Cyber Patrol, expected insecond quarter of this year, will give parents the ability to useany PICS rating service, including the RSAC rating service, inaddition to the Microsystems CyberNOT list.            65.  In order to speed the implementation of PICS andencourage the development of PICS-compatible Internetapplications, Microsystems maintains a server on the Internetwhich contains its CyberNOT list.  The server provides softwaredevelopers with access to a PICS rating service, and allowssoftware developers to test their products' ability to interpretstandard PICS labels.  Microsystems is also offering its PICSclient test program for Windows free of charge.  The clientprogram can be used by developers of PICS rating services to testtheir services and products.  SurfWatch          66.  Another software product, SurfWatch, is alsodesigned to allow parents and other concerned users to filterunwanted material on the Internet.  SurfWatch is available forboth Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Windows 95Operating Systems, and works with direct Internet AccessProviders (e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet, AT&T, and more than 1000other Internet Service Providers).            67.  The suggested retail price of SurfWatch Softwareis $49.95, with a street price of between $20.00 and $25.00.  Theproduct is also available as part of CompuServe/Spry Inc.'sInternet in a Box for Kids, which includes access to Spry's Kidsonly Internet service and a copy of SurfWatch.  Internet in a Boxfor Kids retails for approximately $30.00.  The subscriptionservice, which updates the SurfWatch blocked site listautomatically with new sites each month, is available for $5.95per month or $60.00 per year.  The subscription is included aspart of the Internet in a Box for Kids program, and is alsoprovided as a low-cost option from Internet Service Providers.            68.  SurfWatch is available at over 12,000 retaillocations, including National stores such as Comp USA, EggheadSoftware, Computer City, and several national mail order outlets. SurfWatch can also be ordered directly from its own site on theWorld Wide Web, and through the Internet Shopping Network.          69.  Plaintiffs America Online (AOL), MicrosoftNetwork, and Prodigy all offer parental control options free ofcharge to their members.  AOL has established an online areadesigned specifically for children.  The "Kids Only" parentalcontrol feature allows parents to establish an AOL account fortheir children that accesses only the Kids Only channel onAmerica Online.[15]               70.  AOL plans to incorporate PICS-compatiblecapability into its standard Web browser software, and to makeavailable to subscribers other PICS-compatible Web browsers, suchas the Netscape software.            71. Plaintiffs CompuServe and Prodigy give theirsubscribers the option of blocking all access to the Internet, orto particular media within their proprietary online content, suchas bulletin boards and chat rooms.           72. Although parental control software currently canscreen for certain suggestive words or for known sexuallyexplicit sites, it cannot now screen for sexually explicit imagesunaccompanied by suggestive text unless those who configure thesoftware are aware of the particular site.              73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-based software suggests that a reasonably effective method bywhich parents can prevent their children from accessing sexuallyexplicit and other material which parents may believe isinappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.                      Content on the Internet          74.  The types of content now on the Internet defy easyclassification.  The entire card catalogue of the CarnegieLibrary is on-line, together with journals, journal abstracts,popular magazines, and titles of compact discs.  The director ofthe Carnegie Library, Robert Croneberger, testified that on-lineservices are the emerging trend in libraries generally. Plaintiff Hotwired Ventures LLC organizes its Web site intoinformation regarding travel, news and commentary, arts andentertainment, politics, and types of drinks.  Plaintiff AmericaOnline, Inc., not only creates chat rooms for a broad variety oftopics, but also allows members to create their own chat rooms tosuit their own tastes.  The ACLU uses an America Online chat roomas an unmoderated forum for people to debate civil libertiesissues.  Plaintiffs' expert, Scott Bradner,[16] estimated that15,000 newsgroups exist today, and he described his own interestin a newsgroup devoted solely to Formula 1 racing cars.  AmericaOnline makes 15,000 bulletin boards available to its subscribers,who post between 200,000 and 250,000 messages each day.  Anotherplaintiffs' expert, Harold Rheingold, participates in "virtualcommunities" that simulate social interaction.  It is noexaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet is asdiverse as human thought.            75.  The Internet is not exclusively, or evenprimarily, a means of commercial communication.  Many commercialentities maintain Web sites to inform potential consumers abouttheir goods and services, or to solicit purchases, but many otherWeb sites exist solely for the dissemination of non-commercialinformation.  The other forms of Internet communication -- e-mail, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and chat rooms -- frequentlyhave non-commercial goals.  For the economic and technicalreasons set forth in the following paragraphs, the Internet is anespecially attractive means for not-for-profit entities or publicinterest groups to reach their desired audiences.  There areexamples in the parties' stipulation of some of the non-commercial uses that the Internet serves.  Plaintiff Human RightsWatch, Inc., offers information on its Internet site regardingreported human rights abuses around the world.  PlaintiffNational Writers Union provides a forum for writers on issues ofconcern to them.  Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., posts text,graphics, and statistics regarding the incidence and preventionof rape in prisons.  Plaintiff Critical Path AIDS Project, Inc.,offers information on safer sex, the transmission of HIV, and thetreatment of AIDS.            76.  Such diversity of content on the Internet ispossible because the Internet provides an easy and inexpensiveway for a speaker to reach a large audience, potentially ofmillions.  The start-up and operating costs entailed bycommunication on the Internet are significantly lower than thoseassociated with use of other forms of mass communication, such astelevision, radio, newspapers, and magazines.  This enablesoperation of their own Web sites not only by large companies,such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-profit groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDSProject.  The Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,[17] agreedthat creation of a Web site would cost between $1,000 and$15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on one's goalsand the Web site's traffic.  Commercial online services such asAmerica Online allow subscribers to create Web pages free ofcharge.  Any Internet user can communicate by posting a messageto one of the thousands of newsgroups and bulletin boards or byengaging in an on-line "chat", and thereby reach an audienceworldwide that shares an interest in a particular topic.           77.  The ease of communication through the Internet isfacilitated by the use of hypertext markup language (HTML), whichallows for the creation of "hyperlinks" or "links".  HTML enablesa user to jump from one source to other related sources byclicking on the link.  A link might take the user from Web siteto Web site, or to other files within a particular Web site. Similarly, by typing a request into a search engine, a user canretrieve many different sources of content related to the searchthat the creators of the engine have collected.            78.  Because of the technology underlying the Internet,the statutory term "content provider,"[18] which is equivalent tothe traditional "speaker," may actually be a hybrid of speakers. Through the use of HTML, for example, Critical Path and StopPrisoner Rape link their Web sites to several related databases,and a user can immediately jump from the home pages of theseorganizations to the related databases simply by clicking on alink.  America Online creates chat rooms for particulardiscussions but also allows subscribers to create their own chatrooms.  Similarly, a newsgroup gathers postings on a particulartopic and distributes them to the newsgroup's subscribers.  Usersof the Carnegie Library can read on-line versions of Vanity Fairand Playboy, and America Online's subscribers can peruse the NewYork Times, Boating, and other periodicals.  Critical Path, StopPrisoner Rape, America Online and the Carnegie Library all makeavailable content of other speakers over whom they have little orno editorial control.           79.  Because of the different forms of Internetcommunication, a user of the Internet may speak or listeninterchangeably, blurring the distinction between "speakers" and"listeners" on the Internet.  Chat rooms, e-mail, and newsgroupsare interactive forms of communication, providing the user withthe opportunity both to speak and to listen.            80.  It follows that unlike traditional media, thebarriers to entry as a speaker on the Internet do not differsignificantly from the barriers to entry as a listener.  Once onehas entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue thatoccurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can anddoes become the content provider, and vice-versa.          81.  The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly newmedium of worldwide human communication.            Sexually Explicit Material On the Internet          82.  The parties agree that sexually explicit materialexists on the Internet.  Such material includes text, pictures,and chat, and includes bulletin boards, newsgroups, and the otherforms of Internet communication, and extends from the modestlytitillating to the hardest-core.            83.  There is no evidence that sexually-orientedmaterial is the primary type of content on this new medium. Purveyors of such material take advantage of the same ease ofaccess available to all users of the Internet, includingestablishment of a Web site.           84.  Sexually explicit material is created, named, andposted in the same manner as material that is not sexuallyexplicit.  It is possible that a search engine can accidentallyretrieve material of a sexual nature through an imprecise search,as demonstrated at the hearing.  Imprecise searches may alsoretrieve irrelevant material that is not of a sexual nature.  Theaccidental retrieval of sexually explicit material is onemanifestation of the larger phenomenon of irrelevant searchresults.           85.  Once a provider posts content on the Internet, itis available to all other Internet users worldwide.  Similarly,once a user posts a message to a newsgroup or bulletin board,that message becomes available to all subscribers to thatnewsgroup or bulletin board.  For example, when theUCR/California Museum of Photography posts to its Web site nudesby Edward Weston and Robert Mapplethorpe to announce that its newexhibit will travel to Baltimore and New York City, those imagesare available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, and New YorkCity, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or Beijing -- whereverInternet users live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions thatCritical Path posts to its Web site, written in street languageso that the teenage receiver can understand them, are availablenot just in Philadelphia, but also in Provo and Prague.  A chatroom organized by the ACLU to discuss the United States SupremeCourt's  decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation would transmitGeorge Carlin's seven dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messagesposted to a newsgroup dedicated to the Oklahoma City bombingtravel to all subscribers to that newsgroup.            86.  Once a provider posts its content on the Internet,it cannot prevent that content from entering any community. Unlike the newspaper, broadcast station, or cable system,Internet technology necessarily gives a speaker a potentialworldwide audience.  Because the Internet is a network ofnetworks (as described above in Findings 1 through 4), anynetwork connected to the Internet has the capacity to send andreceive information to any other network.  Hotwired Ventures, forexample, cannot prevent its materials on mixology from enteringcommunities that have no interest in that topic.            87.  Demonstrations at the preliminary injunctionhearings showed that it takes several steps to enter cyberspace. At the most fundamental level, a user must have access to acomputer with the ability to reach the Internet (typically by wayof a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connectwith the access provider, enter a password, and enter theappropriate commands to find particular data.  On the World WideWeb, a user must normally use a search engine or enter anappropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups, bulletinboards, and chat rooms requires several steps.          88.  Communications over the Internet do not "invade"an individual's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden. Users seldom encounter content "by accident."   A document'stitle or a description of the document will usually appear beforethe document itself takes the step needed to view it, and in manycases the user will receive detailed information about a site'scontent before he or she need take the step to access thedocument.  Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded bywarnings as to the content.  Even the Government's witness, AgentHoward Schmidt, Director of the Air Force Office of SpecialInvestigation, testified that the "odds are slim" that a userwould come across a sexually explicit site by accident.            89.  Evidence adduced at the hearing showed significant differences between Internet communications and communicationsreceived by radio or television.  Although content on theInternet is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the user,  thereceipt of information on the Internet requires a series ofaffirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merelyturning a dial.  A child requires some sophistication and someability to read to retrieve material and thereby to use theInternet unattended.             Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet          90.  There is no effective way to determine theidentity or the age of a user who is accessing material throughe-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat rooms.  An e-mailaddress provides no authoritative information about theaddressee, who may use an e-mail "alias" or an anonymousremailer.  There is also no universal or reliable listing of e-mail addresses and corresponding names or telephone numbers, andany such listing would be or rapidly become incomplete.  Forthese reasons, there is no reliable way in many instances for asender to know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor. The difficulty of e-mail age verification is compounded for mailexploders such as listservs, which automatically send informationto all e-mail addresses on a sender's list.  Government expertDr. Olsen agreed that no current technology could give a speakerassurance that only adults were listed in a particular mailexploder's mailing list.            91.  Because of similar technological difficulties,individuals posting a message to a newsgroup or engaging in chatroom discussions cannot ensure that all readers are adults, andDr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are moderated, themoderator's control is limited to what is posted and themoderator cannot control who receives the messages.                        92.  The Government offered no evidence that there is areliable way to ensure that recipients and participants in suchfora can be screened for age.  The Government presented noevidence demonstrating the feasibility of its suggestion thatchat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain materialdeemed indecent could be effectively segregated to "adult" or"moderated" areas of cyberspace.            93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to blockminors' access to newsgroups and similar fora, there is no methodby which the creators of newsgroups which contain discussions ofart, politics or any other subject that could potentially elicit"indecent" contributions could limit the blocking of access byminors to such "indecent" material and still allow them access tothe remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of thatcontent was not indecent.          94.  Likewise, participants in MUDs (Multi-UserDungeons) and  MUSEs (Multi-User Simulation Environments) do notknow whether the other participants are adults or minors. Although MUDs and MUSEs require a password for permanentparticipants, they need not give their real name nor verify theirage, and there is no current technology to enable theadministrator of these fantasy worlds to know if the participantis an adult or a minor.            95.  Unlike other forms of communication on theInternet, there is technology by which an operator of a WorldWide Web server may interrogate a user of a Web site.  An HTMLdocument can include a fill-in-the-blank "form" to requestinformation from a visitor to a Web site, and this informationcan be transmitted back to the Web server and be processed by acomputer program, usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi)script.  The Web server could then grant or deny access to theinformation sought.  The cgi script is the means by which a Website can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors byrequesting a credit card number or adult password.          96.  Content providers who publish on the World WideWeb via one of the large commercial online services, such asAmerica Online or CompuServe, could not use an online ageverification system that requires cgi script because the serversoftware of these online services available to subscribers cannotprocess cgi scripts.  There is no method currently available forWeb page publishers who lack access to cgi scripts to screenrecipients online for age.           The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses          Note:  The Government contends the CDA makes availablethree potential defenses to all content providers on theInternet:  credit card verification, adult verification bypassword or adult identification number, and "tagging".                     Credit Card Verification           97.  Verification[19] of a credit card number over theInternet is not now technically possible.  Witnesses testifiedthat neither Visa nor Mastercard considers the Internet to besufficiently secure under the current technology to processtransactions in that manner.  Although users can and do purchaseproducts over the Internet by transmitting their credit cardnumber, the seller must then process the transaction with Visa orMastercard off-line using phone lines in the traditional way. There was testimony by several witnesses that Visa and Mastercardare in the process of developing means of credit cardverification over the Internet.            98.  Verification by credit card, if and whenoperational, will remain economically and practically unavailablefor many of the non-commercial plaintiffs in these actions.  TheGovernment's expert "suspect[ed]" that verification agencieswould decline to process a card unless it accompanied acommercial transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.            99.  There was evidence that the fee charged byverification agencies to process a card, whether for a purchaseor not, will preclude use of the credit-card verification defenseby many non-profit, non-commercial Web sites, and there was noevidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia NellWarren, an author whose free Web site allows users to purchasegay and lesbian literature, testified that she must pay $1 perverification to a verification agency.  Her Web site can absorbthis cost because it arises in connection with the sale of booksavailable there.            100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate forage, and requiring use of a credit card to enter a site, wouldimpose a significant economic cost on non-commercial entities. Critical Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily fromFebruary 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical Path must pay afee every time a user initially enters its site, then, to providefree access to its non-commercial site, it would incur a monthlycost far beyond its modest resources.  The ACLU's BarrySteinhardt testified that maintenance of a credit cardverification system for all visitors to the ACLU's Web site wouldrequire it to shut down its Web site because the projected costwould exceed its budget.           101. Credit card verification would significantly delaythe retrieval of information on the Internet.  Dr. Olsen, theexpert testifying for the Government, agreed that even "a minuteis [an] absolutely unreasonable [delay] . . . [P]eople will notput up with a minute."  Plaintiffs' expert Donna Hoffmansimilarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the "flow" onthe Internet and stifles both "hedonistic" and "goal-directed"browsing.           102.  Imposition of a credit card requirement wouldcompletely bar adults who do not have a credit card and lack theresources to obtain one from accessing any blocked material.  Atthis time, credit card verification is effectively unavailable toa substantial number of Internet content providers as a potentialdefense to the CDA.                  Adult Verification by Password           103.  The Government offered very limited evidenceregarding the operation of existing age verification systems, andthe evidence offered was not based on personal knowledge. AdultCheck and Verify, existing systems which appear to be usedfor accessing commercial pornographic sites, charge users fortheir services.  Dr. Olsen admitted that his knowledge of theseservices was derived primarily from reading the advertisements ontheir Web pages.  He had not interviewed any employees of theseentities, had not personally used these systems, had no idea howmany people are registered with them, and could not testify tothe reliability of their attempt at age verification.            104.  At least some, if not almost all, non-commercialorganizations, such as the ACLU, Stop Prisoner Rape or CriticalPath AIDS Project, regard charging listeners to access theirspeech as contrary to their goals of making their materialsavailable to a wide audience free of charge.            105.  It would not be feasible for many non-commercialorganizations to design their own adult access code screeningsystems because the administrative burden of creating andmaintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs involved isbeyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would beprohibitive even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, theonline version of Wired magazine.            106.  There is evidence suggesting that adult users,particularly casual Web browsers, would be discouraged fromretrieving information that required use of a credit card orpassword.  Andrew Anker testified that HotWired has received manycomplaints from its members about HotWired's registration system,which requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail addressand self-created password.  There is concern by commercialcontent providers that age verification requirements woulddecrease advertising and revenue because advertisers depend on ademonstration that the sites are widely available and frequentlyvisited.            107.  Even if credit card verification or adultpassword verification were implemented, the Government presentedno testimony as to how such systems could ensure that the user ofthe password or credit card is in fact over 18.  The burdensimposed by credit card verification and adult passwordverification systems make them effectively unavailable to asubstantial number of Internet content providers.                The Government's "Tagging" Proposal          108. The feasibility and effectiveness of "tagging" torestrict children from accessing "indecent" speech, as proposedby the Government has not been established.  "Tagging" wouldrequire content providers to label all of their "indecent" or"patently offensive" material by imbedding a string ofcharacters, such as "XXX," in either the URL or HTML.  If a usercould install software on his or her computer to recognize the"XXX" tag, the user could screen out any content with that tag. Dr. Olsen proposed a "-L18" tag, an idea he developed for thishearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony thatcertain tagging would not be feasible.          109. The parties appear to agree that it istechnologically feasible -- "trivial", in the words ofplaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML, and thetechnology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS proposaland the Government's "-L18" proposal.          110. The Government's tagging proposal would requireall content providers that post arguably "indecent" material toreview all of their online content, a task that would beextremely burdensome for organizations that provide large amountsof material online which cannot afford to pay a large staff toreview all of that material.  The Carnegie Library would berequired to hire numerous additional employees to review its on-line files at an extremely high cost to its limited budget.  Thecost and effort would be substantial for the Library andfrequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiyatestified that it would be impossible for his organization,Critical Path, to review all of its material because it has onlyone full and one part-time employee.            111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be donesimply by using software which screens for certain words, as Dr.Olsen acknowledged, and we find that determinations as to what isindecent require human judgment.            112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, acontent provider could tag its entire site but this would preventminors from accessing much material that is not "indecent" underthe CDA.            113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18proposal would require a worldwide consensus among speakers touse the same tag to label "indecent" material.  There iscurrently no such consensus, and no Internet speaker currentlylabels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other widely-recognized label.          114. Tagging also assumes the existence of softwarethat recognizes the tags and takes appropriate action when itnotes tagged speech.  Neither commercial Web browsers nor user-based screening software is currently configured to block a -L18code.  Until such software exists, all speech on the Internetwill continue to travel to whomever requests it, withouthindrance.  Labelling speech has no effect in itself on thetransmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither plaintiffs nor theGovernment suggest that tagging alone would shield minors fromspeech or insulate a speaker from criminal liability under theCDA. It follows that all speech on any topic that is available toadults will also be available to children using the Internet(unless it is blocked by screening software running on thecomputer the child is using).            115. There is no way that a speaker can use currenttechnology to know if a listener is using screening software.            116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivatethemselves depending on the age or location of the receiver. Critical Path, which posts on-line safer sex instructions, wouldbe unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in communitieswhere it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical Path, forexample, must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speechin all communities) or not to tag, blocking its speech in none.                 The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching          117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, ofcontent on the Internet originates outside the United States.  Atthe hearing, a witness demonstrated how an Internet user couldaccess a Web site of London (which presumably is on a server inEngland), and then link to other sites of interest in England.  Auser can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming fromoverseas, since InterNIC allows a content provider to imbed acountry code in a domain name.[20]  Foreign content is otherwiseindistinguishable from domestic content (as long as it is inEnglish), since foreign speech is created, named, and posted inthe same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement thatforeign speech contain a country code in its URL.  It isundisputed that some foreign speech that travels over theInternet is sexually explicit.          118. The use of "caching" makes it difficult todetermine whether the material originated from foreign ordomestic sources.  Because of the high cost of using the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables, and because the high demand onthose cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often"cached", or temporarily stored, on servers in the United States. Material from a foreign source in Europe can travel over thetrans-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the United States, andpass through a domestic caching server which then stores a copyfor subsequent retrieval.  This domestic caching server, ratherthan the original foreign server, will send the material from thecache to the subsequent receivers, without placing a demand onthe trans-oceanic cables.  This shortcut effectively eliminatesmost of the distance for both the request and the informationand, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards thestored information according to its configuration (e.g., after acertain time or as the demand for the information diminishes). Caching therefore advances core Internet values:  the cheap andspeedy retrieval of information.          119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon. Domestic content providers store popular domestic material ontheir caching servers to avoid the delay of successive searchesfor the same material and to decrease the demand on theirInternet connection.  America Online can cache the home page ofthe New York Times on its servers when a subscriber firstrequests it, so that subsequent subscribers who make the samerequest will receive the same home page, but from AmericaOnline's caching service rather than from the New York Times'sserver.[21]            120. Put simply, to follow the example in the priorparagraph, America Online has no control over the content thatthe New York Times posts to its Web site, and the New York Timeshas no control over America Online's distribution of that contentfrom a caching server.                             Anonymity          121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seekto access sensitive information, such as users of the CriticalPath AIDS Project's Web site, the users, particularly gay youth,of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop Prisoner Rape(SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remainanonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.                   Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA          122. Many speakers who display arguably indecentcontent on the Internet must choose between silence and the riskof prosecution.  The CDA's defenses -- credit card verification,adult access codes, and adult personal identification numbers --are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profitentities.          123.  The plaintiffs in this action are businesses,libraries, non-commercial and not-for-profit organizations, andeducational societies and consortia.  Although some of thematerial that plaintiffs post online -- such as informationregarding protection from AIDS, birth control or prison rape --is sexually explicit and may be considered "indecent" or"patently offensive" in some communities, none of the plaintiffsis a commercial purveyor of what is commonly termed"pornography."                                 III.                        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW          Plaintiffs have established a reasonable probability ofeventual success in the litigation by demonstrating that 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional ontheir face to the extent that they reach indecency.  Sections223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on theirface.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, noparty has any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutionallaw, and therefore the public interest will be served by grantingthe preliminary injunction.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied,493 U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645,653 (3d Cir. 1994).  The motions for preliminary injunction willtherefore be granted.          The views of the members of the Court in support ofthese conclusions follow.SLOVITER, Chief Judge, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:                                A.                       Statutory Provisions          As noted in Part I, Introduction, the plaintiffs'motion for a preliminary injunction is confined to portions oftwo provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, 223(a) and  223(d), which they contend violate their FirstAmendment free speech and Fifth Amendment due process rights.  Tofacilitate reference, I set forth those provisions in full. Section 223(a), the "indecency" provision, subjects to criminalpenalties of imprisonment of no more than two years or a fine orboth anyone who:          1) in interstate or foreign communications . . .           (B) by means of a telecommunications device               knowingly --                             (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and               (ii) initiates the transmission of,                any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,               or other communication which is obscene or               indecent, knowing that the recipient of the               communication is under 18 years of age, regardless               of whether the maker of such communication placed               the call or initiated the communication; . . .           (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility          under his control to be used for any activity          prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be          used for such activity.(emphasis added).          The term "telecommunications device" is specificallydefined not to include "the use of an interactive computerservice," as that is covered by section 223(d)(1).          Section 223(d), the "patently offensive" provision,subjects to criminal penalties anyone who:          (1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--          (A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a          specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or                    (B) uses any interactive computer service to display in          a manner available to a person under 18 years of age,           any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or          other communication that, in context, depicts or          describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by          contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory          activities or organs, regardless of whether the use of          such service placed the call or initiated the          communication; or           (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility          under such person's control to be used for an activity          prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be          used for such activity.(emphasis added).          Two aspects of these provisions stand out.  First, weare dealing with criminal provisions, subjecting violators tosubstantial penalties.  Second, the provisions on indecent andpatently offensive communications are not parallel.          The government uses the term "indecent" interchangeablywith "patently offensive" and advises that it so construes thestatute in light of the legislative history and the SupremeCourt's analysis of the word "indecent" in FCC v. PacificaFoundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  However,  the CDA does notdefine "indecent."  Notwithstanding Congress' familiarity withPacifica, it enacted  223(a), covering "indecent"communications, without any language confining "indecent" todescriptions or depictions of "sexual or excretory activities ororgans," language it included in the reference to "patentlyoffensive" in  223(d)(1)(B).  Nor does  223(a) contain thephrase "in context," which the government believes is relevant.            The failure to define "indecent" in  223(a) is thusarguably a negative pregnant and subject to "the rule ofconstruction that an express statutory requirement here,contrasted with statutory silence there, shows an intent toconfine the requirement to the specified instance."  Field v.Mans, 116 S.Ct. 437, 442 (1995).  See also Gozlon-Peretz v.United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) ("'[W]here Congressincludes particular language in one section of a statute butomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generallypresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in thedisparate inclusion or exclusion'") (quoting Russello v. UnitedStates, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)).            Plaintiffs note the difference but do not press this asa basis for distinguishing between the two sections in theirpreliminary injunction arguments and therefore I will also usethe words interchangeably for this purpose, leaving open theissue for consideration at the final judgment stage if it becomesrelevant.                                B.                   Preliminary Injunction Standard          To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs mustestablish that they are likely to prevail on the merits and thatthey will suffer irreparable harm if injunctive relief is notgranted.  We also must consider whether the potential harm to thedefendant from issuance of a temporary restraining orderoutweighs possible harm to the plaintiffs if such relief isdenied, and whether the granting of injunctive relief is in thepublic interest.  See Campbell Soup Co. v. ConAgra, Inc., 977F.2d 86, 90-91 (3d Cir. 1992); Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. ofEduc., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir. 1990).          In a case in which the injury alleged is a threat toFirst Amendment interests, the finding of irreparable injury isoften tied to the likelihood of success on the merits.  In Elrodv. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme Court emphasized that"the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periodsof time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury."  Id. at373 (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713(1971)).          Subjecting speakers to criminal penalties for speechthat is constitutionally protected in itself raises the spectreof irreparable harm.  Even if a court were unwilling to draw thatconclusion from the language of the statute itself, plaintiffshave introduced ample evidence that the challenged provisions, ifnot enjoined, will have a chilling effect on their freeexpression.  Thus, this is not a case in which we are dealingwith a mere incidental inhibition on speech, see Hohe v. Casey,868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989), butwith a regulation that directly penalizes speech.          Nor could there be any dispute about the publicinterest factor which must be taken into account before a courtgrants a preliminary injunction.  No long string of citations isnecessary to find that the public interest weighs in favor ofhaving access to a free flow of constitutionally protectedspeech.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. VirginiaCitizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 763-65 (1976).            Thus, if plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of successon the merits, they will have shown the irreparable injury neededto entitle them to a preliminary injunction.                                C.                   Applicable Standard of Review          The CDA is patently a government-imposed content-basedrestriction on speech, and the speech at issue, whetherdenominated "indecent" or "patently offensive," is entitled toconstitutional protection.  See Sable Communications ofCalifornia, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  As such, theregulation is subject to strict scrutiny, and will only be upheldif it is justified by a compelling government interest and if itis narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest.  Sable, 492U.S. at 126; see also Turner Broadcasting, 114 S. Ct. at 2459(1994).  "[T]he benefit gained [by a content-based restriction]must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights." Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 363.          The government's position on the applicable standardhas been less than pellucid but, despite some references to asomewhat lesser burden employed in broadcasting cases, it nowappears to have conceded that it has the burden of proof to showboth a compelling interest and that the statute regulates leastrestrictively.  Tr. of Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 121 (May10, 1996).  In any event, the evidence and our Findings of Factbased thereon show that Internet communication, while unique, ismore akin to telephone communication, at issue in Sable, than tobroadcasting, at issue in Pacifica, because, as with thetelephone, an Internet user must act affirmatively anddeliberately to retrieve specific information online.  Even if abroad search will, on occasion, retrieve unwanted materials, theuser virtually always receives some warning of its content,significantly reducing the element of surprise or "assault"involved in broadcasting.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely thata very young child will be randomly "surfing" the Web and comeacross "indecent" or "patently offensive" material.            Judge Dalzell's separate opinion fully explores thereasons for the differential treatment of radio and televisionbroadcasting for First Amendment purposes from that accordedother means of communication.  It follows that to the extent theCourt employed a less than strict scrutiny standard of review inPacifica and other broadcasting cases, see, e.g., Red LionBroadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), there is no reasonto employ a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in thiscase.                                D.              The Nature of the Government's Interest          The government asserts that shielding minors fromaccess to indecent materials is the compelling interestsupporting the CDA.  It cites in support the statements of theSupreme Court that "[i]t is evident beyond the need forelaboration that a State's interest in `safeguarding the physicaland psychological well-being of a minor' is `compelling,'"  NewYork v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982)(quoting Globe NewspaperCo. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982)), and "there is acompelling interest in protecting the physical and psychologicalwell-being of minors.  This interest extends to shielding minorsfrom the influence of literature that is not obscene by adultstandards."  Sable, 492 U.S at 126.  It also cites the similarquotation appearing in Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. PennsylvaniaPublic Utility Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990).           Those statements were made in cases where the potentialharm to children from the material was evident.  Ferber involvedthe constitutionality of a statute which prohibited persons fromknowingly promoting sexual performances by children under 16 anddistributing material depicting such performances.  Sable andFabulous involved the FCC's ban on "dial-a-porn" (dealing bydefinition with pornographic telephone messages).  In contrast tothe material at issue in those cases, at least some of thematerial subject to coverage under the "indecent" and "patentlyoffensive" provisions of the CDA may contain valuable literary,artistic or educational information of value to older minors aswell as adults.  The Supreme Court has held that "minors areentitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection,and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances maygovernment bar public dissemination of protected materials tothem."  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213(1975)(citations omitted).            In Erznoznik, the Court rejected an argument that anordinance prohibiting the display of films containing nudity atdrive-in movie theatres served a compelling interest inprotecting minor passersby from the influence of such films.  TheCourt held that the prohibition was unduly broad, and explainedthat "[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subjectto some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solelyto protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative bodythinks unsuitable for them."  422 U.S. at 213-14.  As JusticeScalia noted in Sable, "[t]he more pornographic what is embracedwithin the . . .  category of `indecency,' the more reasonable itbecomes to insist upon greater assurance of insulation fromminors."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Itfollows that where non-pornographic, albeit sexually explicit,material also falls within the sweep of the statute, the interestwill not be as compelling.            In part, our consideration of the government's showingof a "compelling interest" trenches upon the vagueness issue,discussed in detail in Judge Buckwalter's opinion but equallypertinent to First Amendment analysis.  Material routinelyacceptable according to the standards of New York City, such asthe Broadway play Angels in America which concerns homosexualityand AIDS portrayed in graphic language, may be far lessacceptable in smaller, less cosmopolitan communities of theUnited States.  Yet the play garnered two Tony Awards and aPulitzer prize for its author, and some uninhibited parents andteachers might deem it to be material to be read or assigned toeleventh and twelfth graders.  If available on the Internetthrough some libraries, the text of the play would likely beaccessed in that manner by at least some students, and it wouldalso arguably fall within the scope of the CDA.          There has been recent public interest in the femalegenital mutilation routinely practiced and officially condoned insome countries.  News articles have been descriptive, and it isnot stretching to assume that this is a subject that occupiesnews groups and chat rooms on the Internet.  We have no assurancethat these discussions, of obvious interest and relevance toolder teenage girls, will not be viewed as patently offensive -even in context - in some communities.          Other illustrations abound of non-obscene materiallikely to be available on the Internet but subject to the CDA'scriminal provisions.  Photographs appearing in NationalGeographic or a travel magazine of the sculptures in India ofcouples copulating in numerous positions, a written descriptionof a brutal prison rape, or Francesco Clemente's painting"Labirinth," see Def. Exh. 125, all might be considered to"depict or describe, in terms patently offensive as measured bycontemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activitiesor organs."  47 U.S.C.  223(d)(1).  But the government has madeno showing that it has a compelling interest in preventing aseventeen-year-old minor from accessing such images.            By contrast, plaintiffs presented testimony thatmaterial that could be considered indecent, such as that offeredby Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS project, may becritically important for certain older minors.  For example,there was testimony that one quarter of all new HIV infections inthe United States is estimated to occur in young people betweenthe ages of 13 and 20, an estimate the government made no effortto rebut.  The witnesses believed that graphic material thattheir organizations post on the Internet could help save lives,but were concerned about the CDA's effect on their right to doso.          The government counters that this court should defer tolegislative conclusions about this matter.  However, where FirstAmendment rights are at stake, "[d]eference to a legislativefinding cannot limit judicial inquiry." Sable, 492 U.S. at 129(quoting Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829,843 (1978)).  "[W]hatever deference is due legislative findingswould not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearingon an issue of constitutional law."  Id.           Moreover, it appears that the legislative "findings"the government cites concern primarily testimony and statementsby legislators about the prevalence of obscenity, childpornography, and sexual solicitation of children on the Internet. Similarly, at the hearings before us the government introducedexhibits of sexually explicit material through the testimony ofAgent Howard Schmidt, which consisted primarily of the same typeof hard-core pornographic materials (even if not technicallyobscene) which concerned Congress and which fill the shelves of"adult" book and magazine stores.  Plaintiffs emphasize that theydo not challenge the Act's restrictions on speech not protectedby the First Amendment, such as obscenity, child pornography orharassment of children.  Their suit is based on their assertion,fully supported by their evidence and our findings, that the CDAreaches much farther.          I am far less confident than the government that itsquotations from earlier cases in the Supreme Court signify thatit has shown a compelling interest in regulating the vast rangeof online material covered or potentially covered by the CDA. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there is certainly a compellinggovernment interest to shield a substantial number of minors fromsome of the online material that motivated Congress to enact theCDA, and do not rest my decision on the inadequacy of thegovernment's showing in this regard.                                E.                     The Reach of the Statute          Whatever the strength of the interest the governmenthas demonstrated in preventing minors from accessing "indecent"and "patently offensive" material online, if the means it haschosen sweeps more broadly than necessary and thereby chills theexpression of adults, it has overstepped onto rights protected bythe First Amendment.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.            The plaintiffs argue that the CDA violates the FirstAmendment because it effectively bans a substantial category ofprotected speech from most parts of the Internet.  The government responds that the Act does not on its face or ineffect ban indecent material that is constitutionally protectedfor adults.  Thus one of the factual issues before us was thelikely effect of the CDA on the free availability ofconstitutionally protected material.  A wealth of persuasiveevidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of Fact, provedthat it is either technologically impossible or economicallyprohibitive for many of the plaintiffs to comply with the CDAwithout seriously impeding their posting of online material whichadults have a constitutional right to access.          With the possible exception of an e-mail to a knownrecipient, most content providers cannot determine the identityand age of every user accessing their material.  Consideringseparately content providers that fall roughly into twocategories, we have found that no technology exists which allowsthose posting on the category of newsgroups, mail exploders orchat rooms to screen for age.  Speakers using those forms ofcommunication cannot control who receives the communication, andin most instances are not aware of the identity of therecipients.  If it is not feasible for speakers who communicatevia these forms of communication to conduct age screening, theywould have to reduce the level of communication to that which isappropriate for children in order to be protected under thestatute.   This would effect a complete ban even for adults ofsome expression, albeit "indecent," to which they areconstitutionally entitled, and thus would be unconstitutionalunder the holding in Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.          Even as to content providers in the other broadcategory, such as the World Wide Web, where efforts at ageverification are technically feasible through the use of CommonGateway Interface (cgi) scripts (which enable creation of adocument that can process information provided by a Web visitor),the Findings of Fact show that as a practical matter, non-commercial organizations and even many commercial organizationsusing the Web would find it prohibitively expensive andburdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposedby the government, and that even if they could attempt to ageverify, there is little assurance that they could successfullyfilter out minors.          The government attempts to circumvent this problem byseeking to limit the scope of the statute to those contentproviders who are commercial pornographers, and urges that we dolikewise in our obligation to save a congressional enactment fromfacial unconstitutionality wherever possible.  But in light ofits plain language and its legislative history, the CDA cannotreasonably be read as limited to commercial pornographers.  Acourt may not impose a narrowing construction on a statute unlessit is "readily susceptible" to such a construction.  Virginia v.American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988).  The courtmay not "rewrite a . . . law to conform it to constitutionalrequirements."  Id.  Although we may prefer an interpretation ofa statute that will preserve the constitutionality of thestatutory scheme, United State v. Clark, 445 U.S. 23, 27 (1980),we do not have license to rewrite a statute to "createdistinctions where none were intended."  American Tobacco Co. v.Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 72 n.6 (1982); see also Consumer Party v.Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 147 (3d Cir. 1985).  The Court has oftenstated that "absent a clearly expressed legislative intention tothe contrary, [statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded asconclusive."  Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla Band ofMission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772 (1984)(quoting North Dakota v.United States, 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983)).          It is clear from the face of the CDA and from itslegislative history that Congress did not intend to limit itsapplication to commercial purveyors of pornography.  Congressunquestionably knew how to limit the statute to such entities ifthat was its intent, and in fact it did so in provisions relatingto dial-a-porn services.  See 47 U.S.C.  223(b)(2)(A)(criminalizing making any indecent telephone communication "forcommercial purposes").  It placed no similar limitation in theCDA.  Moreover, the Conference Report makes clear that Congressdid not intend to limit the application of the statute to contentproviders such as those which make available the commercialmaterial contained in the government's exhibits, and confirmsthat Congress intended "content regulation of both commercial andnon-commercial providers."  Conf. Rep. at 191.  See also, 141Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (Statement of SenatorExon).                   The scope of the CDA is not confined to material thathas a prurient interest or appeal, one of the hallmarks ofobscenity, because Congress sought to reach farther.  Nor didCongress include language that would define "patently offensive"or "indecent" to exclude material of serious value.  It followsthat to narrow the statute in the manner the government urgeswould be an impermissible exercise of our limited judicialfunction, which is to review the statute as written for itscompliance with constitutional mandates.              I conclude inexorably from the foregoing that the CDAreaches speech subject to the full protection of the FirstAmendment, at least for adults.[1]  In questions of the witnessesand in colloquy with the government attorneys, it became evidentthat even if "indecent" is read as parallel to "patentlyoffensive," the terms would cover a broad range of material fromcontemporary films, plays and books showing or describing sexualactivities (e.g., Leaving Las Vegas) to controversialcontemporary art and photographs showing sexual organs inpositions that the government conceded would be patentlyoffensive in some communities (e.g., a Robert Mapplethorpephotograph depicting a man with an erect penis).           We have also found that there is no effective way formany Internet content providers to limit the effective reach ofthe CDA to adults because there is no realistic way for manyproviders to ascertain the age of those accessing theirmaterials.  As a consequence, we have found that "[m]any speakerswho display arguably indecent content on the Internet must choosebetween silence and the risk of prosecution."  Such a choice,forced by sections 223(a) and (d) of the CDA, strikes at theheart of speech of adults as well as minors.                                                      F.                 Whether CDA is Narrowly Tailored          In the face of such a patent intrusion on a substantialcategory of protected speech for adults, there is some irony inconsidering whether the statute is narrowly tailored or, assometimes put, whether Congress has used the least restrictivemeans to achieve a compelling government interest.  See Sable,492 U.S. at 126.  It would appear that the extent of theabridgement of the protected speech of adults that it has beenshown the CDA would effect is too intrusive to be outweighed bythe government's asserted interest, whatever its strength, inprotecting minors from access to indecent material.  Nonetheless,the formulation of the inquiry requires that we consider thegovernment's assertion that the statute is narrowly drafted, andI proceed to do so.            In this case, the government relies on the statutorydefenses for its argument of narrow tailoring.  There are anumber of reasons why I am not persuaded that the statutorydefenses can save the CDA from a conclusion of facialunconstitutionality.          First, it is difficult to characterize a criminalstatute that hovers over each content provider, like theproverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow tailoring.  Criminalprosecution, which carries with it the risk of public obloquy aswell as the expense of court preparation and attorneys' fees,could itself cause incalculable harm.  No provider, whether anindividual, non-profit corporation, or even large publicly heldcorporation, is likely to willingly subject itself to prosecutionfor a miscalculation of the prevalent community standards or foran error in judgment as to what is indecent.  A successfuldefense to a criminal prosecution would be small solace indeed.          Credit card and adult verification services areexplicitly referred to as defenses in  223(e)(5)(B) of the CDA. As is set forth fully in the detailed Findings of Fact, thesedefenses are not technologically or economically feasible formost providers.            The government then falls back on the affirmativedefense to prosecution provided in  223(e)(5)(A) for a personwho "has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, andappropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict orprevent access by minors to a communication specified in suchsubsections . . . including any method which is feasible underavailable technology."  The government emphasizes that"effective" does not require 100% restriction, and that thisdefense is "open-ended" and requires only reasonable effortsbased on current technology.          But, as the evidence made clear, there is no suchtechnology at this time.  The government proffered as one optionthat would constitute a valid affirmative defense under 223(e)(5)(A) a "tagging" scheme conceived by Dr. Olsen inresponse to this lawsuit whereby a string of characters would beimbedded in all arguably indecent or patently offensive material. Our Findings of Fact set forth fully the reasons why we foundthat the feasibility and effectiveness of tagging in the mannerproposed by the government has not been established.  All partiesagree that tagging alone does nothing to prevent children fromaccessing potentially indecent material, because it depends uponthe cooperation of third parties to block the material on whichthe tags are embedded.  Yet these third parties, over which thecontent providers have no control, are not subject to the CDA.  Ido not believe a statute is narrowly tailored when it subjects topotential criminal penalties those who must depend upon thirdparties for the effective operation of a statutory defense.          Most important, the government's "tagging" proposal ispurely hypothetical and offers no currently operative defense toInternet content providers.  At this time, there is no agreed-upon "tag" in existence, and no web browsers or user-basedscreening systems are now configured to block tagged material. Nor, significantly, has the government stipulated that a contentprovider could avoid liability simply by tagging its material.             Third, even if the technology catches up, as thegovernment confidently predicts, there will still be a notinsignificant burden attached to effecting a tagging defense, aburden one should not have to bear in order to transmitinformation protected under the constitution.  For example, toeffect tagging content providers must review all of theirmaterial currently published online, as well as all new materialthey post in the future, to determine if it could be considered"patently offensive" in any community nationwide.  This would beburdensome for all providers, but for the many not-for-profitentities which currently post thousands of Web pages, this burdenwould be one impossible to sustain.           Finally, the viability of the defenses is intricatelytied to the clarity of the CDA's scope.  Because, like JudgeBuckwalter, and for many of the reasons he gives, I believe that"indecent" and "patently offensive" are inherently vague,particularly in light of the government's inability to identifythe relevant community by whose standards the material will bejudged, I am not persuaded by the government that the statutorydefenses in  223(e) provide effective protection from theunconstitutional reach of the statute.          Minors would not be left without any protection fromexposure to patently unsuitable material on the Internet shouldthe challenged provisions of the CDA be preliminarily enjoined.Vigorous enforcement of current obscenity and child pornographylaws should suffice to address the problem the governmentidentified in court and which concerned Congress.  When the CDAwas under consideration by Congress, the Justice Departmentitself communicated its view that it was not necessary because itwas prosecuting online obscenity, child pornography and childsolicitation under existing laws, and would continue to do so.[2] It follows that the CDA is not narrowly tailored, and thegovernment's attempt to defend it on that ground must fail.                                G.                      Preliminary Injunction          When Congress decided that material unsuitable forminors was available on the Internet, it could have chosen toassist and support the development of technology that wouldenable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such materialfrom their end.  It did not do so, and thus did not follow theexample available in the print media where non-obscene butindecent and patently offensive books and magazines abound. Those responsible for minors undertake the primary obligation toprevent their exposure to such material.  Instead, in the CDACongress chose to place on the speakers the obligation ofscreening the material that would possibly offend somecommunities.           Whether Congress' decision was a wise one is not atissue here.  It was unquestionably a decision that placed the CDAin serious conflict with our most cherished protection - theright to choose the material to which we would have access.            The government makes what I view as an extraordinaryargument in its brief.  It argues that blocking technology neededfor effective parental control is not yet widespread but that it"will imminently be in place." Government's Post-hearingMemorandum at 66.  It then states that if we uphold the CDA, it"will likely unleash the 'creative genius' of the Internetcommunity to find a myriad of possible solutions."  I can imaginefew arguments less likely to persuade a court to uphold acriminal statute than one that depends on future technology tocabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds.          The government makes yet another argument that troublesme.  It suggests that the concerns expressed by the plaintiffsand the questions posed by the court reflect an exaggeratedsupposition of how it would apply the law, and that we should, ineffect, trust the Department of Justice to limit the CDA'sapplication in a reasonable fashion that would avoid prosecutionfor placing on the Internet works of serious literary or artisticmerit.  That would require a broad trust indeed from a generationof judges not far removed from the attacks on James Joyce'sUlysses as obscene.  See United States v. One Book EntitledUlysses, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934); see also Book Named "JohnCleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" v. Attorney General ofMass., 383 U.S. 413 (1966).  Even if we were to place confidencein the reasonable judgment of the representatives of theDepartment of Justice who appeared before us, the Department isnot a monolithic structure, and individual U.S. Attorneys in thevarious districts of the country have or appear to exercise someindependence, as reflected by the Department's tolerance ofduplicative challenges in this very case.          But the bottom line is that the First Amendment shouldnot be interpreted to require us to entrust the protection itaffords to the judgment of prosecutors.  Prosecutors come and go.Even federal judges are limited to life tenure.  The FirstAmendment remains to give protection to future generations aswell.  I have no hesitancy in concluding that it is likely thatplaintiffs will prevail on the merits of their argument that thechallenged provisions of the CDA are facially invalid under boththe First and Fifth Amendments.  BUCKWALTER, District Judge                                A.          I believe that plaintiffs should prevail in thislitigation.            My conclusion differs in part from my originalmemorandum filed in conjunction with the request for a TemporaryRestraining Order.  As part of the expedited review (per  561 ofthe CDA), and in contrast to the limited documentation availableto me at the time of the T.R.O. hearing, we have now gatheredvoluminous evidence presented by way of sworn declarations, livetestimony, demonstrative evidence, and other exhibits.[1]  Basedupon our findings of fact derived from careful consideration ofthat evidence, I now conclude that this statute is overbroad anddoes not meet the strict scrutiny standard in SableCommunications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).          More specifically, I now find that current technologyis inadequate to provide a safe harbor to most speakers on theInternet.  On this issue, I concur in Chief Judge Sloviter'sopinion.  In addition, I continue to believe that the word"indecent" is unconstitutionally vague, and I find that the terms"in context" and "patently offensive" also are so vague as toviolate the First and Fifth Amendments.          It is, of course, correct that statutes that attempt toregulate the content of speech presumptively violate the FirstAmendment.  See e.g. R.A.V. v. City of Saint Paul, 505 U.S. 377,381 (1992).  That is as it should be.  The prohibition againstGovernment's regulation of speech cannot be set forth any clearerthan in the language of the First Amendment itself.  I suspect,however, that it may come as a surprise to many people who havenot followed the evolution of constitutional law that, byimplication at least, the First Amendment provides that Congressshall make no law abridging the freedom of speech unless that lawadvances a compelling governmental interest.[2]  Our cherishedfreedom of speech does not cover as broad a spectrum as one mayhave gleaned from a simple reading of the Amendment.[3]            First Amendment jurisprudence has developed into astudy of intertwining standards and applications, perhaps as anecessary response to our ever-evolving culture and modes ofcommunication.[4]            Essentially, my concerns are these:  above all, Ibelieve that the challenged provisions are so vague as to violateboth the First and Fifth Amendments, and in particular thatCongress' reliance on Pacifica is misplaced.  In addition, Ibelieve that technology as it currently exists -- and it bearsrepeating that we are at the preliminary injunction phase only --cannot provide a safe harbor for most speakers on the Internet,thus rendering the statute unconstitutional under a strictscrutiny analysis.  I refer to Chief Judge Sloviter's moredetailed analysis of this issue.           While I believe that our findings of fact clearly showthat as yet no defense is technologically feasible, and while Ialso have found the present Act to be unconstitutionally vague, Ibelieve it is too early in the development of this new medium toconclude that other attempts to regulate protected speech withinthe medium will fail a challenge.  That is to say that Ispecifically do not find that any and all statutory regulation ofprotected speech on the Internet could not survive constitutionalscrutiny.  Prior cases have established that governmentregulation to prevent access by minors to speech protected foradults, even in media considered the vanguard of our FirstAmendment protections, like print, may withstand a constitutionalchallenge.  See e.g. Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 635(1968) ("`Material which is protected for distribution to adultsis not necessarily constitutionally protected from restrictionupon its dissemination to children.'") (quoting Bookcase Inc. v.Broderick, 18 N.Y.2d 71, 75, 271 N.Y.S.2d 947, 952, 218 N.E.2d668, 671 (1966), appeal dismissed, sub nom Bookcase, Inc. v.Leary, 385 U.S. 12 (1966)).  It should be noted that thoserestrictions that have been found constitutional were sensitiveto the unique qualities of the medium at which the restrictionwas aimed.                                  B.          This statute, all parties agree, deals with protectedspeech, the preservation of which has been extolled by courtafter court in case after case as the keystone, the bulwark, thevery heart of our democracy. What is more, the CDA attempts toregulate protected speech through criminal sanctions, thusimplicating not only the First but also the Fifth Amendment ofour Constitution.  The concept of due process is every bit asimportant to our form of government as is free speech.  If freespeech is at the heart of our democracy, then surely due processis the very lifeblood of our body politic; for without it,democracy could not survive.  Distilled to its essence, dueprocess is, of course, nothing more and nothing less than fairplay.  If our citizens cannot rely on fair play in theirrelationship with their government, the stature of our governmentas a shining example of democracy would be greatly diminished.  Ibelieve that an exacting or strict scrutiny of a statute whichattempts to criminalize protected speech requires a word by wordlook at that statute to be sure that it clearly sets forth asprecisely as possible what constitutes a violation of thestatute.          The reason for such an examination is obvious.  If theGovernment is going to intrude upon the sacred ground of theFirst Amendment and tell its citizens that their exercise ofprotected speech could land them in jail, the law imposing such apenalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only forthe potential offender but also for the potential enforcer. Kolender, 461 U.S. 352; Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Smith v.Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408U.S. 104 (1972); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948).          In dealing with issues of vagueness and due processover the years, the Supreme Court has enunciated many notableprinciples.  One concern with vague laws relates to the issue ofnotice.  The older cases have used phrases such as "a statutewhich either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms sovague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess atits meaning and differ as to its application violates the firstessential of due process of law,"  Connally v. General Const.Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (citations omitted); "it will notdo to hold an average man to the peril of indictment for theunwise exercise of his . . . knowledge involving so many factorsof varying effect that neither the person to decide in advancenor the jury to try him after the fact can safely and certainlyjudge the result," Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., 274 U.S. 445, 465(1927); and "[n]o one may be required at peril of life, libertyor property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands orforbids," Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). Second, the Court has said that laws must provide precisestandards for those who apply them to prevent arbitrary anddiscriminatory enforcement, because "[w]hen the legislature failsto provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit`a standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, andjuries to pursue their personal predilections.'"  Kolender, 461U.S. at 358 (citing Goguen, 415 U.S. at 575).  Finally, whenFirst Amendment concerns have been implicated, a stricterstandard of examination for vagueness is imperative.  "[T]hiscourt has intimated that stricter standards of permissiblestatutory vagueness may be applied to a statute having apotentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may the less berequired to act at his peril here, because the free disseminationof ideas may be the loser."  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147,151 (1959).  See also Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499("[P]erhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity thatthe Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens toinhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.  If,for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech . .. , a more stringent vagueness test should apply.") (citationsomitted).          A case which sums up vagueness as it relates to dueprocess as succinctly as any other is Grayned v. City ofRockford.  Here the court said:               It is a basic principle of due process               that an enactment is void for vagueness               if its prohibitions are not clearly               defined.  Vague laws offend several               important values.  First, because we               assume that man is free to steer between               lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist               that laws give the person of ordinary               intelligence a reasonable opportunity to               know what is prohibited, so that he may               act accordingly.  Vague laws may trap               the innocent by not providing fair               warning.  Second, if arbitrary and               discriminatory enforcement is to be               prevented, laws must provide explicit               standards for those who apply them.  A               vague law impermissibly delegates basic               policy matters to policemen, judges, and               juries for resolution on an ad hoc and               subjective basis, with the attendant               dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory               application.  Third, but related, where               a vague statute "abut[s] upon sensitive               areas of basic First Amendment               freedoms," it "operates to inhibit the               exercise of [those] freedoms."                Uncertain meanings inevitably lead               citizens to "'steer far wider of the               unlawful zone' . . . than if the               boundaries of the forbidden areas were               clearly marked."Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations omitted).            At the same time, in considering the vagueness issue,as the Government correctly points out, "[C]ondemned to the useof words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from ourlanguage." Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110.  See also Hoffman Estates,455 U.S. 489; Hynes v. Mayor & Council of Oradell, 425 U.S. 610(1976); Goguen, 415 U.S. 566.   In addition, it will always betrue that the fertile legal "imagination can conjure hypotheticalcases in which the meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nicequestion."  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382,412 (1950).  Thus, as I considered the vagueness issue I havekept in mind the observation of Justice Holmes, denying achallenge to vagueness in Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373(1913).  To Justice Holmes, "the law is full of instances where aman's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as thejury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree.  If hisjudgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a shortimprisonment . . ., he may incur the penalty of death."  Nash,229 U.S. at 377.  Even more recently the court has stated that"due process does not require `impossible standards' of clarity." Kolender, 461 U.S. at 361, (quoting United States v. Petrillo,332 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).  It is with all of these principles inmind, as they interplay with the unique features of the Internet,that I have reached my conclusion.          The fundamental constitutional principle that concernsme is one of simple fairness, and that is absent in the CDA.  TheGovernment initially argues that "indecent" in this statute isthe same as "patently offensive."  I do not agree that a facialreading of this statute supports that conclusion.  The CDA doesnot define the term "indecent," and the FCC has not promulgatedregulations defining indecency in the medium of cyberspace.   If"indecent" and "patently offensive" were intended to have thesame meaning, surely section (a) could have mirrored section(d)'s language.[5]  Indecent in this statute is an undefined wordwhich, standing alone, offers no guidelines whatsoever as to itsparameters.  Interestingly, another federal crime gives adefinition to indecent entirely different from that proposed inthe present case.[6]  While not applicable here, this exampleshows the indeterminate nature of the word and the need for cleardefinition, particularly in a statute which infringes uponprotected speech.  Although the use of different terms in 223(a) and (d) suggests that Congress intended that the termshave different meanings, the Conference Report indicates anintention to treat  223(a) as containing the same language as 223(d).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89 ("The conferees intend that theterm indecency . . . has the same meaning as established in FCCv. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and [Sable] and "Newsection 223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from[Pacifica] . . . .  The precise contours of the definition ofindecency have varied . . . .  The essence of the phrase --patently offensive descriptions of sexual and excretoryactivities -- has remained constant, however.").  Therefore, Iwill acknowledge that the term indecency is "reasonablysusceptible" to the definition offered in the Conference Reportand might therefore adopt such a narrowing construction if itwould thereby preserve the constitutionality of the statute.  SeeVirginia v. American Booksellers Association, 484 U.S. 383, 397(1988);  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).           Accepting these terms as synonymous, however, providesno greater help to a speaker attempting to comply with the CDA. Contrary to the Government's suggestion, Pacifica does not answerthe question of whether the terms pass constitutional muster inthe present case.  In Pacifica, the Court did not consider avagueness challenge to the term "indecent," but considered onlywhether the Government had the authority to regulate theparticular broadcast at issue -- George Carlin's Monologueentitled "Filthy Words."  In finding in the affirmative, theCourt emphasized that its narrow holding applied only tobroadcasting, which is "uniquely accessible to children, eventhose too young to read."  438 U.S. at 749.  Thus, while theCourt sanctioned the FCC's time restrictions on a radio programthat repeatedly used vulgar language, the Supreme Court did nothold that use of the term "indecent" in a statute applied toother media, particularly a criminal statute, would be on safeconstitutional ground.          The Supreme Court more recently had occasion toconsider a statute banning "indecent" material in the dial-a-porncontext in Sable, 492 U.S. 115, and found that a complete ban onsuch programming violated the First Amendment because it was notnarrowly tailored to serve the purpose of limiting children'saccess to commercial pornographic telephone messages.  Onceagain, the Court did not consider a challenge to the term"indecent" on vagueness grounds, and indeed has never directlyruled on this issue.          Several other courts have, however, upheld the use ofthe term in statutes regulating different media.  For example, inInformation Providers' Coalition v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir.1991), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether theterm "indecent" in the 1989 Amendment to the Communications Actregulating access to telephone dial-a-porn services and the FCC'simplementing regulations was void for vagueness.  The FCC haddefined "indecent" as "the description or depiction of sexual orexcretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner asmeasured by contemporary community standards for the telephonemedium."  928 F.2d at 874.  Although recognizing that the SupremeCourt had never explicitly ruled on a vagueness challenge to theterm, the court read Sable and Pacifica as having implicitlyaccepted the use of this definition of "indecent."  The courtfurther stated that the FCC's definition of "indecent" was noless imprecise than was the definition of "obscenity" asannounced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973), andthus concluded that "indecent" as pertained to dial-a-pornregulations must survive a vagueness challenge.  See also DialInformation Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991),(upholding the use of "indecent" in the same amendment to theCommunications Act and FCC regulations.); Action for Children'sTelevision v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (rejectingvagueness challenge to "indecency" provision in broadcasttelevision regulations).[7]                Notably, however, in these telephone and cabletelevision cases the FCC had defined indecent as patentlyoffensive by reference to contemporary community standards forthat particular medium.  See, e.g., Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 732(defining "indecent" by reference to terms "patently offensive asmeasured by contemporary community standards for the broadcastmedium"); Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1540 (definingindecency by reference to contemporary community standards forthe telephone medium).  Here, the provision is not so limited. In fact, there is no effort to conform the restricting terms tothe medium of cyberspace, as is required under Pacifica and itsprogeny.          The Government attempts to save the "indecency" and"patently offensive" provisions by claiming that the provisionswould only be used to prosecute pornographic works which, whenconsidered "in context" as the statute requires, would beconsidered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in any community. The Government thus contends that plaintiffs' fears ofprosecution for publishing material about matters of health, art,literature or civil liberties are exaggerated and unjustified. The Government's argument raises two issues:  first is thequestion of which "community standards" apply in cyberspace,under the CDA; and second is the proposition that citizens shouldsimply rely upon prosecutors to apply the statuteconstitutionally.          Are the contemporary community standards to be appliedthose of the vast world of cyberspace, in accordance with theAct's apparent intent to establish a uniform national standard ofcontent regulation?  The Government offered no evidence of anysuch national standard or nationwide consensus as to what wouldbe considered "patently offensive".  On the contrary, insupporting the use of the term "indecent" in the CDA, theGovernment suggests that, in part, this term was chosen as ameans of insulating children from material not restricted undercurrent obscenity laws.  This additional term is necessary, theGovernment states, because "whether something rises to the levelof obscene is a legal conclusion that, by definition, may varyfrom community to community."  Govt. Brief at 31.  In support ofits argument, the Government points to the Second Circuit'sdecision in United States v. Various Articles of ObsceneMerchandise, Schedule No. 2102, 709 F.2d 132, 134, 137 (2d Cir.1983), which upheld the district court's conclusion that"detailed portrayals of genitalia, sexual intercourse, fellatio,and masturbation" including the film "Deep Throat" and otherpornographic films and magazines, are not obscene in light of thecommunity standards prevailing in New York City."  What thisargument indicates is that as interpretations of obscenity ebband flow throughout various communities, restrictions on indecentmaterial are meant to cover a greater or lesser quantity ofmaterial not reached by each community's obscenity standard.  Itfollows that to do this, what constitutes indecency must be asopen to fluctuation as the obscenity standard and cannot berigidly constructed as a single national standard if it is meantto function as the Government has suggested.  As Justice Scaliastated, "[t]he more narrow the understanding of what is`obscene,' . . . the more pornographic what is embraced withinthe residual category of `indecency.'"  Sable, 492 U.S. at 132(Scalia, J. concurring).  This understanding is consistent withthe case law, in which the Supreme Court has explained that therelevant community is the one where the information is accessedand where the local jury sits.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 125;Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974); Miller, 413 U.S. at30 ("[O]ur nation is simply too big and too diverse for thisCourt to reasonably expect that such standards [of what ispatently offensive] could be articulated for all 50 states in asingle formulation.").  However, the Conference Report withregard to the CDA states that the Act is "intended to establish auniform national standard of content regulation."  Conf. Rep. at191.  This conflict inevitably leaves the reader of the CDAunable to discern the relevant "community standard," and willundoubtedly cause Internet users to "steer far wider of theunlawful zone" than if the community standard to be applied wereclearly defined.  The chilling effect on the Internet users'exercise of free speech is obvious.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377U.S. 360, 372 (1964).  This is precisely the vice of vagueness.          In addition, the Government's argument that thechallenged provisions will be applied only to "pornographic"materials, and will not be applied to works with serious value iswithout support in the CDA itself.  Unlike in the obscenitycontext, indecency has not been defined to exclude works ofserious literary, artistic, political or scientific value, andtherefore the Government's suggestion that it will not be used toprosecute publishers of such material is without foundation inthe law itself.  The Government's claim that the work must beconsidered patently offensive "in context" does nothing toclarify the provision, for it fails to explain which context isrelevant.  "Context" may refer to, among other things, the natureof the communication as a whole, the time of day it was conveyed,the medium used, the identity of the speaker, or whether or notit is accompanied by appropriate warnings.  See e.g., Pacifica,438 U.S. at 741 n.16, n.17 (referring to "the context of thewhole book," and to the unique interpretation of the FirstAmendment "in the broadcasting context").          The thrust of the Government's argument is that thecourt should trust prosecutors to prosecute only a small segmentof those speakers subject to the CDA's restrictions, and whoseworks would reasonably be considered "patently offensive" inevery community.  Such unfettered discretion to prosecutors,however, is precisely what due process does not allow.  "It willnot do to say that a prosecutor's sense of fairness and theConstitution would prevent a successful . . . prosecution forsome of the activities seemingly embraced within the sweepingstatutory definitions.  The hazard of being prosecuted . . .nevertheless remains . . . .  Well-intentioned prosecutors andjudicial safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law." Baggett, 377 U.S. at 373-74; see also Keyishian v. Board ofRegents, 385 U.S. 589, 599 (1967)("[i]t is no answer" to a vaguelaw for the Government "to say that the statute would not beapplied in such a case.").  And we cannot overlook the vagariesof politics.  What may be, figuratively speaking, oneadministration's pen may be another's sword.          The evidence and arguments presented by the Governmentillustrate the possibility of arbitrary enforcement of the Act. For example, one Government expert opined that any of the so-called "seven dirty words" used in the Carlin monologue would besubject to the CDA and therefore should be "tagged," as shouldpaintings of nudes displayed on a museum's web site.  TheGovernment has suggested in its brief, however, that the Actshould not be so applied.  See Govt. Brief at 37 (suggesting that"seven dirty words" if used "in the context of seriousdiscussions" would not be subject to the Act).  Even Governmentcounsel was unable to define "indecency" with specificity.  TheJustice Department attorney could not respond to numerousquestions from the court regarding whether, for example, artisticphotographs of a nude man with an erect penis, depictions ofIndian statues portraying different methods of copulation, or thetranscript of a scene from a contemporary play about AIDS couldbe considered "indecent" under the Act.            Plaintiffs also argue that section 223(e)(5)(A) of theCDA, offering a defense for speakers who take "good faith,reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under thecircumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to acommunication" covered by the Act, is unconstitutionally vaguebecause it fails to specify what would constitute an effectivedefense to prosecution.  The plain language of the safe harborprovision indicates an effort to ensure that the statute limitsspeech in the least restrictive means possible by taking intoaccount emerging technologies in allowing for any and all"reasonable, effective and appropriate" approaches to restrictingminors' access to the proscribed material.  But, the statuteitself does not contain any description of what, other thancredit card verification and adult identification codes -- whichwe have established remain unavailable to most content providers-- will protect a speaker from prosecution.  Significantly,although the FCC is authorized to specify measures that mightsatisfy this defense, the FCC's views will not be definitive butwill only "be admitted as evidence of good faith efforts" thatthe defendant has met the requirements of the defense.  47 U.S.C. 223(e)(6).  Thus, individuals attempting to comply with thestatute presently have no clear indication of what actions willensure that they will be insulated from criminal sanctions underthe CDA.                                            C.          The consequences of posting indecent content aresevere.[8]  I recognize that people must make judgments each andevery day, many times in the most intimate of relationships andthat an error in judgment can have serious consequences.  It isalso true that where those consequences involve penal sanctions,a criminal law or statute has more often than not carefullydefined the proscribed conduct.  It is not so much that theaccused needs these precise definitions, as it has been said heor she rarely reads the law in advance.  What is more importantis that the enforcer of statutes must be guided by clear andprecise standards.  In statutes that break into relatively newareas, such as this one, the need for definition of terms isgreater, because even commonly understood terms may havedifferent connotations or parameters in this new context.[9]Words cannot define conduct with mathematical certainty, andlawyers, like the bright and intelligent ones now before us, willmost certainly continue to devise ways by which to challengethem.  This rationale, however, can neither support a finding ofconstitutionality nor relieve legislators from the very difficulttask of carefully drafting legislation tailored to its goal andsensitive to the unique characteristics of, in this instance,cyberspace.DALZELL, District JudgeA. Introduction          I begin with first principles:  As a general rule, theConstitution forbids the Government from silencing speakersbecause of their particular message.  R.A.V. v. City of SaintPaul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992).  "Our political system andcultural life rest upon this ideal."  Turner Broadcasting Sys. v.FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  This general rule is subjectonly to "narrow and well-understood exceptions".  Id.  A lawthat, as here, regulates speech on the basis of its content, is"presumptively invalid".  R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2542.          Two of the exceptions to this general rule deal withobscenity (commonly understood to include so-called hardcorepornography), Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and childpornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982).  TheGovernment can and does punish with criminal sanction people whoengage in these forms of speech.  18 U.S.C.  1464-65(criminalizing obscene material); id.  2251-52 (criminalizingchild pornography).  Indeed, the Government could punish theseforms of speech on the Internet even without the CDA.  E.g.,United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995)(affirming obscenity convictions for the operation of a computerbulletin board).            The Government could also completely ban obscenity andchild pornography from the Internet.  No Internet speaker has aright to engage in these forms of speech, and no Internetlistener has a right to receive them.  Child pornography andobscenity have "no constitutional protection, and the governmentmay ban [them] outright in certain media, or in all."  Alliancefor Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. Cir. 1995)(citing R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2545), cert. granted sub nom.Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium, 116 S. Ct. 471(1996); see also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756.  As R.A.V. notes, "'thefreedom of speech' referred to by the First Amendment does notinclude a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations." R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2543.          The cases before us, however, are not about obscenityor child pornography.  Plaintiffs in these actions claim no rightto engage in these forms of speech in the future, nor does theGovernment intimate that plaintiffs have engaged in these formsof speech in the past.          This case is about "indecency", as that word has cometo be understood since the Supreme Court's decisions in FCC v.Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1976), and SableCommunications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The legaldifficulties in these actions arise because of the special placethat indecency occupies in the Supreme Court's First Amendmentjurisprudence.  While adults have a First Amendment right toengage in indecent speech, Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; see alsoPacifica, 438 U.S. at 747-48, the Supreme Court has also heldthat the Government may, consistent with the Constitution,regulate indecency on radio and television, and in the "dial-a-porn" context, as long as the regulation does not operate as acomplete ban.  Thus, any regulation of indecency in these areasmust give adults access to indecent speech, which is their right.          The Government may only regulate indecent speech for acompelling reason, and in the least restrictive manner.  Sable,492 U.S. at 126.  "It is not enough to show that the Government'sends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored toachieve those ends."  Id.  This "most exacting scrutiny", Turner,114 S. Ct. at 2459, requires the Government to "demonstrate thatthe recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that theregulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct andmaterial way."  United States v. National Treasury EmployeesUnion, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1017 (1995) (citing Turner, 114 S. Ct. at1017).  Thus, although our analysis here must balance ends andmeans, the scales tip at the outset in plaintiffs' favor.  Thisis so because "[r]egulations which permit the Government todiscriminate on the basis of the content of the message cannot betolerated under the First Amendment."  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of the New York State Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105,116 (1991) (citation omitted).            The Government argues that this case is really aboutpornography on the Internet.  Apart from hardcore and childpornography, however, the word pornography does not have a fixedlegal meaning.  When I use the word pornography in my analysisbelow, I refer to for-profit purveyors of sexually explicit,"adult" material similar to that at issue in Sable.  See 492 U.S.at 118.  Pornography is normally either obscene or indecent, asJustice Scalia noted in his concurrence in Sable.  Id. at 132.  Iwould avoid using such an imprecise (and overbroad) word, but Ifeel compelled to do so here, since Congress undoubtedly had suchmaterial in mind when it passed the CDA.  See S. Rep. No. 230,104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-91 (1996), reprinted in 1996U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 200-05 [hereinafter Senate Report].  Moreover,the Government has defended the Act before this court by arguingthat the Act could be constitutionally applied to such material.          Plaintiffs have, as noted, moved for a preliminaryinjunction.  The standards for such relief are well-settled. Plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show (1)"[a] reasonable probability of eventual success in thelitigation" and (2) "irreparabl[e] injur[y] pendente lite" ifrelief is not granted.  Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.2d645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994).  We must also consider, if appropriate,(3) "the possibility of harm to other interested persons from thegrant or denial of the injunction", and (4) "the publicinterest".  Id.; see also Opticians Ass'n v. IndependentOpticians, 920 F.2d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).          In a First Amendment challenge, a plaintiff who meetsthe first prong of the test for a preliminary injunction willalmost certainly meet the second, since irreparable injurynormally arises out of the deprivation of speech rights, "foreven minimal periods of time".  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347,373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert.denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989).  Of course, neither the Governmentnor the public generally can claim an interest in the enforcementof an unconstitutional law.  Thus, I focus my legal analysistoday primarily on whether plaintiffs have shown a likelihood ofsuccess on their claim that the CDA is unconstitutional.  Theissues of irreparable harm to plaintiffs, harm to third parties,and the public interest all flow from that determination.[1]          Plaintiffs' challenge here is a "facial" one.  A lawthat regulates the content of speech is facially invalid if itdoes not pass the "most exacting scrutiny" that we have describedabove, or if it would "penalize a substantial amount of speechthat is constitutionally protected".  Forsyth County v.Nationalist Movement, 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  This is soeven if some applications would be "constitutionallyunobjectionable".  Id.; see also National Treasury EmployeesUnion v. United States, 990 F.2d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993)(Randolph, J., concurring), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995). Sometimes facial challenges require an inquiry into a party's"standing" (i.e., whether a party may properly challenge a law asfacially invalid).  See, e.g., Ferber, 458 U.S. at 767-79.  Atother times a facial challenge requires only an inquiry into thelaw's reach.  See, e.g., R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2547.[2]  As Idescribe it in part C below, I have no question that plaintiffshere have standing to challenge the validity of the CDA, and,indeed, the Government has not seriously challenged plaintiffs'standing to do so.  See, e.g., Virginia v. American BooksellersAssoc., 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988).  Thus, the focus is squarely onthe merits of plaintiffs' facial challenge.[3]          I divide my legal analysis below into three parts.  InPart B, I examine the traditional definition of indecency andrelate it to the provisions of the CDA at issue in this action. From this analysis I conclude that  223(a) and  223(d) of theCDA reach the same kind of speech.  My analysis also convinces methat plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their claim that theCDA is unconstitutionally vague.  In Part C, I address theGovernment's argument that plaintiffs are not the CDA's target,nor would they likely face prosecution under the Act.  Here, Iconclude that plaintiffs could reasonably fear prosecution underthe Act, even if some of their fears border on the farfetched. In Part D, I consider the legal implications of the specialattributes of Internet communication, as well as the effect thatthe CDA would have on these attributes.  In this Part I concludethat the disruptive effect of the CDA on Internet communication,as well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech, not onlyrender the Act unconstitutional but also would renderunconstitutional any regulation of protected speech on this newmedium.B.  Defining Indecency          Although no court of appeals has ever to my knowledgeupheld a vagueness challenge to the meaning of "indecency",several recent cases have grappled with the elusive meaning ofthat word in the context of cable television and "dial-a-porn". Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir.1995), cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); Dial InformationServ. Corp. v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert.denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992); Information Providers Coalition forDefense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir.1991).          In Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 123-25, forexample, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals addressedprohibitions on indecent programming on certain cable televisionchannels.  That court noted that the FCC has codified the meaningof "'indecent' programming" on cable television as "programmingthat describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities ororgans in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporarycommunity standards for the cable medium."  Id. at 112 (citingwhat is now 47 C.F.R.  76.701(g)).          The FCC took a similar approach to the definition of"indecency" in the "dial-a-porn" medium.[4]  In Dial InformationServices, 938 F.2d at 1540, the Second Circuit quoted the FCC'sdefinition of indecent telephone communications in that context:               [I]n the dial-a-porn context, we               believe it is appropriate to define               indecency as the description or               depiction of sexual or excretory               activities or organs in a patently               offensive manner as measured by               contemporary community standards               for the telephone medium.Id. at 1540 (citation omitted); see also Information Providers'Coalition for Defense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d866, 876 (9th Cir. 1991).          These three cases recognize that the FCC did not define"indecency" for cable and dial-a-porn in a vacuum.  Rather, itborrowed from the Supreme Court's decision in FCC v. PacificaFoundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  In that case (which I describein greater detail below), the Supreme Court established the roughoutline from which the FCC fashioned its three-part definition. For the first two parts of the test, the Supreme Court emphasizedthe "importance of context" in examining arguably indecentmaterial.  Id. at 747 n.25.  "Context" in the Pacifica opinionincludes consideration of both the particular medium from whichthe material originates and the particular community thatreceives the material.  Id. at 746 (assuming that the Carlinmonologue "would be protected in other contexts"); id. at 748-51(discussing the attributes of broadcast); see also InformationProviders' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876 (discussing the"content/context dichotomy").  Second, the opinion limits itsdiscussion to "patently offensive sexual and excretory language",Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747, and this type of content has remainedthe FCC's touchstone.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media,56 F.3d at 112.[5]          We have quoted from the CDA extensively above and Iwill only briefly rehearse that discussion here.  Section 223(a)of the CDA criminalizes "indecent" speech on the Internet.  Thisis the "indecency" provision.  Section 223(d) of the CDAaddresses speech that, "in context, depicts or describes, interms patently offensive as measured by contemporary communitystandards, sexual or excretory activities or organs".  This isthe "patently offensive" provision.  The foregoing discussionleads me to conclude that these two provisions describe the samekind of speech.  That is, the use of "indecent" in  223(a) isshorthand for the longer description in  223(d).  Conversely,the longer description in  223(d) is itself the definition of"indecent" speech.  I believe Congress could have used the word"indecent" in both  223(a) and  223(d), or it could have usedthe "patently offensive" description of  223(d) in  223(a),without a change in the meaning of the Act.  I do not believethat Congress intended that this distinction alone would changethe reach of either section of the CDA.[6]          The CDA's legislative history confirms this conclusion. There, the conference committee explicitly noted that  223(d)"codifies the definition of indecency from FCC v. PacificaFoundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). . . .  The conferees intend thatthe term indecency (and the rendition of the definition of thatterm in new section 502) has the same meaning as established inFCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and SableCommunications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989)." Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02. The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intendto create a distinction in meaning when it used the generic term"indecency" in  223(a) and the definition of that term in 223(d).[7]          There is no doubt that the CDA requires the moststringent review for vagueness, since it is a criminal statutethat "threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionallyprotected rights".  Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S 379, 391(1979); see also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8(1983); Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.  My analysis herenevertheless leads ineluctably to the conclusion that thedefinition of indecency is not unconstitutionally vague.  TheMiller definition of obscenity has survived such challenges, see,e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 118-19 (1974); FortWayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57 (1989), and thedefinition of indecency contains a subset of the elements ofobscenity.  If the Miller test "give[s] the person of ordinaryintelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly", Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408U.S. 104, 108 (1972), the omission of parts of that test does notwarrant a contrary conclusion.  See Dial Information Services,938 F.2d at 1541-42.  Similarly, since the definition ofindecency arose from the Supreme Court itself in Pacifica, we mayfairly imply that the Court did not believe its owninterpretation to invite "arbitrary and discriminatoryenforcement" or "abut upon sensitive areas of basic FirstAmendment freedoms".  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations andalterations omitted).  Sable, while not explicitly addressing theissue of vagueness, reinforces this conclusion.  See InformationProviders' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 875-76 (citing Sable, 492 U.S.at 126-27).  It follows, then, that plaintiffs' vaguenesschallenge is not likely to succeed on the merits and does notsupport preliminary injunctive relief.          The possible interpretations of the defenses in 223(e) do not alter this conclusion.  As a matter of statutoryconstruction,  223(e)(5)(B) could not be clearer.  This section,which imports the dial-a-porn defenses into the CDA, creates"specific and objective" methods to avoid liability.  See Robertsv. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 629 (1984).  Section223(e)(5)(A) is more suspect, since it arguably "fail[s] todescribe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do inorder to satisfy" it.  Kolender 461 U.S. at 361.[8]  Yet eventhough the defenses in both sections are unavailable to manyInternet users, their unavailability does not render theliability provisions vague.  Rather, their unavailability justtransforms  223(a) and  223(d) into a total ban, in violationof Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), and Sable, 492U.S. at 127, 131.  I am sensitive to plaintiffs' arguments thatthe statute, as written, does not create safe harbors throughwhich all Internet users may shield themselves from liability. Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 37-38.  Here again, however, theabsence of safe harbors relates to the (over)breadth of astatute, and not its vagueness.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.C.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Prosecution Under the Act          The Government has consistently argued that the speechof many of the plaintiffs here is almost certainly not indecent. They point, for example, to the educational and political contentof plaintiffs' speech, and they also suggest that the occasionalcurse word in a card catalogue will probably not result inprosecution.  See Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996U.S.C.C.A.N. at 203 ("Material with serious redeeming value isquite obviously intended to edify and educate, not to offend."). In this section I address that argument.          I agree with the Government that some of plaintiffs'claims are somewhat exaggerated, but hyperbolic claims do not inthemselves weigh in the Government's favor.  In recent FirstAmendment challenges, the Supreme Court has itself paid closeattention to extreme applications of content-based laws.            In Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New YorkState Crimes Victim Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), the Courtaddressed the constitutionality of a law that required criminalsto turn over to their victims any income derived from books,movies, or other commercial exploitation of their crimes.  Id. at504-05.  In its opinion, the Court evaluated the argument of anamicus curiae that the law's reach could include books such asThe Autobiography of Malcolm X, Civil Disobedience, andConfessions of Saint Augustine, and authors such as Emma Goldman,Martin Luther King, Jr., Sir Walter Raleigh, Jesse Jackson, andBertrand Russell.  Id. at 121-22.  The Court credited theargument even while recognizing that it was laced with"hyperbole":               The argument that [the] statute . .               . would prevent publication of all               of these works is hyperbole -- some               would have been written without               compensation -- but the . . . law               clearly reaches a wide range of               literature that does not enable a               criminal to profit from his crime               while a victim remains               uncompensated.Id. at 122.  If a content-based law "can produce such anoutcome", id. at 123 (emphasis added), then Simon & Schusterallows us to consider those outcomes in our analysis.          Even more recently, in United States v. NationalTreasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995), the Courtaddressed the constitutionality of a law that banned federalemployees from accepting honoraria for publications unrelated totheir work.  Id. at 1008.  The Court noted that the law wouldreach "literary giants like Nathaniel Hawthorne and HermanMelville, . . . Walt Whitman, . . . and Bret Harte".  Id. at1012.  This concern resurfaced later in the opinion, see id. at1015 ("[W]e cannot ignore the risk that [the ban] might depriveus of the work of a future Melville or Hawthorne."), even thougha footnote immediately renders this concern at least hyperbolic:               These authors' familiar masterworks               would survive the honoraria ban as               currently administered.  Besides               exempting all books, the               [regulations implementing the ban]               protect fiction and poetry from the               ban's coverage, although the               statute's language is not so clear.                But some great artists deal in fact               as well as fiction, and some deal               in both.Id. n.16 (citations omitted).          Here, even though it is perhaps unlikely that theCarnegie Library will ever stand in the dock for putting its cardcatalogue online, or that the Government will hale the ACLU intocourt for its online quiz of the seven dirty words, we cannotignore that the Act could reach these activities.  The definitionof indecency, like the definition of obscenity, is not a rigidformula.  Rather, it confers a large degree of autonomy toindividual communities to set the bounds of decency forthemselves.  Cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  This is as it shouldbe, since this flexibility recognizes that ours is a country withdiverse cultural and historical roots.  See, e.g., Hamling, 418U.S. at 104 ("A juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge ofthe views of the average person in the community or vicinage fromwhich he comes for making the required determination, just as heis entitled to draw on his knowledge of the propensities of a'reasonable' person in other areas of the law.").          Putting aside hyperbolic application, I also havelittle doubt that some communities could well considerplaintiffs' speech indecent, and these plaintiffs could --perhaps should -- have a legitimate fear of prosecution.  InAction for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir.1995), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized threebroadcasts that the FCC found indecent in the late 1980s:               The offending morning broadcast . .               . contained "explicit references to               masturbation, ejaculation, breast               size, penis size, sexual               intercourse, nudity, urination,               oral-genital contact, erections,               sodomy, bestiality, menstruation               and testicles."  The remaining two               were similarly objectionable.Id. at 657 (citing In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC R.930, 932 (1987)).  In Infinity Broadcasting, one of thebroadcasts that the FCC found indecent was an excerpt of a playabout AIDS, finding that the excerpts "contained the concentratedand repeated use of vulgar and shocking language to portraygraphic and lewd depictions of excretion, anal intercourse,ejaculation, masturbation, and oral-genital sex".  3 FCC R. at934.[9]  To the FCC, even broadcasts with "public value . . .addressing the serious problems posed by AIDS" can be indecent if"that material is presented in a manner that is patentlyoffensive".  Id. (emphasis in original).[10]            Yet, this is precisely the kind of speech that occurs,for example, on Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, whichincludes safer sex instructions written in street language foreasy comprehension.  The Web site also describes the risk of HIVtransmission for particular sexual practices.  The FCC'simplication in In the Matter of King Broadcasting Co., 5 FCC R.2971 (1990), that a "candid discussion[] of sexual topics" ontelevision was decent in part because it was "not presented in apandering, titillating or vulgar manner" would be unavailing toCritical Path, other plaintiffs, and some amici.  Theseorganizations want to pander and titillate on their Web sites, atleast to a degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver theirmessage in an engaging and coherent way.[11]          In In re letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC R. 3689(1990), the FCC found indecent a morning discussion between twoannouncers regarding Jim Bakker's alleged rape of Jessica Hahn. Id.  Here, too, the FCC recognized that the broadcast had publicvalue.  Id. (noting that the broadcast concerned "an incidentthat was at the time 'in the news'").  Yet, under the FCC'sinterpretation of Pacifica, "the merit of a work is 'simply oneof the many variables' that make up a work's context".  Id.(citation omitted).          One of the plaintiffs here, Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc.,has as its core purpose the issue of prison rape.  Theorganization creates chat rooms in which members can discusstheir experiences.  Some amici have also organized Web sitesdedicated to survivors of rape, incest, and other sexual abuse. These Web sites provide fora for the discussion and contemplationof shared experiences.  The operators of these sites, and theirparticipants, could legitimately fear prosecution under the CDA.          With respect to vulgarity, the Government is in asimilarly weak position.  In Pacifica, the Supreme Court heldthat multiple repetition of expletives could be indecent. Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750.  Although the FCC did not follow thisrationale with respect to a broadcast of "a bona fide news story"on National Public Radio, Letter to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 FCC R.610 (1991), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Branton v. FCC, 993F.2d 906, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the ACLU, a plaintiff here, couldtake little comfort from that administrative decision.  It wouldneed to discern, for example, whether a chat room that itorganized to discuss the meaning of the word fuck was more likethe Carlin monologue or more like a National Public Radiobroadcast.[12]  Plaintiffs' expert would have found expletivesindecent in a community consisting only of himself,[13] and hisviews undoubtedly -- and reasonably -- reflect the view of manypeople.            In sum, I am less confident than the Government thatsocietal mores have changed so drastically since Pacifica that anonline equivalent of the Carlin monologue, or the Carlinmonologue itself online, would pass muster under the CDA.  Underexisting precedent, plaintiffs' fear of prosecution under the Actis legitimate, even though they are not the pornographersCongress had in mind when it passed the CDA.[14]   Cf. City ofHouston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987).  My discussion of theeffect and reach of the CDA, therefore, applies both toplaintiffs' hyperbolic concerns and to their very real ones.D.  A Medium-Specific Analysis          The Internet is a new medium of mass communication.[15] As such, the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudencecompels us to consider the special qualities of this new mediumin determining whether the CDA is a constitutional exercise ofgovernmental power.  Relying on these special qualities, which wehave described at length in our Findings of fact above, Iconclude that the CDA is unconstitutional and that the FirstAmendment denies Congress the power to regulate protected speechon the Internet.  This analysis and conclusions are consistentwith Congress's intent to avoid tortuous and piecemeal review ofthe CDA by authorizing expedited, direct review in the SupremeCourt "as a matter of right" of interlocutory, and not merelyfinal, orders upholding facial challenges to the Act.  See 561(b) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.[16]          1.  The Differential Treatment of Mass CommunicationMedia          Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Jackson recognized that"[t]he moving picture screen, the radio, the newspaper, thehandbill, the sound truck and the street corner orator havediffering natures, values, abuses and dangers.  Each . . . is alaw unto itself".  Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 97 (1949)(Jackson, J., concurring).  The Supreme Court has expressed thissentiment time and again since that date, and differentialtreatment of the mass media has become established FirstAmendment doctrine.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v.FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2456 (1994) ("It is true that our caseshave permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakersthan of speakers in other media."); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748("We have long recognized that each medium of expression presentsspecial First Amendment problems."); City of Los Angeles v.Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 496 (1974)("Different communications media are treated differently forFirst Amendment purposes.") (Blackmun, J., concurring);Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 500-01(1981) (plurality opinion) ("This Court has often faced theproblem of applying the broad principles of the First Amendmentto unique forums of expression.").  Thus, the Supreme Court hasestablished different rules for print, Miami Herald PublishingCo. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), broadcast radio andtelevision, see, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.367 (1969), cable television, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57, andeven billboards, Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 501, and drive-in movietheaters, Erzoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).          This medium-specific approach to mass communicationexamines the underlying technology of the communication to findthe proper fit between First Amendment values and competinginterests.  In print media, for example, the proper fit generallyforbids governmental regulation of content, however minimal. Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  In other media (billboards, forexample), the proper fit may allow for some regulation of bothcontent and of the underlying technology (such as it is) of thecommunication.  Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 502.           Radio and television broadcasting present the mostexpansive approach to medium-specific regulation of masscommunication.  As a result of the scarcity of band widths on theelectromagnetic spectrum, the Government holds broad authorityboth to parcel out the frequencies and to prohibit others fromspeaking on the same frequency:               As a general matter, there are more               would-be broadcasters than               frequencies available in the               electromagnetic spectrum.  And if               two broadcasters were to attempt to               transmit over the same frequency in               the same locale, they would               interfere with one another's               signals, so that neither could be               heard at all.  The scarcity of               broadcast frequencies thus required               the establishment of some               regulatory mechanism to divide the               electromagnetic spectrum and assign               specific frequencies to particular               broadcasters.  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citing FCC v. League of Women Voters,468 U.S. 364 (1984)).          This scarcity also allows the Government to regulatecontent even after it assigns a license:               In addition, the inherent physical               limitation on the number of               speakers who may use the broadcast               medium has been thought to require               some adjustment in traditional               First Amendment analysis to permit               the Government to place limited               content restraints, and impose               certain affirmative obligations, on               broadcast licensees.Id. at 2457 (citing Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390-95; NationalBroadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943)).            The broadcasting cases firmly establish that theGovernment may force a licensee to offer content to the publicthat the licensee would otherwise not offer, thereby assuringthat radio and television audiences have a diversity of content. In broadcasting, "[i]t is the right of the public to receivesuitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and otherideas and experiences which is crucial".  Red Lion, 395 U.S. at390; see also CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 U.S. 367, 395 (1981) ("Alicensed broadcaster is 'granted the free and exclusive use of alimited and valuable part of the public domain; when he acceptsthat franchise it is burdened by enforceable publicobligations.'") (citation omitted); Columbia Broadcasting Sys.,Inc. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 110-11 (1973). These content restrictions include punishing licensees whobroadcast inappropriate but protected speech at an impermissibletime.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750-51.          In this case, the Government relies on the Pacificadecision in arguing that the CDA is a constitutional exercise ofgovernmental power.  Since the CDA regulates indecent speech, andsince Pacifica authorizes governmental regulation of indecentspeech (so the Government's argument goes), it must follow thatthe CDA is a valid exercise of governmental power.  Thatargument, however, ignores Pacifica's roots as a decisionaddressing the proper fit between broadcasting and the FirstAmendment.  The argument also assumes that what is good forbroadcasting is good for the Internet.          2.  The Scope of the Pacifica Decision          In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), theSupreme Court first decided whether the Government had the powerto regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 729.  In Pacifica, a radiolistener complained about the broadcast of George Carlin's"Filthy Words" monologue at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon. Id. at 729-30.  The Carlin monologue was replete with "the wordsyou couldn't say on the public . . . airwaves . . . , ever", andthe listener had tuned in while driving with his young son in NewYork.  Id.  The FCC issued a declaratory order, holding that itcould have subjected the Pacifica Foundation (owner of the radiostation) to an administrative sanction.  Id. at 730.  In itsorder the FCC also described the standards that it would use inthe future to regulate indecency in the broadcast medium.  Id. at731.  The Supreme Court upheld the FCC's decision and confirmedthe power of that agency to regulate indecent speech.  Id. at750-51.          The rationale of Pacifica rested on three overlappingconsiderations.  First, using as its example the Carlin monologuebefore it, the Court weighed the value of indecent speech andconcluded that such speech "lie[s] at the periphery of FirstAmendment concerns."  Id. at 743.  Although the Court recognizedthat the FCC had threatened to punish Pacifica based on thecontent of the Carlin monologue, id. at 742, it found that thepunishment would have been permissible because four-letter words"offend for the same reasons that obscenity offends."  Id. at 746(footnote omitted).  The Court then described the place of four-letter words "in the hierarchy of first amendment values":               Such utterances are no essential               part of any exposition of ideas,               and are of such slight social value               as a step to truth that any benefit               that may be derived from them is               clearly outweighed by the social               interest in order and morality.Id. at 746 (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572(1942)).            Second, the Court recognized that "broadcasting . . .has received the most limited First Amendment protection."  Id.at 748.  The Government may regulate broadcast consistent withthe Constitution, even though the same regulation would run afoulof the First Amendment in the print medium.  Id. (comparing RedLion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969) with MiamiHerald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974)).  This isso because broadcasting has a "uniquely pervasive presence in thelives of all Americans" and "is uniquely accessible to children,even those too young to read."  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.          Third, the Court found the FCC's sanction -- anadministrative sanction -- to be an appropriate means ofregulating indecent speech.  At the outset of the opinion, theCourt disclaimed that its holding was a "consider[ation of] anyquestion relating to the possible application of  1464 as acriminal statute."  Id. at 739 n.13.  Later in the opinion, theCourt "emphasize[d] the narrowness of [its] holding", andexplicitly recognized that it had not held that the Carlinmonologue would justify a criminal prosecution.  Id. at 750. Instead, the Court allowed the FCC to regulate indecent speechwith administrative penalties under a "nuisance" rationale --"like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard."  Id. at 750(citation omitted).          Time has not been kind to the Pacifica decision.  Latercases have eroded its reach, and the Supreme Court has repeatedlyinstructed against overreading the rationale of its holding.          First, in Bolger v. Young Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S.60 (1983), the Supreme Court refused to extend Pacifica to a lawunrelated to broadcasting.  In that case, a federal lawprohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptiveadvertisements.  Id. at 61.  The Government defended the law byclaiming an interest in protecting children from theadvertisements.  The Court rejected this argument as overbroad:               In [Pacifica], this Court did               recognize that the Government's               interest in protecting the young               justified special treatment of an               afternoon broadcast heard by adults               as well as children.  At the same               time, the majority "emphasize[d]               the narrowness of our holding",               explaining that broadcasting is               "uniquely pervasive" and that it is               "uniquely accessible to children,               even those too young to read."  The               receipt of mail is far less               intrusive and uncontrollable.  Our               decisions have recognized that the               special interest of the Federal               Government in regulation of the               broadcast media does not readily               translate into a justification for               regulation of other means of               communication. Id. at 74 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis inoriginal) see also id. at 72 ("[T]he 'short, though regular,journey from mail box to trash can . . . is an acceptable burden,at least so far as the Constitution is concerned.'") (citationomitted) (alterations in original).          Second, in Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115(1989), the Supreme Court again limited Pacifica.  In that case,the Court considered the validity of a ban on indecent "dial-a-porn" communications.  Id. at 117-18.[17]  As in Bolger, theGovernment argued that Pacifica justified a complete ban of thatform of speech.  The Supreme Court disagreed, holding insteadthat Pacifica's "emphatically narrow" holding arose out of the"unique attributes of broadcasting".  Id. at 127.  The Court heldthat the ban was unconstitutional.  Id. at 131.          Sable narrowed Pacifica in two ways.  First, the Courtimplicitly rejected Pacifica's nuisance rationale for dial-a-porn, holding instead that the Government could only regulate themedium "by narrowly drawn regulations designed to serve thoseinterests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendmentfreedoms".  Id. at 126 (citation omitted).  Under this strictscrutiny, "[i]t is not enough to show that the Government's endsare compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achievethose ends."  Id.; see also Fabulous Assoc. v. Pennsylvania Pub.Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780, 784-85 (3d Cir. 1990).           Second, the Court concluded that the law, like a law ithad struck down in 1957, "denied adults their free speech rightsby allowing them to read only what was acceptable for children". Sable, 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380(1957)).  Thus, any regulation of dial-a-porn would have to giveadults the opportunity to partake of that medium.  Id.  Thisconclusion echoes Bolger.  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74 ("The levelof discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to thatwhich would be suitable for a sandbox.").[18]          Finally, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994), the Supreme Court implicitly limitedPacifica once again when it declined to adopt the broadcastrationale for the medium of cable television.  The Courtconcluded that the rules for broadcast were "inapt" for cablebecause of the "fundamental technological differences betweenbroadcast and cable transmission".  Id. at 2457.          The legal significance to this case of Turner's refusalto apply the broadcast rules to cable television cannot beoverstated.  Turner's holding confirms beyond doubt that theholding in Pacifica arose out of the scarcity rationale unique tothe underlying technology of broadcasting, and not out of the endproduct that the viewer watches.  That is, cable television hasno less of a "uniquely pervasive presence" than broadcasttelevision, nor is cable television more "uniquely accessible tochildren" than broadcast.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49. From the viewer's perspective, cable and broadcast television areidentical:  moving pictures with sound from a box in the home. Whether one receives a signal through an antenna or through adedicated wire, the end result is just television in either case. In declining to extend broadcast's scarcity rationale for cable,the Supreme Court also implicitly limited Pacifica, the holdingof which flows directly from that rationale.[19]          Turner thus confirms that the analysis of a particularmedium of mass communication must focus on the underlyingtechnology that brings the information to the user.  Inbroadcast, courts focus on the limited number of band widths andthe risk of interference with those frequencies.  See, e.g.,Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57.  In cable, courts focus on thenumber of channels, the different kinds of cable operators, andthe cost to the consumer.  Id. at 2452.           I draw two conclusions from the foregoing analysis. First, from the Supreme Court's many decisions regulatingdifferent media differently, I conclude that we cannot simplyassume that the Government has the power to regulate protectedspeech over the Internet, devoting our attention solely to theissue of whether the CDA is a constitutional exercise of thatpower.  Rather, we must also decide the validity of theunderlying assumption as well, to wit, whether the Government hasthe power to regulate protected speech at all.  That decisionmust take into account the underlying technology, and the actualand potential reach, of that medium.  Second, I conclude thatPacifica's holding is not persuasive authority here, sinceplaintiffs and the Government agree that Internet communicationis an abundant and growing resource.  Nor is Sable persuasiveauthority, since the Supreme Court's holding in that caseaddressed only one particular type of communication (dial-a-porn), and reached no conclusions about the proper fit betweenthe First Amendment and telephone communications generally. Again, plaintiffs and the Government here agree that the Internetprovides content as broad as the imagination.          3.  The Effect of the CDA and the Novel Characteristicsof Internet Communication          Over the course of five days of hearings and manyhundreds of pages of declarations, deposition transcripts, andexhibits, we have learned about the special attributes ofInternet communication.  Our Findings of fact -- many of themundisputed -- express our understanding of the Internet.  TheseFindings lead to the conclusion that Congress may not regulateindecency on the Internet at all.            Four related characteristics of Internet communicationhave a transcendent importance to our shared holding that the CDAis unconstitutional on its face.  We explain thesecharacteristics in our Findings of fact above, and I onlyrehearse them briefly here.  First, the Internet presents verylow barriers to entry.  Second, these barriers to entry areidentical for both speakers and listeners.  Third, as a result ofthese low barriers, astoundingly diverse content is available onthe Internet.  Fourth, the Internet provides significant accessto all who wish to speak in the medium, and even creates arelative parity among speakers.          To understand how disruptive the CDA is to Internetcommunication, it must be remembered that the Internet evolvedfree of content-based considerations.  Before the CDA, it onlymattered how, and how quickly, a particular packet of datatravelled from one point on the Internet to another.  In itsearliest incarnation as the ARPANET, the Internet was for manyyears a private means of access among the military, defensecontractors, and defense-related researchers.  The developers of the technology focused on creating a medium designed for therapid transmittal of the information through overlapping andredundant connections, and without direct human involvement.  Outof these considerations evolved the common transfer protocols,packet switching, and the other technology in which today'sInternet users flourish.  The content of the data was, before theCDA, an irrelevant consideration.          It is fair, then, to conclude that the benefits of theInternet to private speakers arose out of the serendipitousdevelopment of its underlying technology.  As more networksjoined the "network of networks" that is the Internet, privatespeakers have begun to take advantage of the medium.  This shouldnot be surprising, since participation in the medium requiresonly that networks (and the individual users associated withthem) agree to use the common data transfer protocols and othermedium-specific technology.  Participation does not require, andhas never required, approval of a user's or network's content.          After the CDA, however, the content of a user's speechwill determine the extent of participation in the new medium.  Ifa speaker's content is even arguably indecent in somecommunities, he must assess, inter alia, the risk of prosecutionand the cost of compliance with the CDA.  Because the creationand posting of a Web site allows users anywhere in the country tosee that site, many speakers will no doubt censor their speech sothat it is palatable in every community.  Other speakers willdecline to enter the medium at all.  Unlike other media, there isno technologically feasible way for an Internet speaker to limitthe geographical scope of his speech (even if he wanted to), orto "implement[] a system for screening the locale of incoming"requests.  Sable 492 U.S. at 125.          The CDA will, without doubt, undermine the substantive,speech-enhancing benefits that have flowed from the Internet.Barriers to entry to those speakers affected by the Act wouldskyrocket, especially for non-commercial and not-for-profitinformation providers.  Such costs include those attributable toage or credit card verification (if possible), tagging (iftagging is even a defense under the Act[20]), and monitoring orreview of one's content.           The diversity of the content will necessarily diminishas a result.  The economic costs associated with compliance withthe Act will drive from the Internet speakers whose content fallswithin the zone of possible prosecution.  Many Web sites,newsgroups, and chat rooms will shut down, since users cannotdiscern the age of other participants.  In this respect, theInternet would ultimately come to mirror broadcasting and print,with messages tailored to a mainstream society from speakers whocould be sure that their message was likely decent in everycommunity in the country.          The CDA will also skew the relative parity amongspeakers that currently exists on the Internet.  Commercialentities who can afford the costs of verification, or who wouldcharge a user to enter their sites, or whose content has massappeal, will remain unaffected by the Act.  Other users, such asCritical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape, or even the ACLU, whose Websites before the CDA were as equally accessible as the mostpopular Web sites, will be profoundly affected by the Act.  Thischange would result in an Internet that mirrors broadcasting andprint, where economic power has become relatively coterminouswith influence.          Perversely, commercial pornographers would remainrelatively unaffected by the Act, since we learned that most ofthem already use credit card or adult verification anyway. Commercial pornographers normally provide a few free pictures toentice a user into proceeding further into the Web site.  Toproceed beyond these teasers, users must provide a credit cardnumber or adult verification number.  The CDA will force thesebusinesses to remove the teasers (or cover the most salaciouscontent with cgi scripts), but the core, commercial product ofthese businesses will remain in place.           The CDA's wholesale disruption on the Internet willnecessarily affect adult participation in the medium.  As somespeakers leave or refuse to enter the medium, and othersbowdlerize their speech or erect the barriers that the Actenvisions, and still others remove bulletin boards, Web sites,and newsgroups, adults will face a shrinking ability toparticipate in the medium.  Since much of the communication onthe Internet is participatory, i.e., is a form of dialogue, adecrease in the number of speakers, speech fora, and permissibletopics will diminish the worldwide dialogue that is the strengthand signal achievement of the medium.          It is no answer to say that the defenses and exclusionsof  223(e) mitigate the disruptive forces of the Act.  We havealready found as facts that the defenses either are not availableto plaintiffs here or would impose excessive costs on them. These defenses are also unavailable to participants in specificforms of Internet communication.          I am equally dubious that the exclusions of  223(e)would provide significant relief from the Act.  The "commoncarrier" exclusion of  223(e)(1), for example, would notinsulate America Online from liability for the content itprovides to its subscribers.  It is also a tricky questionwhether an America Online chat room devoted to, say, women'sreproductive health, is or is not speech of the service itself,since America Online, at least to some extent, "creat[es] thecontent of the communication" simply by making the room availableand assigning it a topic.  Even if America Online has noliability under this example, the service might legitimatelychoose not to provide fora that led to the prosecution of itssubscribers.  Similarly, it is unclear whether many cachingservers are devoted "solely" to the task of "intermediatestorage".  The "vicarious liability" exclusion of  223(e)(4)would not, for example, insulate either a college professor orher employer from liability for posting an indecent onlinereading assignment for her freshman sociology class.          We must of course give appropriate deference to thelegislative judgments of Congress.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129;Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472-73 (Blackmun, J., concurring).  Afterhearing the parties' testimony and reviewing the exhibits,declarations, and transcripts, we simply cannot in my view deferto Congress's judgment that the CDA will have only a minimalimpact on the technology of the Internet, or on adultparticipation in the medium.  As in Sable, "[d]eference to alegislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when FirstAmendment rights are at stake."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 129 (citationomitted).  Indeed, the Government has not revealed Congress's"extensive record" in addressing this issue, Turner, 114 S. Ct.at 2472 (Blackmun, J., concurring), or otherwise convinced methat the record here is somehow factually deficient to the recordbefore Congress when it passed the Act.            4.  Diversity and Access on the Internet          Nearly eighty years ago, Justice Holmes, in dissent,wrote of the ultimate constitutional importance of the "freetrade in ideas":               [W]hen men have realized that time               has upset many fighting faiths,               they may come to believe even more               than they believe the very               foundations of their own conduct               that the ultimate good desired is               better reached by free trade in               ideas -- that the best test of               truth is the power of the thought               to get itself accepted in the               competition of the market . . . .Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J.,dissenting).            For nearly as long, critics have attacked this much-maligned "marketplace" theory of First Amendment jurisprudence asinconsistent with economic and practical reality.  Mostmarketplaces of mass speech, they charge, are dominated by a fewwealthy voices.  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418U.S. 241, 248-50 (1974).  These voices dominate -- and to anextent, create -- the national debate.  Id.  Individual citizens'participation is, for the most part, passive.  Id. at 251. Because most people lack the money and time to buy a broadcaststation or create a newspaper, they are limited to the role oflisteners, i.e., as watchers of television or subscribers tonewspapers.  Id.          Economic realities limit the number of speakers evenfurther.  Newspapers competing with each other and with (free)broadcast tend toward extinction, as fixed costs drivecompetitors either to consolidate or leave the marketplace.  Id.at 249-50.  As a result, people receive information fromrelatively few sources:               The elimination of competing               newspapers in most of our large               cities, and the concentration of               control of media that results from               the only newspaper's being owned by               the same interests which own a               television station and a radio               station, are important components               of this trend toward concentration               of control of outlets to inform the               public.                    The result of these vast               changes has been to place in a few               hands the power to inform the               American people and shape public               opinion.Id. at 249.          The Supreme Court has also recognized that the adventof cable television has not offered significant relief from thisproblem.  Although the number of cable channels is exponentiallygreater than broadcast, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2452, cable imposesrelatively high entry costs, id. at 2451-52 (noting that thecreation of a cable system requires "[t]he construction of [a]physical infrastructure").          Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has resistedgovernmental efforts to alleviate these market dysfunctions.  InTornillo, the Supreme Court held that market failure simply couldnot justify the regulation of print, 418 U.S. at 258, regardlessof the validity of the criticisms of that medium, id. at 251. Tornillo invalidated a state "right-of-reply" statute, whichrequired a newspaper critical of a political candidate to givethat candidate equal time to reply to the charges.  Id. at 244. The Court held that the statute would be invalid even if itimposed no cost on a newspaper, because of the statute'sintrusion into editorial discretion:               A newspaper is more than a passive               receptacle or conduit for news,               comment, and advertising.  The               choice of material to go into a               newspaper, and the decisions made               as to limitations on the size and               content of the paper, and treatment               of public issues and public               officials -- whether fair or unfair               -- constitute the exercise of               editorial control and judgment.Id. at 258.          Similarly, in Turner, the Supreme Court rejected theGovernment's argument that market dysfunction justifieddeferential review of speech regulations for cable television. Even recognizing that the cable market "suffers certainstructural impediments", Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, the Courtcould not accept the Government's conclusion that thisdysfunction justified broadcast-type standards of review, since"the mere assertion of dysfunction or failure in a speech market,without more, is not sufficient to shield a speech regulationfrom the First Amendment standards applicable to nonbroadcastmedia."  Id. at 2458.  "[L]aws that single out the press, orcertain elements thereof, for special treatment 'pose aparticular danger of abuse by the State,' and so are alwayssubject to at least some degree of heightened First Amendmentscrutiny."  Id. (citation omitted).[21]  The Court then eloquentlyreiterated that government-imposed, content-based speechregulations are generally inconsistent with "[o]ur politicalsystem and cultural life":               At the heart of the First Amendment               lies the principle that each person               should decide for him or herself               the ideas and beliefs deserving of               expression, consideration, and               adherence.  Our political system               and cultural life rest upon this               ideal.  Government action that               stifles speech on account of its               message, or that requires the               utterance of a particular message               favored by the Government,               contravenes this essential right.                Laws of this sort pose the inherent               risk that the Government seeks not               to advance a legitimate regulatory               goal, but to suppress unpopular               ideas or information or manipulate               the public debate through coercion               rather than persuasion.  These               restrictions "rais[e] the specter               that the Government may effectively               drive certain ideas or viewpoints               from the marketplace."Id. (citation omitted).          Both Tornillo and Turner recognize, in essence, thatthe cure for market dysfunction (government-imposed, content-based speech restrictions) will almost always be worse than thedisease.  Here, however, I am hard-pressed even to identify thedisease.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet hasachieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatorymarketplace of mass speech that this country -- and indeed theworld -- has yet seen.  The plaintiffs in these actions correctlydescribe the "democratizing" effects of Internet communication: individual citizens of limited means can speak to a worldwideaudience on issues of concern to them.  Federalists and Anti-Federalists may debate the structure of their government nightly,but these debates occur in newsgroups or chat rooms rather thanin pamphlets.  Modern-day Luthers still post their theses, but toelectronic bulletin boards rather than the door of the WittenbergSchlosskirche.  More mundane (but from a constitutionalperspective, equally important) dialogue occurs between aspiringartists, or French cooks, or dog lovers, or fly fishermen.          Indeed, the Government's asserted "failure" of theInternet rests on the implicit premise that too much speechoccurs in that medium, and that speech there is too available tothe participants.  This is exactly the benefit of Internetcommunication, however.  The Government, therefore, implicitlyasks this court to limit both the amount of speech on theInternet and the availability of that speech.  This argument isprofoundly repugnant to First Amendment principles.          My examination of the special characteristics ofInternet communication, and review of the Supreme Court's medium-specific First Amendment jurisprudence, lead me to conclude thatthe Internet deserves the broadest possible protection fromgovernment-imposed, content-based regulation.  If "the FirstAmendment erects a virtually insurmountable barrier betweengovernment and the print media", Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 259(White, J., concurring), even though the print medium fails toachieve the hoped-for diversity in the marketplace of ideas, thenthat "insurmountable barrier" must also exist for a medium thatsucceeds in achieving that diversity.  If our Constitution"prefer[s] 'the power of reason as applied through publicdiscussion'", id. (citation omitted), "[r]egardless of howbeneficent-sounding the purposes of controlling the press mightbe", id., even though "occasionally debate on vital matters willnot be comprehensive and . . . all viewpoints may not beexpressed", id. at 260, a medium that does capture comprehensivedebate and does allow for the expression of all viewpoints shouldreceive at least the same protection from intrusion.            Finally, if the goal of our First Amendmentjurisprudence is the "individual dignity and choice" that arisesfrom "putting the decision as to what views shall be voicedlargely into the hands of each of us", Leathers v. Medlock, 499U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991) (citing Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15,24 (1971)), then we should be especially vigilant in preventingcontent-based regulation of a medium that every minute allowsindividual citizens actually to make those decisions.  Anycontent-based regulation of the Internet, no matter how benignthe purpose, could burn the global village to roast the pig.  Cf.Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.          5.  Protection of Children from Pornography          I accept without reservation that the Government has acompelling interest in protecting children from pornography.  Theproposition finds one of its clearest expressions in Mill, whorecognized that his exposition regarding liberty itself "is meantto apply only to human beings in the maturity of theirfaculties":               We are not speaking of children or               of young persons below the age               which the law may fix as that of               manhood or womanhood.  Those who               are still in a state to require               being taken care of by others must               be protected against their own               actions as well as against external               injury.John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 69 (Gertrude Himmelfarb ed., PenguinBooks 1982) (1859), cited in Harry Kalven Jr., A Worthy Tradition54 (Jamie Kalven ed. 1988).          This rationale, however, is as dangerous as it iscompelling.  Laws regulating speech for the protection ofchildren have no limiting principle, and a well-intentioned lawrestricting protected speech on the basis of its content is,nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.  Regulations that"drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace" forchildren's benefit, Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 116, riskdestroying the very "political system and cultural life", Turner,114 S. Ct. at 2458, that they will inherit when they come of age.          I therefore have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act,passed because Congress discovered that young girls had read afront page article in the New York Times on female genitalmutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional.  Tornillo, 418U.S. at 258.  Nor would a Novel Decency Act, adopted afterlegislators had seen too many pot-boilers in convenience storebook racks, pass constitutional muster.  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383. There is no question that a Village Green Decency Act, the fruitof a Senator's overhearing of a ribald conversation between twoadolescent boys on a park bench, would be unconstitutional. Perry Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S.37, 45 (1983).  A Postal Decency Act, passed because ofconstituent complaints about unsolicited lingerie catalogues,would also be unconstitutional.  Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  Inthese forms of communication, regulations on the basis of decencysimply would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.            The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium thanprint, the village green, or the mails.  Because it wouldnecessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarilyreduce the speech available for adults on the medium.  This is aconstitutionally intolerable result.          Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests thelimits of conventional discourse.  Speech on the Internet can beunfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionallycharged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a word, "indecent"in many communities.  But we should expect such speech to occurin a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have avoice.  We should also protect the autonomy that such a mediumconfers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.          Moreover, the CDA will almost certainly fail toaccomplish the Government's interest in shielding children frompornography on the Internet.  Nearly half of Internetcommunications originate outside the United States, and somepercentage of that figure represents pornography.  Pornographyfrom, say, Amsterdam will be no less appealing to a child on theInternet than pornography from New York City, and residents ofAmsterdam have little incentive to comply with the CDA.[22]          My analysis does not deprive the Government of allmeans of protecting children from the dangers of Internetcommunication.  The Government can continue to protect childrenfrom pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement ofexisting laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography.  SeeUnited States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995).  Aswe learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need forpublic education about the benefits and dangers of this newmedium, and the Government can fill that role as well.  In myview, our action today should only mean that the Government'spermissible supervision of Internet content stops at thetraditional line of unprotected speech.          Parents, too, have options available to them.  As welearned at the hearing, parents can install blocking software ontheir home computers, or they can subscribe to commercial onlineservices that provide parental controls.  It is quite clear thatpowerful market forces are at work to expand parental options todeal with these legitimate concerns.  More fundamentally, parentscan supervise their children's use of the Internet or deny theirchildren the opportunity to participate in the medium until theyreach an appropriate age.  See Fabulous, 896 F.2d at 788-89(noting that "our society has traditionally placed" thesedecisions "on the shoulders of the parent").E.  Conclusion          Cutting through the acronyms and argot that litteredthe hearing testimony, the Internet may fairly be regarded as anever-ending worldwide conversation.  The Government may not,through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the mostparticipatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internetdeserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion.          True it is that many find some of the speech on theInternet to be offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace manyhear discordant voices that they regard as indecent.  The absenceof governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionablyproduced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts putit with such resonance at the hearing:               What achieved success was the very               chaos that the Internet is.  The               strength of the Internet is that               chaos.[23]  Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength ofour liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of theunfettered speech the First Amendment protects.           For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that theCDA is unconstitutional on its face.

ByOrder dated February 27, 1996, we asked the parties to addresswhether a modem is a "telecommunications device".  Plaintiffs andthe Government answered in the affirmative, and we agree that theplain meaning of the phrase and the legislative history of theAct strongly support their conclusion.  "Telecommunications"under 47 U.S.C.  153(48) means "the transmission, between oramong points specified by the user, of information of the user'schoosing, without change in the form of content of theinformation as sent and received."  The plain meaning of "device"is "something that is formed or formulated by design andusu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives,experiment, and testing."  Webster's Third New InternationalDictionary, 618 (1986).  Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thoughtit would reach individual Internet users, many of whom stillconnect through modems.  See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S8329-46(daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen.Coats).     The resolution of the tension between the scope of"telecommunications device" and the scope of "interactivecomputer service" as defined in 47 U.S.C.  230(a)(2), see infranote 6, must await another day.  It is sufficient for us toconclude that the exclusion of  223(h)(1)(B) is probably anarrow one (as the Government has argued), insulating aninteractive computer service from criminal liability under theCDA but not insulating users who traffic in indecent and patentlyoffensive materials on the Internet through those services.6. The statute at  509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add  230(e)(2),which defines such a service as "any information service, system,or access software provider that provides or enables computeraccess by multiple users to a computer server, includingspecifically a service or system that provides access to theInternet and such systems operated or services offered bylibraries or educational institutions."7. In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for atemporary restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes "theDepartment has a longstanding policy that previous suchprovisions are unconstitutional and will not be enforced", andthat both President Clinton and General Reno "have made th[e]point clear" that no one will be prosecuted under "the abortion-related provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C.  1462(c)." Opposition at 19, n.11 (February 14, 1996).  In view of this"longstanding policy", the Government contends there is norealistic fear of prosecution and, so the argument goes, no needfor equitable relief.  Id.  In their post-hearing brief, the ACLUplaintiffs inform us that in view of the Government's statement,"they do not seek a preliminary injunction against theenforcement of  1462(c)."  Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffsat 2 n.2.8. The court again expresses its appreciation to the parties fortheir cooperative attitude in evolving the stipulation.9. The Government has not by motion challenged the standing ofany plaintiff in either case, and we harbor no doubts of our ownon that point, notwithstanding the Government's suggestion in afootnote of its post-hearing brief.  See Defendants' Post-HearingMemorandum at 37 n.46 ("Plaintiffs' assertions as to the speechat issue are so off-point as to raise standing concerns."). Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature andcontent of the speech they contend is or may be affected by theCDA, are set forth in paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30through 103 of the parties' stipulation filed in these actions. These paragraphs will not be reproduced here, but will be deemedadopted as Findings of the court.10. It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroupsare the exception and unmoderated newsgroups are the rule.11. The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to thisparagraph of the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.12. Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forcesexist to limit the availability of material on-line that parentsconsider inappropriate for their children.  Although the partiessharply dispute the efficacy of so-called "parental empowerment"software, there is a sufficiently wide zone of agreement on whatis available to restrict access to unwanted sites that theparties were able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs ofstipulated facts on the subject, which form the basis ofparagraphs 49 through 69 of our Findings of fact.  Because of therapidity of developments in this field, some of the technologicalfacts we have found may become partially obsolete by the time ofpublication of these Findings.13. This membership is constantly growing, according to thetestimony of Albert Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide WebConsortium.  See also Defendants' Ex. D-167.14. See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr.Vezza.15. From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longerbased upon the parties' stipulation, but upon the record adducedat the hearings.  16. Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet Engineering TaskForce, the group primarily responsible for Internet technicalstandards, as well as other Internet-related associationsresponsible for, among other things, the prevailing InternetProtocols.  He is also associated with Harvard University.17. Dr. Olsen chairs the Computer Science Department at BrighamYoung University in Provo, Utah, and is the recently-appointedDirector of the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.18. The term "information content provider" is defined in  509of the CDA, at the new 47 U.S.C.  230(e)(3), as "any person orentity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creationor development of information provided through the Internet orany other interactive computer service."19. By "verification", we mean the method by which a user typesin his or her credit card number, and the Web site ensures thatthe credit card is valid before it allows the user to enter thesite.20. InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator ofcontent.  InterNIC and two other European organizations maintaina master list of domain names to ensure that no duplicationoccurs.  Creators of Web sites must register their domain namewith InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to chooseanother name if the new Web site has the name of an already-existing site.  InterNIC has no control over content on a siteafter registration.21. This paragraph and the preceding paragraph also illustratethat a content provider might store its own material or someoneelse's on a caching server.  The goal -- saving money and time --is the same in both cases.1. It also probably covers speech protected by the FirstAmendment for some minors a well, because it fails to limit itsreach to that which is harmful for minors, an issue which it isnot necessary to decide in light of the other conclusionsreached.2. See 141 Cong. Rec. S8342 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (letterfrom Kent Markus, Acting Assistant Attorney General, U.S.Department of Justice, to Senator Leahy).1. If by virtue of the statute's authorization of expeditedreview of its constitutionality, "on its face," 47 U.S.C.561(a), we were strictly limited to looking at the words of thestatute, I would stand by my T.R.O. opinion.  However, in lightof the procedures which are required by 47 U.S.C.  561(a) and 28U.S.C.  2284, and were followed by this court in establishing anextensive record in this case, to ignore the evidence presentedwould be to ignore what an action for injunctive relief is allabout.  Section 561 reads as follows:           561.  EXPEDITED REVIEW.     (a) THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT HEARING --Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civilaction challenging the constitutionality, on its face,of this title or any amendment made by this title, orany provision thereof, shall be heard by a districtcourt of 3 judges convened pursuant to the provisionsof section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.  Section 2284 states, in relevant part:      2284.  Three-judge court; when required;composition; procedure                  (b) In any action required to be heard anddetermined by a district court of three judges undersubsection (a) of this section, the composition andprocedure of the court shall be as follows:  . . .   (3) A single judge may conduct allproceedings except the trial . . . . He maygrant a temporary restraining order on aspecific finding, based on evidencesubmitted, that specified irreparable damageswill result if the order is not granted,which order, unless previously revoked by thedistrict judge, shall remain in force onlyuntil the hearing and determination by thedistrict court of three judges of anapplication for a preliminary injunction. . .. 2. Justice Kennedy argues in his opinion in Simon & Schuster v.New York Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120 (1991), that "[t]heregulated content has the full protection of the First Amendmentand this, I submit, is itself a full and sufficient reason forholding the statute unconstitutional.  In my view it is bothunnecessary and incorrect to ask whether the state can show thatthe statute 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interestand is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.'"  In the presentcase, there is no disagreement that indecent and patentlyoffensive speech have the full protection of the First Amendment.3. Not only has speech been divided up and given values -- withsome types of speech given little or no protection (obscenity,fighting words, possibly commercial speech) -- but also, by courtdecisions over the years, it has been decided that the content ofspeech can indeed be regulated provided that the regulation willdirectly and materially advance a compelling government interest,and that it is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest inthe least restrictive manner.  However, any content-basedrestriction must survive this most exacting scrutiny.  Sable, 492U.S. 115; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989).4. The plaintiffs have made facial challenges to the disputedprovisions of the CDA on grounds of both vagueness andoverbreadth.  The approach taken and language used in evaluatinga statute under each of these doctrines commingles, andfrequently is treated as a single approach.  "We havetraditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logicallyrelated and similar doctrines."  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.352, 358 n.8 (1983) (citing Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385U.S. 589, 609, (1967); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433(1963)).  Even in cases where the court attempts to distinguishthese two doctrines, it acknowledges some interplay between them. See e.g. Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, and n. 6 (1982).          In addition, when discussing overbreadth, one cannotavoid reference to the same language used to describe and applythe strict scrutiny standard to constitutionally protectedactivities.  See e.g. Sable, 492 U.S. at 131; Roberts v. Jaycees,468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).  While there are occasional attempts toargue for clear distinctions among these doctrines, see e.g.Kolender, 461 U.S. at 369 (White, J., Rehnquist, J. dissenting),such bright lines simply have not been, and most likely cannotbe, drawn in this area.5. Comparing a different portion of each of these two provisionssuggests that different terms are not to be read to mean the samething.  As written, section (a) pertains to telecommunicationsdevices, and section (d) to interactive computer services.  Whilewe have not entirely resolved the tension between thesedefinitions at this stage, it has been established that theseterms are not synonymous, but are in fact intended to denotedifferent technologies.  This, together with the rule ofstatutory construction set forth in Chief Judge Sloviter'sopinion, seems to suggest on the face of the statute thatindecent and patently offensive also are not to be read assynonymous.6. 18 U.S.C. 1461 states, "The term `indecent' as used in thissection includes matter of a character tending to incite arson,murder or assassination."7. Although the Supreme Court may rule on the vagueness questionin the context of cable television regulation in Alliance forCommunity Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), currentlypending on certiorari before the Court, we will not deferadjudication of this issue as the constitutionality of the termin the cable context may not be determinative of its use incyberspace.8. Each intentional act of posting indecent content for displayshall be considered a separate violation of this subsection andcarries with it a fine, a prison term of up to two years, orboth.  47 U.S.C.  223(a),(d) and Conf. Rep. at 189.9. As I have noted, the unique nature of the medium cannot beoveremphasized in discussing and determining the vagueness issue. This is not to suggest that new technology should driveconstitutional law.  To the contrary, I remain of the belief thatour fundamental constitutional principles can accommodate anytechnological achievements, even those which, presently seem tomany to be in the nature of a miracle such as the Internet.1. By Order dated March 13, 1996, we asked the parties to submittheir views on questions regarding allocation of the burdens ofproof in these cases.  Since I believe that the outcome of thesecases is clear regardless of the allocation of proof between theparties, none of my conclusions in this opinion requires me tochoose between the arguments that the parties have presented tous.2. Although I do not believe the statue is unconstitutionallyvague, I agree with Judge Buckwalter that the Government'spromise not to enforce the plain reach of the law cannot salvageits overbreadth.  Even accepting the Government's argument thatprosecution of non-obscene pornography would be a "legitimateapplication" of the CDA, City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451,459 (1987), it is clear that the Act would "make unlawful asubstantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct", id. As in Hill, the Government's circular reasoning -- that the lawis constitutional because prosecutors would only apply it tothose against whom it could constitutionally be applied -- mustfail.  See id. at 464-67.3. Plaintiffs have argued that we may consider their challengeunder the standards governing both "facial" and "as-applied"challenges.  That is, they suggest that we may pass judgment onthe decency of the plaintiffs' speech, even if we are unable toconclude that the act is facially unconstitutional.  Surely thisprocedural confusion arises out of the three opinions of the D.C.Circuit in National Treasury Employees Union v. United States,990 F.3d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003.          I doubt that we could undertake an as-applied inquiry,since we do not know the exact content of plaintiffs' speech. Indeed, it is impossible to know the exact content of someplaintiffs' speech, since plaintiffs themselves cannot know thatcontent.  America Online, for example, cannot know what itssubscribers will spontaneously say in chat rooms or post tobulletin boards.  In any event, I need not address this issue, inthe light of our disposition today.4."Dial-a-porn" is a shorthand description of "sexuallyoriented prerecorded telephone messages".  Sable, 492 U.S. at117-18.5. In turn, Pacifica's definition of indecency has its roots inthe Supreme Court's obscenity jurisprudence.  Indecency includessome but not all of the elements of obscenity.  See, e.g.,Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 113-14 n.4.6. The reach of the two provisions is not coterminous, however. As we explain in the introduction to this Adjudication,  223(a)reaches the making, creation, transmission, and initiation ofindecent speech.  Section 223(d) arguably reaches more broadly tothe "display" of indecent speech.  I conclude here only that bothsections refer to the identical type of proscribed speech.7. At oral argument, counsel for the Government candidlyrecognized that "there's nothing quite like this statute before",and that the CDA's novelty raised some "legislative craftsmanshipproblem[s]".  Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 81-82.  I believethat my analysis here makes sense in the light of the legislativehistory and the jurisprudence on which Congress relied inenacting the CDA.  See Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.8. The counterargument is that  223(e)(5)(A), when readtogether with  223(e)(6), merely confers jurisdiction on the FCCto prescribe the "reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions"that count as defenses.  Congress employed a similar scheme fordial-a-porn.  See Dial Information Servs., 938 F.2d at 1539(citing 47 U.S.C.  223(b)(3)); Information Providers' Coalition,928 F.2d at 871.9. The play was "critically acclaimed and long-running in LosAngeles area theaters".  Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC R. at 932.10. Analytically, it makes sense that indecent speech has publicvalue.  After all, indecent speech is nevertheless protectedspeech, see, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 126, and it must thereforehave some public value that underlies the need for protection. Obscenity, by contrast, has no public value, id. at 124, and thushas no protection from proscription.11. Internet technology undercuts the Government's argument thatthe "in context" element of  223(a) and 223(d) would insulateplaintiffs such as Critical Path from liability.  See, e.g.,Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 89-91.  A user who clicks on alink in the Critical Path database (see Findings 33, 77-78) mighttravel to a highly graphic page in a larger HTML document.  Thesocial value of that page, in context, might be debatable, butthe use of links effectively excerpts that document byeliminating content unrelated to the link.12. Moreover, because of the technology of Internet relay chat,it would need to make this determination before it organized thechat room, since it could not pre-screen the discussion among theparticipants.  Thus, it would need to predict, in advance, whatthe participants were likely to say.  The participants would needto make a similar determination, unaided (I expect) by FirstAmendment lawyers.13. Testimony of April 12, 1996, at 235-36.14. In this section I do not imply that the FCC has jurisdictionto process Internet complaints in the same manner as it does forbroadcast.  The extent of the FCC's jurisdiction under the CDA isa sticky question not relevant here.  See Senate Report at 190-91, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 204.  Because theadministrative decisions cited above arose out of citizens'complaints to the FCC, however, they provide a kind of surrogateinsight into the kinds of speech that citizens have charged asindecent in the past.15. See Finding of fact 81.  See also Symposium, Emerging Media: Technology and the First Amendment, 104 Yale L.J. 1613 (1995).16. A narrow holding for this new medium also will not eliminatethe chill to plaintiffs, who could well stifle the extent oftheir participation in this new medium while awaiting a futureiteration of the CDA.  Such a holding would also lead Congress tobelieve that a rewritten CDA (using, for example, a "harmful tominors" standard, see Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996U.S.C.C.A.N. at 202) would pass constitutional muster.  In myview, a holding consistent with the novel qualities of thismedium provides Congress with prompt and clear answers to thequestions that the CDA asks.17. The history of dial-a-porn regulation both before and afterSable is tortuous, and involves the intervention of all threebranches of government.  I will not rehearse that history here,deferring instead to the other courts that have recounted it.See, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 118-23; Dial Information Serv., 938F.2d at 1537-40; Information Providers Coalition, 928 F.2d at870-73.18. Sable is arguably not a decision about mass communication. Unlike Red Lion, Tornillo, or Turner, the Court in Sable reachedno conclusions about the proper fit between the First Amendmentand governmental regulation of the telephone.  The case alsoincludes no discussion of the technology of the telephonegenerally.  The plaintiff in that case, a purveyor of dial-a-porn, challenged the statute only with respect to that type ofcontent.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 117-18.  Thus, the Court's opiniondiscussed only the "dial-in services".  Id. at 128.  Since everytelephone call at issue was, by definition, dial-a-porn, everytelephone call was, by definition, either obscene or indecent. Id. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).          Here, however, plaintiffs represent forty-sevendifferent speakers (including educational associations andconsortia) who provide content to the Internet on a broad rangeof topics.  The limited reach of the Sable holding renders itinapt to the Internet communications of the plaintiffs in theseactions.19. I note here, too, that we have found as a fact thatoperation of a computer is not as simple as turning on atelevision, and that the assaultive nature of television, seePacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49, is quite absent in Internet use. See Findings 87-89.  The use of warnings and headings, forexample, will normally shield users from immediate entry into asexually explicit Web site or newsgroup message.  See Finding 88. The Government may well be right that sexually explicit contentis just a few clicks of a mouse away from the user, but there isan immense legal significance to those few clicks.20. In a May 3, 1996 letter to a three-judge court in theSouthern District of New York, John C. Keeney, Acting AssistantAttorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department ofJustice, has advised that tagging would be "substantial evidence"in support of a  223(e)(5)(A) defense:          Under present technology, non-commercial          content providers can take steps to list          their site[s] in URL registries of covered          sites, register their site[s] with the          marketplace of browsers and blocking software          (including listing an IP address), place          their material in a directory blocked by          screening software, or take other similarly          effective affirmative steps to make their          site[s] known to the world to allow the          site[s] to be blocked.  Under present          technology, it is the position of the          Department of Justice that, absent          extraordinary circumstances, such efforts          would constitute substantial evidence that a          content provider had taken good faith,          reasonable, effective, and appropriate          actions under the circumstances to restrict          or prevent access by minors to the covered          material.  The same would be true for tagging          by content providers coupled with evidence          that the tag would be screened by the          marketplace of browsers and blocking          software.Letter of May 3, 1996 from Acting Assistant Attorney General JohnC. Keeney to Hons. Denise L. Cote, Leonard B. Sand, and Jose A.Cabranes, attached to Defendants' Motion for Leave to FileSupplemental Statement.  On May 8, 1996, the Government moved tofile the Kenney letter in this action, and we granted the motionas unopposed the next day.          The letter certainly raises more questions than itanswers.  I wonder, for example, whether it is consistent withthe plain language of the Act simply for content providers to"make their site[s] known to the world" and thereby "to allow[them] to be blocked", even though this form of notice alonewould not reduce the availability of indecent content.  Cf.Senate Report at 178, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201 (noting that 223(d) "applies to content providers who post indecent materialfor online display without taking precautions that shield thatmaterial from minors").  It is also an unanswered questionwhether the Keeney letter would eliminate any of the CDA's chill,since the Government acknowledged that the letter would notprohibit a United States Attorney from taking a contrary positionin a particular prosecution.  See Defendants' May 9, 1996Response to the May 8, 1996 Order of Court.  The letter alsofails to mention how users who participate in chat rooms,newsgroups, listservs, and e-mail might take advantage of 223(e)(5)(A).  Finally, it is undisputed that neither PICS northe hypothetical "-L18" tag are available to speakers using theWorld Wide Web today, whom the Government has explicitly reservedits right to prosecute should the CDA ultimately be foundconstitutional.  See Stipulation and Order of February 26, 1996,quoted supra.21. Turner examined certain "must-carry" provisions under anintermediate scrutiny, since those laws imposed incidentalburdens on speech but did not directly regulate content.  Turner,114 S. Ct. at 2469.  The Court remanded the case to the districtcourt without passing on the constitutionality of the must-carryprovisions.  Id. at 2472.22. Arguably, a valid CDA would create an incentive for overseaspornographers not to label their speech. If we upheld the CDA,foreign pornographers could reap the benefit of unfettered accessto American audiences.  A valid CDA might also encourage Americanpornographers to relocate in foreign countries or at least useanonymous remailers from foreign servers.23. Testimony of March 22, 1996, at 167.
