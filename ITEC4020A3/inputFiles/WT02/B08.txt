The RFA has promoted the use of renewable energy resources byserving as a vital link between domestic ethanol producers andthe U.S. Congress and Federal and State Government and regulatoryagencies, American industries and consumers nationwide. RFA isdedicated toward the establishment of a strong marketplace forrenewable fuels, increased consumer awareness and acceptance ofalternative fuel sources, communication of sound technical industrydata, and substantial industry growth for ethanol, ETBE and otherrenewable fuels in the U.S. fuel marketplace. With a proven trackrecord as a leader in the renewable fuels industry, the RFA isrecognized nationwide as an organization dedicated to the continuedvitality and growth of alternative fuels. The RFA promotes a visible and competitive domestic renewablefuels industry by aggressively pursuing the following objectives: To promote federal, state and local government policies, programsand initiatives advantageous to the development and use of ethanolfuels to the U.S. Congress and other federal, state and localgovernment entities. To provide the utmost and technically accurate and up-to-dateinformation on ethanol blended fuels to consumers, environmentalists,gasoline marketers, auto manufacturers and technicians. To distribute accurate information and to correct misinformationabout ethanol fuels to the media. To participate in educational activities to increase public awarenessconcerning the production, distribution and use of renewable fuelsand the contribution that they can make to American energy independenceand the enhancement of national security. To keep RFA members abreast of new technological developmentson renewable fuels at universities, private research institutionsand other associations. Renewable Fuels Membership The Renewable Fuels Association Membership, which includes 90%of all U.S. ethanol production, encompasses a broad cross-sectionof private industries, businesses and organizations involved inthe production, blending and marketing of alternative and renewablefuels. This group of ethanol producers and potential producers,fuel retailers, ethanol fuel blenders, equipment manufacturers,farm organizations, energy and engineering companies, and consumerorganizations are dedicated to the expansion and continued developmentof the U.S. fuel ethanol industry. Renewable Fuels Foundation The Renewable Fuels Foundation is a nonprofit organization designedto meet an expanding demand for information relating to researchactivities and technological advancements in the renewable fuelsindustry. An integral part of the RFA, the Foundation and RFAhave engaged in a myriad of innovative education and researchprojects designed to enrich the regulatory and marketplace environmentfor renewable fuels, such as ethanol and ETBE. RFA Organization The Renewable Fuels Association's organization includes key committeesestablished to provide leadership and expertise for the domesticethanol industry. Those include: Technical Committee - The RFA's Technical Committeeworks with ethanol producers and blenders on issues relation tothe production, blending, distribution, and performance of ethanoland ETBE blends. The Committee has published, "GasolineEthanol Blends Program Operations Guide," which sets forthindustry standards and practices. By defining the dominant issuesof interest facing the private sector in the production, distributionand use of renewable fuels, the Technical Committee provides accuratetechnical information to both the public and private sector, spurringsignificant advances in the use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol,ETBE and biodiesel. Market Development Committee - The Market DevelopmentCommittee seeks to establish and augment creative economic andmarketplace conditions favorable to the domestic ethanol industry. By increasing public awareness about the value of renewable fuels,the committee provides consumers with insight to and assurancesof a high quality product for use in the U.S. fuel marketplace. Among the committee's publications is an advanced motor fuelstechnical manual and video training tape for auto mechanics andcar care specialists, "Changes in Gasoline - the Auto TechniciansGasoline Quality Guide." With a circulation of over 400,000,this manual is also used by over 300 colleges and technical schoolsas well as commercial training centers and several auto manufacturers. Membership Committee - The Membership Committeeis instrumental in increasing awareness about the tremendous benefitsof membership in the Renewable Fuels Association. The Committeeengages in an extensive outreach program to continually expandthe renewable fuels community to include new producers of ethanol,marketers, blenders, equipment manufacturers, technology designengineers and suppliers, consumer and environmental organizations,and agricultural commodity organizations that support the useof renewable energy. The Committee establishes fees and responsibilitiesfor membership in the Renewable Fuels Association. Small Producers Committee - The Small ProducersCommittee focuses on unique situations involving smaller ethanolproducers. The Committee focuses on research and developmentprojects regarding production and distribution services and supplysituations.

The substance is oil and we will do anything to get a fix. As an example of the lengths we will go to maintain our habit, the United States recently approved a plan allowing Iraq's return to the oil export business at the rate of $4 billion per year. Much of that oil is expected to be imported by the United States, even though Saddam Hussein remains a threat to regional peace and stability. Unfortunately, this victory for Saddam Hussein, along with the earlier tragic bomb attack in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. airmen protecting our interests -- an increasingly uncertain oil supply -- demonstrate the dangers of our nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. In 1970, the U.S. imported 23 percent of its petroleum needs. By 1973, the number had grown to 35 percent. Today, it is 54 percent and the Department of Energy's independent Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects it to exceed 60 percent by the year 2010. The dollar costs of this oil aren't cheap. In 1994 alone, the U.S. spent $51 billion on oil imports. In 1995, oil imports added $48 billion to the U.S. trade deficit of almost $160 billion. Since 1990, oil imports have added $281.3 billion to America's balance-of-trade deficit, comprising 41 percent of the nation's total imbalance of trade. There are high military costs associated with our foreign oil dependence. We have recently witnessed the loss of life. Military costs to protect our foreign energy sources have been estimated at $35 billion per year. That is more than $12 for every barrel of imported oil or 55 cents per gallon of gasoline. Our foreign oil dependence has also cut hundreds of thousands of domestic jobs, cost us billions of dollars in trade, impaired air quality in our nation's cities, jeopardized public health, stifled economic growth, and devastated our domestic energy production infrastructure. Our exclusive use of oil for transportation energy is a key factor in foreign oil dependence. Today, Americans are driving farther, faster, in larger vehicles, consuming more gasoline than ever before. In 1994, petroleum used for transportation in the U.S. averaged 10.8 million barrels a day, 65 percent of the nation's total petroleum use. This demand exceeded domestic petroleum production by 61 percent. There are alternatives to imported oil. Today, tens of thousands of vehicles throughout the U.S. are powered by fuels other than conventional gasoline. Many urban areas battling air quality problems are operating fleets on alternatives such as compressed natural gas, propane, biodiesel and ethanol. We need to continue to pursue these alternatives as part of a broad national energy strategy that promotes domestic energy sources in an effort to break our foreign oil habit. Renewable fuels can play a central role in this policy. Fuels such as ethanol, made from corn, and biodiesel, made from soybeans, offer the promise of domestically produced energy that is abundant, affordable and clean. There is also the potential for making ethanol from biomass, which includes waste products like corn fiber, rice straw, sawdust, pulp and paper sludge and yard clippings -- or from energy crops such as switch grass, prairie grasses and fast-growing trees. These sources offer a tremendous opportunity for new jobs for the rural economy, as well as environmental benefits through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The National Association of State Energy Officials recently reiterated its support for renewable energy. In a letter to members of the U.S. Senate, the Association said: "Renewable energy is critical to our Nation's future... we must do all we can to reduce our reliance on energy imports and diversify our energy resources." A national domestic energy policy which promotes renewable fuels is long overdue. We need to put a stop to exporting energy jobs and investment overseas. The use of domestic, renewable fuels will strengthen our domestic economy, lower our trade deficit, and secure our energy future for our children. Renewable fuels are also a smart choice for the environment. They burn cleaner than gasoline, reduce toxic emissions from automobiles, and reduce global warming. Our current energy policy, or lack of one, is leading this country down a dangerous road of increased oil dependence, threatening our national security and most importantly, increasing the risk that more American lives will be sacrificed to satisfy our thirst for foreign oil. It is time we "just say no" -- to imported oil.

The study augments a study conducted earlier this summer by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which also demonstrated a significant and sustained reduction in CO attributable to oxyfuels. "When wintertime oxyfuel is used, the corresponding ambient CO concentrations are reduced by approximately 14 percent." The SAI study reports a substantial (14% reduction) and statistically significant (+4%) association between the use of oxyfuels and monitored CO concentrations. More importantly, the analysis notes that as the EPA estimates that on-road vehicles contribute only 62 percent of total CO emissions, oxyfuels are "reducing mobile CO emissions by as much as 20 percent. " " This study answers many of the critics of the oxyfuels program by clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of oxygenated fuels in reducing carbon monoxide levels, " said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA. The SAI study analyzed raw CO data from over 1,000 sites across the country. The analysis utilized bimonthly (Dezcember-January for winter and June-July for summer) average hourly CO and average daily eight-hour maximum CO observations retrieved from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System. The use of data from both December and January is significant given that the highest CO concentrations are typically recorded during these two months. The study also includes June and July data as a control, as oxyfuel programs are not in place during the summer months. The study was conducted in response to a National Research Council peer-review of the Office of Science and Technology Policy's study of the effectiveness of the winter oxygenated fuels program, which suggested only minimal reductions in CO attributable to the oxyfuel program. ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE RINGS LOUD AND CLEAR IN FALL ELECTIONS One of the obvious messages coming from the election is that environmental policy has become a potent issue in electoral politics today. Of the 19 Republican incumbents defeated, 16 were on an environmental hit list. Environmental groups were successful in defeating about 60 % of the Members that were targeted. House Renewable Energy Caucus The Renewable Energy Caucus, formed last February, is a bipartisan organization comprised of Members who support the research and development of renewable energy sources. The Caucus has increased awareness of renewable energy issues on Capitol Hill, and members have successfully maintained funding for renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy. The anticipated addition of freshman Members to the House Renewable Energy Caucus will likely raise membership to over 100 members. 90 members of the Caucus were reelected, including 46 Republicans, 42 Democrats, and 2 Independents. " The Renewable Energy Caucus will assume a more prominent role in the 105th Congress as Members are extremely aware of the potency of environ-mental issues today," said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA. " We look forward to continuing to work with the Caucus to educate Members about the importance of an abundant, affordable and domestically produced energy supply.

Under the leadership of Rep. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Jim Leach (R-IA), the Caucus has helped to build strong bipartisan support for the increased production and use of fuel ethanol. With two members having been elected to the U.S. Senate, and several others having retired or been defeated, the Caucus will be seeking new membership. The RFA will work to build membership as the 105th Congress convenes, and we urge all ethanol supporters to encourage their Member of Congress to join.

Ethanol production increases farm income, decreases deficiency payments, creates jobs in rural America, and reduces American reliance on foreign oil. While it has experienced tremendous growth in the last few years, the ethanol industry barely existed 15 years ago, and is still not a mature industry. I believe Congress and my administration must work together to provide the foundation for the ethanol industry's continued growth. I am strongly opposed to efforts to reduce or repeal the alcohol fuels tax incentives. " PEKIN ENERGY COMPANY EXECUTIVE OUTLINES FUTURE ROLE FOR ETHANOL The following is excerpted from a speech by Ron Miller, Vice President - Ethanol Marketing and Logistics, Pekin Energy Company, Williams Energy Group, and Chairman of the RFA Board of Directors, to the Governors' Ethanol Coalition If one were to describe ethanol's role in America in one sentence, it might go something like this: "An economic investment in domestic renewable energy designed to reduce this nation's dependence on imported energy while addressing the environmental need for cleaner-burning motor fuels with the added benefit of providing consistent and secure markets for an ever expanding agricultural base." This troika of agriculture, national energy and environmental policy is key to continued public support for ethanol. The economic investment is made by the private sector. This year's corn production is about 9.4 billion bushels. The ethanol industry consumes about 600 million bushels per year, or about 6%. Some estimates forecast a 30-40% growth in corn production within the next decade. Today there is not existing market demand for that production. While export markets have been strong, the rest of the world is on a higher production curve like the United States. Also, export markets can be extremely volatile creating significant risks to grain producers. Ethanol, perhaps more than any other market for grain, has the potential to grow with increased output. Today, ethanol represents only slightly over 1% of this nation's gasoline supply. The market potential is unlimited. Of all components in gasoline only ethanol is renewable. From a carbon cycle perspective, it is the only component that has a positive impact on global warming. Ethanol's clean burn tendencies reduce ozone forming tailpipe emissions. More and more, the " good science " of automobile emissions is focusing on the tailpipe as the generator of the more reactive compounds that create ozone. That is why I believe that as the clean air science moves forward, the better ethanol will look. And most importantly, I believe the global warming issue is right around the corner. Where does the future of ethanol lie in my perspective? I think it lies in that partnership of public and private interests. Organizations like the Governors' Ethanol Coalition will help shape the public focus on ethanol. Private interests can only make economic investments based upon public policy. Today, tax and environmental policies drive ethanol demand. Will those policies change in the post 2000 time frame? I really don't know. But I do know that ethanol is good from an agricultural, domestic energy and environmental perspective and it creates domestic economic activity. On that basis, I believe appropriate public policies will continue to maintain and probably expand ethanol's role in the United States energy mix. ETHANOL INDUSTRY PROMOTES COOPERATION WITH BIOMASS POWER AUDIENCE At the joint annual meeting of the National Biomass Industries Association and the United BioEnergy Commercialization Association, Bob Dinneen, Legislative Director of the RFA, presented to the biomass power industry an outlook on alliances with liquid fuel groups, including the domestic ethanol industry. " We need to make support for renewable energy an environmental imperative," challenged Dinneen. Noting that 85% of the electorate now considers themselves "t environmentalists, " Dinneen stated that the same percentage would like to see U.S. dependence on oil reduced, and federal programs to encourage increased use of alternative fuels and renewables expanded. While Americans by and large see renewable energy as an environmental issue, that link is not supported in Washington. Political support for renewable energy among the House Renewable Energy Caucus " is found predominately among those Members who recognize the economic benefit to their community from the development of a particular alternative energy resource." Dinneen challenged the group that " we need to make support for renewable energy part of the environmental lexicon and make it an inextricable part of the environmental agenda." Concerned with rising oil imports that threaten our nation's energy independence, Dinneen stated that energy policy must assume a more prominent role on the political agenda. & quot Nobody discusses energy policy until there is a crisis... we need to make energy independence a part of the political discourse,& quot said Dinneen. Finally, Dinneen encouraged the liquid fuels and biomass power groups to work together. & quot Clearly, there are political synergies [between fuel ethanol and biomass power]. But there very well may be marketplace synergies in the future as technology matures and markets grow. We need to be acutely attentive to those opportunities, and work together for our mutual benefit.

"It is patently irresponsible for Consumer Reports to make any claims on today's cleaner burning fuels on such a limited analysis, which is based on a single test of five fuels in a single vehicle," said Vaughn. The Consumer Reports study tested regular and premium 1996 grades of California Phase 2 reformulated gasoline (RFG), federal Phase I RFG blended with MTBE and ethanol, and oxygenated fuel blended with ethanol in an attempt to assess the environmental and performance benefits of new, cleaner gasolines. The report concludes that the new fuels provide equivalent acceleration and fuel economy to conventional gasoline, but maintains that the new fuels do not provide promised emissions reductions, and challenges whether the new fuels are worth the cost to consumers. In its "fuels analysis," Consumer Reports failed to look at the following: Consumer Reports failed to properly determine the fuel specifications of the tested gasolines. As a result, we do not know the oxygen content, the aromatic content, sulfur level, or olefin content, all of which can have an impact on emissions. Consumer Reports failed to include evaporative emissions in its emissions tests. The federal RFG program is intended to reduce both exhaust emissions and evaporative emissions, which occur during refueling and engine cool-down. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) expects to find a greater mass reduction in volatile organic compounds from evaporative emissions rather than from exhaust. Consumer Reports acknowledged that new fuels are intended to reduce toxic emissions, but did not include an analysis of toxic emissions reductions in its review. Consumer Reports did not compare the fuels for toxics, such as benzene, a known carcinogen. Finally, Vaughn challenged why Consumer Reports did not study the comprehensive database on emissions from these fuels that was developed by the EPA, the Auto/Oil Research Program, the California Air Resources Board, and numerous other state and industry sources. "Before making allegations concerning the environmental benefits of today's cleaner fuels, Consumer Reports should have reviewed the plethora of emissions test data that is available on these fuels. The overwhelming consensus of these tests is that RFG and oxygenated fuels provide significant air quality benefits at a cost-competitive price," concluded Vaughn.

"The oxygenate industry must begin by more effectively promoting the air quality benefits of oxygenates," said Vaughn. Referencing data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Aerometric Information Retrieval System and the EPA National Dry Deposition Network, Vaughn noted that areas using RFG experienced an 11 percent reduction in ozone exceedances between 1994 and 1995, while areas using conventional gasoline witnessed a 79 percent increase. "The benefits realized from RFG to date are uniquely and predominately the result of the oxygen requirement," said Vaughn. Vaughn discussed the need to develop a better understanding of the technical effects of oxygenate use, referring to the recent controversy surrounding the efficacy of the oxyfuel program. Vaughn added that the RFA and the Oxygenated Fuels Association are working together on a test program to evaluate the ambient air data for carbon monoxide in areas using oxyfuels. "This data should go a long way to resolving any legitimate doubt that the oxyfuel program is providing significant reductions in carbon monoxide levels and exceedances across the country," said Vaughn. Rising imports of MTBE were also discussed as a threat to the oxygenate program. "We need to recognize that the political support for oxygenates is based, in large part, on the economic and employment benefits attributable to domestic energy production," said Vaughn. Imports of MTBE reached record levels in 1995, continuing a trend that has seen MTBE imports grow more than 400% in five years. Even more troubling, said Vaughn, is that 1995 MTBE imports were mainly from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. "The trend is clearly toward greater MTBE imports, and a greater dependence on OPEC," said Vaughn. "I would submit to you that if this trend continues, it will threaten the continued political support for the oxygenate program itself," cautioned Vaughn. "There is no constituency for imported oxygenates." Rather than increasing our current dependence on Mideast energy sources, Vaughn recommended promoting the increased production of domestic oxygenates, both MTBE and ethanol. "It only makes sense that as we address one critical public policy objective -- air pollution, we not exacerbate another -- energy security," said Vaughn. "We should never disagree that U.S. energy policy should be grounded in the promotion of domestically produced energy resources; that the role for oxygenates in the nation's fuel supply is critical to continued improvements in air quality and must be expanded; and that both oxygenates should be allowed to grow and develop in this important market to their full potential."For a copy of Mr. Vaughn's testimony, please contact the RFA at (202) 289-3835.

"The important message from this report is that current federal policies are encouraging energy investments offshore at the expense of the domestic industry, effectively feeding our oil import habit. It is analogous to the federal Drug Enforcement Agency buying the needles for a heroin addict," said Vaughn. The report examines three major federal subsidy programs, the foreign tax credit and other provisions of the U.S. tax code, the operation of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the military costs of protecting our access to Middle Eastern oil. The study finds that: "with oil company foreign tax credits totaling over $5 billion a year, with U.S. taxpayers on the line for nearly $8 billion worth of OPIC underwriting for the high-risk foreign ventures of U.S. oil companies and other multinationals, and with military expenditures of roughly $50 billion a year, the U.S. government is providing an expensive welfare program to encourage major U.S. international oil companies to find and develop foreign oil." "The U.S. should be encouraging domestic alternatives to imported oil, like ethanol, a clean-burning, renewable energy resource. Instead, tax subsidies and provisions of the U.S. tax code provide incentives to turn abroad to satisfy our energy needs," said Vaughn. "According to the Citizen Action report, the U.S. spends over $63 billion dollars a year on oil imports. Factor that in together with foregone U.S. jobs and a stagnated domestic energy industry, and you have a recipe for disaster," continued Vaughn. The Energy Information Administration's latest energy outlook projects total U.S. net oil imports in 1997 to exceed 1977's record high, the pinnacle of the nation's energy crisis, and a continued decline in U.S. domestic crude oil production. "These projections provide further evidence that the U.S. must alter its current energy policy. We need to promote domestic energy sources in an effort to increase our nation's energy independence, or face another energy crisis," said Vaughn.

According to RFA President Eric Vaughn, "this letter shouldsignal to anyone interested in the RFG program that the entireoxygenate industry is actively promoting the benefits of thisimportant program and working to expand its use. We are concernedthat areas in need of cost-effective ozone control are missingout on the opportunity provided by RFG. Simply put, there isno better means of reducing ozone than through RFG. We are askingEPA to work closely with us to assure the widest possible useof this clean-burning fuel." The letter to Browner is accompanied by a memorandum from formerU.S. Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources, JamesMoorman, detailing several instances where the potential benefitsof RFG have been foregone in favor of low-RVP (Reid vapor pressure)programs. Low-RVP fuels simply reduce gasoline volatility anddo not have the additional ozone or toxic-reduction benefits ofRFG. Fred Craft, Executive Director of the Oxygenated Fuels Associationstated, "the inclusion of oxygenates in RFG is essentialto reducing ozone-forming emissions from our nation's fuel. Oxygenatesalone reduce all precursors to urban ozone -- VOCs, carbon monoxideand NOx." Referring to a comprehensive analysis comparingthe ozone exceedances for 1995 to 1994, Craft stated, "thedata indicates that areas using RFG had a 9% reduction in ozoneexceedances, while areas using low-RVP gasoline had a 94% increasein exceedances. The bottom line is RFG works, and it works becauseof the addition of oxygenates." American Methanol Institute President Ray Lewis stated, "weare all extremely enthusiastic about the benefits of RFG. Theoxygenate industry believes that by working more closely withEPA we will be able to achieve our mutual goal of expanding theuse of RFG to improve air quality across the country. Our messageto EPA is clear -- let's do what needs to be done to promote thebenefits of RFG as effectively as possible." According to CFDC Executive Director, Douglas A. Durante, "Followingthe first year of the RFG program, the effectiveness of RFG withoxygenates at reducing air pollution is clear. No other pollutionreduction method has achieved such dramatic results. CFDC members,which include Ford, GM, and Chrysler, look forward to continuedcooperation from EPA to educate the public about the benefitsof RFG."

Chelsea Instruments Latest Company News News of people, development, research, and applications from the leaders in ocean optics and data systems. News Index CI INTRODUCES ITS NEW FASTRACKA FLUORIMETER OCEANOLOGY INTERNATIONAL '97, 12-14 MAY 1997, WORLD TRADE CENTRE, SINGAPORE VISIT THE CHELSEA INSTRUMENTS STAND AT IMDEX ASIA 97, WORLD TRADE CENTRE, SINGAPORE, 6-9 MAY 1997 CI's MINIATURE FLUORIMETER GOES INTO PRODUCTION IN 1997 CE HIRE LTD EXPANDS ITS RANGE OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT CI INTRODUCES ITS NEW FASTRACKA FLUORIMETER Chelsea Instruments has entered into an agreement with the Brookhaven National Laboratory to develop, manufacture and market the Fast Repetition Rate Fluorimeter (FRRF) technology. This instrument joins CI's range of fluorimeters and is marketed under the name "Fastracka". Delivery of the instrument begins in April. This new generation of oceanographic instrument has the capability to measure the photosynthetic reaction of chlorophyll in the ocean. This is of particular interest to the environmental and scientific communities, since it gives a unique insight into primary production and thus the overall health of the ocean ecosystem. This is directly related to the uptake and release of carbon dioxide in the surface waters of the oceans and is fundamentally linked to current studies of the Greenhouse Effect. During the IRONEX experiment in 1995, scientists used the Fastracka to assess the primary production before and after seeding an area of ocean with iron. An area of ocean south of the Galapagos Islands in the Equatorial Pacific was chosen as a region high in nutrients, but with abnormally low phytoplankton population. It was hypothesed that a deficiency in iron was limiting production. To test this theory 500 pounds of iron solution was spread over a 25 square miles area. After a few days the once blue ocean was green due to the abundance of chlorophyll bearing phytoplankton. To monitor this feature a Fastracka was towed in a Nu-Shuttle repetitively across the area to assess the horizontal, vertical and temporal extent of the bloom. The fluorimeter flash emits a blue light at a high repitition rate and then measures the amount of red light the object fluoresces. If phytoplankton growing under these conditions is environmentally stressed it tends to lose more energy to heat (and fluoresces more than a healthy plant). The IRONEX results confirmed that the phytoplankton fluorescence was less after being fertilised and thus healthier than before the seeding. Given this success it is seen that the Fastracka / Nu-Shuttle combination is an important new tool in biological oceanography. In particular there is a great paucity of data on photosynthetic characteristics in the world's oceans, both spatially and seasonally, and these parameters are required for basin scale productivity models, linking in-situ data and satellite remote sensing of biological processes. Back to the News Index OCEANOLOGY INTERNATIONAL '97, 12-14 MAY 1997, WORLD TRADE CENTRE, SINGAPORE. Chelsea Instruments has led the market in the production of towed vehicles for many years. Two of these vehicles will be on display at OI97: Aquashuttle - Stable, high speed undulating vehicle, towed at controllable depths and capable of carrying a wide range of instruments. Nu-Shuttle - Towed undulating oceanographic vehicle, large versatile payload, suitable for ships of opportunity.

LOGGING AQUATRACKA Compact, lightweight submersible logging fluorimeter APPLICATIONS Long term deployments on moored monitoring stations. Chlorophyll-a studies for biomass evaluation. Primary production: temporal and spatial variability. Dye tracing studies for the monitoring of water mass circulation, dispersion of outfall discharges. FEATURES Logger capacity 2Mbytes Raw sampling rate 50 Hz Excellent ambient light rejection characteristics Control of stray magnetic, electrostatic and electromagnetic field emissions High data resolution, sensitivity Wide dynamic range Pulsed xenon light source Low power consumption Rhodamine version has excellent turbidity and chlorophyll-a rejection Titanium pressure housing, rated to 6000 metres depth. LOGGING AQUATRACKA Based upon the optical design of the Aquatracka Mark III combined with an internal data logger this instrument retains the same high performance specification as the Aquatracka Mark III. The Logging Aquatracka can sense chemical fluorescence light scatter in the visible and near infra-red (400 - 800nm). Versatility is achieved by the selection of appropriate optical narrow bandpass filters to match the excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorophor, e.g., chlorophyll-a, rhodamine or fluorescein. It may be configured as a nephelometer by using the same band pass filters for both excitation and emission. The Logging Aquatracka uses a rugged pulsed xenon light source which is not prone to sudden failure and gives low power consumption with excellent detection limits. Similarly, the photo-diode detector is virtually indestructible and provides excellent calibration stability over long time intervals. Data logger communication is via a RS422 link and the logger can access up to sixteen channels. Only three channels are used in the standard Aquatracka Mark III so there is ample scope for optional configurations that connect to additional instruments, both from Chelsea Instruments or other suppliers.

FASTRACKA Fast Repetition Rate Fluorimeter APPLICATIONS Monitoring of photosynthetic parameters in marine phytoplankton Oceanographic, estuarine, limnological and riverine studies Environmental monitoring of phytoplankton populations Ocean optical properties research Fisheries and ecosystem studies FEATURES Measurement of variable fluorescence parameters in real time and in situ. Low power: many weeks of low frequency logging on a single charge. Onboard measurement of PAR, temperature and pressure Powered by a rechargeable battery pack, direct (host) power or CTD power tap. Up to 10 different FRRF user-defined protocols programmable. Dual optical channels allow simultaneous light chamber/dark chamber experiments. Use it alone, mounted to oceanographic rosettes, or as payload in the Nu-Shuttle. Large non-volatile data storage capacity protects accidental data loss (4MB standard, up to 20MB available - thousands of acquisitions). FASTRACKA Fast Repetition Rate Fluorimeter The Chelsea Instruments� Fastracka is designed to observe, in real time and in situ, biophysical characteristics of phytoplankton photosynthesis. Using a 100-200 kHz pumping protocol instead of a single saturating flash, the Fastracka instantaneously and non-destructively monitors the photosynthetic parameters of PSII such as variable fluorescence, electron transport rates, and photochemical quenching. The Fastracka has become an important tool for biological oceanographers and environmental monitoring scientists. Developed as a means to measure variable fluorescence in marine phytoplankton, the Fastracka is able to digitise and record the characteristics of phytoplankton fluorescence during the first 100 - 200 microseconds of stimulation. By analysing the manner in which phytoplankton fluorescence varies during this time period, the Fastracka can not only differentiate between photosynthetically active and non photosynthetic fluorescence (i.e. what fraction of a given fluorescence signal is coming from photosynthetically competent phytoplankton), but can also quantify how phytoplankton react to certain environmental conditions. Effects of environmental parameters such as PAR, UV intensity, nutrient availability and toxins on photosynthetic potential can thus be quantified and correlated. A dual chamber arrangement allows the Fastracka to measure ambiently irradiated and dark adapted samples simultaneously, giving the user an index of photosynthetic activity. The Fastracka has been successfully deployed on a wide variety of experiments on many different platforms world-wide. It has been mounted on most types of rosettes, deployed and moored by itself, and flown on Chelsea�s Nu-Shuttle. The instrument is intelligent and readily adapted to different sampling schemes. Instruments will be available in mid to late 1997.

Alphatracka Mark II Transmissometer for suspended and disolved solids Blue, green, yellow or red wavelength versions APPLICATIONS Turbidity measurements Suspended mass transport Visibility measurements Light attenuation FEATURES Dual beam, ratiometric, digitally controlled signal nulling servo gives excellent long term calibration stability with a very small temperature coefficient. Output linearity inherently defined by digital circuitry only. Built In Test (BITE) circuitry gives high stability and extended calibration intervals Minimal excitation & detection beam divergences to enhance significance of particulate measurements. Extremely rigid external optical chassis machined from solid titanium, which is also used for the pressure housings to give low weight and excellent corrosion resistance. 2000m & 6000m depth versions with 'Spectrosil' and sapphire windows respectively. Interfaces easily to a wide range of oceanographic instrumentation. Surface mount circuitry gives small overall diameter. Versions with optical path length of 5, 10 or 25cm. Low power consumption (150mW); accepts wide supply voltage range. Wavelengths 470, 565, 590, 660nm available. ALPHATRACKA MARK II Alphatracka Mark II uses identical electronic circuitry to that in our well received Mark I version but it is now implemented with surface-mount technology; this has enabled a much smaller diameter pressure housing to be used while retaining exactly the same optical train. Data from the Mark II version is thus fully compatible with that already obtained with the Mark I. As before, the transmissometer still yields its full performance even when exposed to full sunlight at any angle, thereby easing deployment constraints. This capability, together with excellent long term calibration stability and very low temperature coefficient, is achieved with a modulated LED source, an internal optical reference beam and photodiode detector in a configuration giving ratiometric signal processing. The performance of this already powerful scheme is further enhanced by the two new proven developments from Chelsea Instruments - firstly, all items are now locked in a signal nulling loop of near infinite gain and, secondly, the signal output linearity is inherently defined by digital circuitry only. Among other advantages noted above, these features ensure that the optical intensity, indicated by the output voltage, is accurately represented by a straight line interpolation between a reading near full-scale under known conditions and a zero reading when blanked off. The efficacy of the control servo is such that the ageing of the LED source produces a reduction of less than 0.01% of full-scale reading per 1000 hours usage. Alphatracka Mark II is available with optical path lengths of 5, 10 and 25cm, so that optimum results can be obtained in waters with widely differing amounts of absorption, whether caused by solutes or by suspended solids. Moreover, these latter conditions were particularly borne in mind when designing the well collimated optics, so that there is minimum possible pick-up of scattered light which would otherwise cause the amount of particulate matter to be underestimated from the apparent optical obscuration caused. The signal beam diameter is 15mm and source peak intensity wavelengths of 470nm (blue), 565nm (green), 590nm (yellow) or 660 (red) are optionally available, typically having a half-power half-width of 20nm. The transmissometer draws 20mA (typically) at all voltages between its rated limits of 7V to 18V DC and is protected against reverse polarity connection of the supply. Full-scale output voltage of +2.5V or +5.0V is optionally available; in both cases the output can deliver at least 5mA without perceptible performance degradation and is safe against indefinite short-circuit to ground potential; supply & signal 'lo' are internally connected. The 'warm-up' time from switch-on to rated performance is 10 sec; the step response time to 63% of final value is typically 0.2 sec. The overall temperature coefficient is <0.05%/ deg C of f.s. and calibration of the clear water reading is established to better than 0.3% accuracy in water purified and filtered by a reverse osmosis/ion exchange column.

Glowtracka Stimulated Bioluminescence Sensor APPLICATIONS Biomass surveys Marine toxicology studies Primary production assesment FEATURES Small, rugged Low power consumption Internal or externally powered Event, peak and continuous sampling GLOWTRACKA Glowtracka is a submersible bioluminescence sensor based on an original design by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK. The sensor monitors the visible emissions from bioluminescent organisms in seawater. The photodetector is built into the side arm of a pipework T-junction and measures the emissions as well as the water flows through the pipe. It contains extensive on-board data reduction circuitry to minimise storage requirements, whilst still retaining a good 'characteristic' of the distribution of the bioluminescent biomass. The impellor is used to measure flow through the sensor, and also to mechanically stimulate the organisms. Glowtracka is designed to be moored, profiled or deployed in towed vehicles (Aquashuttle, SeaSoar, Nu-Shuttle). Complementary Measurements Glowtracka has a number of measurement regimes to cover the wide range (from single cell flashes to mesoscale occurences) of bioluminescent phenomena encountered. An event counter records individual flashes at low frequencies up to 20Hz while integrated intensity and peak sampling allow recording of higher order events.

CTD Sensor Chains CTD SENSOR CHAIN Chelsea Instruments has developed an expanded Aqualink CTD system for the UK Defence Research Agency.The resulting system consists of five Aqualink CTD units, each with three remote CT heads. These are integratedto produce a sensor chain some 400 metres long, designed to be towed from a surface ship at 3 to 4 knots. The Aqualink Underwater Unit is modified by replacing the end cap plug with a nineteen way socket that givesaccess to the spare data channels. This modification and provision of a customised cableform allows the connection of the three additional CT Headsto each underwater unit. Each underwater unit can receive analogue data on up to fourteen channels and convertit to digital data for transmission to the surface deck unit. It also monitors two internal reference voltages. The sampling rate can be either 1 Hz or 16 Hz for all sensors The deck unit consists of five identical discrete units that decode the data sent by each underwater unit, it thenconverts it for transmission to a PC in RS232 format. Each CT Head is of a common build and can be used in any position in the chain, however, to take account of allsystem aspects each CT Head is calibrated in its specific chain position and connected to its unique AqualinkUnderwater Unit. The CT Head is identified by the Aqualink number and the chain position. The system has been towed extensively in many areas of the North East Atlantic and Arctic oceans. It has generated many data sets of durations from a few days to several weeks. Specification (Remote CT Head) Dimensions: length width 280 mm 120 mm Weight: 3.5kg Voltage input: 24 V d.c.

Oceanographic Flow Cells APPLICATIONS Sea surface monitoring from a vessel underway. Unattended monitoring in hazardous areas. Oceanographic data gathering by non-scientific personnel USERS Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, UK Defence Research Agency, UK The Environment Agency, UK Netherlands Centre for Ocean Research OCEANOGRAPHIC FLOW CELLS Chelsea Instruments have produced a number of flow cells designed for continuous monitoring of the surfacewaters by ships on passage. The flow cells are designed to operate either in a laboratory or within the machineryspace of a sea going vessel. Their rugged and waterproof construction makes them ideal for locating close to seawater inlets in harsh environments. The sensors are based on the proven Aqualink conductivity and temperature designs with the addition ofother sensors if required. The sensor performances are the same as the standard Aqualink CTD. A flow through fluorimeter variant is also available. Flow rates are typically four litresper minute at a nominal pressure of two bars. Power supplies are intrinsically safe 24VDC with 0-10VDC analogoutputs. All units are rated to both IEC 349 Class 1 and IP65. A novel approach has been developed for the Environment Agency, UK. To meet their requirement to monitorsea surface parameters underway using their existing Alphatracka, Aquapack and Chemitracka instruments CIdesigned a deck mounted flow through chamber. This enables the instruments, originally designed for profiling, tobe installed into the chamber and a pumped seawater flow to be input. Internal clamps secure the instrumentsbefore the water-tight seals are made. Removable volume inserts enable the water flow to be directed andoptimised. The chamber is constructed from UPVC reinforced with chopped strand mat. It is 970 mm long,480 mm wide and 270 mm long.

Oceanographic Calibration Facility RECENT CLIENTS Defence Research Agency Natural Environmental Research Council National Rivers Authority Royal Navy French Navy OCEANOGRAPHIC CALIBRATION FACILITY Chelsea Instruments has an extensive calibration facility in Surrey. This facility is available for the calibration ofinstrumentation not only of CI equipment but also from any manufacturer. TEMPERATURE A 50 litre capacity temperature controlled bath has been installed, with a working volume of 550x300x250 mm.This has a stability of better than 1mK over the temperature range -10 to 65 deg C. The temperature of the fluid isindependently measured with a platinum resistance thermometer with 0.2mK resolution and 1mK accuracy. Routinely, calibrations are performed in the range 2 to 29.5 deg C, but work outside this range can be undertaken tospecial order. Reporting can be either on the ITS-90 or IPTS-68 scale. PRESSURE Two new dead weight testers (pressure balances) have been installed. One is a pneumatic instrument coveringthe range 0.1 to 7MPa absolute (0 to 700m depth), with a measurement uncertainty of 0.0035% of reading, plus0.1kPa (1mBar). The second is a hydraulic unit covering the range 0.3 to 60MPa gauge (30 to 6000m depth),with a measurement uncertainty of 0.01% of reading. Reporting can be in any pressure units (corrected to standard atmospheric pressure) or depth units corrected to agiven latitude, temperature and salinity. CONDUCTIVITY Five new 400 litre capacity baths, each with continuous filtration, have been installed for conductivity calibration inthe range 0 to 5 Siemens per metre. The salinity of each is determined at the time of calibration by comparison toIAPSO standard sea-water with an autosalinometer. Reporting can be either in conductivity ratio or electrical conductivity units (assuming a conductivity of 4.2914 S/mfor standard sea-water at 15 deg C). FLUORIMETERS Standard calibrations of fluorimeters can be undertaken using chlorophyll-a in acetone, rhodamine in water,carbazole in water (for hydrocarbon fluorimeters) or perylene in ethanol (for gelbstoffe fluorimeters) in the range0.0001 to 100�g/l concentration. Measurements using other fluorophors, solvents and concentrations can beundertaken to special order. Nephelometers can also be calibrated to BS6068.

Peter Jaret reports on the breakthrough Rarely has a single brief scientific paper, delivered at an obscure research conference, ignited such a frenzy of publicity. But when the subject is a cream that promises to make thigh fat melt away within weeks-- and when the results say it actually works--it's big news. In the study, presented at the North American Association for the Study of Obesity in Milwaukee in October, endocrinologist Frank Greenway of the University of California at Los Angeles and George Bray of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University selected twelve women who considered their thighs to be undesirably pudgy and dimpled. The women applied a cream laced with a drug called aminophylline to one thigh. An identical cream, but without the active ingredient, was applied to the other thigh. At the end of six weeks, the thighs treated with aminophylline cream were measurably thinner than those treated with the inactive cream, some by more than half an inch in girth. "We conclude that a 2 percent aminophylline cream applied topically causes regional fat loss from the thighs of women," the researchers announced. As the audience of some 400 obesity and weight loss experts spilled out of the conference room, Associated Press science editor Paul Raeburn, the only journalist in attendance, full expected to hear the usual scientific skepticism--that the results are preliminary, that further research is in order. "Instead," says Raeburn, "everyone I talked to seemed in a hurry to get their hands on samples of the cream." Raeburn hurried to his typewriter. "Researchers Describe Cream That Shrinks Thighs," headlines declared the next day. Within hours the news was being trumpeted far and wide, from local daily newspapers to national television. A fat-loss lotion that really works! A miracle cream that melts stubborn fat off thighs! Can it be true? As the hype dies down, a clearer view is emerging of a potentially valuable discovery that's far from new, a little less than revolutionary, and --alas--probably not all it's cracked up to be. Scientists have long known that aminophylline--and more than a dozen other substances, including caffeine--causes fat cells to burn fat, according to David Heber, professor of medicine and chief of clinical nutrition at UCLA and an internationally recognized expert on obesity and weight loss. "Put fat cells in a culture dish with aminophylline and you can literally watch them release their stores of fat," says Heber. Aminophylline and other promising fat-loss drugs work by interfering with the action of hormones that normally regulate storage and release of fat. Aminophylline is believed to block the receptor for an enzyme called adenosine, which otherwise inhibits fat cells from burning up their stored energy. With the enzyme inhibitor out of the way, fat cells can mobilize their fat stores more easily, according to George Bray, who co-authored the highly publicized study and is a professor of medicine at Louisiana State University. One potential use of such drugs is for the treatment of clinical obesity. Scientists are currently experimenting with several promising substances that, taken orally or by injection, may help stimulate the body to burn fat more readily. But what about applying the same fat-loss substances, in a cream or a lotion, directly to certain parts of the body where unwanted fat tends to settle? Estrogen and progesterone produced during pregnancy trigger enzymes that remove fat from the bloodstream and tuck it away in fat cells in hips and thighs, where it's on hand to supply the more than 500 extra calories a day required to produce breast milk. Because the need to feed our offspring is so crucial, fat cells in the thighs and hips are programmed to protect fat stores, even when other cells in the body burn theirs--one reason women who put on unwanted pounds during pregnancy find them devilishly difficult to shed later. "Theoretically, at least, a substance applied locally could make it easier for those cells to burn stores of fat in hips and thighs," says Heber. Surprisingly, Greenway and Bray first announced promising results using a topical formulation of aminophylline cream more than six years ago. "Local fat reduction from the thigh can be safely accomplished, "their little-noticed scientific paper in Clinical Therapeutics announced in 1987. No one at the time, it sees, was listening. "The basic research into how cells store and release fat goes way back to the early 1960's," says Bray. He and his colleagues first began to experiment with topical applications in 1978. Since then, the aminophylline-cream formulation has been refined and further tested, according to Los Angeles--based physician and medical researcher Bruce Frome, who is collaborating with Bray and Greenway to make various thigh creams commercially available. "The real trick was creating a formula that allowed aminophylline to reach fat cells," says Frome, who directs the International Pain Research Institute in Los Angeles and has patented over a dozen medical inventions. The compound had long been widely used to treat asthma, so doctors knew the substance was safe in very low concentrations. Frome says its effectiveness had been suggested in 20 studies conducted over the past twelve years that showed that cream containing aminophylline, applied daily, reduces thigh girth in 80 percent of women who use it. But is it really melting away fat? Aminophylline and related substances act as diuretics when taken internally, drawing fluid out of cells. Some researchers caution that the thigh-thinning effect may be nothing more than water loss. Others say we simply don't know enough about how aminophylline works on the skin. "There's still no laboratory evidence that aminophylline cream actually penetrates the outer layers of the skin to reach fat cells," Heber insists. "Nor do we know whether it can override all the other enzyme signals that control fat storage and release. There are still many questions to be answered." Even if aminophylline cream does work as claimed, it would only make it easier for the body to draw on fat stored in the thighs. The same overall amount of fat would be burned. Fat stored in the upper arms, for instance, might increase in direct proportion to fat burned in the thighs and hips. "The only way to lose overall weight is to decrease the amount of calories you eat or increase the energy you expend through exercise," says Heber. "A thigh cream is not a formula for weight loss." Frome and Bray are even more cautious about the practical uses of aminophylline cream. "True, the latest study showed a measurable reduction in girth. But in my opinion that inch or so simply isn't significant," Frome admits. "Even trained observers weren't able to tell the difference." There's no reason to think continuing use of the cream over time will drop even more inches from thighs. "In cream form, the aminophylline only reaches effective concentrations in fat cells near the surface of the skin," Bray explains. And the effect is temporary; once the cream was discontinued, the inches crept back on. good old dieting and exercise, as Heber points out, are far more effective and long-lasting. The real value of aminophylline cream, according to Frome, will be in smoothing away unsightly "orange peel" appearance--so-called cellulite, which some researchers believe is caused when pockets of fat cells create bulges in the connective tissue of the thighs. In a few women, Frome claims, dimpling and lumpiness disappeared after the first application of the cream. Surprisingly, several anticellulite creams already on the market contain a chemical relative of aminophylline called theophylline--although in far smaller concentrations than the 2 percent solution used in the research study. "There's nothing miraculous about it," says Jack Mausner, Ph.D., senior vice president of research and development for Chanel cosmetics. "Theophylline works as a diuretic, drawing water out of the cells and temporarily improving appearance." Frome admits that some creams now on cosmetics shelves contain a substance similar to his formulation. But he says that they contain the wrong concentrations of the drug to have much effect or substances that counteract it. Obviously many women would pay handsomely for a cream that really does away with dimpled "orange peel" thighs. They'll even pay good money for a product that simply claims it does. Putting such claims to the test, unfortunately, won't be easy. Wary of crossing the line between a cosmetic and a drug--thereby triggering the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration--cosmetics companies are reluctant to say too much about what their products actually do in the body. It's safe to claim that a product improves the appearance of cellulite-laden thighs; but if manufacturers say that an active ingredient causes fat cells to burn up their stores of energy, the formulation may be required to undergo extensive and expensive FDA drug testing. Thus many cosmetics companies purposefully keep their claims vague. The result is a growing number of so-called cosmeceuticals--cosmetics that may actually be more effective than manufacturers are willing to say. Add to that the fact that many lookalike products now crowd cosmetics shelves, and it's easy to see why choosing a product that really works isn't easy. The latest flap over aminophylline cream won't make the choice any easier. Frome and his colleagues have signed agreements with three companies to produce their new cream won't make the choice any easier. Frome and his colleagues have signed agreements with three companies to produce their new cream, including Herbalife and the Fight Solution, and the cream should be hitting the market now. But even Frome readily admits that at least one of the companies has made changes in the formula that may make the product less effective. The good news is that a one-month supply of aminophylline thigh cream is expected to cost only about $30. since most women in the highly touted study saw changes in the appearance of their thighs within three weeks, that's all you'll need to spend to find out whether the new cream really works. Chances are plenty of women will give it a try. Two days after the research results made headlines, Frome had received more than 300 faxes from people who hoped to get samples. In the end, women evaluating the results in the privacy of their own mirrors will decide whether this latest miracle lotion is just so much hype--or really something special.

Cellulite is characterized by dimpled or bumpy areas at the skin�s surface, most often in the hip and buttock areas of the body. These dimples are actually tissue bands in the fat that are "tethered" together at various places, thus causing a puckered look. Because women physiologically have higher percentage of body fat than men and more subcutaneous body fat in the hip and buttock areas, cellulite is experienced primarily by females. Causes of Cellulite Although it is not conclusively known whether cellulite is hereditary, it is clear that the condition is directly related to the skin�s elasticity in specific areas. Therefore, a series of weight fluctuations can cause cellulite due to a reduction in the skin�s tautness in certain areas. In addition, activity levels and nutrition also contribute to the laxity of the skin. Treatments Surgical The appearance of cellulite may be reduced by liposuction of the affected areas. This procedure is performed by a plastic surgeon as outpatient surgery and involves thinning of the fatty layer and releasing the tethered bands of tissue in the skin. Selective fat-grafting, where small amounts of fat are re-injected into hollow areas, may also lessen the appearance of cellulite. Chemical Most commonly, creams containing aminophylline are used to treat areas of cellulite. However, creams with theophylline are also used with even greater results due to its higher stability and shelf-life. These chemicals are natural products belonging to a group of plant compounds called xanthines,, which includes caffeine in coffee and theobromine in chocolate. The main action of xanthine-based creams is to help mobilize fatty acids from fat cells, thus encouraging those fat cells to reduce in size. Many women report significant results with the continued usage of these types of creams. Other Exercise and nutrition are also important in promoting the skin�s elasticity. Keep the body at a healthy level by practicing the following: A Low fat Diet - fruits, vegetables, grains, limited salt, plenty of water Moderate exercise - twenty minutes of aerobic activity three times a week For More Information Dr. Graham Kemsley is a board certified plastic surgeon with 20 years experience in cosmetic surgery and cofounder of the Newport Institute of Plastic Surgery.

The term was initially used to explain the shaping and molding of various features. Modern plastic surgery developed following World War II, when scores of British airmen sustained grave facial disfigurement during battle. Doctors created new techniques to reshape their faces and eventually the term "plastic surgery" was used to describe the vocation. Type of Plastic Surgery There are two categories of plastic surgery - reconstructive and cosmetic. Reconstructive plastic surgery is used in a wide variety of medical cases including: birth defects cancer reconstruction severe burns facial trauma skin tumors hand surgery Cosmetic plastic surgery is a voluntary surgery performed to improve or enhance a physical feature. The most common cosmetic surgeries include: liposuction breast enlargement breast reduction breast lift rhinoplasty (nose) face lift chin or cheek implant eyelid lift fat grafting Is Cosmetic Surgery Right for Everyone? Thousands of people choose to have cosmetic surgery every year and are thrilled with the results. But it is important to note that cosmetic surgery is a physical and emotional decision. Not only must there be enough probability that the area may be surgically corrected or enhanced, but the patient must also be emotionally ready to alter the chosen physical feature. How to Choose a Plastic Surgeon There are several factors to consider when deciding on a plastic surgeon: Recommendations. Ask friends or family who have had plastic surgery about their doctor. There is no substitute for first hand knowledge. Qualifications. Be sure the surgeon is Board Certified or Board Eligible. Most qualified surgeons are also members of the ASPRS (American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons). Experience. Choose a surgeon who is well-trained and experienced in the surgery you are pursuing. You may wish to speak with more than one doctor to obtain this information. Comfort Level. You need to feel comfortable with the surgeon and confident that he/she understands your needs and concerns.

Exposure to the sun�s ultraviolet rays can prematurely age and damage the skin. Tanning booths have the same effect. Smoking also causes skin damage. To best protect the skin from daily environmental exposure, sun protection should be used from a very early age and continued throughout adulthood. Although no product completely blocks UV rays, there are many lotions and creams available with an adequate SPF (sun protection factor) to protect from the harmful effects of the sun. For the face, it is recommended that a sunscreen or block of at least SPF 15 be applied each morning and throughout the day as needed. General Cleansing and Hydration Skin is often as unique as the individual. For example, acne prone skin is treated quite differently from severely dry skin. However, most skin types benefit from some form of cleansing each day. Cleansers help keep pores clean, gently remove debris and dead cells, and hinder formation of blemishes or blackheads. Toners or astringents are usually recommended if the skin is very oily or acne prone. Moisturizing or "hydrating" the skin is also dependent on the individual�s needs. Often a light moisturizer can help protect the skin from the drying effects of various environmental stresses including cold, wind or air conditioned rooms. Alpha Hydroxy Acid Products In the last 15 years, skincare research has produced a number of creams and lotions that literally speed up how fast the skin regenerates. Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) which include glycolic acid (also referred to as fruit acids) are derived primarily from natural products such as citric and lactic acids. When applied regularly after cleansing and before moisturizing, these acids cause skin cells to multiply at a faster rate and improve the bond between those cells. Results commonly reported include: Smoother, more youthful appearance diminished appearance of fine lines more even skin tome, decreased discoloration reduced inflammation and acne formation Some mild side effects during the first two weeks of AHA usage include a slight tingling sensation and /or minor irritation of the treated area. These symptoms are transient and not harmful. However, if sever redness or inflammation occurs, product usage should be discontinued immediately. Direct contact with the eyes and lips should also be avoided. Pregnant or nursing women may wish to consult their doctor before using AHA products. Additionally, AHA skin �peels� can be performed by a qualified plastic surgeon or esthetician. This procedure provides significant results and can be performed a few times throughout the year.

Pugliese, MD Biomedical Consultant Bernivlle, Pa July 28,1994 Aloe vera has many positive properties. The anti-inflammatory action of aloe vera provides versatility to other formulations when compounded with aloe vera. When used with cellulite reduction products containing theophylline aloe vera has the unique action increasing lymphatic drainage and promoting an accelerated action of the theophylline. Fat cells in cellulite are characterized by a subclinical inflammatory state. Subclinical inflammation is not detectable by visual means as it is microscopic. In the presence of this low grade inflammation the fat cells are swollen and under increased interstitial (intercellular) pressure. This increased pressure reduces the flow of lymph fluid which in turn causes a slowing of the theophylline to the fat cell. Addition of aloe to the products reduces the inflammation which reduces the intercellular pressure on the lymphatic vessels, allowing them to carry away more lymph fluid, including free fatty acids which are breakdown products of lipid metabolism. This added benefit of aloe vera to the formula will provide a greater benefit from using anti-cellulite products. When combined with a regimen of walking the benefit is even greater.

Pugliese, MD Biomedical Consultant Bernivlle, Pa July 28, 1994 The basic concept in the use of topical agents to reduce cellulite is based on the action of theophylline to mobilize stored fatty tissue in the areas to which it is applied. Theophylline is a natural product belonging to a group of plant compounds call xanthities, which includes caffeine found in coffee and tea. The main action of theophylline in cellulite reduction is to help the normal processes of the body in the mobilization and utilization of stored fatty tissue. Fat is stored in the body whenever there is an excess of intake of food, no matter what foods we eat. This stored fat serves as an energy reserve, to be used when needed. Normally the body will maintain about 30% to 35% of total body weight as fatty tissue. The use of this fat requires that it be changed into a form that the body can use as active energy. When we do not take in food for four hours or more, fat will start to be mobilized from the stored reserves. However, when we eat food the body will start to secret insulin, which is needed to help utilize this new food, but the insulin will block or stop stored fatty tissue from being mobilized. This action makes sense when you consider that fat is reserve energy, energy that we shall need when there is no food available. To conserve this energy the body shuts down the process with insulin whenever we eat. In between food intake the insulin level is low and does not inhibit the mobilization of fat. Now, we can take advantage of this fact by using the anti-cellulite cream when we are not taking in food, that is, at night. While we peacefully sleep, the body is burning up enough fat to consume between 400 and 500 calories. What particular area of fat is used in this process is determined by a complex physiological mechanism, but you can select a specific area to be utilized by applying the anti-cellulite cream to that area. This is how the cream works. Unfortunate, you can not expect the best results with the anti-cellulite cream if you apply it only during the day and eat between meals. You do not need to starve yourself, just eat regular meals to maintain you ideal weight. If you are overweight you need a reduction diet, and a slight increase in your activity which will raise your caloric needs and mobilize more fatty tissue. Keep in mind that the body is constantly striving to maintain and improve itself. Everything is there to keep you in good shape, all you need to do is to help it along. We have a tendency to put on weight just as we increase our knowledge or our saving accounts, at regular intervals, a little at a time. We can do exactly the same thing to keep our bodies in shape, a little extra effort, but regularly. Walking is the best exercise known, and really great for the legs. The body is an incredibly beautiful and resilient mechanism. It is designed to stay beautiful and to last over a hundred years; all it asks of us is no abuse, and a little care.

DOUBLE STRENGTH FORMULA FOR FASTER RESULTS WHY 'PHYSICIAN CELLULITE CREAM' IS THE BEST Dr. Kemsley's Skin Care is providing you with a product that was developed through a concertedeffort of dedicated professionals including a Research Pharmacologist, Biomedical ResearchDermatologist and Cosmetic Plastic Surgeon. A unique Theophylline is used that isextremely fat soluble and able to penetrate the skin. We use Theophyline instead of the morecommonly used aminophylline because aminophylline is very unstable with a limited shelf life ,normally 2 months or less. This instability causes the product to naturalize, thus many of the cellulitecreams on the market have lost all potency by the time the consumer uses the product. Weuse a derivative of theophylline which is very stable for at least 3 years. In addition whole leaf aloevera is an important part of our formula. Our patented aloe vera increases lymphaticdrainage and has an anti-inflammatory effect which promotes an accelerated action of theTheophylline. These active ingredients are contained in a rich emollient that gives yourskin a wonderfully soft and enriched feel. HOW IT WORKS Theophylline is a natural product belonging to a group of plant compounds called xanthines, which includes caffeine in coffee and theobromine in chocolate. The main action of theophylline is to help the normal body processes in mobilizing stored fat. Fat is energy that the body stores for use whenever there is no food available. Even when we sleep, the body burns up enough fat to consume 500 - 600 calories. What particular area of fat used in this process is determined by a complex physiological mechanism, but fat mobilization can be encouraged in specific areas such as thighs or buttocks by direct application of the cellulite cream. WHOLE LEAF ALOE VERA GEL Aloe Vera has many positive properties. For example, the anti-inflammatory action of the gel provides versatility to other formulations when compounded with aloe vera. When used with cellulite reduction products containing Theophylline, aloe vera has the unique action of increasing lymphatic drainage and promoting an accelerated action of the Theophylline. RESULTS People report seeing results in 7 to 30 days. They report a softening and smoothing of the areas treated. You should continue the thigh creme until your desired results are obtained. If the cellulite starts to reappear, then resume using the product until the cellulite is not visible. RECOMMENDED USES: Physician Cellulite Cream was developed for the reduction of unsightly cellulite. It smoothes and tones cellulite type fatty deposits on the hips, buttocks & thighs Moisturizing, non-greasy, dries quickly. DIRECTIONS: After bathing, apply to hips, thighs, buttocks, & and other target areas. For best results, use at least twice daily through a moisturizing, non-greasy formula that dries quickly.

Plastic Surgery News / March 1994 While cosmetic creams claiming to help smooth unsightly fat on thigh are not a new invention, the hype over them is. Interest in thigh - slimming creams hit in a big way late last year after researchers unveiled a study at an October meeting of the North American association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO). George Bray, MD, and Frank Greenway, MD, Began searching over a decade ago for a chemical that would diminish the size of fat cells near the surface of the skin. Their research brought them to aminophylline, an asthma drug that seemed to nullify the effects of a fat-breakdown inhibitor. Together with Bruce Frome, MD, of the International Pain Research Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., the researchers found an apparently effective level of the drug and an appropriate cream to suspend it in. They conducted a study with a group of 12 women (one of whom dropped to due skin irritation), applying the cream to one thigh and a placebo cream to the other five days a week for five weeks. The researchers noted a decrease of 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches in the treated thighs of the group. Dr. Greenway presented these encouraging results at the NAASO meeting in Milwaukee. The result was a flood of new thigh creams entering the marketplace capitalizing on the publicity of his study. With the complaint of "thunder thighs" easily ranking as one of the most popular cosmetic gripes of women, the news of the new cream was greeted with waves of both enthusiasm and skepticism. ASPRS member Charles Ettelson, MD, of Chesterfield, Mo., serves as secretary of the St. Louis Area Society of Plastic Surgeons. He expressed the skeptical viewpoint by a local newspaper on the effectiveness of thigh creams. No credible evidence? "It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal that is commonly read by plastic surgeons," Dr. Ettelson offered, noting that some purveyors of these creams have been doing the talk show circuit to hawk products, rather than demonstrating scientifically that they work. "I've seen no credible evidence that these thigh creams can work," says Dr. Ettelson. "I'm as skeptical as any other plastic surgeon would be hearing about a product like that." But Dr. Bray, MD, a respected obesity researcher and executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., says the results of his research speak for themselves. He explains how he and Dr. Greenway, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at Harbor -UCLA Medical Center, came to develop the cream. "When I was on sabbatical 15 years ago, it occurred to me that we knew enough about the differences in fat on the thighs and buttocks and fat on the abdomen to suggest that we might be able to 'tip' some of the fat cells in the leg area into mobilizing more of the fat. With a colleague of mine -- Dr. Greenway at UCLA -- we began some preliminary studies in his clinical office on some different ways to do this. After a couple of years and tests which we published (the first article appeared in Clinical Therapeutics Vol. 9#6 in 1987), we had clear evidence that you could in fact 'tip it' and get small amounts of the superficial fat mobilized to make the thigh appear to change its size and configuration a bit so it looked better." Dr. Bray says aminophylline, the active agent the researchers ended up using in the cream, belongs to a family of drugs, any one of which would accomplish similar results. Skinny Dip, a thigh cream which has been on the market a handful of years in different formula variations, until recently used theophylline, a sibling of aminophylline. The active ingredient was changed to aminophylline around the time of the release of the study by Drs. Frome, Greenway and Bray. In the cosmetic, not the drug biz "We decided to use aminophylline because it's a compound which has been around in the treatment of asthma since before I was medical school -- and that's 40 years ago," says Dr. Bray of their formula. "It's generally recognized as a safe agent and is available over the counter. We thought something was safe and has long experience was the way to go -- we're no in the drug business, we're really in the cosmetic, the appearance - improvement side." While the study documents that thigh girth reduction occurred while using he cream, there is no actual proof that the cream breaks down fat cells in the thigh. But Dr. Bray says there is proof that aminophylline reacts with fat cells in a test tube. "If you have fat cells in a test tube and you put aminophylline in, it binds to what are called the adenosine (sometimes called beta) receptors which inhibit fat breakdown. When you block them with a drug like aminophylline, you enhance that breakdown." Dr. Bray explains that fat cells are governed by surface receptors, which can be triggered to release fat into the bloodstream to be burned by the body as fuel. Fat in the thighs and buttocks differs form fat cells in the rest of the body in that they have fewer "fat release" receptors. ";There are two broad types of receptor systems on fat cells which control their function in terms of breakdown of fat," says Dr. Bray. "One is called lipolytic -- the kinds that break down fat. The other is called antilipolytic which inhibit breakdown. The thigh fat cells, particularly in women, have more of the antilipolytic types of receptors, less of the lipolytic. The adenosine receptor is one of those antilipolytic receptors. It is the modulation of that receptor, right at the surface of the thigh, which probably leads to the smoothing effects you get on these fat globules which are bulging out of the skin." Still no cure for thunder thighs Dr. Bray notes that if his cream does, as he suspects, break down fat cells in the thighs, it doesn't rival, say, liposuction. "It's not a quantitative fat removal process. It's not like a treatment for AIDS, it's not going to cure anything. They're really cosmetic changes. We did weekly measurements to determine thigh sizes in order to give us some quantitative numbers. It takes two or three weeks to get a size change; that means that the cosmetic effects have already occurred because they're going to be there before you can measure anything. And we know from people who have weight problems who have regained weight and are not continuing to use this, it will recur. So it's like any cosmetic, if you don't continue to use it, the problem will recur. We haven't permanently changed anything at all." Sherrel Aston, MD, ASPRS member and president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, remains skeptical of the creams, and points out that the evidence that aminophylline creams are effective is very slim. "From a physiological standpoint, it doesn't seem reasonable to think that it would make the thighs shrink. I would say buyer beware. I need to see how it works physiologically and see the results before I can buy that." But Dr. Bray suggests that the cream may be a good tool for plastic surgeons if used as an adjunct to liposuction. "Because with liposuction you take out fat in one area," says Dr. Bray. "The junction between the area where you use liposuction and where you don't is where you're likely to get puckering, because of the fat that's left behind. I can see the cream as a very real benefit if used around the area where they've done liposuction." Enhancing liposuction results Joel Singer, MD, a Connecticut ASPRS member who has used the cream on his patients, agrees. "it gives us a topical cream that can be used to enhance our liposuction results," says Dr. Singer. "It's certainly not going to do what liposuction does, but I think those irregularities in post - operative lumps and bumps that we seen can be smoothed out with this. Its also gives the patient something to do -- to massage it in or have as massage therapist massage it in -- as they're healing. I think it enhances the healing of liposuction and improves our results. For plastic surgeons, I think this cream definitely has a place." Dr. Bray also notes that while some have voiced concern over the use of a drug in the cream, many cosmetic products use over-the -counter drugs or their roots to accomplish different ends on the external surface of the body than the purposes for which they are used internally. "You take more of that drug in one day as an asthmatic than you could get through your skin if you put it all over you!" Dr. Bray added. Some have also speculated that rather than releasing fat from the thighs, the cream simply releases water retained in the thighs. "I've heard that suggestion since we published our data," Dr. Bray admits. "I have no evidence that that's not the case because the rationale for the studies was not based on fluid shifts. There may well be some fluid shift as part of it." The researchers have no further studies planned. Instead, they have licensed the formula to three cosmetic companies: The Right Solution in Newport Beach, Calif., which markets it as a Cellution; Nutri/System in Philadelphia (owned by Chicago's Heico Cosmetics, Inc.) which markets it as smooth contours (TM) Thigh Cream; and Herbalife in Los Angeles which produces a slightly altered version of the cream known as Thermojectics Body Toning Cream. Another company which Dr. Bray says "pirated" the basis of his cream, has its own version of an aminophylline-based thigh cream on the market -- Neways in Salem, Utah, markets Skinny Dip. Neways has done perhaps the most aggressive marketing campaign of any of the thigh cream producing companies since late last year. Collette McCollough, a spokesperson for Neways, says the timing of Neway's recent addition of aminophylline to Skinny dip was simply an unfortunate coincidence. "We benefited form research going on all over the world," she says. "Skinny Dip had used theopylline. 'Hard Copy' (a syndicated TV featured news program) came out with a study on aminophylline and we were adding it to our product and the UCLA study came out -- all at the same time; it was all really close." The publicity over the Dr. Frome - spearheaded study, though it documented the results of a different cream, certainly didn't hurt Neways. Adding aminophylline and sales "Our sales completely skyrocketed," McCollough says, noting that "since we added aminophylline, the results of using Skinny Dip have improved." "I've been using Skinny Dip for years, but since the publicity came out everybody's been calling me about it," reports Dr. Singer, who has used the cream with positive results on 40-50 patients. "Since they added in the aminophylline, I think it works faster. You can enhance the results by adding heat or using it in an enclosed environment like an exercise or sauna suit. By adding the heat you improve the results. But it's not permanent result. You stop using the cream and you go back to where you were before. It's not something that is effecting a permanent change in the same way that liposuction does. I look it as fitness for the fatty tissue in the external parts of the body -- a fat fitness cream." But while some surgeons have used various thigh creams with good results, currently the studies Drs. Frome, Bray and Greenway are the only scientific investigation with available results of the cream's effects. More studies have been begun by various independent researchers since late last year, but Dr. Bray isn't one of them. "I haven't done further studies," explains Dr. Bray, "because once or formula was patented, I have the view that I have a conflict of interest with it. This actual last study was part of one we were doing to try to get somebody interested. We published to papers in '87 and '88 and we'd been to a dozen companies but nobody was interested in the formula. So after awhile, Dr. Frome went into business with us and said he'd try to get it moving along. So the recent study with him was actually to verify the effect of a lower percentage of aminophylline." FDA certification process underway Smooth Contours, Dr. Frome's company which owns the rights to the cream, is currently beginning the process of sending a higher strength cream to the Food and Drug Administration for certification as a medicinal product. But both FDA and the Federal Trade Commission have begun to look closely at the non-approved "cosmetic" versions of the thigh-smoothing creams. Alan Halper, of the FDA Office of Cosmtics and Colors, says that so far, no one has submitted any "magic thigh creams" for approval to his department. "Products promoted to remove cellulite are considered drugs by the agency -- or at least by me," say Halper. "I don't consider them cosmetics. If they are making claims that a product removes dimpled skin or cellulite, then if fits the definition of a drug from the standpoint of 'intending to effect the structure or function of the body of a man or animal.' So it would be regulated as a drug by the agency." Halper says the FDA hasn't reached a decision on what to do about the creams currently on the market, but the FTC has tried to stop some companies from advertising that their creams "break down or reduce cellulite or fat" unless they have firm documentation to prove the claim. The solution for most companies is simply not to make the claim. This has been the thrust of The Right Solution's campaign for Cellution. Brenda Fabian, a spokesperson for the company notes: "It's a topical product. You can't make claims that it takes fat away because it's sold as a cosmetic. But the proof is in the pudding. Every woman in America will be looking for it." FTC - instigates cases against mfrs. Susan Cohn, in the FTC's department of advertising practices, says there have been FTC - instigated cases against thigh cream manufacturers, but since they are brought by regional offices, there is no accurate count of the number of such cases. "There are lots of different creams out there with different ingredients," Cohn says. "Some companies have been making claims for these products for a number of years. When somebody makes a claim that a product will behave in a certain way and give you certain results, they have to have adequate substantiation for that claim before they can disseminate it They are allowed to say anything that's truthful and not misleading. AT this point I don't know if they do or do not have substantiation." Ralph Bashioum, MD, a Minneapolis ASPRS member who was recently interviewed for a TV news report on thigh slimming creams, voices the feelings of many who have heard about the creams and wondered if they had any value. "The study that has been done doesn't show the cream is actually absorbed in the skin, and it's the only study that's ever been done on this, notes Dr. Bashioum. "I think it warrants further investigation with a significant amount of patients to demonstrate whether this is beneficial or not beneficial."

It is the hydrochloride salt of a phenylpiperidine compound identifiedchemically as (-)-trans-4R-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3S-[(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenoxy)methyl]-piperidinehydrochloride hemihydrate. The molecular weight of paroxetine is 374.8 (329.4as free base). Paroxetine hydrochloride (CAS 61869-08-7) is an odourless, off whitepowder, with a melting point range of 120 to 138C and solubility of 5.4mg/mL in water. Aropax 20 tablets also contain titanium dioxide (white, E171) as colourantand calcium hydrogen phosphate, hypromellose, starch (potato), and magnesiumstearate, polysorbate 80 and macrogols as excipients. Aropax 20 tabletsdo not contain sucrose, lactose, gluten, tartrazine or any other azo dyes. PHARMACOLOGY Paroxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT,serotonin) uptake and its antidepressant action and efficacy in the treatmentof OCD and Panic Disorder is thought to be related to its specific inhibitionof 5-HT uptake in brain neurones. In vitro studies have indicated that, in contrast to tricyclic anti-depressants,paroxetine has little affinity for 1, 2 and -adrenoceptors, dopamine (D2),5-HT1 like, 5-HT2 and histamine (H1) receptors. This lack of interactionwith post-synaptic receptors in vitro is substantiated by invivo studies which demonstrate lack of CNS depressant and hypotensiveproperties. Paroxetine has low affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptorsand animal studies have indicated only weak anticholinergic properties. Because the relative potencies of paroxetine's major metabolites are atmost 1/50 of the parent compound, it is most unlikely that they contributeto paroxetine's therapeutic effect. As with other selective 5-HT uptake inhibitors, paroxetine causes symptomsof excessive 5-HT receptor stimulation when administered to animals previouslygiven monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or tryptophan. Behavioural andEEG studies indicate that paroxetine is weakly activating at doses generallyabove those required to inhibit 5-HT uptake. The activating properties arenot "amphetamine-like" in nature. Paroxetine does not impair psychomotor function and does not potentiatethe depressant effects of ethanol. Animal studies indicate that paroxetine is well tolerated by the cardiovascularsystem, and in healthy subjects paroxetine produces no clinically significantchanges in blood pressure, heart rate and ECG. In the treatment of depressive disorders, Aropax 20 exhibits comparableefficacy to standard antidepressants. There is also some evidence that paroxetinemay be of therapeutic value in patients who have failed to respond to standardtherapy. In general, improvement in patients starts after one week but does not becomesuperior to placebo until the second week of therapy. Aropax 20 is effectivein improving depression and suicidal ideation concurrently during the firstfew weeks of therapy. Morning dosing with paroxetine does not have any detrimental effect on eitherthe quality or duration of sleep. Moreover, patients are likely to experienceimproved sleep as they respond to paroxetine therapy. Where it is clinicalpractice to co-prescribe short-acting hypnotics with antidepressants, noadditional adverse events have been recorded. Aropax 20, in addition to its significant antidepressant effects, can improveassociated symptoms of anxiety. Clinical Trials Relapse prevention of depression *A study of depressed outpatients who had responded to Aropax 20 (HAM Dtotal score <8) during an initial 8-week open-treatment phaseand were then randomised to continuation on Aropax 20 or placebo for 1 yeardemonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate for patients taking Aropax20 (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Obsessive Compulsive Disorder *The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of Obsessive CompulsiveDisorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12 week placebo-controlled studies(Studies 1 and 2). The results of a third placebo-controlled study (study3) support the effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of OCD. *Study 1 was a dose-ranging study which originally consisted of 348 patientswith OCD and compared placebo, 20mg, 40mg or 60mg daily. Of these 348 patients,338 had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation and were includedin the Intent to Treat (ITT) population for efficacy analyses. Paroxetine40mg and 60mg/day were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.001) inthe treatment of OCD as assessed by the primary efficacy variable, meanchange from baseline in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (YBOCS)total score. Significant improvement was noted from week 6 onwards. *Studies 2 and 3 were flexible dose studies comparing paroxetine (20 to60 mg daily) with clomipramine (25 to 250mg daily). In Study 2, conductedin 399 patients, 391 had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluationand were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population for efficacy analyses.Paroxetine was significantly more effective than placebo as assessed bythe primary efficacy variables mean change from baseline in YBOCS totalscore (p=0.002). In addition, the efficacy of paroxetine was comparableto that of clomipramine in this study. In study 3, conducted in 241 patients,232 had at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation and were includedin the Intent to Treat (ITT) population for efficacy analyses. There wasa numerically better response in paroxetine treated patients compared toplacebo in the mean change from baseline in YBOCS total score, the magnitudeof which was comparable to that in study 2, though this did not reach statisticalsignificance. Relapse prevention of OCD *A study of OCD outpatients, who had responded to Aropax 20 during an initial6 month open-treatment phase and were then randomised to continuation onAropax 20 or placebo for 6 months demonstrated a significantly lower relapserate for patients taking Aropax 20 (38%) compared to those on placebo (59%).The risk ratio assessment conducted in this study showed that patients randomisedto placebo were 2.7 times more likely to experience a relapse compared tothose patients who continued on paroxetine treatment (p=0.001). Panic Disorder *The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of Panic Disorder wasdemonstrated in four multicentre, placebo controlled studies of adult outpatients.Patients in all studies had Panic Disorder (DSM III-R) with or without agoraphobia.The studies were conducted over 10-12 weeks. Two of these studies also hadan active comparator (clomipramine or alprazolam) arm. In all four studies,patients received either paroxetine 10-60 mg/day (n=469), clomipramine 10-150mg/day (n=121), alprazolam 1-6mg/day (n=77) or placebo (n=324). These studiesindicated that paroxetine was superior to placebo and comparable with activecomparator. Pharmacokinetics Paroxetine is well absorbed after oral dosing and undergoes first-pass metabolism.As a consequence the amount of paroxetine available to the systemic circulationis less than that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Partial saturationof the first-pass effect and reduced plasma clearance occur as the bodyburden increases, with higher single dosing or on multiple dosing. Thisresults in disproportionate increases in plasma concentrations of paroxetineand hence pharmacokinetic parameters are not constant, resulting in non-linearkinetics. However, the non-linearity is generally small and is confinedto those subjects who achieve low plasma levels at low doses. Paroxetine is distributed throughout the body including the CNS. Approximately95% of the paroxetine present in the plasma is protein bound at therapeuticconcentrations. Paroxetine is extensively metabolised after oral administration. The principalmetabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation,which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate,and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate thatthe metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compoundat inhibiting serotonin uptake. Approximately 64% of the dose is excreted in the urine; urinary excretionof unchanged paroxetine is generally less than 2% of dose. About 36% ofthe dose is excreted in the faeces, probably via the bile; faecal excretionof unchanged paroxetine represents less than 1% of the dose. Thus paroxetineis eliminated almost entirely by metabolism. Metabolite excretion is biphasic,being initially a result of first pass metabolism and subsequently controlledby systemic elimination of paroxetine. The elimination half life is variable but is generally about 1 day. Steadystate systemic levels are attained by 7-14 days after starting treatmentand pharmacokinetics do not appear to change during long-term therapy. Considerablevariation can occur in the plasma concentrations achieved between individuals,possibly due to variable first pass effect and variability in clearance. No correlation has been found between paroxetine plasma concentrations andclinical effect (adverse experiences and efficacy). Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in elderly subjectsand in those subjects with severe renal and hepatic impairment, but therange of plasma concentrations overlaps that of healthy adult subjects. INDICATIONS Aropax 20 is indicated for the treatment of major depression and is effectivein preventing the relapse of depressive symptoms. *Aropax 20 is also indicated for the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorderand the symptomatic treatment of Panic Disorder. CONTRAINDICATIONS Aropax 20 is contraindicated in persons who are known to be hypersensitiveto paroxetine or any of its components (see DESCRIPTION). Concomitant use in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)(see PRECAUTIONS). PRECAUTIONS Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): As with most antidepressants,paroxetine should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or within2 weeks of terminating treatment with MAO inhibitors. Thereafter treatmentshould be initiated cautiously and dosage increased gradually until optimalresponse is reached. MAO inhibitors should not be introduced within 2 weeks of cessation of therapywith paroxetine. Activation of Mania/Hypomania: As with all antidepressants, paroxetineshould be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or hypomania. Oral Anticoagulants: Paroxetine should be administered with greatcaution to patients receiving oral anticoagulants. (see INTERACTIONS) Tryptophan: As adverse experiences have been reported when tryptophanwas administered with another selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, paroxetineshould not be used in combination with tryptophan medication. (see INTERACTIONS) Cardiac Conditions: *The usual precautions should be observed inpatients with cardiac conditions. There is limited experience concerningthe use of paroxetine in patients with recent myocardial infarction or unstableheart disease. Epilepsy: As with other antidepressants, paroxetine should be usedwith caution in patients with epilepsy or history of convulsive disorders. Seizures: Overall the incidence of seizures is <0.15% in patientstreated with paroxetine. The drug should be discontinued in any patientwho develops seizures. ECT: The efficacy and safety of the concurrent use of Aropax20 and ECT have not been studied. Cognitive and Motor Performance: Clinical experience has shown thattherapy with paroxetine is not associated with impairment of cognitive orpsychomotor function. However, as with all psychoactive drugs, patientsshould be cautioned about their ability to drive a car and operate machinery. Alcohol: Although paroxetine does not increase the mental and motorskill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of paroxetine andalcohol in patients is not advised. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility In two year studies conducted in mice and rats, paroxetine had no tumourigeniceffect and no genotoxicity effects were observed in a battery of in vitroand in vivo tests. Impairment of Fertility: Serotonergic compounds are known to affectreproductive function in animals. Impaired reproductive function (ie reducedpregnancy rate, increased pre- and post-implantation losses, decreased viabilityof pups) was found in the reproduction studies in rats at doses of 13mgparoxetine/kg and above. Vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium andatrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrestedspermatogenesis occurred in male rats at doses of 25mg/kg/day in toxicitystudies. Use in Pregnancy (Category B3) Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to43 and 5mg/kg, respectively, have revealed no evidence of teratogenic effects.Studies in rats have shown increased pre- and post-implantation losses anddecreased postnatal survival at dose levels producing maternal toxicity.There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Becauseanimal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Use in Lactation The concentrations of paroxetine detected in the breast milk of lactatingwomen are similar to those in plasma. Neonatal mortality was increased inthe offspring of rats receiving paroxetine 13 and 43mg/kg/day PO duringpregnancy and lactation. The risk to the infant by paroxetine administrationto lactating women is unknown. Breast feeding should be discontinued ifthe use of paroxetine by the mother is thought necessary. Interactions The absorption and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are not affected by foodor antacids. Paroxetine has little or no effect on the pharmacokineticsof a wide range of drugs, including digoxin, propranolol and warfarin. Warfarin A pharmacodynamic interaction between paroxetine and warfarin may exist.This may result in increased bleeding. Paroxetine should therefore be administeredwith great caution to patients receiving oral anticoagulants. Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by theinduction or inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes. For example cimetidine,a known drug metabolising enzyme inhibitor, can increase the bioavailabilityof paroxetine whereas phenytoin, a known drug metabolising enzyme inducer,can decrease it. When paroxetine is to be co-administered with a known drug metabolisingenzyme inhibitor, consideration should be given to using doses at the lowerend of the range. No initial dosage adjustment is considered necessary whenthe drug is to be coadministered with known drug metabolising enzyme inducers.Any subsequent dosage adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerabilityand efficacy). Phenytoin: Co-administration of paroxetine and phenytoin is associatedwith decreased plasma concentrations of paroxetine and increased adverseexperiences. No initial dosage adjustments of paroxetine are considerednecessary when these drugs are co-administered, any subsequent adjustmentsshould be guided by clinical effect. Co-administration of paroxetine withother anticonvulsants may also be associated with an increased incidenceof adverse experiences. Drugs Metabolised by Cytochrome P450IID6 As with other antidepressants, including other SSRIs, paroxetine inhibitsthe specific hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzyme responsible for the metabolismof debrisoquine and sparteine. This may lead to enhanced plasma levels ofthose co-administered drugs which are metabolised by this isoenzyme, althoughthe clinical significance of this observation has not been established. Drugs metabolised by the isoenzyme include certain tricyclic antidepressants(eg. nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine and desipramine), phenothiazineneuroleptics (eg. perphenazine, thioridazine) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics(eg. flecainide). Because the effects of concomitant use of paroxetine with neuroleptics andtricyclic antidepressants have not been studied, co-administration of theseagents with paroxetine should be approached with caution. Procyclidine Daily administration of paroxetine increases significantly the plasma levelsof procyclidine. If anti-cholinergic effects are seen, the dose of procyclidineshould be reduced. Psychotropic Agents A study of the interaction between paroxetine and diazepam showed no alterationin the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine that would warrant changes in thedose of paroxetine for patients receiving both drugs. Experience in a limited number of healthy subjects has shown that paroxetinedoes not increase the sedation and drowsiness associated with haloperidol,amylobarbitone or oxazepam, when given in combination. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: see CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS Tryptophan can be metabolised to serotonin. Therefore, the use ofAropax 20 together with tryptophan may result in adverse reactions includingagitation, restlessness and gastrointestinal distress. (see PRECAUTIONS) Lithium: In a study in depressed patients stabilised on lithium,no pharmacokinetic interaction between paroxetine and lithium was observed.However, since there is little clinical experience, the concurrent administrationof paroxetine and lithium should be undertaken with caution. Alcohol: See PRECAUTIONS ADVERSE EFFECTS Adverse experiences with paroxetine are generally mild in nature and donot affect the patient's life-style. Adverse experiences may decrease inintensity and frequency with continued treatment and do not generally leadto cessation of therapy. *13% of paroxetine (n=2963) treated patients inworldwide short term clinical trials for depression, discontinued treatmentdue to an adverse experience, compared to 5% receiving placebo (n=554).*In addition, 11.8% (64/542) and 9.4% (44/462) of paroxetine patients withdrewfrom worldwide trials in OCD (vs placebo, 21/265, 7.9%) and Panic Disorder(vs placebo, 32/324, 9.9%), respectively. The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetinein clinical trials and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebotreated patients were: nausea, somnolence, sweating, tremor, asthenia, drymouth, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, constipation, diarrhoea,and decreased appetite. Paroxetine is less likely than tricyclic antidepressants to be associatedwith dry mouth, constipation and somnolence. The following adverse events were observed during the clinical trial programmesfor depression, OCD and Panic Disorder. All adverse experiences are includedin the list except those reported in terms so general as to be uninformativeand those experiences for which the drug cause was remote. It should howeverbe noted that causality has not necessarily been established, and that patientsenrolled in the clinical trials may have been generally healthier than thegeneral patient population. Events are listed within body systems and categorised by frequency accordingto the following definitions: common events reported at a frequency of greateror equal to 1/100 patients; uncommon events reported at a frequency of lessthan 1/100 but greater or equal to 1/1,000 patients; rare events reportedat a frequency of less than 1/1,000 patients.

Hyponatraemia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, andin some cases may be associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretichormone secretion (SIADH). The hyponatraemia generally reverses on discontinuationof paroxetine. *Elevation of hepatic enzymes has been reported. Serious liver abnormalitieshave been reported rarely. Discontinuation of paroxetine should be consideredif there is prolonged elevation of liver function test results. Occasional reports of extrapyramidal disorders including oro-facial dystoniahave been received in patients sometimes with underlying movement disordersor who were using neuroleptic medication. *Abnormal bleeding (mostly ecchymosis and purpura) has been reported followingparoxetine treatment. Discontinuation Effects As with many psychoactive medicines, abrupt discontinuation may lead tosymptoms such as dizziness, sensory disturbances, sleep disturbances, tremor,agitation or anxiety, nausea and sweating. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Depression The recommended dose of Aropax 20 is 20mg (1 tablet) daily. Manypatients will respond to a 20mg daily dose. Patients not respondingto a 20 mg dose may benefit from dose increases in 10mg/day increments,up to a maximum of 50mg/day according to the patient's response. It is recommendedthat paroxetine is administered once daily in the morning with food. Thetablet should be swallowed rather than chewed. As with all antidepressant drugs, dosage should be reviewed and adjustedif necessary within 2 to 3 weeks of initiation of therapy and thereafteras judged clinically appropriate. Dose changes should occur at intervalsof at least 1 week. It is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant drug treatmentshould continue for a sufficient period, often for several months. Thereis no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long thepatient treated with paroxetine should remain on it. It is generally agreedthat acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustaineddrug therapy. Whether the dose of an antidepressant needed to induce remissionis identical to the dose needed to maintain or sustain euthymia is unknown. Systematic evaluation of paroxetine hydrochloride has shown that efficacywas maintained for periods up to one year. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder *The recommended dose of Aropax 20 is 40mg (2 tablets) daily. Patients shouldstart on 20mg and the dose can be increased weekly in 10mg increments. Somepatients will benefit from having their dose increased up to a maximum of60mg/day. It is recommended that paroxetine is administered once daily in the morningwith food. The tablet should be swallowed rather than chewed. *Patients with OCD should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure thatthey are free from symptoms. Panic Disorder *The recommended dose is 40mg daily. Patients should be started on 10mg/dayand the dose increased weekly in 10mg increments according to patient'sresponse. Some patients may benefit from having their dose increased upto a maximum of 60mg/day. It is recommended that paroxetine is administeredonce daily in the morning with food. The tablet should be swallowed ratherthan chewed. *A low starting dose and slow dosage increase reduce the risk of an initialtransient increase in anxiety which is generally recognised to occur earlyin the treatment of this disorder. Use in the Elderly Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in elderly subjects,but the range of concentrations overlaps with that observed in younger subjects.Dosing should commence at the adult starting dose and may be increasedup to 40mg daily. Dosing should not exceed 40mg daily. Elderly patients should be initiated and maintained at the lowest dailydosage of paroxetine which is associated with clinical efficacy. Use in Children The use of paroxetine in children is not recommended as safety and efficacyhave not been established in this population. Use in Renal/Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severerenal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) or severe hepaticimpairment. Therefore, dosage should be restricted to the lower end of thedosage range in patients with clinically significant hepatic or renal impairment. Discontinuation of Treatment Discontinuation effects have been noted 1 to 4 days after abrupt cessation.Aropax 20 should not normally be discontinued abruptly. *When Aropax 20is to be discontinued, the dose should be tapered. As with many psychoactivemedicines, abrupt discontinuation may lead to symptoms such as dizziness,sensory disturbances, sleep disturbances, tremor, agitation or anxiety,nausea and sweating. Prolonged Treatment The physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended period should periodicallyre-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. OVERDOSAGE Overdose attempts have been reported with paroxetine (up to 850mg) aloneand in combination with other agents. In cases where paroxetine was usedalone, no deaths have occurred and recovery was medically uneventful. As with all overdose attempts, the possibility of multiple drug ingestionshould be borne in mind. Symptoms Symptoms of overdose with paroxetine include nausea, vomiting, tremor, dilatedpupils, dry mouth and irritability.

The Local Organising Committee has put together a complete programme ofsymposia, scientific sessions, keynote lectures and other workshops to bringtogether the world's most renowned researchers and clinicians. We have workedwith the International Committee and the Scientific Committee to ensurean exciting and valuable scientific programme supported by national andinternational participants. The Conifer system, available on screens throughout the Congress Centre,allows delegates to individually tailor their XXth CINP Congress programme.Category II CME points are also available for US doctors by recording theamount of time spent at the XXth CINP Congress and claiming informal hourson your Annual CME Reporting Form, including the congress name, locationand dates. At the same time the Local Organising Committee has worked to provide alarge range of social and cultural activities that will introduce you toAustralia &shyp; the people, the flora and fauna and the rich diversityof our multicultural nation. Of all our cities, Melbourne provides the bestour country can offer in hospitality, fine food, wine, the arts and sport.Further afield, you may also have the opportunity to sample other wondersof Australia such as the Great Barrier Reef, Central Australia or otherstates. The Local Organising Committee will keep delegates up-to-date via the lateannouncements that will appear on the last page of each issue of this dailynewspaper. Join with us, the members of the Local Organising Committee, the Presidentand officers of the CINP and experience a wonderful Congress and all thebest our country has to offer. Professor Graham Burrows AO, KSJ, MD, FRANZCP Chairman, Local Organising Committee Welcome to the XXth CINP Congress Distinguished guests, dear colleagues, On behalf of the International College of Neuro-Psycho-pharmacology (CINP),I am very pleased to extend a warm welcome to all of the participants inthe XXth CINP Congress. In their wisdom, the founders of CINP made the decisionto hold a scientific congress every 2 years. As a result, the biennial CINPCongress is a very important scientific event in international neuroscienceand neuropsychopharmacology, and an event we all look forward to. This is the first CINP Congress held in this region of the world, and GrahamBurrows and his National and Local Organising Committees have worked hardfor more than 2 years to organise an outstanding Congress in this beautifulcity of Melbourne &shyp; designated as one of the world's most liveablecities. People from "down under" are noted for their openness,warmth and hospitality and Graham and his group have made sure that theorganisation of the XXth Congress, its social events and its venues, are"user friendly" and that a warm and amiable spirit will pervadethis meeting. The most memorable aspects of an international scientific meeting like thisare the social interactions with colleagues &shyp; it is a unique opportunityto make new friends and renew old friendships with scientific colleaguesfrom over 50 different countries throughout the world. I know you will alltake advantage of this unusual opportunity. We take great pride in the scientific programme you will be offered at theXXth CINP Congress. The science conducted by CINP members and their colleaguesis the best of its kind. The general focus of all our research efforts isto improve understanding of the brain's function in health and disease andhow, specifically, psycho-pharmacological medications work in the brainto ameliorate and treat mental and neurological disorders and diseases ofageing. It is fitting that the XIXth CINP Congress in Washington and now the XXthCongress here in Melbourne are held during the Decade of the Brain. TheDecade of the Brain began under the US Federal Government, with a PresidentialProclamation in 1990, during the time I directed the National Instituteof Mental Health. It has now spread to the 11 member nations of the Europeancommunity and Switzerland, as well as to many sovereign nations that arenow in the process of developing their own Decade of the Brain efforts aswell. The goal of a worldwide Decade of the Brain is a foreseeable realityin the future. I am pleased that CINP, beginning with past President GiorgioRacagni, and continuing during my 2 years as President, has played an importantleadership role in the international Decade of the Brain and I am sure thatthe incoming President, Claude de Montigny, will continue this during his2-year tenure. The scientific programme which you will enjoy, learn from and add to asof tomorrow, has been carefully crafted by the International ScientificProgramme Committee to include cutting edge basic and clinical researchthat is highly relevant to the understanding and management of the fullspectrum of brain disorders. It includes over 80 scientific symposia, fivescientific plenary addresses including the Presidential Address, 11 officialsatellite meetings and 472 poster presentations. Great care was taken tohave an appropriate balance between clinical and basic research and to ensurethat, at all times, there is something of interest available for the basicscientist, the clinical scientist and the clinician. We believe that thiswill prove to be a CINP Congress second to none in its science and socialevents &shyp; please enjoy yourself. I look forward to seeing and greetingyou personally during the next 5 days at the XXth CINP Congress. Lewis L Judd, MD, President, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharma-cologicumwill be presenting the inaugural CINP Presidential Address New observationsin the life course of unipolar major depression: risk factors and treatmentgoals in the John Batman Theatre at 0830 today. Lewis L Judd, MD, President, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum Premier Of Victoria welcomes delegates of the XXth CINP Congress It is with great pleasure that I extend a warm and enthusiastic welcometo all delegates of the XXth CINP Congress on behalf of the people of Melbourne&shyp; the world's most liveable city. This internationally significant forum is being held in Australia for thefirst time and we are delighted that Melbourne has been chosen to host sucha prestigious meeting of minds. Not only does this reflect well on our reputation as a centre of excellencein medical research, it is also a vote of confidence in this city's abilityto play host to notable events. While I understand that your focus over the next four days will be on contributingto a greater understanding of the brain's functions and how we can bettertreat mental disorders, I would also urge the many visitors from overseasand interstate to take some time to enjoy the pleasures of Melbourne. We have plenty of sporting and cultural activities, challenging golf courses,beautiful parks and relaxing restaurants on hand to ensure that your mindsremain fresh for these vital deliberations. On behalf of all Victorians I wish you well in your endeavours over thenext four days. Jeff Kennett Lithium, Melbourne and John Cade, AO &shyp; from serendipity to serenity John Cade (1912&shyp;1980) placed lithium and Melbourne on the internationalmap of psychiatry. Despite the fact that lithium use was unpopular in thelate 1940s, he discovered that lithium calmed the "psychotic excitement"of some patients with psychiatric illness. Although the publication of his findings in the Medical Journal of Australiain 1949 created only a ripple in the academic world of the day, he neverthelessfounded the basis of contemporary treatment of bipolar disorders with lithium.From that time, his discoveries led Melbourne psychiatrists to use lithiumroutinely, even though the international community of psychiatrists tooksome time to endorse its use. At the time, lithium was being used as a convenient cation to prevent crystallisationof urate used to test the toxicity of urine from manic patients after beinginjected into rats. John Cade found that lithium urate induced profounddocility in rats during experiments he performed at the now decommissionedRepatriation Mental Hospital in Bundoora in suburban Melbourne. He pursuedhis belief in this observation, and demonstrated that lithium, not urate,was the psychoactive agent. After self-administering without mishap, heproceeded to find that lithium induced a similar effect in patients with"psychotic excitement". Family and friends knew John Cade as a modest and gentle man whose passionfor observing nature flowed into his work as a clinician. He is rememberedas a man who harnessed the power of true observation, and whom Melbournecan thank for its place in the history of psychiatry. The CINP local organising committee wishes to acknowledge Professor EdmondChiu and John Cade's son for assistance with this story. In honour of John Cade's discovery, the John Cade symposium on lithium:Parts 1 and 2 is on Tuesday, 25 June in room B4 at 0830&shyp;1100 and 1330&shyp;1600. HIV-related neuropsychiatric disorders: early diagnosis is the key totreatment Monday symposium: NeuroAIDS I: animal models and mechan-isms, and NeuroAIDSII: diagnosis, neuropathology and emerging treatments. Major depressive disorders affect 20% of HIV-infected patients, accordingto Dr Glenn Treisman from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science,John Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA. The high prevalence of adjustmentdisorders, cognitive impairment, substance-use disorders and mania (8%)reflect the diversity of presentations confounding the diagnosis of neuropsychiatricdisorders of people with HIV infection. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Studyshows a 1.5&shyp;2.0-fold increase in depression as AIDS progresses. AIDSmania may have specific distinguishing characteristics from bipolar mania. Affective disorders associated with HIV respond to traditional pharmacologicalagents, but care is required as HIV-infected patients are extremely sensitiveto side-effects and toxicities and may have altered pharmacodynamics. Diagnosis and early treatment of HIV-related cognitive impairment Dr Bruce Brew from the Department of Neurology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney,reports that AIDS dementia complex (ADC), a subcortical AIDS-related dementia,mainly occurs in advanced HIV disease, and points out that other factorspredict its development (refer to box). ADC responds to zidovudine, althoughhigh doses may be required. Ian Everall from the Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill, London, UK,reports that neuronal loss is limited to the symptomatic stage of diseaseand seems to be related to the viral load in the brain. The pattern of neuronalloss appears to be selective, and the mechanism of this loss is not relatedto direct infection with HIV. While dementia is rare in asymptomatic HIV infection, neuropsychologicalimpairment may occur in as many as one-third of cases, according to Dr IgorGrant from the Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego,USA. This subtle, cognitive impairment has quality-of-life implications&shyp; including a higher likelihood of unemployment &shyp; highlightingthe importance of early diagnosis and treatment. This early impact of HIV on the CNS is reinforced by a preliminary analysisof NMR spectroscopy (NMRS) in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count below20%. George Fein from the University of California and Veteran Affairs MedicalCenter, San Francisco, USA, reports that patients may demonstrate NMRS changeswith low CD4 counts consistent with mild CNS changes before frank neurocognitiveimpairments are present. Floyd Bloom from the Department of Neuropharmacology, the Scripps ResearchInstitute, La Jolla, USA, says that the ability to correlate measurablebehavioural effects with neuropathological abnormalities is an importantfeature of animal models and has been demonstrated to date in murine, feline and simian animal models. The symposium NeuroAIDS I: animal models and mechanisms is in room B7 at 1000&shyp;1230, followed at 1330&shyp;1600 by NeuroAIDS II: diagnosis,neuropathology and emerging treatments in room B7. AIDS dementia complex is associated with: · CD4 count 94&shyp;139/µL · history of diarrhoea · elevated serum neopterin · advanced age · lower IQ · no history of previous anti-retrovirals Clinical Features of AIDS dementia complex : History: · difficulties with concentration · short-term memory loss Examination: · gait unsteadiness · presence of primitive reflexes · impaired tandem gait Dr Bruce Brew Towards a cholinergic model of Alzheimer's disease Monday symposium: Molecular strategies for Alzheimer's: Parts 1 and 2. Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial and has a poorly understoodaetiology, contemporary methods are breaking new ground in the identificationand testing of therapeutic drugs for AD. Dr A Unterbeck from the Institute for Dementia Research, Bayer Corporation,West Haven CT, USA, believes that these new molecular procedures will allowthe identification of agents specifically designed to target AD at the molecularlevel. Unfortunately, research to date has been hampered by the absenceof a suitable animal model and the inability to diagnose AD reliably. Disruption to the central cholinergic system closely approximates the cognitivedecline characteristic of AD, according to Dr Keith Wesnes from CognitiveDrug Research, Beech Hill, Reading, UK. Even though AD patients have pathologicaltissue changes in the CNS, their anterograde episodic memory deficit iswidely accepted to be due to cholinergic &shyp; and therefore chemical &shyp;dysfunction. New evidence from a large multicentre trial demonstrates thatAD patients also have severe attention disorders directly related in magnitudeto disease severity. Comparison of these deficits to cholinergic blockadeis being undertaken in order to identify any potential cholinergic mechanism. In the discussion of muscarinic partial agonists in the symptomatic treatmentof patients with AD, Dr Kumar from SmithKline Beecham Pharm-aceuticals,New Frontiers Science Park, Essex, UK, will detail the novel agent, SB 202026,which possesses functional selectivity at central muscarinic type 1 (M1)receptors, with lower activity at central and peripheral M2 and M3 receptors.SB 202026 induces cognition-enhancing effects in animals at low doses whereside-effects are not problematic and is well tolerated in patients at therapeuticdoses. Muscarinic partial agonists which are selective for M1 receptorsmay soon provide efficacy in patients with AD without the side-effects whichhamper the use of poorly-selective full agonists. Other areas of discussion during the AD sessions will include the role ofamyloid in the aetiology of AD, the role of serotonin in the abnormal, non-cognitivebehaviour of AD patients, and the role of GABA-B receptors in memory formation. The symposium Molecular strategies for Alzheimer's: Parts 1 and 2 is inBellarine 3 today. Part 1 is from 1000&shyp;1230 and Part 2 is from 1330&shyp;1600. What is the best pharmacological treatment following response to ECT? Monday symposium: ECT: advances in basic and clinical research. Dr Harold Sackeim of the New York State Psychiatric Institute presents newdata from multicentre trials examining the use of medication following responseto ECT. "The most common treatment to prevent relapse following response toECT is pharmaco-therapy with antidepressants. We also need to know whethermedication resistance also impacts upon the response to ECT", reportsDr Sackeim. "These issues are of paramount clinical concern." EEGs and ECT Relationships between EEG indices and treatment outcomes may be useful inthe understanding of the neuro-biological mechanisms of action of ECT. DrRichard D Weiner from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science,Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA, attempts tocharacterise these relationships using data from three separate studiesthat include quantitative assessment prior to, and shortly after, an ECTcourse in patients treated for major depression. Does blood pressure always increase after an ECT seizure? An unexpected finding of continuous blood pressure monitoring during ECT,using the new technique of finger cuff plethysmography, is that an increasein blood pressure does not always follow ECT-induced seizures. As ECT isthought to elevate plasma catecholamines initially, resulting in an increasein blood pressure, David Nutt from the Psychopharmacology Unit, School ofMedical Sciences, Bristol, UK, discusses the implications of the effectof ECT on plasma catecholamines. Other topics discussed at this symposium include an increase in the expressionof 5-HT1A receptors after ECT, and an increase in neuropeptide Y levelsfollowing ECT. The symposium ECT: advances in basic and clinical research is in room B4at 1000&shyp;1230 today.

Lithium - contemporary neurobiochemistry of an enigma Tuesday symposium: John Cade symposium on lithium: Parts 1 and 2. During today's John Cade symposium, international speakers are discussingboth the therapeutic use of lithium &shyp; as discovered by Melbourne-bornpsychiatrist John Cade &shyp; and contemporary neurobiochemical insightsinto its mode of action. Gordon Johnson, from the Department of Psychiatry, Australia and RepatriationHospital, University of Sydney, Australia, begins the clinical sessionswith a discussion of the early development of lithium use in Australia,and explores some contemporary issues &shyp; including renal toxicity. Samuel Gershon, from the Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric InstitutionClinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre, Pittsburgh, USA, arguesthat lithium is the most specific therapeutic agent for bipolar disorder.The findings of comparative studies between lithium and valproate, or carbamazepine,are presented by Charles Bowden from the Department of Psychiatry, Universityof Texas Health Science Center, San Antonia, Texas, USA. The effects of alcohol and the therapeutic use of lithium in conjunctionwith anticonvulsant mood stabilisers in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder arediscussed by David Dunner from the Center for Anxiety and Depression, Universityof Washington, Seattle, USA. The final presentation in the morning sessionis by Professor Graf from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa,Ottawa, Canada, who discusses the various benefits of lithium. In the afternoon sessions, Jorge Perez from the Department of NeuropsychiatricSciences, San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy, discusses lithium-relatedcAMP-dependent phosphorylation, and Arne Mork from the Department of Neurobiologyand Pharma-cological Research, Lundbeck A/S, Copenhagen&shyp;Valby, Denmark,advances the case for heterogeneous c-AMP effects of lithium which are relatedto the known variant of adenylyl cyclase (AC). Husseini Manji from the Molecular Pathophysiology Program, Wayne State UniversitySchool of Medicine, Detroit, USA, discusses transmembrane signalling bylithium via AC and phosphokinase-C (PKC) systems. Further PKC-related informationis provided by Robert Lenox from the University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainsville, Florida,USA, who discusses the PKC substrate, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinasesubstrate (MARCKS). Finally, Professor Belmaker from the Division of Psychiatry, Ben GurionUniversity, Beersheva, Israel, argues that regional hippocampal changesin brain inositol caused by chronic lithium exposure are more relevant thanglobal changes. The apparent specificity of lithium for bipolar disorder, and the growingunderstanding of its neurobiochemistry, may soon lead to a true understanding of the pharmacology of lithium and the biochemistry of bipolar disorder. The John Cade symposium on lithium: Parts 1 and 2 is in room B4 at 0830&shyp;1100and 1330&shyp;1600 today. Plasma drug levels - from the laboratory to the clinic Tuesday symposium: The diminishing correlation between drug plasma concentration and effect:fact or fallacy? Some manic patients do not respond to lithium treatment despite having serumlithium levels in the therapeutic range. In today's symposium, Dr TadafumiKato, Department of Psychiatry, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu,Japan, presents results suggesting the response to lithium in manic patientswith bipolar disorder is more closely related to lithium concentration in the brain. Dr Luc Balant from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva, Switzerland,presents an overview of the various study designs that can be used to assessdose-concentration response in clinical psychopharmacology, while Dr LindsayDeVane from the Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of South Carolina,USA, reviews mathematical models that can be used to analyse plasma drugconcentration and response data. Anticonvulsants in mood disorders "Knowledge of anticonvulsant drug interactions is required for optimaltherapeutics when these agents are combined with psychotropics in treatment-resistantaffective illness, or with other non-psychotropic drugs in patients withmedical comorbidity," according to Dr Terence Ketter from the Departmentof Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Stanford University, California,USA. In his presentation, Dr Ketter examines the metabolism, drug interactionsand adverse effects of established anticonvulsants such as carbamazepineand valproate, as well as newer agents including felbamate, lamotrigineand gabapentin. Dr Trevor Norman from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne,Australia, compares and contrasts the pharmacokinetics and potential fordrug interactions as well as the relationship between plasma concentrationand clinical effect of SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) and newerantipsychotic drugs (risperidone, clozapine). The symposium The diminishing correlation between drug plasma concentrationand effect: fact or fallacy? is in room B2 today at 0830&shyp;1100. Increasing importance of EPS in schizophrenia Monday symposium: Advances in the treatment of schizophrenia into the21st Century The term "ESADs" &shyp; an acronym for "extrapyramidal sparingantipsychotic drugs" &shyp; should replace the term "atypical"when referring to antipsychotic drugs with low extrapyramidal side-effects(EPS). This would avoid confusion regarding efficacy, according to symposiumChair Dr David Copolov from the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria,Australia. In a later address, Dr Wolfgang Fleischhacker from the Depart-ment of BiologicalPsychiatry, Innsbruck, Austria, said that the side-effect profiles of novel antipsychotics will become a major factordetermining which antipsychotics are chosen for treatment. Rather than merelyadjusting the dosage or relying on anti-Parkinsonian agents, he said thatnewer drugs with lower EPS, such as clozapine, offer further options formanaging side-effects. Search for side-effects Dr Fleishhacker suggested that close monitoring of side-effects is especiallyimportant for the prophylaxis of EPS. Managing the side-effects of antipsychoticstakes up a large part of the clinical consultation. Active questioning foradverse effects, especially sexual function, is required because many patientswill not volunteer these symptoms. Dr Fleishhacker said that the failure to actively search for the adverseeffects of antipsychotic drugs had resulted in under-reporting of the trueprevalence of EPS.

Predicting the response to SSRI therapy Tuesday symposium: Predictors of response to SSRIs. Obsessive&shyp;compulsive disorder (OCD) responds only to specific serotoninreuptake inhibitors, whereas drugs affecting other neurotransmitter systemsare ineffective, reports Dr Joseph Zohar from the Department of Psychiatry,Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Speaking at this morning's symposium,Predictors of response to SSRIs, Dr Zohar notes that two-thirds of OCD patientstreated with SSRIs respond to the treatment if the dose is high enough andif the treatment duration is long enough. He adds that biological markersmay predict the response to SSRIs in OCD. Dr Donatella Marazziti from the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Pisa,Italy, echoes this view. In her presention she explains that preliminaryfindings suggesting that the use of peripheral markers of serotonergic activity,such as platelet binding sites, may not only be a predictor of a positiveresponse to SSRIs in OCD, but also in major depression. Remissions high with SSRIs Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also effective in the treatment of panicdisorder and agoraphobia, says Dr Giulio Perugi from the Institute of ClinicalPsychiatry, University of Pisa. Reporting preliminary data derived froma naturalistic 2-year follow-up study of 123 panic disorder and agoraphobicoutpatients, he explains that the number of remissions is high (80%), althoughrecurrences (50%) and residual symptoms (45%) are also numerous. Chronicity and temperament Other presentations at the symposium focus on the factors that predict clinicalresponse to pharmacological therapy for depression. "Brief depressions do not apparently respond to anti-depressants whereasthose with a more prolonged duration of around a month or longer do,"notes Professor Stuart Montgomery from the Department of Psychiatry, ImperialCollege of Science, Technology and Medicine, London. Dr Hagop Akiskal from the Department of Psychiatry, University of California,San Diego, USA, puts forward the hypothesis that commonly observed clinicalsubtypes of depression &shyp; double-depression, anxious, bipolar II, pseudo-unipolar,hostile and psychotic &shyp; respond differentially to tricyclic antidepressants,monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, bupropion, lithium, anti-convulsantsand neuroleptics because they arise from diverse temperamental bases. The symposium Predictors of response to SSRIs is at 0830&shyp;1100 todayin room LA. Gestational disturbances implicated in schizophrenia Tuesday symposium: Are there anatomical anomalies in the brains of schizophrenics?Lessons from post-mortem studies. Developmental disturbances during the second trimester of gestation &shyp;possibly due to a reduction in naturally occurring cell death &shyp; mayincrease the number of neurons found in the striatum, according to Dr HelmutBeckmann from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg,Germany. Compared with normal controls, the brains of people with schizophhreniahad a clearly increased striatal volume (i.e. volume density). "Countingstriatal neuron numbers on both sides, we found an increase of neurons,particularly on the right side," says Dr Beckmann. Abnormal neural circuit in schizophrenia The results of a controlled comparison of post-mortem brain sections usingautoradiography and in situ mRNA hybridisation suggests that an abnormalneural circuit may be present in the brains of A/A schizophrenics. Dr Joel Kleinman from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, National Instituteof Mental Health, Washington DC, USA, describes the results of his study,which include alterations in neurotensin reuptake in the entorhinal cortex, reduced mRNA for cholecystokinin, and changes in 5-HT reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. Expression of dopamine receptors affected in schizophrenia Dopaminergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia may be disrupted at thelevel of dopamine receptor expression, according to Dr James Meador-Woodrufffrom the Mental Health Research Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,USA. "Expression of dopamine receptor transcripts are different inschizophrenic brains but in a region-specific fashion, with particular disturbancesin the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe," says Dr Meador-Woodruff. The symposium Are there anatomical anomalies in the brains of schizophrenics?Lessons from post-mortem studies is in room B1 at 1330&shyp;1600 today. 1996 CINP Award winners The winners of the 1996 CINP Awards were presented with their prizes atthe opening ceremony on Sunday.

Professor Arvid Carlsson from the Department of Pharmacology, Universityof Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan, Gothenburg, Sweden, predicted that 1996will mark a neuropsychopharmacological milestone in advancing the therapeuticsof schizophrenia. In his address to delegates at the first plenary sessionof the XXth CINP Congress, Professor Carlsson described the modulatory effectson the dopaminergic system of new substances (-)3PPP and MDL100907, andhypothesised that, following clinical trials, these and similar agents mayhave the capacity to markedly improve the management of schizophrenia. "Subcortical monoaminergic systems are kept under strict glutaminergiccontrol," said Professor Carlsson as he examined the hypothesis ofglutaminergic inhibition of dopaminergic systems. A lack of these inhibitoryeffects could result in increased dopaminergic activity, possibly resultingin psychosis in a subgroup of people with schizophrenia. As monoaminergic systems respond to a variety of stresses, glutaminergicdeficiencies could exaggerate overall responses in neural circuits, producinginstabilities without any changes in dopaminergic neural tone. Experimental evidence indicates that glutaminergic deficiency enhances behaviouralstimulation induced by 5-HT2 agonists, mixed dopaminergic agonists, alpha-adrenergicagonists and muscarinic antagonists. Novel therapeutic approaches to schizophreniacould utilise these pathways. "If glutaminergic deficiency is important, therapy should aim at stabilisingglutaminergic activities," said Professor Carlsson. He discussed promisingexperimental results achieved with the 5HT2a receptor antagonist MDL100907and the partial dopamine agonist (-)3PPP, both of which are currently undergoing clinical testing. The plenary Chair, Professor Brian Leonard from The Department of Pharmacology,University College, Galway, Ireland, said that he looked forward to thepresentation of this clinical testing at the XXIst CINP Congress in Glasgowin 1998. Treating mood disorders in women - special issues Tuesday symposia: Pharmacotherapy of affective disorders in women: Parts1 and 2. The serotonergic system is more vulnerable to dysregulation in females thanmales, which may help to explain the higher incidence of mood disorders in women, accordingto Professor Meir Steiner from McMaster University, Ontario, Canada. "The serotonergic system is in a very close reciprocal relationshipwith the gonadal hormones, and a disturbance in the interaction betweenthe hypothalmic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the serotonergic cascade maybe of particular relevance to mood disorders in women," said ProfessorSteiner. Complex pharmacological issues in pregnancy and lactation "The use of psychotropic medications during pregnancy and lactationis a complex clinical issue laden with ethical concerns and handicappedby limited data," said Dr Zachary Stowe from the Department of Psychiatryand Behavioural Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta,USA. Dr Stowe was reviewing the pharmacokinetics of psychotropic medicationsin these special situations, and also discussed recent data suggesting thatinfants exposed to sertraline via breast milk do not suffer any adverseeffects. No direct effect on mood from progesterone Exogenous progesterone does not appear to affect mood in premenstrual womendirectly, but the remission of symptoms achieved by suppressing ovulationsuggests indirect involvement of the gonadal hormones. According to Dr EllenFreeman from the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia,USA, antidepressants "effectively improve the mood and behaviouralsymptoms of PMS, but whether the effect is specific to the serotonergicsystem is not yet identified". Dysthymic women may respond better to SSRIs "Women with chronic milder depressions - such as dysthymia - may havea higher response rate to serotonin reuptake inhibitors" (SSRIs) thanmen. Dr Kimberly Yonkers from the University of Texas Southwestern MedicalCenter, Dallas, USA, presented data showing that, although women are morelikely to respond to active treatment with either sertraline or imipramine,they are also more likely to discontinue treatment. Hormones and antidepressants act synergistically Synergy between the interactions of hormones and antidepressant drugs atserotonin receptor subtypes can be exploited to tailor effective antidepressantregimens for women with mood disorders that are unresponsive to antidepressantmonotherapy, according to Dr Stephen Stahl from the Department of Psychiatry,University of California, San Diego, USA. CINP President's report: 1994-1996 Lewis L Judd, MD, President, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum, 1994-1996 I am pleased to report to the membership of the Collegium InternationaleNeuro-Psycho-pharmacoligicum (CINP) on the events and accomplishments ofthe CINP during the past two years (1994-1996). My presidency began at thevery successful XIXth CINP Congress in Washington, DC, with the presentationat the opening ceremony attended by the US Vice-President's wife, TipperGore. The highlight of the Congress was the scientific programme, whichproved to be the largest and best in CINP history with over 160 scientificsymposia presented to the almost 5000 delegates from 62 countries. In June 1995, the CINP Regional Meeting was held in Vienna and Prague andadopted the theme, Neuroscience and neuropsychopharmacology East and Westat the beginning of the European Decade of the Brain. This meeting was designedto promote collaboration between basic and clinical scientists from Eastern,Central and Western Europe, and was attended by more than 500 delegatesrepresenting every European nation. A monograph of the proceedings willbe published shortly and sent to all CINP members. On 25 February 1996, a CINP Satellite Meeting, Comparison of CNS mechanismsof action and therapeutic uses of the new antidepressants was held in LaJolla, California. This was followed by the 1996 CINP President's Workshop,Unipolar major depression: one primary disease or multiple discrete relateddisorders and subtypes? Implications for the lifecourse and management ofunipolar disorders. The workshop featured presentations and discussionsby world leaders in regard to mood disorders. The proceedings will be publishedas a special issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders with the CINP Presidentas Guest Editor. In addition to outreach initiatives to Eastern and Central Europe, the CINPstrengthened its ties and support to Latin America by encouraging and consultingwith our colleagues in their establishment of the Latin American Collegeof NeuroPsychopharmacology. The CINP provided regular consultation in neuropsychopharmacology and neuroscienceto the Division of Mental Health of the WHO, as well as providing leadershipin the development of the Decade of the Brain efforts in various interestednations. My two years as CINP President will culminate both in the publication ofthe history of CINP and the running of the XXth CINP Congress in Melbourne.This has proven to be a very successful CINP Congress - noted for its friendlyambience and superb science. In summary, it has been a busy, productive time for CINP during the pasttwo years, one in which the CINP has experienced significant growth and accomplished a greatdeal. The CINP Executive Committee, the Council and I are looking forwardto supporting the programme of our next President, Claude de Montigny. "Chemical coding": a new model for neurotransmission? Tuesday symposium: Neuropeptides and their receptors The traditional model of neurotransmission - the release of a singletransmitter to act on a small population of receptors - has been dramaticallyoverturned by recent research, according to Professor John Furness, Headof the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Melbourne,Australia. Work since the late 1980s has led to the development of the "chemicalcoding" hypothesis of neurotransmission, in which neurons release multiplebioactive substances that produce a variety of pharmacological and physiologicalconsequences. In contrast to earlier models, it has been found that most neurons containand release up to eight bioactive substances. This process is known as co-transmission. Professor Furness said that there is no shortage of potential substancesto be released. "There are now more than 100 peptides known in theCNS," he explained, "but the question is: how many of them areneurotransmitters?" While many peptides are released from neurons, they may not function specificallyas transmitters. Some do act directly at receptors, but others affect messagetransduction via non-receptor mechanisms, act as "third messengers"to provide feedback within the neuron, or have no apparent function at all. Combinations of transmitters constitute a chemical code The variety of neuronal combinations of these co-transmitters has led tothe rethinking of neuronal function. "The extensive co-localisationof neurotransmitters has led to the 'chemical coding' hypothesis,"explained Professor Furness. "Neurons contain specific groupings ofbioactive substances which constitute a code, and this code is transmittedwhen the neurons release their mixture of co-transmitters," he said. Adding to the complexity of neurotransmission is the increased knowledgeof receptor subtypes provided by molecular biology. Professor Furness saidthat "many peptide receptors have been cloned in the last few years,and it has been found that they are more varied than one might think."For every transmitter or ligand there may be five or more receptors, althoughmany newly cloned "orphan receptors" presently have no known endogenousligand. The enormous number of possible interactions - and physiological and psychiatricconsequences - of ligand-receptor combinations in the CNS will provide fertileground for research for decades to come. More information needed before marijuana legalisation considered Monday CINP special session: The marijuana debate. More research is needed on the effects of marijuana on the brain, a specialCINP debate concluded. The debate followed the Victorian Parliament's recentdecision not to legalise the possession of small quantities of the drugfor personal use. Heavy use of marijuana, in parts of the world where it is part of the localculture, is known to affect the brain, but little is known about the effectsof occasional use. "More data on the neuropharmacological effects of marijuana are neededbefore an informed decision concerning any change of legal status can bemade," said Professor Bruce Singh from the Department of Psychiatry,University of Melbourne, Australia. Those in favour of legalisation of marijuana insist that the drug is nomore dangerous than alcohol. "I would be sceptical of any analogy betweenalcohol and marijuana," warned Dr Fred Goodwin, former Director (1988-1992)of the US Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration. "Drinkingtwo alcoholic drinks per day is safe and even health promoting, but fewpeople would argue that daily users of marijuana do not suffer psychologicaleffects." Alcohol is metabolised quickly, whereas marijuana stays in the body for4 days. The drug builds up in the body and its effects are therefore escalatedin daily users. Marijuana exacerbates schizophrenia and affective disorders. However, heavyalcohol abuse has only rarely been associated with schizophrenia, said DrGoodwin. Dr Goodwin said that the attitude to marijuana use in the United Stateswas that legalisation would be counterproductive. "We would be presentinga double message by saying this drug is legal but don't use it," DrGoodwin explained. "Legislation seemed to make the 'don't do' messagehypocritical." On the other hand, experience in The Netherlands indicates that decriminalisationof marijuana does not increase its use, and decriminalisation has the benefitof not "marginalising the many youngsters who take the drug by makingthem criminals," said Dr Goodwin. More than half of Year 11 students were estimated to have used marijuanain Australia last year, and it was believed that it would be easier to educatethem about drug use if marijuana was legalised. "It was thought tobe inappropriate to educate youngsters about a substance that is illegal,"said Professor Singh. "Drug education requires drug legalisation." Study throws doubt on PTSD hypothesis Tuesday symposium: Post-traumatic stress disorder. A Melbourne study's failed attempt to replicate the results of previousstudies raises a question mark over the role of enhanced negative feedbackinhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD). Previous studies show lower basal cortisol levels in traumatised patientswith PTSD compared with those of traumatised individuals who do not developPTSD and other psychiatric patients. PTSD sufferers also show an enhancedsuppression of cortisol following dexamethasone administration. "We expected similar results to previous studies and were surprisedwhen we didn't get them," said Dr Mal Hopwood from the University ofMelbourne, Australia. "There was no difference in the cortisol responsebetween the Vietnam veterans with past, present or no history of PTSD." It is unlikely that the fact that the normal controls in the Melbourne studywere veterans could have influenced the results. Professor Philip Morrisfrom the University of Melbourne, Australia, said: "The post-dexamethasonecortisol values are in the same ball park as those of non-veteran controlsin other studies." Nevertheless, combat experience is an issue that Dr Hopwood wants to discount."We are presently negotiating with the police force to set up anotherstudy with age-matched controls who have not had PTSD," he said. It was suggested that the criteria for recruitment into the study were lessstringent than in other studies, particularly US studies. Dr Hopwood argued:"Hamilton ratings for depression of around 20 have been used as normalin other studies, and our ratings were much lower at around 12." Further evidence that stress-related depression is linked to corticosteroidand monaminergic mechanisms Wednesday symposium: Stress, hypersecretion of corticosteroids, monaminergicdisturbance: a trias operational in the occurrence of depression? Explaining the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of stress and vulnerabilityto depression may help crystallise new therapeutic approaches to the treatment,prevention and recurrence of affective disorders, according to Dr RobertPost from the Biological Psychiatry Branch, National Institute of MentalHealth, Bethesda, USA. At this morning's symposium he is presenting furtherevidence for postulated acute biochemical changes of stress and affectivedisorders that effect longer term changes at the level of gene expression Implications for the treatment of affective disorders Dr Herman Van Praag from the Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology,University of Limburg, The Netherlands, postulates that stress-related corticosteroidhypersecretion in a biologically compromised 5-HT1A patient would inducefaster down-regulation of the 5-HT1A system. This would cause a rise in the level of anxiety and anger, and finally resultin major depression. This would be likely to occur in a patient with a personalitydisorder who deals inappropriately with stress. In this situation, Dr Van Praag predicts that effective treatment wouldrequire a 5-HT1A-agonist and psychological intervention aimed at increasingresistance to stress. Abnormal corticosteroid secretion impairs 5-HT responses and cognitivefunction Changes in cortisol secretion or 5-HT-receptor deficits impair 5-HT responses,and cognitive functions become impaired during hyper- or hypocortisolismor in the case of receptor deficits, reports E Ronald de Kloet from theDivision of Medical Pharmacology, Leiden University, The Netherlands. Animalexperiments have shown that a negative event in early life, such as maternaldeprivation, results in cortisol receptor resistance, increasing vulnerabilityto depression. Florian Holsboer from the Max Planck Institutes of Psychiatry, ClinicalInstitute, Munich, Germany, says that normal corticosteroid receptor functionis a precondition of successful treatment in depression. If alterationsin the hypothalamic-pituitary axis persist after antidepressant treatment,a poor treatment outcome is more likely. These, and further presentations, add to the growing body of evidence relatingto the biochemical and endocrinological mechanisms of the impact of exogenousstress on the development of affective disorders, and highlight future directionsfor research and treatments. The symposium Stress, hypersecretion of corticosteroids, monaminergic disturbance:a trias operational in the occurrence of depression? is at 0830-1100 inOtway 2 today. Information relating closely to this session is presented at the symposiumStress vulnerability and depression at 0830-1100 in room B2 tomorrow (seebelow). Conference announcement: Second World Congress on Stress 25-29 October 1998, Melbourne, Australia The Second World Congress on Stress builds on the success of the First WorldCongress in New York, and continues to consolidate the relationship betweenclinicians and basic scientists who are endeavouring to elucidate the underlyingbiological mechanisms of stress and increasing the understanding of themanagement of stress-related conditions. The understanding of the clinical impact of biochemical, physiological andendocrine mechanisms of stress has advanced considerably since Hans Selye'sdiscovery in 1945 that the release of adrenal cortical hormones followinga stressful incident initiates a cascade of events with widespread effectson multiple body systems. While psychological factors play an important role in almost every medicalcondition, stress, combined with constitutional or genetic vulnerabilities,may alter the course of a wide variety of common medical and psychiatricconditions, resulting in a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes. The Second World Congress on Stress extends a special invitation to cliniciansfrom all backgrounds. Medical specialists (cardiologists, dermatologists,endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, neurologists,oncologists, respiratory physicians and rheumatologists) as well as psychiatristsand psychologists will benefit from an increased understanding of how stress-relatedphysiological responses exacerbate or delay recovery from the course ofa general medical illness. The Second World Congress on Stress highlights the epidemiology, basic science,natural history and management of stress and how this impacts on a varietyof disciplines and specialties. From the laboratory to the clinic, the interfaceand exchange among experts from diverse backgrounds promises to providea stimulating and innovative conference.

Tuesday symposium: Suicide. Almost 90% of young people who successfully complete suicide have no historyof previous suicide attempts, according to a study presented to the symposiumby Professor Graham Burrows, AO, KSJ, from the Austin Repatriation Hospitaland Professor John Tiller from the Royal Melbourne Hospital, both from theUniversity of Melbourne, Australia. Professor Burrows presented the results of the retrospective arm of thestudy of completed suicides of young people in the State of Victoria, Australia.He said that the youth suicide rate has tripled since the 1950s withouta corresponding rise in the suicide rates of other age groups. Young menaged 20-24 years are particularly vulnerable. The method of suicide was linked with access to the corresponding means.Young people in rural areas were more likely to use firearms, while jumpingfrom tall buildings occurred mainly in city areas. The results of the prospective study, presented by Professor Tiller, confirmedthe findings of the retrospective study, but allowed a comparison betweencompleted suicides and attempted suicides in young people aged 15-24 years.Males comprised a high proportion (86%) of completed suicides, while 62%of attempted suicides were female. In both completed and attempted suicides,females were more likely to attempt suicide by drug overdose or self-laceration,while men used more lethal methods such as hanging, firearms and carbonmonoxide poisoning. Professor Tiller said that effective targeting of youth suicide preventionprogrammes need to recognise that those whose suicide attempts were unsuccessfuloften sought help prior to suicide, while failure to seek help was highlyassociated with completed suicides. Therefore programmes that concentrateonly on improving mental health services may fail to detect some young peopleat high risk of suicide. Raising community awareness of the need to recognisepotential suicide attempts in young people may be necessary.

Dr Post says that three main factors affect vulnerability to affective disorders- heredity, stressors and previous episodes. He explains that two main typesof neurobiological changes are observed during affective disorders - theyare either part of the pathophysiological process or are secondary adaptationsto counter these processes. "The balance between these factors accountsfor the suppression or recurrence of depression," Dr Post says. "Wethink these principles also hold for bipolar depression, where imbalancescan lead to a depressive state or, in the opposite direction, can predisposethe patient to a manic episode," he adds. Reducing the initial stressor response through early treatment - whetherin the form of psychotherapy, social support, drugs or other therapies -is important. Dr Post discusses promising research into new therapeuticapproaches during his plenary lecture. Dr Robert Post's plenary lecture is from 1130-1230 in the John Batman theatretoday. New president for CINP: Dr Claude de Montigny Dr Claude de Montigny, Professor of Psychiatry, Pharmacology and Neuroscienceat McGill University, Montreal, Canada, and Director of the NeurobiologicalPsychiatry Unit of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University beginshis term as President of CINP at the XXth CINP Congress. Dr de Montigny received his MD at the University of Montreal, Canada, andobtained his PhD in Neuroscience from the Neuroscience Research Center ofthe University of Montreal. He trained in psychiatry at McGill and completedpostdoctorate training at Yale University as a centennial fellow of theMedical Research Council of Canada. Dr de Montigny's research interestshave focused on the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments andof lithium. His research is subsidised by the Canadian Medical ResearchCouncil (1978-2001) and the Fonds de la Recherche en Santé du Québec(1987-1998). Recipient of 1995 Selo Prize Dr de Montigny was the sole recipient of the Selo prize awarded by the NationalAlliance for Research into Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders in 1995.The nomination was based on the seminal work of Dr de Montigny and his team,unveiling the adaptive neuronal mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effectof antidepressant treatment, as well as the discovery of a novel therapeuticapproach for major depression resistant to antidepressant treatment. Growing role for cholecystokinin Thursday symposium: Cholecystokinin in anxiety. Systemic administration of a tetrapeptide derived from cholecystokinin (CCK-4)has been shown to induce anxiety in healthy human volunteers, patients withpanic disorder, and different animal species, including the mouse, rat,cat, sheep and monkey. In this morning's symposium Dr Roberta Palmour fromthe Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, describesevidence for a dose-related, CCK-agonist-mediated increase in anxiety-relatedbehaviours in primates. Dr Jacques Bradwejn from the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Toronto, Canada,discusses CCK-B agonists and panic induction in humans, and factors thatmay enhance or antagonise this response. Data supporting the hypothesisthat CCK may play an important role in human anxiety states is also presentedby Dr Robert Lydiard from the Medical University of South Carolina, Charlston,USA. Tools of the trade CCK receptor agonists and antagonists are important tools for understandingthe possible roles of CCK as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in thecentral nervous system. Dr Eero Vasar from the Department of Physiology,University of Tartu, Estonia, examines the effect of CCK agonist and antagonistadministration on the exploratory and locomotor activity of rodents, andrelates these findings to human studies. In another presentation at this morning's symposium, Dr Bernard Roques fromthe Departement de Pharmacochimie Moleculaire et Structurale, UniversiteRene Descartes, Paris, France, presents pharmacological data and behaviouralevidence to lend support for the existence of CCK-B receptor subtypes. The symposium Cholecystokinin in anxiety is in room B1 at 0830-1100 today. New forum to promote mental health issues in the Asia-Pacific region Regional meeting report: Agenda for mental health in the Asia-Pacificregion to the year 2000 Effective collaboration to meet the contrasting mental health needs of differentcountries throughout the Asia-Pacific region is the key aim of a new forumestablished at a regional meeting last Saturday. The meeting, held at the University of Melbourne Business School, was attendedby 35 people from eight countries in the region, including representativesfrom the World Psychiatry Association (WPA), delegates from the XXth CINPCongress in Melbourne and psychiatrists from Australia and New Zealand.The Department of Psychiatry, the University of Melbourne, will providethe Secretariat for the forum. Professor Bruce Singh from the Department of Psychiatry, the Universityof Melbourne, Australia, who coordinated Saturday's meeting, said that ahost of issues faced psychiatry "as the entire range of industrialand economic levels of development are represented in the Asia-Pacific region.The mental health needs of a small Pacific island are very different tothose of, for example, mainland China." Professor Singh said that the new forum aims to establish collaborativelinks between mental health services, research institutes and educationalinstitutions. These links will: · support the development of national mental health policies · increase awareness of fellowship training · increase greater awareness of mental health in the Asia-Pacific region. Proceedings of the meeting will be sent to all who attended as well as relevantorganisations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The next meeting of the forum will be held at the WPA Regional Meeting ofPsychiatry in Beijing, China, in 1997.

Paroxetine is emerging as the first drug of choice for treating panic disorder,according to speakers at Tuesday's satellite meeting. Only three drugs are approved for the treatment of panic disorder - alprazolam,clomipramine and paroxetine. Alprazolam and clomipramine have been usedfor several years, and paroxetine has recently been licensed. The search for an effective treatment for panic disorder began with tricyclics,MAOIs, and then benzodiazepines. "It was then recognised that the SSRIswere a better treatment," says Professor Graham Burrows from the Departmentof Psychiatry, Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia. "A few years ago there was a feeling that SSRIs were the drugs to use,despite the fact there was almost no controlled data in the literature,"said Professor James Ballenger from the Department of Psychiatry and BehaviouralSciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charlston, USA. "However,there is now short- and even long-term data published supporting this." Multiple trials demonstrate efficacy A 12-week study found that paroxetine combined with cognitive therapy atleast halved the number of panic attacks experienced by 85% of patientscompared with 51% of those receiving placebo combined with cognitive therapy."Paroxetine in combination with cognitive therapy is significantlybetter than placebo, and patients on paroxetine in other studies where cognitivetherapy was not part of the treatment still did well," Professor Ballengercontinued. The study found that paroxetine is significantly more effective, bettertolerated and associated with fewer side-effects than clomipramine. At theend of 12-weeks treatment, 51% of paroxetine patients and 37% of clomipraminepatients were free of panic attacks compared with 32% of patients on placebo.Improvement in the paroxetine group also began earlier. "Paroxetineworked faster than clomipramine," Professor Ballenger said, "andit is also better tolerated". Extension of the paroxetine versus clomipramine study to one year showedthat paroxetine continued to prevent panic attacks. Randomisation to placebo of some of the patients in the study revealed thatrelapse is an issue if treatment is not continued. Only 5% of patients whocontinued to take paroxetine experienced a relapse compared with 30% ofthose switched to placebo. "You need to stay on the medication to staywell," Professor Ballenger explained. Better tolerated, fewer drop-outs Overall, fewer adverse effects were experienced by patients on paroxetinecompared with those on clomipramine, and the incidence decreased as treatmentcontinued. Adverse effects were responsible for treatment withdrawal in14.9% of patients on clomipramine, 7.3% of patients on paroxetine and 11.4%of patients in the placebo group. "The most drop-outs were in the clomipramine group. There were fewerdrop-outs in the paroxetine group than in the placebo group," saidProfessor Ballenger. Low doses may not be enough It is important to use the correct dose of paroxetine for panic disorder,and the dosage may need to be higher than that required for the treatmentof depression. "The optimal dose is 40mg. If you use less than 40 mgand patients are not doing very well, the dose should be raised," recommended Professor Ballenger. Panic is a highly comorbid condition Tuesday satellite meeting: Panic and depression: not all SSRIs are thesame. The majority of patients with panic disorder have co-existent symptomatologyof another psychiatric disease, delegates attending Tuesday.'s satellitemeeting were told. Only 20-30% of patients have pure uncomplicated panicdisorder. Panic disorder is associated with agoraphobia in 60% of patients, depressionin 30% of patients and other anxiety disorders in 20% of patients. "The substantial overlap of symptoms in anxiety and depressive disorderscan present diagnosis and treatment dilemmas for the clinician," explainedProfessor Julien Mendlewicz from the Hôpital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium. The lifetime occurrence of major depression in patients with panic disorderis 30-50%. "In many cases the depressive symptoms may appear afterthe anxiety symptoms, but in a number of patients major depression can precedethe onset of panic disorder or occur simultaneously," he continued. Patients who have panic disorder and depression may have more severe symptomsand a greater functional impairment. "This can create additional challengesfor treatment," Professor Mendlewicz said. The seriousness of complicated panic disorder is evident when the incidenceof attempted suicides is examined. Between 20% and 29% of patients withpanic disorder and depression attempt suicide, compared with 13% of patientswith depression only and 5-7% of patients with panic disorder alone. Reawakening interest in neurosurgery for mental disorders Thursday symposium: Neurosurgery for mental disorders in the Decadeof the Brain: current ethical, clinical and scientific issues. "With the recognition that some patients with affective, obsessionalor anxiety disorders prove refractory even to extensive and intensive treatmentefforts and remain extremely disabled, interest in neurosurgery for mentaldisorders (NMD) has reawakened," says Professor Per Mindus from theDepartment of Psychiatry, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Today'ssession on NMD - chaired by Professor Mindus - promises to be a lively updateon "psychiatry's most strikingly brain-centred and controversial treatmentmodality." Consider neurosurgery in OCD non-responders Neurosurgery should be considered in a select group of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), particularly those who are "non-respondersand those whose quality of life, due to impairment caused by the disorder,is extremely poor," explains Dr Joseph Zohar from the Division of Psychiatry,Chaim Sheba Medical Centre, Tel-Hashoner, Israel. "About 10-20% ofOCD patients are refractory to all pharmacological, behavioural and familyintervention," says Dr Zohar. What does the future of psychosurgical procedures hold? "More selective and reversible methods of modifying prefrontal cortex(PFC) function, coupled with advances in functional brain imaging, are likelyto replace current psychosurgical procedures," according to Dr LaurieGeffen from the Psychiatry Department, University of Queensland, Brisbane,Australia. Dr Geffen is presenting a paper this morning on the functionalneuroanatomy of the PFC. Dr Geffen predicts that methods such as transmagneticstimulation and receptor-specific drugs will be increasingly used. NMD - "small but important" role "NMD has a small but important place in the management of severe psychiatricdisorders," says Dr Perminder Sachdev from the Neuropsychiatric Institute,Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Although there is no consensuson the duration of illness before NMD should be used, two years for depressionand five years for OCD is likely to be appropriate, adds Dr Sachdev. The symposium Neurosurgery for mental disorders in the decade of the brain:current ethical, clinical and scientific issues is in room B5 at 1330-1600today. Quitting smoking may trigger relapse of major depression Thursday symposium: Ferno symposium on nicotine. Individuals with a history of depression who quit smoking may have theirillness return, says Dr Alexander Glassman from the College of Physiciansand Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA. In Dr Glassman's studyof 300 smokers, almost 20% who had a history of depression experienced about of major depression after they successfully ceased smoking. "Thequestion becomes whether depressive symptoms are transient like other withdrawalsymptoms, or whether smoking cessation can lead to serious or prolongedepisodes of major depression," observes Dr Glassman. Cerebral blood flow changes in nicotine withdrawal The irritability and inability to concentrate experienced by people attemptingto give up smoking may be partly due to changes in the regional cerebralblood flow (rCBF). Dr Martin Ingvar from the Department of Clinical Neuroscience,Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, this morning is presenting the resultsof a study of habitual smokers who performed a cognitive task (perceptualmaze test) while abstaining from smoking. "Specific rCBF increaseswere observed during abstinence compared with during nicotine infusion,"summarises Dr Ingvar. Dopamine release may contribute to nicotine dependence in schizophrenia Behavioural sensitisation after chronic nicotine treatment in rats is accompaniedby enhanced dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, which is similarto the effect of atypical, but not typical, antipsychotic drugs, accordingto Dr Torgny Svensson from the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology,Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. "This phenomenon may contributeto nicotine dependence in schizophrenia," says Dr Svensson. The Ferno symposium on nicotine is in room B3 at 1330-1600 today. New evidence for familial transmission of anxiety disorder comorbidwith alcoholism Wednesday symposium: Genetics and alcoholism. Comorbid disorders should be examined in patients when trying to elucidatethe complex mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholism, accordingto Dr Kathleen Merikangas from Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,USA. In a study of 1,053 first degree relatives of 224 probands selectedfrom both clinical settings and the community, Dr Merikangas found thatalcoholism was associated with anxiety disorders, and that the transmissionof alcohol dependence was much greater than that of alcohol abuse. Alcoholismassociated with anxiety disorders was higher among female relatives, whilethe transmission of alcohol dependence was higher among male relatives. Self-medication in alcoholism co-morbid with social phobia While social phobia and alcoholism were transmitted independently, therewas evidence of links between panic disorder and alcoholism. Dr Merikangas'findings support a self-medication hypothesis for alcoholism comorbid withsocial phobia. Panic may either precipitate the development of alcoholismor alcoholism could potentiate the expression of panic in susceptible individuals. Welcome from Glasgow - host to the XXIst CINP Congress The XXIst CINP Congress will be held from 12-16 July 1998 in Glasgow, thegateway to one of the most beautiful countries in the world. The natural grandeur and historic splendour of "Glaschu" (thedear green place) and its surrounds will superbly complement the high qualityscientific content of the CINP Congress. In particular the XXIst CINP Congress welcomes new, young researchers intothe world of CINP. Working with the theme The Young Delegate, conferenceorganisers have designed an all inclusive conference package for young investigators.Psychopharmacologists who will be under 40 years of age in January 1998can enter The Glasgow Young Psychopharmacologists Competition. Finalistswill receive a package to attend the Congress and the winner will receivethe major financial prize of $5,000. In accordance with views expressed at previous congresses, the number ofparallel sessions has been reduced to approximately 60. A series of PrimaryCare/Psychiatry symposia and Latest Research symposia have also been introducedto the Congress proceedings. These will have a late registration date becauseof their innovative nature. The XXIst CINP Congress promises to be one of the best yet, so make it adate at CINP Glasgow in 1998.

The organiser, Professor Graham Burrows, said today: "This congress,the 20th held by CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum),is a major event. It is the biggest medical conference to be held in Melbournein recent times. "But the congress's greatest importance is the contribution it willmake to the understanding of health problems that cost Australia billionsof dollars a year. "The congress's agenda includes all areas of mental health and disorder.These range from alcoholism and Alzheimer's disease to the latest techniqueof 'imaging' the human brain; from new ways of treating stress to studiesof the physiological and psychological effects of drugs used in the fightagainst AIDS." The congress will be held at the World Congress Centre from 23 to 27 June.It will be opened by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett. Professor Burrows, who is head of the department of psychiatry at MelbourneUniversity/Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, estimated that the congresswould bring $12 million into Victoria, mainly through spending on accommodationand entertainment. "The congress is held every two years, and getting it for Melbournewas rather like tendering for the Olympic Games," he said. "Atany one time between six and 10 countries are lining themselves up as hosts. "My first bid 10 years ago for the congress, failed, but I succeededin 1988. Since then a core group of eight of us at Melbourne Universityand the Austin have been working with increasing intensity to ensure thesuccess of the congress." Professor Burrows said the CINP, founded in 1957, was a professional organisationthat imposed a rigorous selection procedure on membership. It was open onlyto psychiatrists and other specialists who had made a significant contributionto neuro-psychopharmacology. Of the many thousands of psychiatrists in the world, only about 1500 hadbeen accepted by the CINP. Australia had 40 members, a comparatively highfigure that reflected its international standing in neuro-psychopharmacology. "This area of psychiatry is concerned with the whole spectrum of biological, psychological and sociological studies of mental disorders in which medicationplays a major role," Professor Burrows said. "That is why the congress is not confined to CINP members. Invitationsto attend have been accepted by pharmacologists, physiologists, researchscientists, social workers and clinicians, including doctors in severaldisciplines such as cardiology." Professor Burrows said information from lectures and discussions at thecongress would be widely distributed by media reports and through the publicationof lectures and seminars and the use of videos and CD-ROM. The congress will be followed by a two-day conference, also at the WorldCongress Centre, on the treatment of depression disorders. The second day(29 June) - dealing with the community's response to the needs of thosewith disorders and their carers - will be open free to the public.

Reporters and other media people are welcome to attend all the lectures,forums, symposiums and other formal sessions of the congress. Although much of the information at these sessions is highly topical, itwill be presented in technical terms. The media may find it more convenient and rewarding to gain newsy materialfor stories and feature articles and programs through interviews with someof the 4000 psychiatrists and other medical experts attending the congressfrom all around the world. Interview opportunities will be provided throughout the congress. Many of those attending the congress are international leaders in theirfields. They have agreed to talk to the media about their research and findingsand issues arising from their work. THEIR expertise includes such areas as: *advances in the treatment of abuse of marijuana, alcohol, nicotineand other drugs; *the social cost (health services, loss of employment etc) of depression,schizophrenia and other mental disorders; *Alzheimer's disease; *violence (in its individual manifestations and broader social effects -eg, community trauma from bushfires and the Port Arthur massacre); *phobias and anxiety disorders; *eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia); *gender differences in the incidence of mental disorders; *mental health problems arising from HIV infection (AIDS); *advances in ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) and brain surgery as treatmentsfor mental disorders. *brain imaging (including PET - positron emission tomography) FROM 12.30 to 1.30pm on Monday 24 June (the first "working day"of the congress) there will be a symposium on drugs, including marijuanadepression, a neuro-psychopharmalogical view. The symposium will be held in the John Batman Theatre at the World CongressCentre and will be chaired by Professor Bruce Singh, head of the departmentof psychiatry, Melbourne University, Royal Melbourne Hospital. Immediately after the symposium some of those who took part will give amedia conference. Among the panel of national and international experts expected to attendwill be Professor Fred Goodwin, director of the Centre on Neuroscience,Behaviour and Society, Washington, DC, and a former director of the NationalInstitutes of Mental Health, the top US federal advisory agency on drugs. ALSO on Monday at 4pm in the Press Room there will be a media conferenceon AIDS. This conference will provide information about the physiological and psychologicaleffects of drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and discuss the individualand community costs and problems associated with caring for HIV-positivepeople. Congress experts who maybe available for interview will include ProfessorIgor Grant, department of psychiatry, University of California, San Diego;Dr Bruce Brew, Sydney University/St Vincent's Hospital; Dr Floyd Bloom,Scripps Institute, San Diego; and Professor Mario Maj, Milan University. MEDIA conferences and interviews on other days will be held at 4pm in thePress Room located on the 2nd floor. Congress experts will be attending formal sessions throughout the day, and4pm is the most convenient time for them to make themselves available. Butevery effort will be made to fit in with members of the media who have specialrequirements because of deadlines. Topics to be discussed at daily media conferences and interviews on Tuesday25 June, Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th are set out below. Each afternoon a media release will be issued. It will confirm the topicsto be discussed at the next day's media conference and list the expertswho will attend the conference and be available for interviews. TOPICS TUESDAY: Many topics including alzheimer's disease; phobias; compulsivebehaviour; eating disorders; gambling; post-natal depression; alcoholism;gender differences in mental health (why some disorders, though not apparentlyhormonally related, are more prevalent among women or among men); alternativesto drug therapy in the treatment of mental health problems such as panicattacks and anxiety disorders. WEDNESDAY: Many topics including schizophrenia and depression. These arethe two most common of the more serious mental disorders. Schizophrenia, with its associated thought disorder delusions and hallucinations,often affects people at the potentially most productive times of life. Itmakes ordinary day-to-day living impossible for some sufferers, is expensivein terms of social disruption and often leads to suicide, especially amongstudents and other young people. Similar problems are associated with depression. What new medications are available? What is the role of ECT (electro-convulsivetherapy)? THURSDAY: Many topics including violence in society; the treatment of traumavictims (eg, affected by the Vietnam War, bushfires or such occurrencesas the Port Arthur massacre); brain surgery to the understanding of humandisorders; the relationship between aggression and neurochemical abnormalities;genetic/hereditary propensity towards violence.

He was speaking as more than 4000 psychiatrists and other medical expertsarrived for the 20th congress of the CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacolgicum),which will be officially opened at 8.15am tomorrow (Monday 24 June) by thePremier, Mr Jeffrey Kennett, in the World Congress Centre. Professor Burrows, head of the department of psychiatry at Melbourne University/Austinand Repatriation Medical Centre, chaired a committee that spent eight yearsarranging for the congress to be held here. "This congress is the major forum for the area of treatment -- in particular,the biology, pharmacology, sociology and psychology of psychiatric disorders,"Professor Burrows said. "The importance of the congress, which is held every two years, isthat it gathers psychiatrists and experts from other disciplines from allaround the world so that we can learn from each other and share the latestdevelopments." Among highlights of tomorrow's (Monday's) congress sessions will be a mediaconference (in the centre's press room at 1.30pm) on drugs, including marijuanadepression, and another media conference (press room, 4pm) on AIDS. The conference will end on Thursday. At 4pm each day there will be a mediaconference at which some of the specialists attending the conference willdiscuss the latest developments in psychiatry. Every effort will be made to fit in with members of the media who have specialinterview requirements because of deadlines.

Professor Singh said afterwards: "The central issue is whether marijuanais so toxic to the brain, or is so related to precipitating mental disorders,that we should or should not decriminalise it. "My personal view is that we should move cautiously towards partialdecriminalisation. "If it is illegal, it's hard to mount an appropriate education campaignabout how people already using it should do so. They need to know what isalready known. "But we still have much to learn about its possible role in causingmental disorders or in triggering mental disorders in people predisposedto them."

The symposium was chaired by Professor Bruce Singh, head of the departmentof psychiatry, Melbourne University/Royal Melbourne Hospital. Differing views were expressed, but several times speakers made the pointthat similar data was open to various interpretations. The American experience was outlined by Professor Fred Goodwin, directorof the Centre of Neuroscience, Medical Progress and Society, WashingtonDC, and a former Director of the National Institutes of Mental Health andthe Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration in the US. He saidevidence showed that marijuana was a toxic substance. THC, the major component,attached itself to the brain and stayed there indefinitely. Professor Goodwin said because of this it was false to make an analogy betweenalcohol and marijuana. Alcohol was metabolised completely and was not ofthe same nature as marijuana. Professor Jorge Costa e Silva [repeat Costa e Silva], director of mentalhealth and prevention of substance abuse for the World Health Organisation,highlighted the international problems of dealing with marijuana, nicotineand other addictive substances. There was general opinion in favour of preventing the use of them, but theissue of criminalisation and legalisation was subject to a variety of political,social, and economic pressures. Professor Costa e Silva said there was a planned WHO meeting later thisyear, at which experts from a number of countries would evaluate the researchdata and based on this would make a final report and recommendations onan approach to member countries. Professor Singh said there was general consensus at the symposium that tomake the occasional use of marijuana, particularly by the young, a crimeneeded to be looked at more closely. The danger of labelling these people criminals was far greater than thedanger of occasional marijuana use. The issue of chronic severe use was reported from a Columbia University,New York, study that showed a mental deterioration in the marijuana-smokinggroup compared with a group of non-smokers. The smoking group had a decreasein motivation, drive, volition and productivity on a number of neuro-psychologicalparameters. Professor Graham Burrows, a member of the Addiction Research Institute andhead of psychiatry at Melbourne University/Austin and Repatriation MedicalCentre, said the Victorian Government should be given credit for its stanceagainst decriminalisation until further research is completed and welcomesthe funds provided for a strong education and research program. But, he added, the scientific study of drug use needed greater elaboration,including the development of methodology to measure the effects of marijuana. A MEDIA conference will be held in the Press Room (2nd floor, World CongressCentre) at 4pm tomorrow (Tuesday, 25 June). Topics to be discussed at the conference include Alzheimer's disease; phobias;compulsive behaviour; eating disorders; depression; post-natal depression;alcoholism; gender differences in mental health (why some disorders, thoughnot apparently hormonally related, are more prevalent among women or amongmen); alternatives to drug therapy in the treatment of mental health problemssuch as panic attacks and anxiety disorders. Those taking part in the conference will include Dr Phillippe Robert, theMemory Centre (department of psychiatry), Nice University; Dr Murray Stein,the University of California at San Diego; Dr Carol Nadelson, professorof psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and president of the American PsychiatricPress; Professor James Ballenger; Professor Colin Masters, head of the pathologydepartment, Melbourne University; Dr Keith Wesnes; Dr Zachary Stowe, schoolof medicine, Emory University, USA; Professor Uriel Halbreich, State Universityof New York at Buffalo; Professor Lorraine Dennerstein; Dr Ellen Freeman,Pennsylvania University medical centre.

"There has been a tendency to take some women's symptoms and complaintsless seriously and assume they are hormonally related," she said. "Most medical research, including psychiatry, has been on white males.They were seen as the models out of which you could extrapolate to the generalcommunity, regardless of gender, racial group or other factors. "But we don't know how much is accounted for biologically or hormonally,or how much is the result of psycho-social and other factors. "For instance, there is a higher instance of major depression amongwomen than among men (a ratio of 5.7 to 2.7), but it is not explained byany one factor, hormonal or otherwise." Dr Nadelson, who is attending the World Congress of CINP (Collegium InternationaleNeuro-Psychopharmacologicum), is professor of psychiatry at Harvard MedicalSchool and president of the American Psychiatric Press. "Over the past decade there has been an attempt to establish the effectsof gender and other differences," she said. "In the United States it is now mandatory, in seeking renewal of medicalresearch grants, to use both female and male subjects or to specify whynot." She said examples where gender differences needed particular study wereschizophrenia (which tended to occur earlier in men than in women), alcoholism(despite their higher tolerance, men greatly outnumbered women) and eatingdisorders (men were sometimes overlooked because the disorder was far morecommon in women).

"This view is still regarded by some psychiatrists as old-fashionedand even politically incorrect because it seems to put less importance onself-esteem and an individual's ability to control his or her behaviour,"he said. "But there are signs that it is coming back into favour withgreat force as a subject for research." The view was related to the nature/nurture, or heredity/environment, debate,and was leading to a closer study of the interaction between genetics andlife experience. Dr Plotsky is professor of psychiatry and director of the stress/neurobiologylaboratory at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. He is attending the CINP(Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum) World Congress inMelbourne. Research throughout the world had shown that a disturbed childhood couldseriously damage a person's ability to deal with the trauma of being involvedin the Vietnam War, the Port Arthur massacre or the Holocaust, or even anunstable marriage or a traffic accident. Dr Plotsky said ethical considerations still placed a strong barrier againstestablishing how far people's behaviour might be pre-determined by theirgenetic inheritance.

Tests were being conducted in Italy, Canada and New Zealand to discoverwhether this addiction could be corrected with drugs. Professor Bandecchi is director of the Neurosciences Institute, Arezzo University,Italy. He is attending the World Congress of CINP (Collegium InternationaleNeuro-Psychopharmacologicum). Social pressures alone could not explain why some girls and women riskedstarving themselves to death (anorexia nervosa) or indulged in binge-eatingfollowed by forced vomiting (bulimia). Fashion magazines and other media encouraged excessive thinness, but anorexiahad been prevalent long before the existence of the mass media -- in medievalItaly, for example. Studies of anorexic and bulimic girls showed changes in the brain that indicatedaddictive pleasure was derived from abnormal eating habits. This was similarto the biochemical effects on the brain of extreme exertion by athletesand joggers. Professor Bandecchi said he had no explanation for the trend, especiallysince World War II, for some girls to starve themselves into a shape thatwas the complete opposite of what most men found sexually desirable. It was possible that the studies of brain changes related to the eatinghabits of hibernating animals might reveal genetic factors behind anorexiaand bulimia. Professor Bandecchi said anorexia was the only known disease that suffererscould use to kill themselves. It affected one per cent of the population,and three per cent of its sufferers died. It disrupted family life to such an extent that a man in Italy had recentlykilled his anorexic daughter.

Dr Copolov, director of the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria,is attending the World Congress of CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum)in Melbourne. Schizophrenia, which affects one per cent of the population, is one of themost common mental disorders. Until recently it had been possible to test only a few chemical compoundsin a month, Dr Copolov said. New screening techniques now made possibleto test tens of thousands. Drugs were being developed that had the same efficacy as current drugs intreating schizophrenia, but had fewer side effects, especially those causingstiffness and tremor, and -- perhaps the most distressing -- inner restlessness. Dr Copolov said: "The big question is: Will the new drugs have veryuseful effects on treatment-resistant people (about a third of patients)? "That will be determined only after very extensive studies, and soit's too early to say whether they will have superior efficacy. "Drugs must always be harnessed with psycho-social treatments, becausethese treatments help people with the skills of daily living and inter-personalrelationships."

Students will initially spend time with the cat, primarily indoors,learning techniques that will maximize the feline's pleasure. Some of thetechniques covered will be brushing the cat, scratching the ears, hairremoval, and monitoring feline responses such as purring and meowing.Mid-semester, students will be introduced cat toys such as the catnipmouse on an elastic string and how to make ordinary household objects intocat toys such as bottle caps, paper clips, rubber bands, twist ties andthat plastic string thing that you take off when you open a can ofconcentrated frozen orange juice. Some students may pursue study inspecial topics such taking the cat outdoors, restricting the cat whenentering and leaving, and being bitten and chased by the cat. This classis open to all student with an priority given to young attractive singlewomen. bwhitmor@uiuc.edu / leonard6@uxa.cso.uiuc.eduWT02-B08-115IA003-000026-B016-330http://robot0.ge.uiuc.edu:80/~whitmore/thesis.ideas.html 128.174.127.217 19961231234356 text/html 8836HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Tuesday, 31-Dec-96 23:46:29 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html  thesis.ideas 148 THINGS (NOT) TO DO OR SAY AT OR FOR YOUR THESIS DEFENSE      Written by Master Peter Dutton	contributions by Jim Lalopoulos, Alison Berube, and Jeff Cohen,	Patricia Whitson and a few others.1) "Ladies and Gentlemen, please rise for the singing of our National	Anthem..."2) Charge 25 cents a cup for coffee.3) "Charge the mound" when a professor beans you with a high fast question.4) Describe parts of your thesis using interpretive dance.5) "Musical accompaniment provided by..."6) Stage your own death/suicide.7) Lead the specators in a Wave.8) Have a sing-a-long.9) "You call THAT a question?

You can use this as a study guide for the exam on October 3rd. Systems feedback, system, plant, compensator, sensor, actuator, input, reference input, output,disturbance, transfer function, linearity, superposition, block diagram. Laplace Transforms Laplace Transforms, complex numbers, complex plane, real and imaginary parts, s-plane,magnitude and phase angle,unit impulse, unit step, impulse response, step response, transfer function, Final Value Theorem, differential equation, initial conditions, residue, partial fraction expansion, poles and zeros, convolution. Modeling modeling, circuits, Kirchoff's Laws, Laplace Transform, operational amplifier, impedance,mechanical system, electrical systems, dc-servo motor, linearization of nonlinear systems. It is important that you understand what a simple block diagram means,what information the impulse response and the step response give you andhow to compute them. You will need to know how to derive the equationsfor simple electrical and mechanical systems and to derive the transferfunctions relating inputs and outputs. There will be no Matlabquestions, nor will you have to memorize Laplace Transform pairs. Youwill be given a short table of Laplace Transforms. In addition you areallowed a single page of notes.WT02-B08-127IA003-000025-B016-164http://robot0.ge.uiuc.edu:80/~spong/ge222/clist2.html 128.174.127.217 19961231232045 text/html 1860HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Tuesday, 31-Dec-96 23:23:20 GMTServer: NCSA/1.3MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/html GE 222 Checklist for Exam Number 2 Checklist for Exam Number 2 The following is a list of the important keywords and conceptsfor Exam number 2.

Lausunto esitellään26.11.1996 CCFP'lle (Consultative Committee for Fusion Programme,Euroopan fuusio-ohjelmaa valvova edustuksellinen komitea). CCFP'njäsenet (Suomesta Seppo Hannus, TEKES, ja Seppo Karttunen,VTT) esittelevät asian maidensa hallituksille. Asia käsitellaanEU'n ministerineuvostossa ensimmäisen kerran jo joulukuussa1996. Huhut kertovat, että arviointi on fuusiolle erittäinmyönteinen.  ITER'in sijoituspaikka - Eurooppakilpailee   Vieläkesällä näytti selvältä, että Eurooppaluopuu suosiolla ITER'in rakennuspaikasta. Mutta sen jälkeenmielipiteet ovat kääntyneet. Tärkeintä olihavainto, että jos ITER rakennetaan Japaniin, niin (1) EU'ntähänastiset investoinnit fuusioteknologiaan hyödyttävätpaljon japanilaisia ja vain vähän eurooppalaisia ja(2) reaktori rakennetaan japanilaisten lisenssiviranomaisten valvonnassa,jolloin eurooppalaiset saavat toimituksia vain japanilaisten ehdoilla.Euroopan kannalta siedettävä ratkaisu olisi reaktorinrakentaminen Kanadaan. Silloin eurooppalaisella teollisuudellaja tutkimusyhteisöllä olisi tasavertaiset mahdollisuudetJapanin kanssa. Italia on tarjoamassa rakennuspaikkaa etelä-Italiaan.Odotettavissa on, että myös Ranska tarjoaa rakennuspaikkaaMarseille'n lähelle.  ITER EDA Detail Design Report - loppuraportinkonsepti valmistunut   ITER EDA'n tuloksena on reaktorin suunnitteluaineisto:Full Design Report.

Its replacement cost of $50M is estimated from the contract price of the similar size heliac TJ-II at presentunder construction in Spain.  JAPAN  In Japan JAERI, the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, has emphasized the following: (1) completion of the construction of the HighTemperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), which aims at the utilization of high temperaturethermal energy (nearly 1000) produced by nuclear energy, with the first criticality in 1997, (2) theresearch and development of a nuclear fusion reactor, which is expected to be an inexhaustibleenergy source, and the participation in the Engineering Design Activities for the InternationalThermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Project, (3) the promotion of neutron science research,which is expected to make breakthroughs in basic science, applied science and nuclear energy, andcharged particle research (mainly ion irradiation research) and the promotion for the most advancedbasic research in the nuclear field by reserchers from both Japan and abroad, (4) the construction ofthe large synchrotron radiation (SR) facility (SPring-8) to be completed in 1997, in cooperation withthe Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), to promote research through theutilization of ultrahigh brilliance Synchrotron radiation.   Germany  The fusion research being conducted at Max-Planck-Institut f�r Plasmaphysik (IPP) in Garching is aimed at reproducing on earth the energyproduction process occurring on the sun. The research activities of IPP are concerned with investigating the plasma physics principles underlying a fusion reactor: confinement ofhigh-temperature hydrogen plasmas in magnetic fields, heating and refuelling of plasmas, plasma diagnostics, magnetic field technology,electrical and electronic engineering, data acquisition and processing, systems studies, plasma theory and plasma-wall interaction. For thispurpose IPP is conducting two large-scale experiments at Garching, the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak and the WENDELSTEIN 7-AS stellarator. Asuccessor to the present stellarator experiment, WENDELSTEIN 7-X, which is intended to demonstrate the reactor relevance of the stellaratorconcept developed at IPP, is under preparation.   Sweden  The aim of the Swedish Research Unit (RU) is to take part in the EURATOM fusion research programme for the development of thermonuclearfusion based on magnetic confinement for power production. The activities of the Swedish RU are organised into a General Programme and aTechnology Programme. The work is distributed among several Universities: the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Chalmers University ofTechnology (CTH), Uppsala University (UU) and Lund University (LU) as well as at the Studsvik AB Research Centre. A major part of the research in Sweden is carried out by groups at Universities. The General Programme of the Swedish Association includes both experimental and theoretical work involving both the reversed-field pinch(RFP) and tokamak configurations. The programme for the Division of Fusion Plasma Physics at the Alfv�n Laboratory primarily is concentrated to the following areas: EXTRAP T2, based at KTH, has preferential support (45%) in the European programme. The device is primarily operated in the RFPconfiguration which is an approach to fusion where the main advantage is the potential for producing fusion plasmas with lower magnetic fieldrequirements. In addition there is special emphasis in the experimental programme in the areas of plasma surface interaction and spectroscopy, by groups atKTH and LU.There is a Fusion Theory group at the Division which concentrates on the tokamak concept.  The UK contribution  The UK contributes to fusion research in two ways: through the UK's own programme and through our contribution to the Joint European Torus (JET) project which is Euratom's flagship experiment. JET is situated at Culham next to our own laboratory. Key features of the UK fusion research programme are: COMPASS-D, a medium-sized tokamak which is highly adaptable and specifically designed to address the problems of magnetic confinement, having the same magnetic geometry as JET and the Next Step device, ITER. START - Small Tight-Aspect Ratio Tokamak - operational at Culham since early 1991. This 'baby' tokamak was the first high temperature spherical tokamak in the world and remains the leading experiment of its kind. MAST - Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak - START's bigger brother (approximately twice as big), now under construction at Culham. The Joint European Torus (JET) - The UK programme contributes to JET by providing many of the staff (about half) and by agreements to undertake specific projects. Much of the early work on fusion in UK was undertaken by universities, before being centered at Harwell and Aldermaston. The original large-scale experimental fusion device on which British physicists worked during the 1940s and 50s was housed in a hangar at Harwell.

It is the reaction in which two atoms of hydrogen combine together, or fuse, to form an atom of helium. In the process some of the mass of the hydrogen is converted into energy. The easiest fusion reaction to make happen is combining deuterium (or "heavy hydrogen") with tritium (or "heavy-heavy hydrogen") to make helium and a neutron. Deuterium is plentifully available in ordinary water. Tritium can be produced by combining the fusion neutron with the light metal lithium. Thus fusion has the potential to be a source of energy. To make fusion happen, the atoms of hydrogen must be heated to very high temperatures (100 million degrees). The sun and stars do this by gravity. More practical approaches on earth are magnetic confinement, where a strong magnetic field holds the ionized atoms together while they are heated by microwaves or other energy sources. Another is inertial confinement, where a tiny pellet of frozen hydrogen is compressed and heated by an intense energy beam, such as a laser, so quickly that fusion occurs before the atoms can fly apart. We may get an energy source that is virtually inexhaustible. One out of every 6500 atoms of hydrogen inordinary water is deuterium, giving a gallon of water the energy content of 300 gallons of gasoline. Fusion is also environmentallyfriendly, producing no combustion products or greenhouse gases. While fusion is a nuclear process, the products of the fusion reaction(helium and a neutron) are not radioactive, and with proper design a fusion power plant would be passively safe. Design studies show thatelectricity from fusion could be about the same cost as present day sources. Scientists have sought to make fusion work on earth for over 40 years. While fusion sounds simple, the details are difficult and exacting. Heating and confining hydrogen plasmas at 100 million degrees is a significant challenge. Both magnetic and inertial fusion programs expect to build their next experiments that will reach ignition and produce more energy than they consume shortly after the year 2000. Commercial application should be possible providing humankind a safe, clean,inexhaustible energy source for the future. In appreciation.

All fusion related research in Finland is included in the FFUSION programme and it made it possible to establish a dialogue with the European Fusion Programme already two years before Finland joined the European Union. The process led to the founding of the Finnish Association Euratom-TEKES in early 1995. The activities of the Research Unit of the Association Euratom-TEKES are organized into the Fusion Physics Programme and the Technology Programme. The Physics Programme is carried out at the Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), and the University of Helsinki (UH). The Technology Programme is carried out at VTT, HUT and Tampere University of Technology (TUT) in close collaboration with Finnish Industry. Finnfusion project promotes collaboration between Finnish industry and research institutes to develop and provide industrial applications for fusion technology. Finnfusion is part of national FFUSION programme, which carries out scientific and technological research in support of the European Fusion Programme and the international ITER project. Finnfusion project is managed and organized by PrizzTech Oy.

T�st� seuraisi automaattisesti, ett� ITER'i� ei rakenneta Euroopaan. ITER'i� ei my�sk��n rakenneta Amerikkaan eik� Ven�j�lle. Molemmat ovat kielt�ytyneet is�nnyydest�. Japanin tarjous on sensijaan hyvin vahva: Japani maksaa 70% ITER'in rakentamiskustannuksista, jos reaktori rakennetaan Japaniin. Jos ITER rakennetaan Japaniin, Euroopan osuus on 10-20%, eli vain noin 1-2 miljardi USD. EU'n toimitukset rajoittuisivat erikoistekniikkaan: magneetteja, suprajohteita, vaativia vaipparakenteita, kauko-ohjattua huoltoa, kuumennussysteemej� sek� mittaustekniikkaa. T�m� tietysti olisi pettymys Euroopan teollisuudelle, joka mielell��n olisi ottanut p��vastuun koereaktorin rakentamisesta ja toimittanut kaikkea ydinvoimalaitoksen tarvitsemaa tekniikkaa. Evaluation panel  Kuten my�s vuonna 1990, EU on j�lleen nimitt�nyt korkeatasoisen ryhm�n arvioimaan fuusio-ohjelmaa.

Jos raportti on positiivinen, eli jos sanotaan, ett� fuusion kehitt�minen on v�ltt�m�t�nt� ja ett� ohjemaa on hoidettu hyvin, niin silloin on hyv�t mahdollisuudet saada paljon rahaa EU'n viidenteen puiteohjelmaan. EU'n painopisteet ITER EDA -ohjelmassa ITER'in suunnitteluvaihe p��ttyy kahden vuoden kuluttua, hein�kuussa 1998. EU panostaa erikoisesti kolmeen osaprojektiin: - Toroidal Field Model Coil, yhden koemagneetin valmistus ja kokeilu - Blanket Development, yhden vaippamodulin kehitt�minen ja koestus - Divertor Maintenance, ns. divertor -modulien kauko-ohjattu vaihtaminen ja huolto.   Magneetti -projektissa EU on tehnyt 18 MECU'n sopimuksen teollisuuden kanssa. Blanket -projektissa on tarkoitus tehd� noin 6-8 teollisuussopimusta yhteens� noin 9 MECU'n arvosta.

Kun Ruotsi, It�valta ja Suomi liittyiv�t EU'hun vuonna 1995, p��tettiin 'short list' avata uusia j�senmaita varten. Asia kuitenkin lykk��ntyi vuodella ja t�ll�in uusintahaku oli avoin kaikille j�senmaille. Nyt prosessi on l�hes valmis lukuun ottamatta julkistamista. Kolme suomalaista yritysryhm�� hyv�ksyt��n uudelle 'short listalle': - Outokumpu Superconductors Oy (suprajohteet) - The Finnish Blanket Group (vaippa ja divertor -rakenteet) - The Finnish Remote Handling Group (kauko-ohjattu huolto)   Uudella 'short listalla' on noin 70 yrityst� tai yritysryhm��. FTSC-I pvm 19.7.1996  Fusion Technology Steering Committee - Implementation -ryhm�n kokouksessa 19.7.1996 hyv�ksyttiin uusia ATT -teht�vi� 4667 kECU'n arvosta (ATT = Association Technology Task, EU maksaa kustannuksista 25%).

Työryhmän työ kohdistuu ITER'in rakentamiseen:lisenssiointi, kustannukset ja niiden jako, sijoituspaikka-asiat,rahoitus jne.  Colombon raportti 1990 - uusi raportti vuoden kuluttua  Vuonna 1990 teki korkeatasoinen eurooppalainen työryhmäprof.

Siinä esitettiin, että fuusioenergiankehittäminen on ihmiskunnalle ja Euroopalle tärkeätäja että EU'n pitää siihen panostaa. Tämänraportin perusteella EU on panostanut fuusioon ja on ollut vahvastimukana ITER -ohjelmassa.  Ensi syksynä koottaneen uusi korkeatasoinen työryhmäpohtimaan samaa asiaa uudestaan.

Työryhmäntuloksellä lienee suuri vaikutus EU'n tutkimus- ja kehitysohjelmaanseuraavan 10 vuoden aikana - ja myös siihen, rakennetaankoITER vai ei.  EU'n viides puiteohjelma  ITER'in rakentamisen kannalta on EU'n viides puiteohjelma varsintärkeä. Sen valmistelu alkaa syksyllä 1996. Neljännessäpuiteohjelmassa (1994-98) fuusion osuus oli 840 MECU eli 38% energiaohjelmastaja 7% koko DGXII -ohjelmasta.

Blanket Development Programme. Teollisuudelta tilataan erilaisia koekappaleita yhteens� noin 9 MECU'n arvosta - ohjelman mukaan jo vuonna 1996. Materiaalit ovat kupari ja ter�s, liitostekniikkana on ensisijaisesti HIP (Hot Isostatic Pressing) ja kilpailijana r�j�ytysliitostekniikka. Remote Handling -alueella EU'n vastuulla on ns. Divertor Maintenance Test Facility. Teollisuudelta tilataan kauko-ohjattuja siirtimi� noin 4 MECU arvosta sek� lis�ksi muita laitteita noin 1 MECU arvosta - ohjelman mukaan jo vuoden 1996 alussa. Tilaukset teollisuudelta ITER -ohjelmassa (1) Tavallinen tekniikka: vapaa kilpailu (2) Fusion Specific Technology: nk. System of Qualification eli er��nlainen short list. T�m� piti uusia t�m�n vuoden kev��ll� uusien j�senmaiden takia. Uusiminen on siirtynyt vuodella ensi kev��seen (syyn� hidas byrokratia Brysseliss�). Ennen uusimista Suomi ja It�valta saavat kukin esitt�� yhden firman jokaiseen kyselyyn. (3) Suunnittelu: tilaukset vain EFET -konsortiolta, jolla on asiasta puitesopimus EU'n kanssa. EFET'in j�seni� ovat Siemens (Saksa), Framatome (Ranska), Belgatom (Belgia), NNC (Iso-Britannia), CITIF (Italia), IBERTEF (Espanja). Imatran Voima Oy on tehnyt sopimuksen liittymisest��n EFET -konsortioon. Samalla on sovittu, ett� EU voi tehd� suunnittelutilauksia EFET'in l�pi Imatran Voima Oy'lt�. Viewing -systeemin kehitt�minen tulossa Suomeen Viewing -systeemi on pitk� tanko, joka ty�nnet��n ylh��lt� ITER -koneen sis��n. Tangon l�pi kulkee 160 000 optista kuitua. Kuituryhmien p��ss� on optiikka, joka vastaanottaa laservaloheijastuksen pienest� kohdasta ensisein��. Systeemi on varsin monipuolinen: lasertekniikkaa, optiikkaa, l�pivientitekniikkaa, hienomekaniikkaa ja tietojenk�sittely�. Ensimm�inen koelaite asennetaan JET -koneeseen (JET = Joint European Torus, maailman suurin fuusiolaite t�ll� hetkell�, sijaitsee Englannissa). Alustavasti on sovittu, ett� kehitysty� tehd��n Suomessa Imatran Voima Oy'n, VTT'n ja TKK Automaatiolaboratorion toimesta. ICRF Vacuum Transmission Line: Dielectric Window Development ICRF = Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency on er�s plasman kuumennusmenetelm�. Teho vied��n koneen sis��n siirtolinjaa pitkin, jonka ehk� kriittisin osa on l�pivienti-ikkuna. Alustavasti on sovittu, ett� ikkunan kehitysty� tehd��n Suomessa VTT Energian, VTT Valmistustekniikan, Imatran Voima Oy'n ja TKK Teknillisen fysiikan toimesta. Blanket -koekappaleiden tarjoaminen T�h�n on sovittu seuraava konsortio: Outokumpu Poricopper Oy, Rauma Materials Technology Oy, High Speed Technology Oy, Imatran Voima Oy sek� VTT Valmistustekniikka ja TKK Materiaalitekniikka. Varsinaisen tarjouksen antaa se yritys, jolle asia parhaiten sopii. Ensimm�isen koekappaletarjouksen antanee Rauma Materials Technology Oy. Budjetti on noin 1 MECU. Yhteens� tarjouspyynt�j� tulee noin 9 MECU arvosta vuonna 1996. Remote Handling -tarjousten antaminen My�s t�h�n on sovittu konsortio: Plustech Oy, Imatran Voima Oy, Hytar Oy, Tehdasmallit Oy, PI-Rauma Oy sek� TKK Automaatiotekniikka, TKK S��t�tekniikka ja TTKK Hydrauliikka ja Automatiikka. Tarjouksen kauko-ohjatuista siirtimist� antaa Plustech Oy, budjetti on noin 4 MECU. Arto Timperi NET-ryhm��n 15.11.1995 NET -ryhm� koordinoi ja johtaa EU'n toimintaa ITER -projektissa. Ryhm�ss� on 27 nk. ammattilaista sek� 21 tukihenkil�a (atk, CAD, sihteerit, ym). Ryhm� on jaettu seitsem��n teknologia-alueseen (ks. sivu 1). Arto Timperi ty�skentelee Remote Handling -ryhm�ss� yhdess� David Maisonnier'in kanssa. Sopimusaika on kaksi vuotta, sopimusosapuolina lis�ksi EU, TEKES ja Plustech Oy. NET -ryhm�n toinen suomalainen, Pertti Pale, hoitaa EU'n ITER -ohjelman toimintasuunnittelua. Rauno Rintamaa FTSC-I -komiteaan Kun Kari T�rr�nen VTT Valmistustekniikasta siirtyi EU -virkaan Ispra Petten tutkimuslaitokseen johtajaksi, nimitettiin Rauno Rintamaa (my�s VTT Valmistusteknikasta) h�nen tilalleen Suomen edustajaksi FTSC-I komiteaan (= Fusion Technology Steering Committee - Implementation). T�m� komitea on edustuksellinen (edustaja joka assosiaatiosta, Rintamaa edustaa TEKES'i�). Komitean teht�v�n� on ensisijaisesti hyv�ksy� EU'n ITER -ohjelman toimintasuunnitelmat ja sopimukset. Saksa rakentaa Wendelstein 7X koereaktorin - Suomi osallistuu projektiin ITER on tokamak -kone. Wendelstein 7X on stellaraattori. Kysymyksess� on kaksi erilaista fuusiokoneen konseptia. Saksan valtio rakentaa uuden stellaraattorilaitoksen Greifswaldiin, entisen It�-Saksan alueelle. Kokonaisbudjetti on 1 mrd DEM. Nk. teknologiapaketti on 320 milj. DEM. T�st� EU maksaa 45%. Teknologiapaketin hankinnat ovat EU'ssa vapaan kilpailun kohteena. Hankinnat alkavat v�litt�m�sti ja rakennusprojekti kest�� kokonaisuudessaan kahdeksan vuotta. Projektista vastaa IPP (Max-Planck-Institut f�r Plasma Physik) Garching'issa M�nchenin l�hell�. Projektia kiinnostaa yhteisty� my�s Suomen kanssa. Suomalaisilla saattaa olla annettavaa mm. seuraavilla alueilla: plasmafysiikka, diagnostiikka, materiaalikomponenttitekniikka ja suprajohteet. Wendelstein 7X koneeseen tulee 60 km (48 ton) NbTi -suprajohdetta. Viimeisen koe-er�n tarjouspyynt� (200m) on ulkona ja Outokumpu Oy antanee tarjouksen. P��er�n hankinta tapahtuu noin vuoden kuluttua.

ITER -koneen rakentaminen vaatii uuden kansainv�lisen sopimuksen. ITER EDA -vaiheen budjetti on 1,5 mrd USD ja ITER'in rakentaminen maksaa noin 10 mrd USD. Euroopan fuusio-ohjelman vuosibudjetti koostuu Euratomin budjetista 1 mrd FIM ja kansallisista budjeteista yhteens� 1,5 mrd FIM. Suomen vastaavat luvut vuodessa ovat: maksu Euratom'lle noin 20 milj. FIM ja kansallinen ohjelma lis�ksi noin 12 milj. FIM. Teollisuuden tavoitteet Suomen fuusio-ohjelmassa: (1) teknologian siirto Suomeen ja (2) markkinaosuuden saaminen fuusiomarkkinoilla.

Raportti sisältääteknillisen ratkaisun ja toteutussuunnitelman. Raportin yhteenvetoon 4 cm paksu. Varsinainen teknillinen kuvaus, ns.

Lopputuloksenaon 5 sivun yhteenveto, joka marraskuussa esitelläänEU'n ministerineuvostolle.  USA:n fuusio-ohjelmaa leikataan 40% ?   Joka tapauksessa USA on mukana ITER'in suunnitteluvaiheenloppuun eli vuoteen 1998. Mutta mitä sen jälkeen tapahtuu?- sitä ei kukaan tiedä. Koska Venäjä on (taloudellisistäsyistä) pudonnut kelkasta, saattaa olla, että Eurooppaja Japani ovat johtavat ITER  -jäsenet ITER'in rakennusvaiheessa.  ITER'in aikataulu nyt   - ITER EDA (suunnitteluvaihe) valmistuu sopimusten mukaan kesäkuussa1998  - ITER'in rakennuspaikka päätetään vuonna1998  - ITER'in rakentamis- (ja rahoitus-) päätös tehdäänvuonna 2000, jolloin myös komponenttien tilaaminen alkaa  - Laitos valmistuu ja koetoiminta alkaa vuoden 2008 lopulla   Liukumaa verrattuna edelliseen aikatauluun (v. 1992) on kaksivuotta. Silloin päätös rakentamispaikasta oli sijoitettuvuoteen 1996. Rakentamispaikalla on suuri vaikutus projektin aikatauluun.Toisaalta rakentamismaahan pitää luoda lainsäädäntösuurta fuusioreaktoria varten - ja toisaalta reaktori pitääsuunnitella, lisensioida ja rakentaa rakentamismaan säännöstenmukaan.  ITER EDA loppuvaiheen ohjelma   Tähän asti ITER EDA on toiminut 'task' -periaatteella.ITER JCT (Joint Central Team) on määritellyt 'taskeja',tehtäviä, joita EU, USA, JA (Japani) ja RF (VenäjänFederaatio) ovat toteuttaneet. Taskeja tähän asti onollut noin 500.   ITER EDA'n (suunnitteluvaiheen) loppuosa (1995-98) tehdäänhieman toisin. Painopisteenä on "seitsemän suurtaR&D projektia". Näistä kolme on Euroopan vastuulla:   (1) Blanket Development  (2) Divertor Maintenance Test Facility  (3) Toroidial Field Model Coil   Blanket Development -projektin budjetti on 24.5 MECU (EU10, JA 2.5, US 10 ja RF 2). Kokonaisvastuu on Euroopalla. Työnjakonaon alustasti EU: First Wall, US: Limiter, JA: ensisijaisesti RemoteHandling (johon on lisäksi 22 MECU'n budjetti), RF: osuusauki. Projekti koostuu koekappaleiden tekemisestä sekänäiden koestamisesta. Lopputuloksena vuoden 1998 keväälläon blanket  -demonstraatio, jossa näkyy sekä teknillinen ratkaisu,asentaminen ja vaihtaminen.   Divertor Maintenance -projektin budjetti on Euroopan osalta22 MECU. Koelaitos rakennetaan Italiaan. Divertor muodostuu 60palasta, joista kukin painaa 20 ton. Näiden vaihtaminen kauko-ohjatustion projektin tavoitteena. Lopputuloksena on vuoden 1998 keväällädivertor -demonstraatio, jossa teknillinen ratkaisu, asentaminenja vaihtaminen esitellään.   Toroidial Field Model Coil -projektin budjetti on 22.4MECU. Se on yhteisprojekti EU'n ja RF'n kesken. Todennäköisestikuitenkin RF'n osuus jää hyvin pieneksi. Mallikäämitilataan teollisuudelta, kokeet tehdään Karlsruhen tutkimuskeskuksessa.Lopputuloksena on vuoden 1998 keväällä toroidialfield model coil -demonstraatio, jossa teknillinen ratkaisu sekätoiminta esitellään.   Edellä mainittujen suurten R&D -projektien lisäksitehdään ITER EDA'n loppuvaiheessa lukuisia erillisiä'taskeja'.  Suomen mahdollisuuksia   Blanket development -projektissa Suomen tekemien koekappaleidenpitää ensi kesään (1996) mennessä osoittautuaparemmiksi kuin kilpailijoiden. Suomi tarjoaa ainoana maailmassaräjäytysliitostekniikan hyväksikäyttöäkuparin ja ruostumattoman teräksen yhteenliittämiseen.Kilpailijoiden ratkaisut perustuvat pelkästäänHIP -tekniikan (Hot Isostatic Pressing) käyttöön.Myös divertor -elementtien valmistuksessa räjäytysliittäminenon vaihtoehto. (VTT, Outokumpu Poricopper Oy, TKK, High SpeedTech Oy, Rauma Materials Technology Oy, Imatran Voima Oy)   Divertor Maintenance -projektiin Suomi voi halutessaanosallistua monipuolisesti: vesihydrauliikka, simulointiohjelmat,kokonaiset käsittelyjärjestelmät. (TTKK, TKK,Plustech Oy, Hytar Oy, Imatran Voima Oy, Tehdasmallit Oy).   Osa suprajohteista (viisi poloidiaalista käämiä)on päätetty valmistaa niobititaanista. NbTi -johtimienkokonaispituus on 120 km. Näitä ei erikseen kehitetäEDA -vaiheen aikana. Muut johtimet valmistetaan niobitinasta.(Outokumpu Poricopper Oy).   Timanttipinnoitustekniikka on vaihtoehto sekä ensiseinänpinnan paikkaamiseen että liukupintojen valmistukseen. (DIARCTechnology Oy).   CODAC (Control and Data Acquisition) -systeemin ratkaisuvoi perustua CERN'iin kehitettävään CICERO -systeemiin.CICERO   -systeemin kehitystyössä suomalaiset VTT, ImatranVoima Oy ja Valmet Automation Oy ovat keskeisesti mukana.   Ns. Ex-Vessel Remote Handling on toistaiseksi kokonaankäsittelemättä. Suomi tarjoaa ratkaisuksi kiipeilevääja kävelevää robottia. (TTKK, TKK, PlustechOy).   Lisäksi projektissa on paljon Ad hoc -mahdollisuuksia.Juuri nyt on huutava pula CATIA -suunnittelijoista.

CDA -vaiheessa (ConceptualDesign Activities) vuonna 1991 määriteltiin ITER -koneenperusratkaisut. EDA -vaiheen alussa nämä ratkaisut hetihylättiin ja ruvettiin kehittämään uusia perusratkaisuja.Kesäkuussa 1995 julkaistaan nk. Interim Design, joka on kuvauslopullisista perusratkaisuista ja sisältää hyvinvähän avoimia kysymyksiä. Interim Design on paksuasiakirja, josta osapuolet (EU, USA, Japani ja Venäjä)niin pian kuin mahdollista antavat omat lausuntonsa (ehkäjo syyskuussa).   EDA -vaiheen alussa oli tarkoitus kehittääITER -konetta varsin laajasti ja päällekkäisesti(samoja asioita kehitetään rinnakkain eri osapuoltentoimesta). Tämä strategia osoittautui liian kalliiksi.Nyt EDA keskittyy vain kriittisimpiin kysymyksiin selvällätyönjaolla osapuolten kesken. Vähemmän kriittisetkehitystehtävät siirretään EDA -vaiheen jälkeiseenaikaan (rakennusvaiheeseen).   Tämän newsletterin postituslistalle   pääsee soittamalla tai faksaamalla osoitteeseenPrizztech Oy Leena Vesa puh. 939-6271012 fax 939-6271101.

Tilaisuudessa esiteltiin tilannekatsuksialaajalla skaalalla: ITER, Euroopan fuusio-ohjelma, Suomen fuusio-ohjelma,tutkimusohjelmat ja teollisuuden projektit. Keskustelun pääkysymysliittyi työn alla olevaan Suomen ja Euratomin väliseennk. assosiaatiosopimukseen: mitkä ovat Suomen erikoistumisalat?  Tiedotustilaisuus 7.9.1994 Porissa   Puhujina olivat Seppo Hannus KTM, SeppoKarttunen VTT sekä Pertti Pale Finnfusion -projekti. Fuusiosai tilaisuuden perusteella runsaasti huomiota, erikoisesti maakuntalehdissäja maakuntaradioissa, mutta myös jonkun verran valtakunnanlehdissä. Pääteemana oli että Suomi pyrkiiagressiivisesti mukaan Euroopan fuusio-ohjelmaan. Kysyttiin: entäjos Suomi ei liitykään EU'hun? Tähän SeppoHannus vastasi näin: On kolme vaihtoehtoa, (1) ei tehdämitään ja jäädään ulkopuolelle kutennytkin, (2) pyritään erillissopimukseen Suomen ja Euratominvälillä ja (3) EU ja EFTA -maat laajentavat ETA -sopimuksenkoskemaan myös Euratomia.  Räjäytysliitosprojektietenee   High Speed Technology Oy teki uudenerittelyn demostraatioliitoksista, joissa kupari ja ruostumatonteräs varsin monimutkaisessa rakenteessa liitetääntoisiinsa. Erittely hyväksyttiin NET -ryhmän puolelta,mutta valitettavasti Suomen osuus ei näy virallisessa työlistassa(koska Suomi ei ole jäsen). Nk. referenssiratkaisu (ykkösvaihtoehto)on HIP -liitos (Hot Isostatic Pressing), mutta kukaan ei tiedäkelpaako HIP lopulliseksi ratkaisuksi.  Vesihydrauliikka kandidaatti divertor-elementtien käsittelyyn   Divertor -elementit (96 kpl a' 15 ton),pitää ajoittain vaihtaa kauko-ohjatulla käsittelyllä.Siirtoihin ja nostoihin voidaan voima siirtää vain sähköllätai vesihydrauliikalla. Öljy ei kelpaa. Vesi olisi ylivoimainenverrattuna sähköön. Tampereen TKK:n hydrauliikanlaitosta ja Hytar Oy:tä on pyydetty tekemään selvitystäsiitä soveltuuko vesihydrauliikka tähän tehtävään.Tapio Virvalo TTKK'sta osallistui divertor-elementtejä koskevanprojektin käynnistyskokoukseen 1.9.1994 Garchingissa.  Timanantinkaltainen pinnoitus esilläGarchingissa   DIARC Technology Oy:n Jukka Kolehmainenpitää 19.9.1994 NET  -ryhmässä esitelmäntimantinkaltaisesta pinnoituksesta. Tilaisuuteen on kutsuttu tutkijoitaNET'istä, ITER'istä ja IPP'stä (Max Planck Institutfür Plasmaphysik). Tilaisuuden jälkeen on neuvottelusiitä miten yhteistyötä DIARC Technology Oy:n jaNET -ryhmän välillä jatketaan (toistaiseksi DIARCon lähettänyt näytteitä NET'ille).  Suomen mahdolliset erikoistumisalueet(teknologiat)   Euroopanfuusio-ohjelman puolelta toivotaan, että Suomi erikoistuisimuutamaan teknologia-alueeseen ja myös muutamaan tutkimusalueeseen.Tutkimuksen osalta valintojen tekeminen on suhteellisen yksinkertaista.Teknologioiden osalta valitseminen on vaikeampaa. Liitteessäon tämän hetken ehdotus.    Ensimmäinen alue on "Firstwall ja plasma facing systems". Tämän valintaperustuu siihen etta koneen palotilan ympärillä on todennäköisesti15 mm paksu kuparilevy, jonka sisällä on tiheäjäähdytysvesiputkisto. Tähän ns. heat sink-rakenteeseen liittyy paljon erittäin suuria vaikeuksia,mm. miten se liitetään takana olevaan ruostumattomaanteräkseen. Suomen mahdollisuudet perustuvat ensisijaisestiOutokummun kupariin (kehittämiseen, valmistukseen ja koneistukseen),mutta myös siihen että Suomessa on useita muita valmiuksiaja tekniikoita, joita tässä tarvitaan. Potentiaalinenhyöty Suomelle on mahdollisten toimitusten lisäksi siinä,että tähän alueeseen liittyy valtavasti tutkimustaja tietoa, joka samalla tulee meidän käyttöömme.   Toinen alue on "Remote handling".Tämän valinta perustuu paljon siihen, että meitäkovasti pyydetään tähän mukaan. Suomella ontarjottavana tähän alueeseen vesihydrauliikkaa, kävelytekniikkaasekä säätötekniikan ja instrumentoinnin tuntemusta.Potentiaalinen hyöty Suomelle on ensinnäkin vesihydrauliikassa:jos tämä valitaan fuusiokoneen kaikkiin nostimiin, siirtimiinja manipulaattoreihin, on kysymyksessä erittäin suurikehityshanke ja toimitus, jota suoraan voi soveltaa myösmuihin vesihydrauliikkaa vaativiin kohteisiin. Toinen hyötypotentiaalion siinä, että vain ne jotka tuntevat koneen, voivatrakennusvaiheessa tarjota teleoperointisysteemejä.   Kolmas alue on "Superconductors".Tämä valinta perustuu siihen, että Outokummun suprajohdetekniikkaon eräässä mielessä ainutlaatuinen maailmassa.Outokumpu on pitkälle vamistusorientoitunut, kun kilpailijatpääsääntöisesti ovat kehittämisyksiköitä,jotka alihankkivat valmistuksen. Isossa fuusiokoneessa tasainenlaatu on elämän ja kuoleman kysymys. Suprajohteidenosalla puhutaan valtavista valmistumääristä jamyös sadoista miljoonista dollareista.  David Maisonnier (NET) ja Eric Martin(ITER) vierailevat Suomessa 26-28.9.1994   Maisonnier ja Martin tutustuvat ensisijaisestivesihydrauliikkaan Tampereella mutta myös Suomen teleoperointivalmiuksiin.Isäntinä toimivat TKK Automaatio (Aarne Halme), HytarOy (Jorma Terävä), TTKK IHA (Tapio Virvalo), PlustechOy (Erkki Kare) sekä TTKK Säätötekniikka (HeikkiKoivo).  Suomi osallistuu Euroopan fuusiokokouksiinulkojäsenenä   Syksyn aikana Suomi osallistuu ainakinseuraaviin kokouksiin:   IAEA 15th International Conferenceon Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion Research, Sevilla, Spain,September 26 - October 1, 1994. Suomesta Seppo Karttunen VTT jaRainer Salomaa TKK. Vaikka kysymyksessä on fysiikka -kokous,konferenssiin osallistuu johtavia virkamiehiä Brysselistäja on tarkoitus että Karttunen ja Salomaa tapaavat näitäja neuvottelevat Suomen ja Euratomin välisen sopimuksen tekstistä.   Planning meeting: Task force materials,Villigen, Switzerland, October 10 - 11, 1994. Suomesta Seppo TähtinenVTT. Kokouksessa päätetään materiaalien kehitysohjelmavuonna 1995 (Euroopassa).   Consultative Committee for Fusion Program,Brussels, Belgium, October 25 - 26, 1994. Suomesta Seppo HannusKTM, Seppo Karttunen VTT. Tämä on fuusio-ohjelman korkeinelin. Jos kansanäänestys on positiivinen, esitellääntäällä ehdotus Suomen ja Euratomin väliseksisopimukseksi.  ITER -hankkeella uusi johtaja : Dr.Robert Aymar   Entinen johtaja Dr. Paul Rebut erosikesäkuussa. Entinen ja uusi johtaja ovat molemmat ranskalaisia,samanikäisiä ja lisäksi koulutovereita. Syyt Rebut'neroon ovat ITER -hankkeen vaikeassa hallinnossa.

These views have coloured attitudes to exploration and development, often with damaging consequences and unnecessary conflicts between administrators, environmentalists and indigenous inhabitants. Lack of understanding also represents a lost opportunity in that polar natural systems play a key role in modulating the global environment. An improved understanding is necessary if we are to make meaningful predictions of environmental change on a global scale." David E. Sugden, Professor of Geography, University of Edinburgh Polar Research The vast wildernesses of the Arctic and Antarctic account for one-fifth of the Earth's surface. There, information vital to understanding the Earth's systems waits to be deciphered: ozone depletion was first observed in the Antarctic; deep ice cores record 100,000 years of climate history; and study of the role played by sea ice in carbon dioxide absorption promises insights into how quickly major climatic shifts can happen. The Arctic is also important for its resources and as the home of many indigenous people. But so little is known about the polar regions that it is fruitful to provide for polar research and for the storage of polar information in dedicated, multidisciplinary institutes. The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) The Institute (SPRI) was founded in 1920, in Cambridge, as a memorial to Captain Scott and his four companions who died returning from the South Pole in 1912. When Scott's last words, "For God's sake, look after our people", were made known to the British nation, the response was tremendous. Scott himself had emphasised the importance of science and, from this plea, the Institute was born. The Institute is the oldest international centre for polar research embedded in a university. Its 75 years of scientific exploration, collection, recording and interpretation of results makes it a unique institution both nationally and worldwide.Many other institutes concerned with polar issues have grown up around it: the British Antarctic Survey, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Project, the World Data Centre 'C' for Glaciology, the International Glaciological Society and the International Whaling Commission. The Institute has fostered polar research worldwide through its participation in the training of scientists, its own research and the development of scientific techniques such as the radio echo sounding of glaciers. Additionally, its library and archives hold an unequalled collection of published and unpublished polar material. The Institute is proud of its postgraduates who work in every field of polar research: sea ice and polar oceanography, glacier geophysics, zoology, history, social sciences, resource and wilderness management and Russian northern studies. Many of these graduates have become internationally-acknowledged leaders in their fields and have gained prominent positions in their universities and institutions. Not only does the Scott Polar Research Institute support the academic community, but its museum brings polar history and research to the public through its collections, lectures, events and school programmes. The Shackletons "Curiosity about and care of the remote parts of the world, concern for people, leadership and judgement - these are priorities of our times. In few people have these been as strong as in the Shackletons, father and son:Sir Ernest in the Antarctic during the first 20 years of this century, Edward Lord Shackleton KG, FRS from the 1930s to the 1990s. Of the classic explorers, the polar hero Ernest Shackleton ranks with Nansen, Peary and Amundsen. In Cherry-Garrard's unforgettable words: 'For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.' Men would follow Shackleton unquestioningly and he never lost one; he knew how far to go and when to go no further. He brought them across the Weddell Sea after the loss of his ship and, almost unbelievably, he secured the safety of all of them as a result of the small boat journey to South Georgia across the worst ocean in the world. His son carried on the work of exploration in Ellesmere Land and Borneo but these were a prelude to a life of extensive distinction in science, conservation and politics, national and international. Eddie Shackleton's leadership, his ability to win the understanding and affection of those of differing political conviction, were outstanding, not least in a generation in which tolerance has been at a premium. A true Shackleton whose contribution had been in the context of today as was his father's in that of nearly a century ago."Sir Alexander Glen Planning for the Future: The Shackleton Memorial Library The Institute's library is recognised as the world's premier polar information centre. As an unparalleled resource of outstanding national and international importance, it is consulted by governments and industry, scientists and scholars. It also houses one of the world's largest collections of unpublished polar manuscripts and literature about snow and ice. The existing archive and library facilities are filled to capacity. In 1960, the Ford Foundation enabled the Institute to meet the challenge of an explosion in polar information following World War II. Now, once again, the Institute has embarked on a major expansion of the library to serve the needs of the research community into the future. This planned extension will be named the Shackleton Memorial Library in honour of the contributions made to polar research by Sir Ernest Shackleton and his son, Lord Shackleton. The new library will accomplish more than providing space for the expanding collection. Through the use of digital scanning and remote access technology, researchers, on-site or via computer links, will have access to the manuscripts and library collections, the databank of polar images and artefacts, English and foreign language polar journals, and expertise from the Institute's staff. Investing in the Future - Opportunities for Partnership In order to continue to provide its unique services to research and education of the highest possible quality, the Scott Polar Research Institute has prepared its plans for development. The total cost to fund the building and equipping of the Shackleton Memorial Library will be �1 million, of which the University is providing �350,000. The need to continue polar research is great and depends upon the contributions of individuals, institutions and corporations in order to be successful. The University is seeking involvement, assistance and financial support from both individuals and the corporate sector. Past and present corporate sponsors of the Institute include BP and Arco. Partnerships are sought to expand the Library and to support the Institute's work. The Institute is keen to foster relationships with individuals, other institutions and corporations which have an interest in the polar regions.

Neil read Geography and went on to do his PhDhere. After a spell as Research Associate in the Geography Department inthe University of Cambridge, he went for one year to Garry Clarke'sDepartment of Geophysics and Astronomy at the University of BritishColombia. Neil interests are within the broad field of environmentalmodelling, particularly the interactions between ice masses, climate andglacier hydrology. He has developed mathematical models of theseinteractions. Terrestrial glaciology has a long history in the Institute associated with Gordon Robin, David Drewry and Julian Dowdeswell. By taking us into the fields of glacier hydrology and themodelling of ice sheets and glaciers at different scales and time spans, Iam greatly looking forward to Neil carrying on, and adding lustre to, thattradition". Neil took up his appointment on 1 November 1996. His e-mail address is nsa12@cus.cam.ac.uk.

[There will be no further updates to this page] The j�kulhlaup, 5 November 1996 at 14:30 This one of several excellent new images of the j�kulhlaup from The Science Institute, University of Iceland.The photographs were taken by Magn�s TumiGu�mundsson and Finnur P�lsson. This is a view northwards, showing the easternmost part of the j�kulhlaup, the 900 m longSkei�ar� bridge and the dyke system protecting the Skaftafell NationalPark, which is situated to the east (left) of the river. At this timeabout 15,000 m�/s was flowing down this part of the alluvialplane. The bridge was still intact but a few hours later theeasternmost end was washed away. These SPRI web pages for the j�kulhlaup (=glacier-flood) which followed the subglacial eruption on the Vatnaj�kull ice sheet, Iceland, were edited by the ICSU World Data Centre C (Glaciology) Most material on this page is © Iceland Review © Science Institute, University of Iceland © The Nordic Volcanological Institute (NVI) The Science Institute, University of Iceland, reported the j�kulhlaup, hour by hour: November 5 - 09:00 GMT The j�kulhlaup from Gr�msv�tn has just begun. The volume of the Skei�ar� river is increasing rapidly this morning. A continuous high frequency tremor appeared on the station on Gr�msfjall at 21:30 hours last night. The tremor amplitude increased steadily throughout the night and is about 16 times greater now at 9 am. November 5 - 10:00 GMT The road across Skei�ar�rsandur has been closed. The j�kulhlaup now surrounds the 900 m long bridge across Skei�ar� which has reached a flow rate of 6000 cubic m/s within the first 2 hours. "Icebergs" are breaking off the glacier snout and are being carried down with the flow. November 5 - 13:00 GMT According to radio reports, the bridge across oneof the glacier rivers (G�gjukv�sl) has now perished in the flood. Thepower line is down and the telephone fiber cables have been cut by the flood.The maximum tremor amplitude is around 240 units. November 5 - 18:00 GMT The bridge across S�luh�sakv�sl has beendemolished by the flood and the longest bridge in Iceland, the 900 mlong Skei�ar� bridge is severely damaged as well, and not expected tolast much longer. Glaciologists surveying the flood from an aircraft at15 h estimated the flow rate to be around 25,000 cubic m/s. The maximumtremor is now 270 units. The Skei�ar� bridge is worth 10 million US$.The total damage to constructions today is estimated at about 15million US$. November 6. - 9:00 GMT The j�kulhlaupculminated at 22:30 hours last night. At that time close to 45.000cubic m/s flowed from Gr�msv�tn, along a 50 km long path beneath theoutlet glacier Skei�ar�rj�kull out to the alluvial plane,Skei�ar�rsandur. The high frequency tremor recorded at Gr�msfjallstayed fairly constant throughout the night and still has a maximum of230 units. Although damaged, close to 700 m of the 900 m long Skei�ar�bridge is still standing but the bridges across S�luh�sakv�sl andG�gjukv�sl washed away. Skei�ar� is the easternmost river draining thisregion whereas S�luh�sakv�sl and G�gjukv�sl are the central bridges.The westernmost bridge, across N�psv�tn stayed intact. The initial(main) phase of the j�kulhlaup, which begun at 8 h yesterday morningwith a 3-5 m high water wave, flowed down the easternmost and centralpart of the Skei�ar�rsandur plain, not reaching N�psv�tn untilafternoon yesterday. Many large icebergs (up to 200 tons) are scatteredon the plain. November 6 - 10:00 GMT Correction: Latest reports claim that the bridge across S�luh�sakv�slis still standing and that the j�kulhlaup has decreased markedly. November 7 - 12:00 GMT The j�kulhlaup has finished. The flowrate in the glacier rivers on Skeidarrsandur is now at 400 cubic m/s. At least 3 cubic km of water thick with ash and other fragments from the eruption have flowed from Gr�msv�tn, along the bottom of the glacier out to sea, within the last 52 hours. The water has left many huge icebergs, some are 10-15 m high weighing up to 1000 tons. The high frequency tremor recorded at the seismic station on Grimsfjall, on the southeastern rim of the Gr�msv�tn caldera, has decreased to less than 10 units. However, the instrument still records numerous "icequakes" which occur within the glacier as it is still being cracked in response to the sudden lowering of the iceshelf above the caldera lake. November 8 - 11:00 GMT GPS measurements of the lake level at Gr�msv�tn showed it to be at 1345 m a.s.l. yesterday afternoon. Thus, the waterlevel subsided 165 m during the j�kulhlaup. A 6 km long, 500 m wide and up to 200 m deep ice canyon has formed over the j�kulhlaup outlet at the southeastern margin of Gr�msv�tn. The current subsidence is larger than during the April 1996 j�kulhlaup, when the waterlevel subsided 74 m, from about 1454 m to 1380 m. This j�kulhlaup carried up to 100 million tons of volcanic material and clay out to sea which could be traced up to 15 km out by its brown colour. It did, however, not trigger any lahars. Our seismic station at Grimsfjall still records numerous "icequakes" caused by collapsing crevasses and other glacier movement. The Volcanological Institute also reported, on November 5 1996: The river Skei�ar�, originating in the subglacial lake of the Gr�mv�tn caldera, has started to increase. At present the frost in Iceland is between -2 to -20degrees Centigrade thus glacial rivers should be at a minimum. This morning, however, a scientist observed that the river Skei�ar� was increasing its discharge. The river smells strongly of sulphur and the water is loaded with sediments. It is expected that the river will increase its discharge rate for the next couple of days, until it reaches a maximum of perhaps 20,000 to 30,000 m3/s. See this image for possible areas of flooding. Iceland Review reported: November 5. 1 pm: A tidal wave of black melt water and huge chunks of ice from last month's Vatnajökull eruption is hurtling southwards under and over Europe's largest glacier sweeping aside everything in its path. The giant flood, believed to be the greatest ever witnessed in Iceland, burst from the Lake Grimsvötn caldera between 8-9am today. Scientists estimate that an initial 3km3 water came crashing under the glacier before washing over the sandy plains of the south lands. Such is the force of the flood that it blasted a 2km long crevice 100m from the edge of the glacier spewing the murky water forth in waves over the frozen surface. A bridge over the river Gýgja has succumbed to the flood along with a fibre optic telecommunications cable. The ring road linking the south and east of the country has been swept away in several places, most dramatically either side of the Skeidarár bridge, as engineers await the further destruction of bridges, roadway and power lines that is sure to follow in its wake. Meanwhile, vessels fishing in the waters off the south coast have been warned to haul in their gear as there is a danger of flood waves of silt sweeping over the ocean bed. A detection of disturbance around 10:30pm yesterday picked up by measuring equipment at Grímsfjall, near the site of the eruption, sparked an initial warning although scientists were not sure whether what they were witnessing was a new sub-glacial eruption or that the colossal amount of melt-water was bursting through the ice dam of the Grímsvötn caldera. By early morning the measurement of disturbances grew ten-fold signalling that the wait for the flood was over. Within two hours, the volume of water had increased a hundred-fold. November 5. 5pm: "In just four hours this has knocked us back 20-30 years in terms of our road building endeavours," said Prime Minister Davíd Oddsson after flying over south Iceland witnessing first hand the damage resulting from the immense flood water of the Vatnajökull glacial eruption. Scientists estimate the rate of water flooding the plains of the south to be gushing at a phenomenal 20,000 m3 per second and growing. Nobody has so far been able to say when the unstoppable wave of water will subside. Large stretches of the ring road have been washed away with three bridges in very real danger of being destroyed, including one of the country's largest and most important. One bridge, that over the river Gýgja, has already been carried away by the tidal like flow of the glacial melt-water onslaught, costing the nation an estimated ISK300 million, around US$4.6 million, to replace.

The radiation can be in the ultraviolet, visible, infrared or microwave region of the spectrum, and can be naturally occurring or artificially generated. It carries information about the physical properties of the medium from which it was reflected or emitted, and about the atmosphere through which it travels. Computer image processing can thus be used to derive information about these properties, and so about the character of the Earth's surface or atmosphere. The use of airborne and, especially, spaceborne platforms allows data to be gathered from very large areas in very short times, and from areas in which fieldwork would be difficult. However, fieldwork remains an important component of most applications, providing known data that can then be extrapolated over space and/or time using remotely sensed data. The Remote Sensing Society,founded in 1974, promotes Remote Sensing as a unified subject. The Remote Sensing Group (RSG) of the Scott Polar Research Institute was formally set up in 1985, under the direction of Dr Gareth Rees, with the aim of developing new methods for using satellite and airborne observation to study polar glacial, marine and biological environments. Satellite Remote Sensing (Earth Observation) is an especially powerful information-gathering technique in the polar regions owing to their vast size, hostile environment and difficulty of access. The newer methods of microwave remote sensing, which do not depend on the daylight, cloud-free conditions often absent from the polar regions, have received particular attention. The Group produces an occasional series SPRI Technical Reports in Remote Sensing, and publishes papers in a variety of scientific journals. Research areas The RSG carries out laboratory and field-based research in the followingmain areas: glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice and icebergs vegetation and pollution in the Arctic Although the geographical focus of research is primarily in the Arctic,some of the techniques developed by the RSG are applicable in other partsof the world, and have been used for such diverse purposes as studying the temperature profile in the lower layers of the Earth's atmosphere using observations of 'mirage' phenomena; tracking migratory birds; characterising areas of actual and potential soil erosion in southern Europe. The RSG also carries out basic research in image processing techniques and the dynamics of satellite orbits. Research by the RSG is supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the UK Department of the Environment, the EC, the US Army, the UK Meteorological Office, and the UK Defence Research Agency. Applications to undertake research with the RSG at Master's, Doctoral or Post-doctoral level are considered from both self-funded and unfunded students. The Remote Sensing Group has also undertaken contract work for the British National Space Centre and SAIC Science and Engineering Ltd. Small research contracts can sometimes be carried out at very low cost through student projects. Larger contracts (typically lasting 6 months or more) generally require some staff funding. Teaching Teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels is provided within the University of Cambridge. Undergraduate teaching in remote sensing and glaciology is contributed to the departments of Physics and Geography. Graduate teaching is contributed to the one-year M. Phil. courses in Polar Studiesand in Geographical Information Systems and Remote Sensing. The RSG also provides training for the PhD degree programme.

There wereimportant and welcome developments on both these fronts duringthe year. Shortly after World War II it became apparent that a sea changewas likely to come over polar activity. The days of polar exploration,in the sense of discovering new land, were moving towards a close,and were being replaced by an era of polar scientific researchin the sense of explaining polar phenomena and relating the polarregions to the rest of the planet. Perhaps that change is bestepitomized by the International Geophysical Year of 1957-58, whichbegan life as a proposal for a Third International Polar Year,following those of 1882 and 1932. It also became apparent thatthis change would be accompanied by a vast increase in polar information,as many more nations become involved in polar research. Dr Brian Roberts, then a Research Fellow in the Institute witha part time appointment in the UK Foreign Office, foresaw thisincrease in polar information and saw also the need for its collection,as far as possible, in one place, and for its organisation inaccordance with a bibliographic system that other polar librarieswould be encouraged to adopt. Thus did the Institute become accreditedto the Federation Internationale de Documentation and developedthe Universal Decimal Classification for use in Polar Libraries.By the early 1960s, the explosion in polar information had becomea reality, and the library storage capacity of the Memorial Buildingpromised soon to be overwhelmed. In the early years of Dr GordonRobin's directorship, the Ford Foundation responded magnificentlyto the Institute's need, and in 1968 Dr Laurence Gould, a memberof the Ford Foundation and an Antarctic geologist, opened theFord Wing of the Institute. It was expected that the space thusmade available would meet the Library's needs to the end of thecentury, but by the mid 1980s space was again becoming a problem,which was partially relieved in 1988 by an addition during thedirectorship of Dr Peter Wadhams. By the beginning of the decade it was clear that to maintain theInstitute's position as the world's premier polar library requiredthat there should again be a forward leap of the same magnitudeas that which had been made possible by the Ford Foundation. Itwas, therefore, with deep gratitude that we learned that the Universityhad responded to our need by promising £350,000, on the understandingthat the Institute would raise a similar sum from outside sources,and thus make possible the forward leap the Institute so sorelyneeds. Over the same period it also became apparent that the Institute'sarchive capacity was being stretched close to its limits and thatthere was a need for photograph and film storage under closelyregulated environmental conditions that differ from those thatare appropriate for the storage of paper archives. When the Ford Wing was built, it had been designed to accept afurther floor on top of the main part of the building. An architecturalfeasibility study showed that such an addition would not providesufficient space, and that too much money would need to be spenton strengthening the existing building to accept a further floorwith loading capacities sufficient to accept library usage. Thearchitectural study therefore suggested a three-part solution:firstly, an extension to the basement area designed to house themap collection, thus providing additional research space followingrelocation of the maps from the top floor of the Ford Wing; secondly,an increase in the space currently used by the general officeand library storage above it; and, thirdly, the building of athree-floored library building in what is currently the car parkingspace between the Institute and our boundary with the church tothe east. An elevation of this aspect of the planned developmentis shown on the front cover of SPRI Review - 95. The approved'tower' solution to linking the rectilinear Ford Wing with thesofter contours of the Memorial Building has been much appreciatedin both aesthetic and architectural terms. Lord Edward Shackleton, son of Sir Ernest, a lifelong friend ofthe Institute, leader of the Oxford University expedition to EllesmereIsland of 1934-35, and a great Parliamentarian, died on 22 September1994. The opportunity to commemorate both Sir Ernest and Lord'Eddie' by naming the new building the Shackleton Memorial Librarywas immediately grasped and has been universally welcomed. Althoughstrictly lying outside the scope of this review, it is very goodto be able to report that we are already more than one-third ofour way towards realising the necessary funds from outside sources. Departments in the University are reviewed on a roughly ten-yearcycle, and at other times in the event of an occurrence such as,in the case of the Institute, the retirement of a director,which makes a review opportune. Following reviews in 1979, 1983,and 1987, the next General Board review was due in 1997, but followingthe departure of Dr Julian Dowdeswell and Dr Robin Williams, reportedlast year, it was agreed within the University that preparatorywork for that review should be brought forward. In 1979 the Council of the School of Physical Sciences reportedto the University : There is a national need for the continuation of polar studiesin the United Kingdom, and the need is seen as likely to increaserather than decrease in the future. An unparalleled concentration of institutions and individualswith interests in the polar regions exists in Cambridge. In spite of the small number of its permanent staff, theScott Polar Research Institute has played a significant part inpolar studies on a worldwide basis and can be expected to continueto do so. The work of the Institute is a worthy and proper use of theUniversity's hard-pressed resources and its position in the Universityenables it to fulfil roles which it could not otherwise meet. The reviews of 1983 and 1987, following the retirements of DrRobin and Dr Drewry, respectively, from the directorship, warmlyendorsed these views. But all these reviews had another threadin common, relating to the need for there to be a mechanism forassociating University officers in the Institute with relevantundergraduate teaching departments 'for the mutual benefit ofboth.' Changes in the government's funding model for universities,from one predominantly historically based to one based on encouragementof undergraduate teaching, has led to institutes, such as SPRI,whose raison d'etre is oriented more to research than teaching,and of which there are a multitude throughout the UK universityworld, being in a financially exposed position. This development,added to the well-attested academic arguments in favour of symbiosisbetween teaching and research, has led to urgent considerationof how best to achieve a steady continuation - and allow for expansion- of polar studies in Cambridge, together with integration withundergraduate teachings. It should be recorded in this context,and particularly as it relates to the first of the 1979 viewsquoted above, that the Higher Education Funding Council for Englandnotified the University during the year of a grant of £90,000,as a non-formula funding for polar studies in the 1995-96 fundingallocation. While these developments relating to infrastructure and peoplemay seem to be more pregnant for the future than conclusive, theyare both strongly positive. While the proof of the pudding isin the eating, the aroma is good and we look forward to the feast. Meanwhile, the following pages will show that the Institute'sresearch activities, its library, and its other functions areensuring that it continues to play 'a significant part in polarstudies on a world-wide basis.' Research Overviews Sea Ice and Polar Oceanography Group Dr P Wadhams, Reader in Polar Studies Dr N.R. Davis, E. Aldworth, M.A. Brandon, D.R. Crane, M. Huddleston,E. Prussen, D. Sheard, M.A. Tadross, S. Wells, M. Aitchison, F.Boud The research work of the Group is concerned with air-sea-ice interactionprocesses in polar oceans and their role in climate, and alsowith the dynamics and mechanics of sea ice. Activities during1994-95 focused on research projects in the Greenland Sea, especiallyin the central gyre region where winter convection occurs; inthe Beaufort Sea with studies of ice deformation; and in the WeddellSea in the Antarctic. The largest research programme with which the group is involvedis ESOP, the European Subpolar Ocean Programme. This is fundedby the Commission for the European Communities under the MAST-II(Marine Science and Technology) Programme, and is the fourthlargest of the 70 projects in MAST-II. The research involves21 partners in seven countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,Norway, Sweden, and the UK) and the project is co-ordinated fromSPRI by Dr Wadhams. The purpose is to study ice-ocean interactionin the Greenland Sea with special reference to the role of seaice in winter convection. In the central Greenland Sea, the icecover of the East Greenland pack frequently develops an eastwardtongue in the latiutide range 72-76°N, where the Jan MayenPolar Current diverts cold water to the east. The tongue is dueto local ice growth, which occurs in the form of frazil and pancakeice owing to extreme sea states. Salt rejected from the growingsea ice contributes to the overturning of the surface water,leading to convective plumes that carry water down to the deepocean. Evidence from tracers suggests that since 1982 convectionhas failed to reach the deep waters and is now terminating atdepths of 1500 m and, latterly, less than 1000 m. This is havinga profound effect on the Greenland Sea deep water, which is becomingwarmer and more saline, and may also accelerate global warming,since the convection process acts as a sink for carbon dioxidecarried down from the surface waters. During 1994-95 the Group was involved in the analysis and interpretationof data from field experiments, in continued work with remotesensing imagery of the ice cover, in modelling studies, and insynthesis of the results with the findings of our European colleagues.Modelling work was carried out by Matthew Huddleston (ResearchStudent), who is funded by a CASE studentship between NERC andthe Meteorological Office (Dr Howard Cattle). His work on ice-oceanmodelling of the Greenland Sea involves interaction with the MeteorologicalOffice GCM (General Circulation Model) of the atmosphere, forwhich purpose a computer link was established between SPRI andthe Met Office Cray computer. Remote sensing analysis involvedinterpretation of ERS-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) imageryand SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) passive microwavedata from the Odden ice tongue in relation to data from fieldobservations. In October 1994 Dr Wadhams hosted a Mid-Term ScienceSymposium at SPRI, where ESOP participants presented results ofthe programme so far. During the year the same group of European partners prepared asuccessful bid to continue this project for a further three years(1996-99) under the MAST-III programme, the new phase being knownas ESOP-2. Another success for MAST-III was a joint proposal withFinnish and Norwegian colleagues called 'Ice State,' to studyice mechanics and their effect on icebreaker operations. Bothnew contracts will start in February 1996. In the Greenland Sea, a second MAST-II project has been carriedout by the group, a collaboration between SPRI and Dr Flavio Parmiggianiof IMGA-CNR, Modena, again with Dr Wadhams as coordinator. Theaim of this project is to spectrally analyse SAR imagery of theOdden region to measure the wavelengths and propagation vectorsof the dominant ocean wave species entering the frazil-pancakeice cover from the open sea. Theory developed by Dr Wadhams predictsthat wavelength should decrease in ice (and thus refraction willoccur if waves are incident obliquely) to an extent that dependson the thickness of the frazil-pancake layer. By examining successivesubscenes it is possible to map the thickness of the ice in Oddenand thus achieve a better insight into the likely flux of saltinto the upper ocean. Others involved in the remote sensing analysiswere Mark Tadross (Research Student) and Eileen Aldworth (ResearchAssociate). The main field work undertaken by the Group during 1994-95 wasin the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, where a sea-ice research programmewas run from HMS Endurance during February 1995. The project wasdesigned to match surface observations of sea ice properties withaerial photographic swathes and satellite SAR imagery, in orderto elucidate the nature of the Antarctic ice edge in late summerand its signature on SAR. The ship sailed from Punta Arenas, withthe SPRI participants being Dr Wadhams, Huddleston, and StephenWells (Research Assistant). After a call at O'Higgins Base onthe Antarctic Peninsula in order to co-ordinate data acquisitionwith the German SAR receiving station there, the ship enteredthe northwest Weddell Sea through Antarctic Sound and carriedout a series of experiments during a seven-day period. On eachday the ship would run into the ice along a line that was beingcovered by an ERS-1 SAR orbit, using her Lynx helicopters to landthe SPRI team on a succession of ice floes. On each floe the partytook an ice core, measured snow and ice physical properties, recordedstrain and accelerations due to ocean waves, and took CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth)profiles through the uppermost 80 m of the water column to measuremelt water effects. Meanwhile the ship was carrying out CTD profilesat 5-10 nml intervals. As near as possible to the exact time ofthe satellite overflight a helicopter would carry out a 100 nmlaerial photography flight along the line of the orbit. By matchingthese datasets from three levels (satellite, air_borne, surface)we have been able to gain new insight into the radar reponse ofAntarctic sea ice, also making the discovery that late summersea ice in the Weddell Sea is covered with melt pools, a phenomenonpreviously thought to be confiend to the Arctic. Strain and accelerationmeasurements were also carried out on two tabular icebergs. Theteam disembarked at Port Stanley. In the Beaufort Sea the Group was involved in SIMI, the Sea IceMechanics Initiative of the US Office of Naval Research (ONR).The purpose is to understand the mechanics of sea ice deformationin the Arctic on scales ranging from tens of km down to singlecracks and individual pressure ridges, in order to be able toimprove the parameterisation of these processes in large-scaleice-ocean models. Having taken part in a series of ice camp experimentsduring 1993-94, the group spent 1994-95 on data analysis, leadingto participation in the ONR Sea Ice Mechanics and Arctic ModelingWorkshop in Anchorage, Alaska, during April 25-28 1995, in whichresults were discussed and compared. During the year Mark Brandon (Research Student) submitted hisPhD thesis, entitled Winter surface water mass modification inthe Greenland Sea, which was approved; he moved to a researchposition with British Antarctic Survey. Two Research Associatesalso left the group after several years of service: David Crane(to join Wimpey Offshore) and Eleanor Prussen (to return withher husband to the USA). Jeremy Wilkinson joined the group asa Research Associate from IASOS (Institute of Antarctic and SouthernOcean Studies) in Hobart, Tasmania. Remote Sensing Group Dr W.G. Rees, Assistant Director of Research M. Williams, K.A. Teleki, G.J. Marshall, A.W. Bingham,D.L. Feltham, A.K. Braimoh, H. Wright The Remote Sensing Group has continued its work of developingmethods for the analysis of satellite data and of applying themto the study of polar environments. This work has three main strands:land ice, sea ice and icebergs, and tundra areas. During the year, Gareth Marshall (Research Student) submittedhis PhD dissertation on the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR)data from the ERS-1 satellite in glaciological research, and hasnow taken up a position at the British Antarctic Survey. I-I Lin(Research Student) was awarded the PhD degree for her thesis onfundamental study of the use of satellite image texture in glaciology,using both SAR and visible-wavelength imagery, and she has beenappointed to a post at Singapore National University. The resultsof both of these projects are now being built upon by Andrew Bingham(Research Student), who is investigating the potential of synergiesbetween different satellite data sources in determining seasonaland long-term changes in the properties of glaciers, ice caps,and ice sheets. A field campaign on Finsterwalderbreen in Svalbard(summer 1995) confirmed and refined the use of SAR and Landsatdata in combination to determine the position of the snow line,and work is now in progress to incorporate satellite-derived surfacetemperature data. Also during the year, Harvey Wright (MPhil Student)successfully applied similar methods to a study of an Alpine glacier. Work on IPAP (Ice Pilot Applications Project) continued duringthe year, with the appointment of Kristian Teleki to a researchassistantship. IPAP is an international project, funded by theDefence Research Agency (Farnborough), to demonstrate the possibilityof producing real-time data on sea ice and iceberg distributionand motion using satellite radar data. During the year, the RemoteSensing Group used data provided by the Danish MeteorologicalService to confirm the accuracy of the IPAP system in detectingsea ice and determining its concentration and motion. The systemis now being commercialised. An associated project was also begun during the year, with theappointment of Daniel Feltham to a UK Meteorological Office GassiotPhD studentship. The aim of this project is to develop a detailedanalytical and numerical understanding of the mechanisms of brinedrainage and pressure ridge formation in sea ice. Such an understanding,at present lacking, is important in modelling the thermodynamiceffects of a sea ice cover, and will ultimately lead to improvedmeteorological models. The Remote Sensing Group's new departure into the study of tundraenvironments was maintained with the continuation of the Kol'skiyPoluostrov project. The aim of this work, which is funded by theUK Department of the Environment through the 'Darwin Initiative,'is to develop methods for studying the impact of industrial pollutionon tundra and forest vegetation using satellite methods. The workis performed in collaboration with the Geography Faculty of MoscowState University (led by Professor A.P. Kapitsa) and the WorldConservation Monitoring Centre. During the year, the results fromthe 1994 field season were worked up, and a time-series (1978-92)of satellite images of the area surrounding the Severonikel smelterat at Monchegorsk (Russia), processed to show changes in vegetationhealth, was produced. Analysis of this time-series has shown anumber of unexpected effects, and allowed, for the first time,the long-term effects of pollution over a wide area of tundrato be quantified. These results were confirmed during a fieldtrip in summer 1995, and presented by Dr Rees at a NATO AdvancedResearch Workshop in Rovaniemi, Finland. This work is now developing in two directions. Firstly, a geographicalextension of the methods developed on the Kol'skiy Poluostrov,into the Taimyr Peninsula, is planned. Dr Rees, Professor Kapitsa,and Meredith Williams (Research Assistant) performed a preliminaryinvestigation of sites near the nickel smelter at Norilsk duringthe summer, including a 500-kilometre aerial survey. Secondly,the Remote Sensing Group began an investigation, in collaborationwith Professor P.J. Williams (Carleton University) into the detectabilityusing satellite data of oil spills on permafrost terrain. A preliminarystudy by Dr Rees and Ademola Braimoh (MPhil Student) showed thatthe huge oil spill that occurred in 1994 at Usinsk in the KomiRepublic (Russia) could be detected and quantified in SAR imagesof the area. Professor Williams and Dr Rees obtained funding fromthe US Army Research Office for a pilot project to study the effectsof spilt oil on permafrost, the scope for remote detection ofthe oil and its effects, and the possibility of remediation. Social Sciences and Russian Northern Studies Group Dr P. Vitebsky, Assistant Director of Research J. Tichotsky, P. Fryer, M. Badger, M. Whittles, B. Seligman,D. Anderson, T. Argounova, M. Gridina, M. Curran The group continued to expand, with an increasing number of long-termVisiting Scholars and complex joint projects with institutionsoverseas. Dr Mark Nuttall, Dr Igor Krupnik, and Dr Nikolai Vakhtinspent time at the Institute as ESRC-funded Research Associates,while Ben Seligman joined as a Research Student and Marion Curranas Secretary. Having long worked with Russian scholars, the Groupwelcomed its first students from Russia, Marina Gridina and TatianaArgounova. They completed the MPhil course and Argounova willstay on for a PhD. She is the first Sakha (Yakut) person to studyat Cambridge. Members of the group carried out fieldwork-based research in severalsites in Russia: Chukotka, Yakutsk, Nyeryungri, Taimyr, VerkhoyanskMountains, Kazym, Syktyvkar, Yamal Peninsula, Norilsk, Lake Baikal,and Vaigach Island. In Alaska they worked in Barrow, Fairbanks,Nome, Bethel, and Indian Valley and elsewhere in the Arctic inInuvik, Banks Island, Varanger Fjord, Sisimiut, Karesuando, andKarasjok. A major theme has been the importance of indigenous knowledgein making sustainable development realistic. The project on 'Environmentalchange and indigenous knowledge in Siberia and Alaska,' fundedby the ESRC and directed by Dr Vitebsky, compares the uses ofindigenous knowledge by local people in each of these regionsin their response to environmental change. Under this project, Dr Mark Nuttall (Research Associate) studiedthe conflicting uses made of indigenous knowledge by governmentagencies and native groups in Alaska. He showed how an advancedlegal system and the use of databases are making this knowledgeinto a commodity, which is feeding back into the educational curriculumand affecting the perceptions of native peoples themselves. His counterparts in Siberia, Dr Nikolai Vakhtin and Dr Igor Krupnik(Research Associates), studied indigenous ideas about human relationswith animals and their shared use of space in Chukotka. They establishedthat indigenous knowledge is now becoming a matter of individualchoice as a politicial statement. However, this attempt at revivalis not backed up by a corresponding development of laws and infrastructure. One lesson of this project is that rapid changes in the socialenvironment are proving as disruptive as those in the naturalenvironment. In the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), Dr Vitebsky andSally Wolfe (Phoenix Counselling Practice) studied family dynamics,gender, and kinship in the transmission of knowledge. Ms Wolfestudied gender relations and psychotherapeutic problems associatedwith rapid social change. Dr Vitebsky studied the impact of theskewed 'market economy' on reindeer herders and their land andthe unofficial ways in which people are regrouping themselvesand activating dormant kinship links in order to utilise resources.Arnt-Øve Eikeland (Visiting Scholar) studied the recentoutbreak of suicide among young Saami in Karasjok in order toplace it in a comparative circumpolar perspective. Dr Vitebsky and John Tichotsky (Research Student) spent a monthin Barrow, Alaska, working with the North Slope Borough's Departmentof Wildlife to support two indigenous organizations in Chukotkadocumenting the behaviour of whales. The project also involvedAcademy of Sciences institutes in Moscow and Vladivostok and hasempowered 50 Siberian indigenous leaders to intervene as expertsin resource management issues at the local and national levels. Dr Vitebsky also worked on shamanism, the religious heart of traditionalArctic cultures. He published The shaman, a worldwide survey thatrelates the forms of shamanism in Siberia and the rest of theArctic to other forms throughout the world. With Dr Anatoly Alekseyevof Yakutsk State University (Visiting Scholar), he studied theritual of a 107-year old Evenk shamaness in Siberia. Another prominent theme was ethnicity. Dr Vitebsky hosted fivedelegates from the new European University of St Petersburg fora month's study of teaching and administration methods underthe progamme on 'Establishing ethnic research in Russia,' fundedunder the EU's TEMPUS-TACIS scheme. Paul Fryer (Research Student)spent six months in the Komi Republic studying the social implicationsof a new university course on Komi language, history, and culturewith which it is intended to train a new generation of administrators.David Anderson (Research Student) completed his thesis on emergingideas of ethnicity among the Dolgan and Evenk of the Taimyr peninsula,showing the progression from the local multivariate identity toa state-induced univariate identity. Martin Whittles (ResearchStudent) continued his research on the Inuvialuit of Banks Islandin Canada. A further theme has been relating local sustainable needs to economicdevelopment on the regional level, by finding common ground betweenmineral resource development and local pastoral or subsistenceactivities. Dr Vitebsky and Tichotsky served as staff membersof the Sakha-American Business Centre in Yakutsk, where they facilitateda research and training programme in reindeer meat marketing thatenabled 20 indigenous people to train in Alaska in meat processingand marketing and encouraged the Sakha Republic to use hard-currencydiamond earnings to purchase meat processing equipment. Workingwith the University of Alaska, Tichotsky also organised a programmeon oil and gas capital market training, which sent 30 Sakha participantsto Alaskan petroleum facilities to study market-oriented projectdesign. Tichotsky also continued work on his PhD thesis on the regionaleconomy of the Sakha Republic, the chief diamond-producing regionin Russia. He visited Alaska, Chukotka, and the Sakha Republicto collect economic data. Tatiana Argounova (MPhil Student) studiedthe legal basis of the federal relationship between the SakhaRepublic (Yakutia) and the Russian Federation in the negotiationof autonomy and sovereignty. A further focus of the group's work was in environmental impactand pollution control. Marina Gridina (MPhil Student) studiedNordic initiatives to control pollution in Norilsk and the Kol'skiyPoluostrov. Ben Seligman (Research Student) studied the evolutionof Russian Arctic gas pipeline design, construction, and operation,paying special attention to environmental issues, such as pipeline-permafrostinteractions and the causes and consequences of pipeline deformationand displacement. Members of the group also studied a number of other topics. MarkBadger (PhD student) continued his comparison of participatoryindigenous film-making among the Koyukon in Alaska and the Khantyin western Siberia. Johnny-Leo Ludviksen (Visiting Scholar) studiedrelations between reindeer herders and the oil industry in theNenets Autonomous Okrug. Profesor Wendy Arundale studied historicalsites and worked on an oral life history of a Koyukon elder inAlaska. Dr Anna Sirina, of the Regional Museum in Irkutsk, workedas a British Academy Fellow on traditional environmental knowledgeamong the peoples around Lake Baikal. Polar Ecology and Management Group Dr B. Stonehouse, Senior associate P.K. Crosbie, P. Davis, A. Dey, D. Enzenbacher, A.J. Nimon The work of this group has included ecological and environmentalissues in both polar regions, with particular emphasis on polartourism. From late November 1994 to late February 1995 a team of four occupiedthe Institute's Antarctic research station on Cuverville Island,Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula. As in the previous season, KimCrosbie (Research Student) led the party. She was accompaniedby Amanda Nimon (Research Student), Amanda Ellerback, and SeanStephen (Engineer, Station manager). Dr Stonehouse visited thestation several times during the season. This season's work roundedoff studies of Cuverville Island and the Errera Channel area begunin 1992, including topographic and botanical surveys; censusesof penguin, skua, gull, shag, and tern populations; an examinationof ways in which the area was used by visiting tour parties; anddevising optimal strategies between penguins and visitors. Onthe strength of the team's findings, the draft management proposalsfor Cuverville Island and the Errera Channel have been updated.At the end of the season, the station was removed and the sitecleared. Between November and March, Dr Stonehouse made nine cruises withseveral tour operators, investigating ship operations, developingmethods of cruise reporting, and surveying landing sites. Topographicalsurveys were undertaken by Kenneth Blaiklock, a veteran surveyorwith many years' Antarctic experience, who has been collatinginformation from British Antarctic Survey and UK HydrographicOffice archives. In the field, he developed a method of rapidmapping using paired GPS receivers, a plane table, and other simpleequipment, to produce maps on scales of about 1:200. The ecologicalsurvey work was assisted by Ms Jasmine Minbashian, a graduateecologist from University of Washington. Results of these surveys are being accumulated on the Institutelanding site database, which currently holds details of 180 Antarcticsites that are used or have been used for tourist landings. Draftmanagement recommendations, prepared for several of the most popularsites where flora, fauna, or historic relics are considered tobe at risk, have been circulated to selected cruise operatorsfor comment and amendment during the 1995-1996 season. Forms designed to simplify cruise reporting were field-testedby a team of experienced cruise staff, including Peter Speak,Greg Mortimer, and Sylvia Stevens. Thomas Bauer, a senior lecturerin the Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management at VictoriaUniversity for Technology, Melbourne, are intended to help inprofiling cruise passengers and predicting the market for Antarctictourism. Logisitic help for this season's work was generously given byseveral cruise operators, notably Quark and Noble Caledonia. From 1 December 1994 to 28 February 1995 a display of the group'swork was mounted at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geneva, inan exhibition entitled 'The polar regions, the Alps and climaticchange,' presented by the International Committee for CryosphereEcostystems. The exhibition covered environmental issues in bothpolar regions and the European Alps, with emphasis on conservationin changing environments. In the course of the year, three research students, Debra Enzenbacher,Pamela Davis, and Anity Dey, completed their doctoral researchand were awarded PhD degrees. Polar History and Humanities Group Dr B. Riffenburgh C. Holland, H.G.R. King, Professor Ian WhitakerP. Speak, Dr J. West, M.P. Casarini-Wadhams During the year, the Polar History and Humanities Group and itscorresponding members continued with a wide range of research,dealing with polar, maritime, and exploration history and Arctichumanities studies. Dr Beau Riffenburgh continued his research into the relationshpsamong popular culture, nationalism, nineteenth-century Europeanimperial expansion, and the exploration of the Arctic and Africa.In conjunction with members of the Faculty of History at bothCambridge and Lancaster universities, he continued research intothe role of the British popular press in the creation, dissemination,and effect of imperial heroic exploration myths in the nineteenthand early twentieth centuries. He also furthered his researchinto the life and contributions of James Gordon Bennett Jr, oneof the major sponsors of exploration in the last third of thenineteenth century. In addition to three books written with Senior Associate Dr ElizabethCruwys - all of which were published during the year - Dr Riffenburghcontinued his work on the edited diaries and journals of the nineteenth-centuryAmerican Arctic explorer George W. Melville, to be published as The Great Arctic Searches. Dr Terence Armstrong (Senior Associate) continued his work onthe history of the Northern Sea Route as part of a collaborativeproject with Norwegian and Russian scholars, under the InternationalNorthern Sea Route Programme coordinated by the Fritjof NansenInstitute in Oslo. This sea route, if viable on a commercial scale,could revolutionise world shipping. David Anderson (Research Student,Social Science Group) also wrote a report for this programme. Dr Armstrong died on 21 February 1996 Professor Ian Whitaker (Senior Associate) continued his studieson trade between the European Arctic and Middle East during theMiddle Ages. He also conducted research on the changing patternsof reindeer management among Saami of Karesuando. Dr Janet West, in collaboration with Arthur G. Credland, wroteScrimshaw: the art of the whaler, the first British book specificallydevoted to scrimshaw. It was published to accompany an exhibitionentitled 'Time on their hands,' held in autumn 1995 at the TownDocks Museum in Hull. Maria Pia Casarini-Wadhams (Research Student) continued researchfor her doctoral thesis entitled Lady Jane Franklin and her rolein the Franklin searches, 1848-1860.' Using the 150 volumes ofFranklin's diaries and correspondence housed in the SPRI archives,her thesis is an examination of the impact of Lady Franklin onthe search expeditions, both those sent out by the Admiralty andthose that were privately sponsored. Teaching and lectures MPhil in Polar Studies Eight students successfully completed the course for the Masterof Philosophy in Polar Studies. The course involved some 65 seminarpapers that were presented by the staff of the Institute, visitors,and invited speakers from outside Cambridge. The course directorwas Dr John Heap. The students were assessed on the basis of a20,000-word thesis and six essay papers. The theses are availablein the Institute Library, and the students and their thesis titleswere: Tatiana Argunova: Federal relations between Yakutsk and Moscow. Bill Barber: Science, politics, and the International WhalingCommission: the decision-making processes affecting whale management. Brett Fotheringham: The Southern Whale Fishery Company, AucklandIslands. Marina Gridina: Nordic initiatives to reduce industrial pollutionin the Kola Peninsula. Cary Haggard: Northern Canadian development and the indigenouspopulation in the era of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). Tim Hunt: The influence of polar exploration and discovery onthe development of geomagnetic instruments in the early nineteenthcentury. Ingibjorg Jonsdottir: Sea ice off the coast of Iceland in thetwentieth century. Jay Klinck: Ice sheet stations: design concepts for increasinglife-spans. Teaching Dr Gareth Rees contributed several core lectures and the modulein glaciology and oceanography to the MPhil in Geographic InformationSystems and Remote Sensing. Dr Peter Wadhams gave four lectures for the Part II GeographicalTripos on glacial studies during the Michaelmas Term. Dr GarethRees contributed a course of lectures on remote sensing to final-yearphysics undergraduates at the Cavendish Laboratory. During Michaelmas Term, Dr Beau Riffenburgh presented a course on 'Popular imperialism and European exploration, 1800-1914' as part of the 'Expansionof Europe' paper in the Part I History Tripos. Conferences held and attended Dr Peter Wadhams was co-organiser, with Professor Julian Dowdeswell(University of Wales, Aberystwyth) and Andrew Schofield (CambridgeEngineering Department), of a Royal Society discussion meetingon 'The Arctic and environmental change," which was heldat the Royal Institution, London, 12-13 October 1994. Fourteenpapers were presented, covering atmospheric changes, ozone loss,solar irradiance, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, sea ice,physical oceanography, glaicers, permafrost, and ice core records.These included a paper by Dr Wadhams on 'Arctic sea ice extentand thickness.' The proceedings of the conference were publishedin Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A352, 1699(25 August 1995) and are also to be published as a book by Gordonand Breach. On the day after the discussion meeting, many of thedelegates remained for a further day's discussion meeting, underthe auspices of the CIBA Foundation, on 'Rapid climatic change.' Dr Wadhams gave an invited paper on 'Antarctic sea ice properties'at the 'First Latin American conference on Antarctic science,'at São Paulo, Brazil, November 1994. He also gave an invitedpaper on 'Ice characteristics in the 1993 Odden' at the 'Nordicseas symposium,' Hamburg, March 1995. That same month, he gavean evening lecture, with M.P. Casarini-Wadhams and Barry Ranford,entitled 'In search of Franklin,' at the Royal Geographical Society,.In June, he presented an invited paper entitled 'The Ocean DrillingProgram in Fram Strait: a case study of the use of ice chartsto predict the probability of ice-free conditions' at the 5thInternational conference of the International Society of Offshoreand Polar Engineers (ISOPE), The Hague. In July 1995, he gavea paper on SAR imaging of waves in sea ice at IGARSS '95 (Internationalgeoscience and remote sensing symposium) in Florence, as wellas an invited paper at the 'International symposium on environmentalresearch in the Arctic,' Tokyo. He and Mrs Casarini-Wadhams eachgave lectures for a special session on John Franklin at the OrkneyScience Festival, 8-11 September 1995. Dr Wadhams was invited by the US Office of Naval Research (ONR)to be an expert participant in a technical meeting in Washington,DC, on the conversion of nuclear submarines for civilian scientificuse, October 1994. As a PI for the ONR SIMI Program (Sea Ice MechanicsInitiative), he attended a 'Symposium on sea ice mechanics andArctic modelling,' in Anchorage, Alaska, April 1995, and gavea paper on results of the Institute's work. As a member of GLOCHANT(Working Group on Global Change in the Antarctic, Scientific Committeeon Antarctic Research), he attended a meeting in Tokyo, April1995, to draw up an international research plan for Antarcticsea ice and climate change. As a member of the IASC (InternationalArctic Science Committee) Working Group on Climate Change, heattended meetings in Stockholm, December 1994, and Groningen,September 1995, to plan an Arctic regional research programme.Dr Wadhams was appointed to a committee of three (with ProfessorDowdeswell and Professor T. Callaghan) to draw up an Arctic researchstrategy for NERC, which was published in October 1995. Dr Gareth Rees spoke at a meeting of the ESRC/NERC joint workinggroup on collaborative research in the Arctic, held at Cambridgein October 1994, and presented a paper at the 'NATO advanced researchworkshop on disturbance and recovery of Arctic terrestrial ecosystems,'held at Rovaniemi, Finland, in September 1995. Andrew Bingham (Research Student) presented papers at IGARSS '95in July, and at the British Branch meeting of the InternationalGlaciological Society at Leeds in September 1995. Daniel Feltham (Research Student) attended the NERC course ingeophysical fluid dynamics at Cambridge in July 1995. Dr Piers Vitebsky taught an intensive residential course in Tromsøfor Norwegian research students working in the former Soviet Unionand Eastern Europe. He lectured to the Scientific and MedicalNetwork in Cambridge and became an editorial advisor to the journalEnvironment and History. In Yakutsk he took part in the Ministryof the Environment's 'Conference on environmental futures' andthe inaugural meeting of the Association of Reindeer Herders ofthe Sakha Republic. He also participated in a conference of therevivalist Kut Sur society in Yakutsk and a conference of pagansat the University of Newcastle. Dr Vitebsky hosted the annual conference of the Common PropertyForum of the Nordic Council, the first time this was held outsidea Nordic country. Dr Mark Nuttall helped organise a joint meetingbetween the ESRC and NERC, on potential cooperation between thesocial and natural sciences in the Arctic. Library and Information Service W.J. Mills, Librarian and Information Officer S. Banks, P. Hogg, J. Pinhey, S. Sawtell, H. Shibata, I. Warren 1994/95 has witnessed the most extensive changes to the library'scomputing infrastructure since the introduction of the SPRILIBbibliographic database in 1985. Those familiar with the Institutein recent years will recall that in 1985 the card catalogue wasreplaced by a database loaded on innovatory Muscat informationretrieval software written by Dr Martin Porter. At the time, Muscat'sprincipal advantage was that, through relevance feedback and termweighting, readers could conduct quite sophisticated subjectand author searches without having to be taught the intricaciesof Boolean logic. Dr Porter has since demonstrated Muscat's considerablepower and flexibility in numerous supplementary programs, forexample, in providing the SPRILIST current awareness service,in typesetting camera-ready copy for Polar and Glaciological Abstracts,and in reformatting records for addition to the Arctic and AntarcticRegions CD-ROM and to MARC format for addition to the CambridgeUniversity Union Catalogue. During 1994/95, not only was SPRILIBreloaded on updated Muscat software to offer a greatly improveduser interface together with integrated acquisitions, accessions,and cataloguing modules, but, with the installation of the Institute'snetwork, it, together with a range of other information services,may now be accessed from the individual workstations of Institutestaff, students, and visitors. In 1995/96, our intention is tomake as many of these services as possible also accessible tothe international polar research community by means of the Internet. Of the special projects reported in last year's SPRI Review, goodprogress has continued to be made with the Historic AntarcticBibliography Project and with collaborative compilation of theAntarctic Bibliography with the Library of Congress. With regardto the former, the second major phase involving the processingof J.H. Roscoe's bibliography has now been completed and a startmade on the third phase centering on the 1951-1961 retrospectivebibliography originally compiled by the Library of Congress,fittingly with extensive collaboration from the Institute. Thesetwo major projects form part of a comprehensive strategy at theconclusion of which all significant Antarctic literature willbe made available through the Arctic and Antarctic Regions CD-ROMand Internet. Other significant developments this year have included the adoptionof the Institute as an IGBP Regional Information Centre, one ofapproximately 60 libraries receiving the full collection of IGBPreports and publications. The Librarian has also continued togather material for his forthcoming book 'Keyguide to informationsources on the polar and cold regions' (London: Mansell 1997).To date, by means of desk research and questionnaires, informationhas been collected on approximately 2000 research institutes,libraries, and museums with polar interests. Library acquisitions and cataloguing programmes A total of 2300 items were added to the library, including 850books. With no significant increase in funds available for purchasingbooks and periodicals, the Library is only able to continue toacquire so many items through the generosity of those who giveeither books or money. Among the latter, Mrs E.A. MacDonald, theSexton family, and Mr John Wright have been particularly generousin establishing bequests to preserve the memories of Captain MacDonald,David Sexton, and Dorothy Fetherstonhaugh, respectively, all ofwhom themselves contributed greatly to the Institute when living.A generous grant was also received from the Friends. This year'smost significant donation of books was received from Mr Alan B.Crawford, who presented his library of books and manuscripts aboutTristan da Cunha. Other numerous gifts were received from polarorganizations and authors. The Library is particularly gratefulto the latter, many of whom make a point of sending offprintsof their articles for addition to the collection and listing inSPRILIB and Polar and Glaciological Abstracts. By the end of theperiod covered, SPRILIB held 86,360 records, with 9751 recordsadded during the year. Approximately 14,500 monograph recordshad been added to the Cambridge University Union Catalogue. Library staff changes All those who have had dealings with World Data Centre C for Glaciologywill be aware of the contribution made by Ailsa Macqueen. As WDCManager, Mrs Macqueen was responsible for building up a collectioncovering all aspects of snow and ice that is without rival anywhere.Itinerant glaciologists will remember Ailsa for the warmth ofher welcome, her diligence, and unflagging enthusiasm. The newManager, Oliver Merrington, brings his own skills and abilityto the post and we are fortunate to have been able to appointto this post an information specialist of his information andscientific qualifications and general interest in glaciology. Library volunteers and work placements The Library continued to benefit greatly from work carried outby its growing team of volunteers. During the year, Mrs Pat Littlecompleted a recataloguing project in the course of which all booksin the collection published up to 1880 were added to SPRILIB.Given the uniqueness of the Library's early holdings, this isa major achievement. Making these records available through SPRILIBgreatly enhances their accessibility not only to those searchingSPRILIB within the Institute but also to all those with accessto the Arctic and Antarctic Regions CD-ROM on which SPRILIB isloaded. With the departure of Ailsa Macqueen, Ron Wilbraham tookover scanning The Times for items of polar interest, in additionto his existing duties as Honorary Map Curator. In this context,the work of A.G.E. Jones and many others who regularly send incuttings identified from a wide range of British and overseasnewspapers should be acknowledged with appreciation. Without theirhelp, the press cuttings collection would be restricted to itemsin The Times. The Library benefited greatly from the presenceof Chuen-chi Brace (National Library of Australia). During a periodof three months, Mrs Brace processed all remaining card recordsfor Antarctic botany before turning her attention to the sealsand sealing monographs and then to the glaciological monographs,for all of which SPRILIB records were created before her departure.Marcus West kindly assisted in the processing of material relatingto Spitsbergen. Work experience placements were found for Cheryl Stark, JacobPotter, Alistair Phillips, Stefan Starkie, and Susanne Steckel.Ms Steckel's ability to provide excellent German translationsfor the Historic Antarctic Bibliography Project proved particularlyhelpful and led to her being employed subsequently on a casualbasis in order to complete this work. World Data Centre C, Glaciology Manager: Ailsa Macqueen (until 31.12.94); Oliver Merrington (from 1.3.95) Following a review of WDC-C's activities and services, the RoyalSociety halved its funding. The Society has emphasized that whilstit considered WDC-C 'to fulfil an excellent purpose,' wider considerationsforced a decision to reduce funding, so that on the retirementof Mrs Macqueen, the post of Manager could only be filled on apart-time basis. The Institute was fortunate to find a well-qualifiedcandidate in Oliver Merrington (MSc, C Biol, MI Biol, MI InfSc)to take up this post. Merrington was previously Head of LibraryServices for a large agribusiness research site. He also bringsto the post extensive Internet and World-Wide Web experience.Acquiring the range of specialist skills and knowledge necessaryfor discharge of all of the duties of WDC-C Manager cannot bean overnight accomplishment, but progress has been made and anotable development has been the establishment of the Ice andSnow database consisting of more than 25,000 glaciological recordsand the first Institute facility to be made accessible over theInternet, see: http://www.muscat.co.uk/ccdp/spri/wdccg.html. Merrington is focusing his attention particularly on identifyingthe best means by which WDC-C's unmatched collection and servicesmay be made accessible to all glaciologists, not just to thosebased in the Institute or those fortunate enough to be able tovisit Cambridge. Among the latter, WDC-C has continued to attracta stream of visiting scientists, this year's visitors coming fromCanada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, andthe United States. Archives and Museum R.K. Headland, Archivist and museum curator A. Billinghurst, P. Hogg, R. Wilbraham The services of both the museum and archives continued to caterto a very wide variety of inquirers. This was made easier andmore efficient because revenue continued to be available to employan assistant, Phillipa Hogg, on a regular basis. Much volunteerhelp was provided by Mr Tony Billinghurst with the photographsand Mr Ron Wilbraham with archival and museum work. The occasion of the centenary of the International GeographicalCongress, which adopted the resolution initiating a major concentrationon Antarctic exploration, was commemorated by a colloquium inSandefjord, Norway. This provided another opportunity to reinforcelinks with Norwegian activities, especially as the new Directorof the South Georgia Whaling Museum was also able to attend. Theoccasion was also that of founding of an 'Antarktisk Forum' withthe object of centralising information held privately by severalfamilies descendent from those involved in the exploration atthe beginning of this century. Copies of certain material heldat the Institute have been provided to Norwegian organizations,and a list of archives held there is in preparation. Requeststo lecture aboard passenger vessels were again accepted, which,as well as maintaining practical contact with the polar regions,allowed direct experience of the changing state of affairs inthe Arctic. The number of readers requesting documents and callers to seeartifacts was approximately the same as in the previous year.Visitors came from many associated institutes, including representativesfrom the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage, Terres Australes et AntarctiquesFrançaise (for Iles Kerguelen historical material), EstonianAcademy of Sciences, Russian Institute of Geography, and RoaldAmundsens Minne. Questions in correspondence continued to be voluminous,although a proportion of inquirers were advised to visit to conducttheir own research. Archives A somewhat greater number of readers were accommodated than duringthe previous year and, even with additional staff, the importanceof the booking system became apparent. A small increase in generalinquiries also occurred and the customary information requestsfrom Crown Agents and various others continued. John Béchervaise's biography of John Rymill was publishedin the spring, and the work by Admiral James Ross on the two polarRosses (John and James Clarke), based to a great extent on materialheld by the Institute, appeared shortly afterwards. The regularwork in maintaining the Antarctic chronology also continued (itnow exceeds 3800 entries). Several important acquisitions were made during this year, includingthe research collections of Mr Alan Crawford, a most comprehensiveset of material about Tristan da Cunha, Gough Island, Bouvetøya,the Prince Edward Islands, and other parts of this region. Thesepapers came in excellent order, which allowed them to be cataloguedquickly. Rev Gavin White kindly gave his research papers concerningthe Canadian Arctic, which were also incorporated quite rapidly.Gifts of original and copied manuscripts were received from severalother sources, which gave constant reminders of the generosityof benefactors and their consideration of the Institute. For many years papers from the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expeditionhave been received from several sources. A review of these confirmedthat the principal set was correct and provided a reasonably completeset of duplicates. These, with the consent of Sir Vivian Fuchs,were offered to the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme,which is maintaining one of the original 'Scott Base' huts onRoss Island, from where the New Zealand contingent of the expeditionworked. It is intended that these papers make their way to theisland to be part of the historical information available there. The monitoring of environmental conditions and conservation workcontinued. A new supplier of acid-free folders, suitable for thedocument cabinets, was found. Contributions from the Friends ofSPRI for archival conservation were particularly useful. Museum Visitor numbers were slightly greater, particularly because ofthe new 'Science at the Poles' exhibition maintained in cooperationwith the British Antarctic Survey. This was improved with largecolour prints generously provided by the Survey. The publicationof Admiral Ross' book was a timely excuse for a display on 'ThePolar Rosses.' This exhibited a range of published and manuscriptworks, including a flag and a pennant that flew over the Arcticand the Antarctic approximately 150 years ago. A small exhibitionto show some of the history of Scott Polar Research Institutewas arranged prior to the seventy-fifth anniversary commemorations. Several visiting groups were again accommodated and a small increasein booked school parties occurred. Attention was drawn to thestate of Edward Bransfield's grave in Brighton and 'redevelopment'of the cemetery. Liaison with the Royal Commission on HistoricalMonuments may help its preservation. The largest gift received,from a physical aspect, was a portrait of the Arctic explorerFrederick Jackson, given by his regiment. He appears in polarclothing; the portrait awaits cleaning and display in a Franz-JosefLand exhibition. Plates of some of the Institute's scrimshaw weremade available for a comprehensive work on the subject by Dr JanetWest, prepared in cooperation with the Hull Maritime Museum. Useful revenue was received from the public donation box, butthere was one unfortunate occurrence. A large plate window wassmashed by thieves and the box robbed. Much stronger glass andother precautions are now present. As for many years previously,the contribution from several of the Friends of the Institutein invigilating the museum and assisting with sales was invaluable,especially during the busy summer and tourist season. Polar Publications Four issues of Polar Record were published, and the journal continuedits development under the editor, Dr Beau Riffenburgh, as an internationallyrefereed journal of polar research for the science, social sciences,and humanities. The April 1995 issue was a special double issuededicated to the proceedings of the 'Third circumpolar symposiumon remote sensing of Arctic environments,' which was held in Fairbanks,Alaska, 16-20 May 1994. For the first time, this issue carriedextensive colour photography. The editor was greatly assistedin the production of Polar Record by Dr Elizabeth Cruwys, MrsAilsa Macqueen, Dr Peter Clarkson, and Stephen Wells. A long-awaited book, Polar pundit: reminiscences about Brian BirleyRoberts, was published in April 1995 after extensive efforts byMr H.G.R. King, Mrs Ann Savours, and the editor. Visitors to the Institute Long-term visitors to the Institute in 1994-95 included ProfessorWendy Arundale (University of Alaska), Dr Albert Baiburin (EuropeanUniversity of St Petersburg), Professor T.H.

Friends of the Scott Polar Research Institute We welcome new members and thank all for their support. Subscriptionsand donations amounting to £4518.56 were received duringthe year. This support, which is gratefully acknowledged, wasused to purchase additions for the collections and to conservearchival material. We thank Ron Wilbraham and Tony Billinghurst for their regularhelp with the map collection and archives, respectively. Thanksare also due to Robert Menzies, Jean Salingar, and Mary Swithinbankfor their continuing help with the museum shop. We would also like to thank two members of the SPRI staff: TeresaClarke, who created the database and instigated the updatingand modernising of the records of the Friends of the Scott PolarResearch Institute, and Jennifer Dale, the new membership secretary,who implemented these procedures. Gino Watkins Memorial Fund The fund, under the joint trusteeship of the University of Cambridgeand the Royal Geographical Society, gives grants towards expeditionsthat meets its objectives of guiding and inspiring enterprisingyoung people towards scientific research and exploration in thepolar regions. We thank the Augustine Courtauld Trust for a contributionof £7000 this year. Grants were made as follows: Iceland Research 1995 - £300 Northern Vatnajokull Expediton, Iceland 1995 - £600 University of Leeds, Svalbard Expedition 1995 - £800 Imperial College Diving Expedition, Greenland 1995 - £1500 The British-Norwegian Spitsbergen Traverse 1996 - £1500 Queens University, Belfast, Arctic Norway Expedition - £600 Keele University, West Greenland Expedition - £300 Alaska 95 - £800 UHSU Svalbard Expedition 95 - £300 Greenland Expedition 95 - £1000 British Trans-Spitsbergen Expedition - £800 Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) of the InternationalCouncil of Scientific Unions (ICSU) is housed within the Institute.Dr P.D. Clarkson and Mrs P. Richmond continued as Executive Secretaryand Secretary, respectively, throughout the year. In April 1995, Dr Clarkson represented SCAR at a workshop on 'Airtransport networks in Antarctica,' and presented a paper on Airtransport needs for science in Antarctica.' The workshop was organisedby the Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations(SCALOP) of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes(COMNAP) in Washington, DC. In May 1995, SCAR was represented at the XIXth Antarctic TreatyConsultative Meeting (XIX ATCM) in Seoul, North Korea, by ProfessorA.C. Rocha-Campos, Dr D.W.H. Walton, and Dr Clarkson. The meetingwelcomed the offer made by SCAR and the COMNAP to hold two workshopson the subject of environmental monitoring in the Antarctic. TheExecutive Secretary attended and serviced the first of these workshopsheld in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995. Also during May 1995, Dr Clarkson serviced a workshop on VostokLake, hosted by the Scott Polar Research Institute on behalf ofthe French, Russian, and United States National Committees forSCAR. The SCAR Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservationheld its meeting (GOSEAC VII) at the New Zealand Antarctic Programmeheadquarters in Christchurch, New Zealand, during June 1995. DrClarkson took part in and serviced the meeting. The Executive Secretary also serviced the meeting of the SCARExecutive Committee in Siena, Italy, during September 1995. Amajor item for the meeting was the redrafting of the SCAR Constitutionand Rules of Procedure. Four issues of SCAR Bulletin (nos 115-118) were published withinPolar Record and as separates during the year with the assistanceof Polar Publications. SCAR continues its principal functions to initiate, promote, andcoordinate scientific research in the Antarctic, and also providesscientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System. International Glaciological Society Dr Simon Ommanney, Secretary General The Society continued its service to the glaciological community,its publishing activities, and the organization of symposia aroundthe world from its headquarters within the Scott Polar ResearchInstitute. Access to its office is now possible through the Interneton the following email address: (100751.1667@compuserve.com). In 1995 the Society published three issues of the Journal of Glaciologyand three issues of ICE, the News Bulletin of the InternationalGlaciological Society. Douglas MacAyeal (University of Chicago)continued as chief editor of the Journal, with copy editing doneby Ray Adie and Ken Moxham. The proceedings of the 'Internationalsymposium on the role of the cryosphere in global change' (Columbus,Ohio, 1994) were published in July as Annals of Glaciology 21.All publications are available from the IGS office. The 'International symposium on glacier erosion and sedimentation'was held in Reykjavik, Iceland, in August 1995. The overall organizationwas done by the Secretary General, with local arrangements thougha Icelandic committee headed by Helgi Bjornsson. The proceedingswill be published as Annals of Glaciology 22, edited by DavidCollins (University of Manchester). The IGS is collaborating with the European Science Foundationin publishing the proceedings of the 'EISMINT international symposiumon ice sheet modelling,' held in Chamonix, France, in September1995. These are scheduled to be published as Annals of Glaciology23, and will be edited by Kolumban Hutter (Technische HochschuleDarmstadt). Planning for future symposia continued. For 1996, the IGS is organizingthe 'International symposium on representation of the cryospherein climate and hydrological models,' in Victoria, Canada, from12-15 August. It is a co-sponsor of a workshop on 'Changing glaciers:revising themes and field sites of classical glaciology,' to beheld in Fjaerland, Norway from 24-26 June, and will publish theproceedings of this meeting in the Annals of Glaciology. The IGSis also co-sponsor of the 'IXth international symposium on thephysics and chemistry of ice,' being held at Dartmouth College,Hanover, New Hampshire, 27-31 August. In 1997 the IGS is organizing an 'International symposium onsnow and avalanches' in Chamonix, France, 25-29 May, and one on'Antarctica and global change,' in collaboration with the AntarcticCRC in Hobart, Tasmania, 14-18 July. For 1998 the Society hasaccepted an invitation to meet in Sweden to discuss the interactionbetween ice sheets and landscapes. The Secretary General attended the one-hundredth anniversary meetingof the Comitato Glaciologico Italiano, in Torino and presenteda paper on 100 years of glacier observations in Canada, whichwill be published in Geografica Fisica e Dinamica Quaternaria.

Headland Archivist's Assistant Philippa Hogg Scholars wishing to use these SPRI departments should make an appointment with the Archivist: rkh10@cus.cam.ac.uk or his Assistant: pmeh2@cus.cam.ac.uk Telephone: Cambridge 336555/336552 (national 01223, international +44 1223) Fax: Cambridge 336549 Telex: 812420 CAMSPL G Museum - opening hours The museum is open to the public between 14:30 and 16:00 on Monday to Saturday (with the exception of some public and university holidays and a few other days) Archives The Institute's Archives hold one of the largest collections of manuscript and other unpublished material relating to the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and to many persons who have worked there. The catalogue of the Archives was published in 1982 Manuscripts in the Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge, England by Clive Holland; (London and New York, Garland Publishing, ISBN 0 8240 9394 1). Supplementary indices are available for material received subsequently. About half the collection is of Antarctic interest and covers all parts of the continent and islands. Of that which relates to the Arctic the exploration of northern Canada is particularly well represented, although all other regions are covered to some extent (notably Greenland and Svalbard). Detailed chronologies of Arctic exploration, largely based on SPRI records, appeared in 1978 as The exploration of northern Canada by Alan Cooke and Clive Holland; (Toronto, Arctic History Press, ISBN 0 7710 2265 4) and in 1994 as Arctic exploration and development c.500 B.C. to 1915 by Clive Holland; (New York and London, Garland Press, ISBN 0 8240 7648 6) In 1989 a Chronological list of Antarctic expeditions and related historical events was publishedby Robert Headland; (Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0 521 309034) and an unpublished revision of this to 1994 is also available. The material held in the Archives has been received from a large variety of sources. The majority has been given and some deposited on loan. It includes some very recent important additions which demonstrate the continued generosity of several benefactors. Other material is sometimes acquired by purchase. Presently, prices for items with polar interest are high and increasing, thus fund raising forms a substantial part of the Institute's work and is a significant problem for the collections. A note on requirements for access to manuscript and other archival items at the Institute is available from the Archivist who will advise on particular fields of investigation. It is necessary to make an appointment to use the material; some periods may be restricted owing to prior bookings, special events, and availability of staff. Archival material is not made available outside the Institute. Library and map collection The Institute also houses the world's largest Arctic and Antarctic library. Readers using thearchives also have access to the published material, including the large collection of maps and charts. Museum Curator R.K. Headland The Scott Polar Research Institute's Museum holds a collection of artifacts, paintings, drawings, photographs (including cinematographic film, lantern slides, and Daguerreotypes), and other material. A proportion of this is exhibited in a private museum on the ground floor which is freely open to persons with an interest in polar regions, between 14:30 and 16:00 on Monday to Saturday (with the exception of some public and university holidays and a few other days). A note on admission and group bookings is available from the Curator. As well as the permanent exhibits, the Museum arranges a Special Exhibition annually and occasionally displays other items of particular interest. Some display cabinets have books, postcards, posters, and other items which may be purchased from the Inquiry Office. The museum catalogue is not published but is available to visitors by appointment. However,Tim Hunt has written a short guide to the Museum Acquisition of museum material has been principally by gift. Access conditions for collectionsnot on display are similar to those for archival materials. Copies of items in the Institute's collections, including paintings and photographs, can be supplied for publication; a note on these and other conditions is available from the Curator. The museum does not lend artifacts or other materials. The University of Cambridge Publications Department included a description of the SPRI Museum, in the Reporter on 23 March 1995.

An association for those who are interested in the Scott Polar Research Institute and who wish to help its work. This association was established in March 1946 with two objectives: first, to provide a means whereby those interested in the promotion of polar exploration and research might assist the Scott Polar Research Institute, itself founded in 1920; second, to keep members in touch both with the Institute and with present polar activities. What do the Friends do? The objectives of the Friends are to assist in the development of the Scott Polar Research Institute as: a centre for the stimulation of interest in the Polar Regions; in their peoples and environments, and in the relationship of those environments to the world as a whole; a centre of excellence in polar scholarship and research; an international information centre dedicated to the collection, organisation, and dissemination of knowledge about the Arctic and Antarctic; a centre for the collection, maintenance and display of materials relating to the history of the polar regions. The Friends have provided valuable funding to help various aspects of the Institute�s work. Subscriptions are mainly used to help with the acquisition and preservation of material for the Institute�s archives. They also provide help for the Library and Museum in other ways, particularly the cases of special need that cannot be met from other sources. You are encouraged to join the Friends and help support this pre-eminent research institute. How do I join? Send a message to Dr. Pam Davis, Public Relations Coordinator, at pbd1000@cam.ac.uk who will be happy to send you a membership form and answer any other questions you may have.

It is very much a work in progress and information about other museums, as well as corrections toexisting entries - heavens, forbid! - are welcomed. The directory was compiled byWilliam Mills, Librarian and Information Officer at the Scott Polar ResearchInstitute, as part of a new reference work Keyguide to information sources on the polar and cold regions (Mansell, 1997). However, so much information has now been gathered on so many subjects thatthis museums directory has been spun off as a separate resource. Additional information can be sent to me at wjm13@cam.ac.uk. Those interested in historic sites associated with the exploration of Antarctic shouldsee the related site Low-Latitude Antarctic Gazetteer maintained by Robert B. Stephenson.

Research Interests Sea ice is a thin, fragile, dynamic solid that forms under the thermodynamic conditions that prevail near the Earth�s poles. Sea ice acts as a barrier to the transfer of moisture, heat and momentum between the oceans and the atmosphere and plays an important role in the formation of deep water masses. Throughout the year, sea ice cover varies between about a twentieth to a thirtieth of the Earth�s surface but has a disproportionately large role in the climate system of the Earth. Sea ice research on macroscopic scales is a well established, important and ongoing activity. Dr. Peter Wadhams, of SPRI, has pioneered much of this work. My research focuses on smaller scales and the fundamental physics involved, in the hope that this will lead to understanding and parameterisation of critical phenomena for use in climate models. When seawater freezes, salt is expelled from the solid in a concentrated salt solution called brine. My research involves the use of analytical mathematical techniques to solve fluid dynamical problems to do with processes involving brine drainage and solidification. To date, I have used simple analytical models to investigate the qualitative effect that deformations of the sea ice cover have on brine drainage. Up to half of the volume of sea ice is in the form of ridges caused by deformation. Ridges are formed by sea ice movements induced by ocean, wind, and internal stresses. I have also investigated some models of the stability of the interface between heavy brine in sea ice and the less dense underlying ocean. I have investigated the effect of ocean shear on the underside of the sea ice on brine drainage within the ice. I am currently investigating the effect ocean shear has on the stability of the region of sea ice growth, the mushy layer. This extends previous work done on instabilities in mushy layers in the context of the solidification of binary alloys. Amongst the most important analytical techniques I have been using are scaling analysis and exact and approximate (though still analytical) methods of solving partial differential equations such as similarity solutions, eigenfunction expansions, Green�s functions and asymptotic methods. I have been using these methods to obtain solutions to problems arising from the application of boundary conditions to systems of dynamical equations such as the Navier-Stokes equation and conservation equations for heat and solute. The analytical nature of my work means that the solutions to the problems I have been tackling can in principle and practice be applied to problems of a seemingly unconnected nature. My latest work, for example, in addition to promising insights into how sea ice forms in typical polar conditions also has application to the solidification of alloy castings.

Abstract: During winter the central Greenland Sea periodically experiences low air temperatures coupled with high winds. In combination with favourable oceanographic conditions this can lead to the formation of a sea ice feature knownas the Odden. This sea ice formation is associated with a salt flux to the upper surface waters. Passive microwave data from the SSM/I instrumentoffer the most promising method for monitoring the sea ice on a daily basis, a timescale over which Odden is shown to vary significantly. Due to the high waveenergy present in the area solid ice sheet formation is inhibited and the predominantice types have been shown to be frazil and pancake. We examine the signatureof these ice types in the passive microwave data and discuss the implications for accurately quantifying their areal extent. The Validation of ERS-1 SAR Data for Antarctic Summer Sea Ice. Douglas Low, Peter Wadhams, Stephen Wells. Poster, UK Oceanography '96, Bangor, Wales, 1996. Abstract: During February 1995 a team of researchers from the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI)collected ground truth data for ERS-1 SAR imagery of sea ice in the northwest region of theWeddell Sea, Antarctica. The team conducted a sea ice physics programme at 21 stations onsea ice floes and icebergs over a period of 6 days from the Royal Navy vessel HMSEndurance. Aerial photography runs and oceanographic transects were carried out from theship during this time. A detailed study of 12 SAR.PRI images was compared with thethicknesses, salinity and temperature profiles and snow data from first year and multiyearfloes and icebergs. The high thicknesses of the floes, approximately half were thicker than2.50m, indicated multiyear ice. The very low salinities, high ice temperatures, lack of snowand extensive melt ponding evident in the aerial photographs suggest a relatively warmsummer melt season in the far northwestern Weddell Sea similar to that found in the Arctic.Melt pond coverage of floes ranged from 0.2-16.0%, with an overall mean of 5.8% for 11February and 7.1% for 14 February. In addition, the SAR images indicate that between 11February and 14 February, the backscatter (�o) values for most ice types (multiyear floes,pack ice, brash ice and icebergs) dropped by approximately 3dB. Physical Properties of the Odden from Remote Sensing and Field Work. Jeremy Wilkinson, Peter Wadhams, Eileen Aldworth. Poster, UK Oceanography '96, Bangor, Wales, 1996. Abstract: During winter a 'tongue' of sea ice usually forms in the Greenland Sea between the latitudes 72 N and 75 N. Known to generations of Scandinavian fishermen as 'Odden' (Norwegian for peninsula), the tongue protrudes several hundred kilometers in a north-east direction from the main East Greenland ice edge. Using a combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) imagery it has be shown that rapid changes in size, shape and position of the Odden can occur in the order of days. These rapid oscillations can lead to high salt fluxes, and therefore the Odden could play an important role in the formation of deep water in the Greenland Sea.On various occasions, during the winter of 1993, the Odden was visited by F.S.Polarstern and M.V.Northern Horizon as a component of the European Subpolar Ocean Programme (ESOP is an EC funded programme under the MAST II initiative), and the first intensive study of the physical properties was initiated. It was found that the Odden consisted primarily of pancake ice whose salinity on some occasions reflected that of multiyear ice. SAR and SSM/I images were also obtained and the various ice types classified.With ESOP drawing to a close, we interpret the satellite and in situ data collected during these cruises, and look at some of the questions that may be answered in the forthcoming ESOP2.

This obituary is by Harry King, the former Librarian of SPRI, and is taken from The Guardian, 29 February 1996. Our friend in the far north Terence Armstrong, who has died aged 75, was Britain's leadingexpert on the Russian Arctic, whose support of Cambridge's Scott PolarResearch Institute for more than 36 years contributed largely to thedepartment's reputation as a centre of excellence. Educated at Winchester and Magdalene College, Cambridge, he tookfirst class honours in French and Russian, and was supervised by thatlegendary Russian teacher Dr (now Dame) Elizabeth Hill. In 1940Armstrong joined the Army Intelligence Corps. serving in North Africa,Italy and Holland - he was parachuted into Arnhem and wounded -Germany and Norway. Postwar he was the Scott Institute's first research fellow inSoviet Arctic studies, a post established on the reasoning that theRussians knew more about the Arctic than anyone else. Armstrongcovered the development of the Soviet north at a time when hard factsabout the area were few. Thus did the linguist metamorphose into ageographer. He chose the economic development of the Soviet northernsea route - the old Northeast Passage - for his 1952 thesis, beforeexamining the economic effects of sea ice on the route and carrying outstudies for the Royal Navy Scientific Survey. In 1954 he joined themaiden voyage of HMCS Labrador through the ice-packed North-west Passage. His observations led to an ice atlas, Sea ice north of the USSR (1958) a model for similar atlases covering Arctic and Antarctic waters. In 1957, following the incorporation of the institute into theuniversity, Armstrong was appointed an assistant director of research. Despite the additional duties he wrote Russian settlement in the North (1965), contributed to the Illustrated glossary of snow and ice (1966), and travelled throughout the Canadian north and the Soviet Arctic. His fluent Russian established contacts which led to exchange agreements with academies and libraries. The polar institute's collection of Russian language material is today one of the most comprehensive in the world. A 1970-72 sabbatical at the University of Alaska led to seminarson cross cultural education with representatives of the indigenousnorthern peoples. In a collaborative publication, The circumpolarnorth, Armstrong reviewed the Arctic and sub-Arctic's political andeconomic geography. He compiled a Unesco report on the Arctic'scultural and economic problems. In 1975 the polar institute initiated a polar studies M Phil. Itssuccess owed much to Armstrong's skills and charismatic, engagingpersonality. In 1976 he was awarded an ad hominem readership inArctic studies. He was a founder fellow of Clare Hall graduate college, and for 25years was joint honorary secretary of the Hakluyt Society, for whom heedited an edition of Yermak's voyages (1975). He was the GlaciologicalSociety's treasurer from 1965-1970; academic honours included theRoyal Geographical Society's Victoria medal. After retirement in 1983, he was a visiting professor at TrentUniversity, Ontario, and chaired the Natural Environment ResearchCouncil's working group on Arctic science policy. He also travelled,walked, and made music (he was an accomplished oboe player). Withhis wife Iris he contributed greatly to village life in Harston, where hewas churchwarden and treasurer for many years, and to entertaining awide circle of friends. He is survived also by two sons and twodaughters. © The Guardian HTML by William Mills, 4 September 1996 Go to SPRI home pageWT02-B08-237IA069-000427-B021-227http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk:80/rsg/rsgice.htm 131.111.118.70 19970113085157 text/html 2577HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 08:52:02 GMTServer: NCSA/1.4.2Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Thu, 29 Aug 1996 11:39:00 GMTContent-length: 2401 Sea ice and icebergs SEA ICE AND ICEBERGS The SPRI Remote Sensing Group carries outresearch into the applications of remote sensing methods to the polarmarine environment, especially sea ice and icebergs. Our research projectshave used both radar altimeter and passive microwave data to measure seaice concentration. More recently, the RSG contributed to theinternational IPAP (Ice Pilot Applications Project) with the aim ofshowing that spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data could be used in atimely manner (within a few hours of collection by the satellite) toprovide sea ice and iceberg data for operational use in polar waters. Thisproject, which was a collaboration between SPRI, GEC Marconi ResearchCentre, SAIC Science and Engineering Ltd, BP, Canarctic Shipping (Canada),Nunaoil (Denmark) and the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute(Russia), was managed by the UK Defence Research Agency on behalf of theBritish National Space Centre. It involved the development and validationof new algorithms for the detection of the ice edge, measurement of iceconcentration, and the detection of icebergs, among other tasks. Thesystem is now operational, using ERS satellite data. (Images here soon) In 1995 the RSG began an associated project todevelop a detailed microscopic understanding of sea ice, with the ultimategoal of improving the parameterisation of sea ice in global climatemodels. It complements the work of the SPRI Sea Ice Group. This project, which is funded by the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Centre under its Gassiot studentship scheme, is being undertaken by Daniel Felthamin collaboration with Dr Grae Worster of the University of Cambridge Department of Applied Mathematics andTheoretical Physics.

When Scott's last words, "For God's sake look after our people" were made known to the British nation, the response was tremendous. Scott himself had emphasised the importance of science and from this plea, the Institute was born. The Institute is the oldest international centre for Polar Research within a university. Seventy-fiveyears of scientific exploration, collection, recording and interpretation of results makes it a uniqueinstitution. Many other institutes concerned with polar issues have grown up with around it: theBritish Antarctic Survey, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the Cambridge Arctic ShelfProject, the World Data Centre C (Glaciology), the International GlaciologicalSociety and the International Whaling Commission. In 1960, the Ford Foundation enabled the Institute to meet the challenge of an explosion in polarinformation following World War II. Now, once again, the Institute has embarked on a major expansionof the library to serve the needs of the research community into thefuture. This planned extension will be named the Shackleton Memorial Library in honour of thecontributions made to polar research by Sir Ernest Shackleton and his son, Lord Shackleton. Terence Armstrong, the polar geographer, died on 21st February 1996. Harry King wrote an obituary which appeared in The Guardian.

Work was undertaken on four EC research projects, one project funded by the US Office of Naval Research and two by NERC. The largest project was the European Subpolar Ocean Programme (ESOP), funded by the EC under the MAST-II initiative, with Dr Wadhams as Co-ordinator. The project involves 22 institutions from 7 European countries, and is the fourth largest project in MAST-II. Its aim is to understand sea ice - ocean interactions in the Greenland Sea, in particular the processes which undelie winter convection and the thermohaline circulation. The effect of convection on the carbon cycle also forms an important part of the project. During the year the Institute was represented at the MAST Days and EUROMAR Market symposium in Sorrento, Italy, in November 1995, and on 24-26 April 1996 Dr Wadhams held a Final Symposium for the project at SPRI. In connection with the results of this project, which show that deep convection has ceased in the Greenland Sea under the effects of global warming, Dr Wadhams made several TV and radio appearances during spring 1996, accompanied by a number of newspaper articles in the British, European and US press. The project is due to last until December 1996, but overlapping it is ESOP-2, a successor programme under MAST-III which began in February 1996 and in which Dr Wadhams is a Principal Investigator. This continues the work of ESOP for three more years, focusing on the oceanography of the thermohaline circulation. Dr Wadhams is on the Steering Committee of the project an attended meetings in Copenhagen in January 1996 and Voss (Norway) in March 1996. Dr Wadhams has also been Principal Investigator of an EC research project in the Environment Programme, shared with IMGA-CNR in Modena (Dr Flavio Parmiggiani). The purpose is to measure the thickness of frazil and pancake ice in the Greenland Sea by analysing the change in the wavelength and direction of ocean waves as they enter the ice. This involves the spectral analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites. Again, Dr Wadhams held a symposium at SPRI on the project on 2 May 1996, attended by Prof Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institut f�r Meteorologie, Hamburg, originator of the SAR wave spectrum algorithm. This project continues until December 1996. An earlier meeting was held in Brussels in February 1996. The fourth EC programme is another new one under MAST-III which also began in February 1996 for three years. It is called "Ice State", co-ordinated by Helsinki University of Technology with Dr Wadhams as a Principal Investigator, and it seks to understand the relationship between sea ice mechanical processes and the resistance offered by an ice sheet to ship passage. Dr Wadhams attended the opening meeting in Helsinki in January 1996. The first science meeting of the project was hosted by Dr Wadhams at SPRI on June 6-7 1996. The two NERC projects were both completed in 1995-6. They concerned light penetration through sea ice and its influence on the average light availability in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), a quantity of great importance for determining the onset of the spring plankton bloom. The final work on the project comprised the construction of a model for irradiance in the MIZ, based on our field results from Antarctica and Alaska of light penetration through ice, and knowledge of ice dynamics, concentrations and floe sizes in the MIZ. The larger of the two grants was a BAS Special Topic project carried out jointly with Dr Julian Priddle of BAS. The ONR project concerns interpretation of data gathered in 1994-5 on the SIMI programme (Sea Ice Mechanics Initiative), an ice camp in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska in which SPRI measured ice tilt, heave, strain and accelerations in conjunction with other groups measuring stress and ice dynamical parameters. The interpretation includes the role of ridge-building in generating wave activity, and the flexural response of the ice sheet to the tidal cycle. Dr Wadhams attended a workshop on the project in Seattle in April 1996. During the year Douglas Low completed an MSc thesis on "The validation of ERS-1 SAR data for Antarctic summer sea ice" for the University of Dundee, supervised by Dr Wadhams. Finlo Cottier joined the group as a research student in October 1995 to work on brine dranage channels in sea ice; and Yevgeny Aksenov joined the group as a research student in April 1996 to work on the Ice State project, having formerly been a research scientist at Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St Petersburg.

Sited within a departmentof the University of Cambridge, this isa resource of national and international importance consulted bygovernments, industry, scientists and scholars. The Library also housesWorld Data Centre C for Glaciology, with specialresponsibilities for the provision of information to British and Europeanglaciologists, and the SPRI Archives, containing the world's finest collection of unpublished material relating to the polar regions. For scientists and scholars, SPRI Library offers a collection developedsince the 1920s with over 1000 current journals, 27,500 books and 44,000pamphlets covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, andto ice and snow wherever found. For industry, it is a prime informationsource on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of naturalresources and on the environmental implications of such activities in thepolar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selectionof sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in coldenvironments. For Government users, the Library offers an unrivalledresource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence. Holdings Arctic collections These are unique in covering all countries ofthe circumpolar north for all subjects and in all languages. No otherlibrary is similarly comprehensive. Particular strengths are thesubstantial collections relating to the Arctic Ocean, to the EuropeanArctic, and to the Russian North. The Russian North holdings areconsidered to be the most extensive outside the former Soviet Union andthe Library of Congress. The definition adopted for the Arctic is broadly that of Thecircumpolar north (Armstrong, Rogers and Rowley, 1978), with minormodifications affecting south-east Alaska and Labrador. Seas covered arethe Arctic Ocean and adjacent waters: the various seas north of Russia(Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara and White seas); Barents Sea;Norwegian Sea; Greenland Sea; Labrador Sea; Davis Strait and Baffin Bay; Hudson Bay; Lincoln Sea; waters of the Canadian Arctic Islands; BeaufortSea; Ber ing Sea; the Sea of Okhotsk; and the Gulf of Alaska. Land areascovered include Alaska (except for the Panhandle); the CanadianTerritories (Yukon and Northwest); those parts of Quebec and Labradoroccupied by the Inuit; Greenland; Iceland (natural histo ry only);Svalbard; the European Arctic south to the Arctic Circle; and the RussianFederation south to 63 deg. in European Russia and to 57 deg. in Asia,including all of Kamchatka and Sakhalin. Antarctic collections Probably the most famous collections in the Library and without peeranywhere, both for the continent itself and for the surrounding ocean andsub-Antarctic islands. Those interested in the history of the Antarctic should ask the Librarian about the Antarctica Retrospective project. The Antarctic is taken to include the continent itself together with itssurrounding waters and islands north to the Antarctic Convergence butincluding also those Peri-Antarctic islands occurring north of this zonebut still strongly subject to Antarctic influences (Gough Island, the NewZealand Sub-Antarctic Islands, Iles Amsterdam and Saint-Paul, Iles Crozet,Macquarie Island, and the Prince Edward Islands). This area correspondsto the zone of interest of the Scientific Committee onAntarctic Research (SCAR). Because of their long association withBritish Antarctic activities, the library also aims to maintain good, butnot exhaustive, holdings for the Falkland Islands and Tristan da Cunhafocusing particularly on natural history and on historical and politicalissues with an Antarctic dimension. Glaciological collections With over 100 current periodicals, 30,000 entries on glaciology andrelated subjects in the SPRILIB databasetogether with an equivalent number of entries in the card catalogue, theglaciological holdings maintained by World Data Centre C for Glaciology are as extensive as those found anywhere. WDC-C has adopted a broad definition of the scope of glaciology collectingpublications on all topics relating to snow and ice in all languages andfor all parts of the world. The glaciology collection is thus notrestricted to the polar regions. Among subjects included are glacialgeology, geocryology, glacioastronomy, and snow and ice engineering. Universal Decimal Classification for Use in Polar Libraries The strength of the Library lies as much in the detail of itslong-established cataloguing practice as in the size and coverage of thecollection itself. Since its foundation, a policy has been maintained ofproviding information access points to items at the analytic and not justat the main entry level. Each entry provides sufficient bibliographicinformation for identification and location of the source documenttogether with a brief abstract and appropriate index numbers derived fromthe Universal Decimal Classification for Use in PolarLibraries (4th edition, 1994), developed and maintained by SPRILibrary and used by many other polar libraries. All cataloguing, indexingand abstracting is carried out by specialist bibliographers possessing arange of linguistic, regional and subject expertise. Since 1985, allrecords have been entered in the SPRILIB bibliographic database. Financial support: SPRI Library is a departmental library of the University of Cambridge,supported by grants from the NERCBritish Antarctic Survey, the UK Ministry of Defence, the Foreign andCommonwealth Office, the governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand,and from private individuals. World Data C for Glaciology, the Europeandocumentation centre for glaciological information, is funded by the Royal Society.

K. Headland, Scott Polar Research Institute 13 May 1996, incorporating decisions of the XX Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting . Introduction The Antarctic Treaty applies to the area south of 60°south latitude, including all islands and ice shelves. The wholearea is subject to Agreed Measures for the Conservation of AntarcticFlora and Fauna which are consolidated in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. These include prohibitionson the killing, wounding, capturing or molesting of anynative mammal or native bird except in accordance with a permit;and regulations on the importation of exotic species, parasites,and diseases. Permits may be issued only by persons authorizedby a participating government. Conservation areas follow legally binding measures adopted atAntarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ACTM), commonlyas a result of recommendations from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. States belonging to the Treaty apply ACTM recommendations in order to control the activities of their own nationals. Each new ACTM recommends additions to or alterations in the designation of certain areas. The system aims to evolve in response to changing perceptions and changing needs for conservation. Six categories of conservation area have been designated: Specially Protected Areas (SPA), Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Historic Sites and Monuments (HSM), Specially Reserved Areas (SRA), Multiple-use Planning Areas (MPA), and Ecosystem Monitoring Sites. Some areas designated under one category overlap or include areas in another category. Management plans are required for all areas exceptHSMs. The 1991 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting recommended thatall SPAs and SSSIs should be redesignated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas and be refereed and renumbered accordingly. However, the renaming and renumbering has not yet been done. Entry into an ASPA will be prohibited except in accordance witha permit. A new category of protected areas is to be known as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) to assist in the planning and coordination of activities, avoid possible conflicts, improve cooperation between Parties or minimize adverseenvironmental effects. Entry into ASMAs will not require a permit. Six Sealing Zones and three SealReserves have been established under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. No areas have yet been set aside under provisions of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources but two Ecosystem Monitoring Programme sites have been designated. One tomb was declared following acatastrophic aircraft impact. All conservation areas are discussed in the Handbook of the Antarctic Treaty System, 8th edition, 1994. Subsequent additions or amendments are from Antarctic Treaty: Final Report of the XVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, Kyoto, 11-15 April 1994 and Antarctic Treaty: Report of the Transitional Environmental Working Group, Seoul, 19 May 1995, and Antarctic Treaty, Report of the XX Consultative Meeting, Den Haag, May 1996. There are similar legally protected conservation areas designatedby national authorities on those peri-Antarctic islands outside the Antarctic Treaty region. These include: the Prince Edward Islands, Iles Crozet, Iles Kerguelen, Heard Island, Iles Saint-Paul et Amsterdam, Macquarie Island, Auckland Islands, Campbell Island, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, and Gough Island. These lists were originally compiled by Charles Swithinbank andhave been revised at the Scott Polar Research Institute. Specially Protected Areas The purpose of SPAs is to preserve both unique and representativeexamples of the natural ecological systems of areas whichare of outstanding scientific interest. Vehicles of any kindare forbidden. Entry to an SPA is prohibited without a permit.Permits may be issued only for a compelling scientific purposewhich cannot be served elsewhere. The collectionof any native plant or animal requires a further and more specificpermit. 1. Taylor Rookery, Mac. Robertson Land 67°26'S, 60°50'E. Approximate area 0·4km2. The area consists of the whole of the northernmost rockexposure on the eastern side of Taylor Glacier. Designated becauseTaylor Rookery contains a colony of Emperor penguins which isone of the few, and probably the largest, of the known colonies of thisspecies breeding wholly on land (see also SPA 8). 2. Rookery Islands, Holme Bay 67°37'S, 62°33'E, includes all the approximately75 small islands within a rectangle centred on this point. Approximatearea 30 km2.

Specially Reserved Areas The purpose of SRAs is to protect representative examples ofthe major geological, glaciological, and geomorphologicalfeatures of Antarctica; and representative examples of areasof outstanding aesthetic, scenic, and wilderness value. A management plan for each SRA should distinguish between activitiesthat would jeopardize, and other activities that wouldnot jeopardize, the special values to be protected. Entryto SRAs is prohibited except for purposes identified in the approved management plan or in accordance with a permit. 1. North Dufek Massif, Pensacola Mountains North of the mountain crest from 82°36'S, 53°30'W(Brown Nunataks) on the west to 82°26'S, 50°36'W(Cox Nunatak) on the east to a line from Cox Nunatak to a pointon the snow surface 1 km north of the north edge of Forlidas Ridgeto Brown Nunataks. The length is 48 km and the width is about 10km, approximate area 390 km2. The area includes SPA 23. Designatedbecause the area contains outstanding geological, geomorphological,aesthetic, scenic, and wilderness values. It is presently in a pristine condition and it is importantto protect these values while allowing multiple use to permitaccess to scientists and others. Multiple-use Planning Areas The purpose of MPAs is to assist in coordinating human activitiesin areas where such activities pose identified risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental effects. Each MPA develops a management plan to identify environmentalcharacteristics threatened by current or planned activities, andagrees specific measures to avoid or minimize harmful and cumulativeeffects. These areas may be suspended by Annex V of the EnvironmentalProtocol. 1. South-west Anvers Island and vicinity Between 64°41'30"S and 65°S, and between63°40'W and 64°35'W, encompassing about 1535km2. Palmer Stationis within the MPA, as are many island groups. The area includesSPA 17 (Litchfield Island) and SSSI 20 (Biscoe Point). Designatedbecause the area, because of its diverse environmental featuresand scientific history, will become increasingly important forlong-term studies of the natural variability in Antarctic ecosystems,the effects of humans on Antarctic communities, and the possibleeffect of global change on the Antarctic environment and on thephysiology and behaviour of its plants and animals.

The diversity ofvegetation species in the Arctic is generally low, and the potential forsignificant loss of biodiversity is consequently high. In some areas, theloss of habitat (for example, for reindeer and migratory birds) is also ofgreat importance. In the former Soviet Union problems of this type arewidespread. Exploitation of the considerable mineral resources of thenorthern regions at first paid little regard to the environmentalconsequences, later suppressed information about them. Since shortlybefore the dissolution of the Soviet Union a growing awareness of andofficial concern about these problems has developed. However, attempts toaddress the environmental problems from within Russia are hindered bygreat uncertainty as to the scale of the problem (many of the affectedareas being remote and inaccessible) and by economic constraints. These factors have led the RSG to develop aprogramme of research into the potential for satellite and airborne remotesensing to study the phenomena of Arctic surface and airborne pollutioneffects. The first stage is a study of damage to upland lichen tundravegetation on the Kola Peninsula of Russia as aresult of huge emissions of sulphur dioxide from the nickel smelter atMonchegorsk. This project has been undertaken in collaboration with theGeography Faculty of Moscow StateUniversity, with funding from the UK Department of the Environment's'Darwin Initiative' for biodiversity. Analysis of visible andnear-infrared LANDSAT images, covering the period from 1980 to 1992, hasbeen combined with a detailed field investigation to map the changes invegetation distribution , especially stressedand damaged lichen tundra. The results show a decrease of almost 50% inthe area of healthy tundra, from 960 to 520 square kilometres, between1980 and 1992, with most of the change occurring after 1989. Although thisresearch is still active, we currently believe that the recent massivegrowth of the damaged area is a result of a change in local weatherpatterns. This project is closely linked to the World Conservation MonitoringCentre's environmental database for the Russian Arctic. It is nowbeing extended to study the effects of sulphur dioxide emissions(currently about 2 million tonnes a year) from the nickel smelter at Norilsk on the Taimyr Peninsula of Russia, again incollaboration with Moscow State University. The second stage is to develop remote sensing/GIS methods for the study ofoil spills on frozen ground. Oil pipelines in permafrost regions are verysusceptible to damage from mechanical stresses, and large spills(images coming soon) are not uncommon in the Russian north. Littleis currently known about the behaviour of oil spilled onto permafrost, andwe are working with the Geotechnical Science Laboratories of Carleton University, Ottawa,to develop methods for monitoring and prediction of both the spill itself,and the post-spill situation, based on data from a wide range of spatialscales, from the microstructural to the kilometric. Such methods shouldhave a major impact on the identification of appropriate remediationstrategies. The techniques currently under development for monitoring healthy,stressed and damaged Arctic vegetation also have important potentialapplications in the social sciences and to climate change studies.Indigenous people in the Russian north are heavily dependent on the tundravegetation which provides grazing for reindeer, and changes in vegetationpatterns can have profound effects on the way of life of these people. This is the subject of a collaboration with the Social ScienceGroup of the Scott Polar Research Institute. Global climate change canalso be expected to cause long-term changes in the spatial distribution ofvegetation. Monitoring of these changes from satellite data will provideanother approach to the study of global climate change.

All libraries are unique and few more so than this one. The key to usingthe library effectively is detailed knowledge of the 162-page schedule ofthe Universal Decimal Classification for Use in PolarLibraries. This classification schedule is used both to arrangepublications on shelves and to provide detailed indexing to subjectcontent. Do you have time to give UDC the study itdeserves? Do you have time to learn the innovative - though idiosyncratic- probabilistic feedback-based interface to the SPRILIBdatabase? If the answer is yes, read no further. I shall be happy to instruct you in the intricacies of UDC and SPRILIB. If no, SPRI Timesaver may offer what you need. Subscribers to this service are provided with: a desk reserved for your use a SPRILIB bibliography on your topic (up to 100 records) selected publications brought to your desk free photocopying by staff of requested articles (up to 50 A4 pages per day) The fee for the standard SPRI Timesaver service is �30.00 ($45.00) per day. Bibliographies of over 100 records, more than one bibliography, or photocopying over 50 A4 pages per day, may all be arranged but at an additional cost. If you would like to use SPRI Timesaver, pleasecomplete the Timesaver application form and return it to me as soon as possible so that the bibliography may be sent to you in advance of your visit.

This report will summarise the work carried out; for a fuller description,information can be found in the BAS Annual Reports, and in the papers listed at the back of thisreport. The lead U.K. organisation for all the work described is BAS, except where explicitlystated. Ice and Atmosphere Chemistry Work in this area has included: Analysis and interpretation of new and existing cores from the Antarctic Peninsula. Analysishas been carried out on a sequence of cores spanning the Antarctic Peninsula (Dolleman Island,Dyer Plateau, Gomez Nunatak, Beethoven Peninsula). The data are being used to compareclimate trends across the Peninsula, and also contribute to the ITASE programme. Collection (in 1994-95), in collaboration with the Alfred-Wegener-Institut of cores from the twodomes of Berkner Island. The core from the northern dome (Reinwarthhohe), collected with anew BAS drill (based on an AWI design), is 152 m long, and covers about 600 years. The corefrom the southern dome (Thyssenhohe) is 178 m long, covering about 1200 years. A sequence ofshorter cores was also collected. A preliminary dating, based on electrical measurements, iscomplete, and detailed isotopic and chemical analysis is underway. Berkner Island has beenidentified as a promising potential site for a deeper drilling at a later stage. Interpretation of cores in the Weddell Sea area. Study of the stable isotope records has shownthat these are affected by ice conditions (affecting the moisture sources) as well as bytemperature changes. An improved understanding of this effect has allowed a more consistentdescription of temperature changes over the last two centuries to be derived. The factorscontrolling the very strong signals of sulphur species in the Weddell Sea area have also beeninvestigated. Studies of airborne pollutants. Work was completed on analysing and interpreting a profile ofheavy metals from Coats Land, Antarctica. This showed that the lead concentration increased bya factor approximately 3 during the period 1920-1980, with a subsequent small decrease. Thismirrors trends in southern hemisphere lead usage. the effect of Antarctic stations has also beenconsidered, and is estimated to be small beyond a few km from the station, although aircraft maycause wider dispersal of pollutants. Air-snow transfer studies. BAS has made a major effort at improving understanding of howatmospheric signals are recorded in ice cores. This has centred on analysis and interpretation ofaerosol and snow samples collected at Halley station. These are being set in the frame of studiesundertaken simultaneously at Dumont d'Urville and Neumayer stations. A new automatedaerosol sampler is being developed to carry out similar studies at remote ice core sites. Preparatory work for EPICA deep drilling in Antarctica. The European Project for Ice Coring inAntarctica (EPICA) is being funded by 10 European nations and by the European Union. BASwill be involved both in work on the Dome C (DC) deep core, and the reconnaissance work inDronning Maud Land (DML). Planned scientific contributions include chemical analysis both atDML and DC, electrical studies at DC, and ice radar studies in DML. Groups from the School ofEnvironmental Sciences at University of East Anglia, and from the Open University, also plan totake part in gas analyses of the cores, and are starting to test their procedures on existing coresheld by BAS. The Rock Mechanics Laboratory at University College London have alreadyundertaken studies of ice mechanical properties on cores from the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (incollaboration with AWI), and also plan to participate in EPICA. Ice Dynamics Work in this area has included: Studies of ice-ocean interactions beneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. In 1995/96, theimproved BAS hot-water drill was used to complete an access hole through 825 m of ice justwest of Korff Ice Rise in the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. this complements two earlier holeswhich have been instrumented in the past. Conductivity, temperature and current meters havebeen placed in and below the ice shelf at this site, and data from all three sites have been studiedto improve our knowledge of the sub-ice shelf regime. Numerical models of the water flowbeneath the ice shelf, and of the interaction of the ice shelf with the water below it, have beenconstructed, and compared with the data. Oceanographic studies in the Ross, Amundsen, Bellingshausen and Weddell Seas. Studies (somein collaboration with U.S. scientists, and using U.S. logistics) have been carried out, particularlyalong ice fronts. One notable finding has been of the very high melt rate from Pine IslandGlacier in the Bellingshausen Sea. Such measurements have allowed a reassessment of theAntarctic mass balance. Studies of ice shelf disintegration. Remote sensing studies have shown that several ice shelvesfringing the Antarctic peninsula are in retreat. This culminated in the break-up of a large part ofthe Larsen Ice Shelf in early 1995. This event has been studied by BAS, and by scientists fromother countries. Remote sensing studies. A new high-powered airborne ice radar has been built. This hascollected ice thickness data from various areas, including the Ronne Ice Shelf, and the Rutfordand Evans Ice Streams. BAS has made detailed studies of the use of Interferometric SyntheticAperture Radar (INSAR) over Antarctic ice. A particular application of INSAR has been theconfirmation of the slow movement of Carlson Inlet compared to neighbouring Rutford IceStream. Ground-based survey measurements have also been made at these and other locations. Scientists from Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Scott Polar Research Institute, andUniversity of Wales, used ice radar and satellite altimetry data to contribute to renewed studies,led by Russian scientists, of the freshwater Lake Vostok, which lies beneath the Antarctic icesheet. Investigations of ice stream beds. Seismic studies have been carried out to investigate the icestream bed, and the ice-bed interface in Rutford Ice Stream. This work has shown that basalconditions are very variable on a scale of a few kilometres. Ice sheet modelling. Work has been carried out on modelling marine ice sheets, modelling flowpatterns at ice divides (of great interest to the ice core community), and modelling erosionalprocesses occurring at the base of ice sheets. Modelling studies of the stability of the EastAntarctic ice sheet are also underway at the Geography Department of the University ofEdinburgh. These studies contribute to the European Ice Sheet Modelling Initiative (EISMINT). Sea ice studies Scientists at the Scott Polar Research Institute have been studying the SAR signatures andphysical properties of MIZ ice in the western Weddell Sea during summer. In a collaborationwith NIPR, Tokyo, they have compared the SAR signatures of Japanese ERS versus EuropeanERS-1/2 instruments, over Antarctic sea ice near Syowa. They have also investigated lightpenetration through MIZ sea ice in spring. Planned work Work will continue in most of the areas outlined above. Major field programmes in the next fewyears include: 1. Participation in EPICA, both at Dome C and through ice coring and radar studies at DML; 2. Hot water drilling south of Berkner Island; 3. Shipborne oceanographic studies at the western Ronne ice front; 4. Ice dynamics studies in Ellsworth Land; 5. Passive and active seismic studies on Rutford and Carlson ice streams.

Dr. Peter Wadhams, of SPRI, has pioneered much of this work. My research focuses on smaller scales and the fundamental physics involved, in the hope that this will lead to understanding and parameterisation of critical phenomena for use in climate models. When seawater freezes, salt is expelled from the solid in a concentrated salt solution called brine. My research involves the use of analytical mathematical techniques to solve fluid dynamical problems to do with processes involving brine drainage and solidification. To date, simple analytical models have been used to investigate the qualitative effect that deformations of the sea ice cover have on brine drainage. Up to half of the volume of sea ice is in the form of ridges caused by deformation. Ridges are formed by sea ice movements induced by ocean, wind, and internal stresses. Some models of the stability of the interface between heavy brine in sea ice and the less dense underlying ocean have also been investigated. The effect of ocean shear on the underside of the sea ice on brine drainage within the ice has been studied. I am currently investigating the effect ocean shear has on the stability of the region of sea ice growth, the mushy layer. This extends previous work done on instabilities in mushy layers in the context of the solidification of binary alloys. The diagram shows contours of the stream function across the interface between sea ice and the upper ocean with a shear discontinuity across the interface. This result was obtained using scaling and asymptotic analysis. Amongst the most important analytical techniques I have been using are scaling analysis and exact and approximate (though still analytical) methods of solving partial differential equations such as similarity solutions, eigenfunction expansions, Green's functions and asymptotic methods. I have been using these methods to obtain solutions to problems arising from the application of boundary conditions to systems of dynamical equations such as the Navier-Stokes equation and conservation equations for heat and solute.

The objective of this activity is to test and compare existing numerical ice-sheet, ice-shelf, and glacier models as they are run by several groups worldwide, in order to narrow down uncertainties and to enable participating groups to upgrade their models. A number of us have been working lately on a new series of experimental setups, aiming at comparing the performance of models under real-world situations and under much more challenging conditions than was the case during previous workshops held in Brussels (1993) and in Bremerhaven (1994). We have now produced descriptions for 5 intercomparison topics, namely: comparison of models applied to the Greenland ice sheet comparison of models applied to the Antarctic ice sheet comparison of ice-shelf models comparison tests involving basal sliding comparison of grounding-line treatments Interested modelers will be provided with detailed descriptions and datasets to run these experiments, and will be invited to discuss the results at a workshopto be organized in October 1997 in Grindelwald (Switzerland). Note that the expenses for this workshop (travel, lodging, meals) will be entirely covered by the European Science Foundation. This call is particularly directed to those of you who were not involved in previous workshops, but are nevertheless active in ice-sheet modeling. If you are interested to participate in this venture, which is certain to push the art of ice-sheet modelling a further step ahead, please contact meat my webpage.

Work by the SPRI Remote Sensing Group is currently aimed at measuring surface topography, surface morphology, surface temperature of terrestrial ice masses using synergistic remote sensing techniques. A topographic map of Nordaustlandet, a small ice cap in north Svalbard, is shown here Image to follow This map was derived using a combination of both visible-wavelength and altimetric data. The surface topography was derived using a shape-from-shading algorithm on LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data, with ERS-1 altimetric data being used to provide suitable tie points. Such a map would be impossible to generate using either dataset alone; the shape-from-shading method does not work well at low spatial frequencies, and the altimetric dataset does not include high frequencies. LANDSAT visible-wavelength data provide information about the 'chemical' properties of a glacier and ERS-1 SAR the physical properties. The RSG is developing techniques to merge these datasets to improve the mapping of surface facies on glaciers and ice caps. Image to follow This figure shows an unsupervised classification of a merged LANDSAT TM and ERS-1 SAR scene of Finsterwalderbreen, a glacier on Svalbard. The categories in the classification contain both chemical and physical description and are thus more representative of the actual surface facies. A technique to acquire accurate surface temperatures, and hence the position of the freeze/thaw line, using ERS-1 ATSR and SAR data is currently under development.

The radiation can be in the ultraviolet, visible, infrared or microwave region of the spectrum, and can be naturally occurring or artificially generated. It carries information about the physical properties of the medium from which it was reflected or emitted, and about the atmosphere through which it travels. Computer image processing can thus be used to derive information about these properties, and so about the character of the Earth's surface or atmosphere. The use of airborne and, especially, spaceborne platforms allows data to be gathered from very large areas in very short times, and from areas in which fieldwork would be difficult. However, fieldwork remains an important component of most applications, providing known data that can then be extrapolated over space and/or time using remotely sensed data. The Remote Sensing Society,founded in 1974, promotes Remote Sensing as a unified subject. The Remote Sensing Group (RSG) of the Scott Polar Research Institute was formally set up in 1985, under the direction of Dr Gareth Rees, with the aim of developing new methods for using satellite and airborne observation to study polar glacial, marine and biological environments. Satellite Remote Sensing (Earth Observation) is an especially powerful information-gathering technique in the polar regions owing to their vast size, hostile environment and difficulty of access. The newer methods of microwave remote sensing, which do not depend on the daylight, cloud-free conditions often absent from the polar regions, have received particular attention. The Group produces an occasional series SPRI Technical Reports in Remote Sensing, and publishes papers in a variety of scientific journals. Research areas The RSG carries out laboratory and field-based research in the following main areas: glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice and icebergs, and vegetation and pollution in the Arctic. Although the geographical focus of research is primarily in the Arctic, some of the techniques developed by the RSG are applicable in other parts of the world, and have been used for such diverse purposes as studying the temperature profile in the lower layers of the Earth's atmosphere using observations of 'mirage' phenomena; tracking migratory birds; characterising areas of actual and potential soil erosion in southern Europe. The RSG also carries out basic research in image processing techniques and the dynamics of satellite orbits. Research by the RSG is supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the UK Department of the Environment, the EC, the US Army, the UK Meteorological Office, and the UK Defence Research Agency. Applications to undertake research with the RSG at Master's, Doctoral or Post-doctoral level are considered from both self-funded and unfunded students. The Remote Sensing Group has also undertaken contract work for the British National Space Centre and SAIC Science and Engineering Ltd. Small research contracts can sometimes be carried out at very low cost through student projects. Larger contracts (typically lasting 6 months or more) generally require some staff funding. Teaching Teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels is provided within the University of Cambridge. Undergraduate teaching in remote sensing and glaciology is contributed to the departments of Physics and Geography. Graduate teaching is contributed to the one-year M. Phil. courses in Polar Studiesand in Geographical Information Systems and Remote Sensing. The RSG also provides training for the PhD degree programme.

Click here for a preview. Other Resources TOPEX/Poseidon has produced several lithographs and brochures that can enhance your classroom. Many people don't know that earth tides result from the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon on the solid earth. You might think that earth tides are small -- however, they typically have vertical displacements of many tens of centimeters! Links to Other Webpages The Center for Space Research has their own Educational Outreach page that includes information "For Kids," educational programs, and science results. Our French Partners at AVISO have images and highlights of T/P science results called "Ocean Digests." Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research (CCAR) has the Distributed Earth Model Orbiting System (DEMOS) and more! Use DEMOS to see where T/P is in Earth's orbit. T/P Satellite Data Viewer lets you create a map of sea surface height variability anywhere in the world. You can view the satellite's groundtrack from here, too.

The University of Colorado at Boulder and Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research (CCAR) have "Near-Real-Time" data available to monitor our oceans just about anywhere! The ocean is in motion and its shape is always changing. You can view daily sea surface heights and 3-day maps of sea surface anomaly to track about ocean currents, swirling eddies, and ocean heat storage. These tools provide access to data from 66 degrees North to 66 degrees South latitude. Observations of the Earth's oceans by the TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-2 satellites are processed and posted within 36 hours of the satellite acquiring them. Check out ocean wind and discover its relationship to ocean waves. CCAR's Ocean-Altimetry Research Results are "making waves," too. A focused area of research "Near-Real-Time" data is being used to better understand the Gulf of Mexico, its neighboring bays, human operations, and the marine mammals who live there.

The Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX/Poseidon) is a cooperative project betweenthe United States and France to develop and operate an advanced satellitesystem dedicated to observing the Earth's oceans. The mission providesglobal sea level measurements with an unprecedented accuracy. The data from TOPEX/Poseidon is used to determine global ocean circulation and to understandhow the oceans interact with the atmosphere. This understanding will improveour ability to predict global climate. For this joint mission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)is providing the satellite bus and five instruments with their associatedground elements. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is responsible for projectmanagement, and will operate and control the satellite through NASA's Trackingand Data Relay Satellite System. The Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)is furnishing two instruments with their associated ground elements and a dedicated launch on Ariane rocket. Both CNES and NASA provide precisionorbit determination and process and distribute data to 38 science investigators from nine nations, as well as other interested scientists. In the summer of 1992, TOPEX/Poseidon was launched into orbit by an Ariane rocket from the European Space Agency's Space Center located in Kourou, FrenchGuiana. From its orbit 830 miles (1,336 kilometers) above the Earth's surface,TOPEX/Poseidon makes sea level measurements along the same path every 10 daysusing the dual frequency altimeter developed by NASA and the CNES single frequency solid-state altimeter. This information is used to relate changes inocean currents with atmospheric and climate patterns. Measurements from NASA'sMicrowave Radiometer provide estimates of the total water-vapor content inthe atmosphere, which is used to correct errors in the altimeter measurements.These combined measurements allow scientists to chart the height of the seasacross ocean basins with an accuracy of 5 inches (13 centimeters). Three independent techniques determine the satellite altitude within 4 inches(10 centimeters). NASA's Laser Retroreflector Array is used with a network of10 to 15 satellite laser ranging stations to provide the baseline tracking datafor precision orbit determination and calibration of the radar altimeter bias.The DORIS system, recently demonstrated by the French SPOT-2 mission, providesan alternate set of tracking data using microwave Doppler techniques. Thesystem is composed of an onboard receiver and a network of 40 to 50 ground transmitting stations, providing all-weather, global tracking of the satellite.NASA's Global Positioning System Demonstration Receiver demonstrates a newtechnique for precise, continuous tracking of the spacecraft. TOPEX/Poseidon is a vital part of a strategic research effort to exploreocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere. It is timed tocoincide with and complement a number of international oceanographic and meteorological programs, including the World Circulation Experiment (WOCE) andthe Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program, both of which are sponsored by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). TOPEX/Poseidon is athree-year mission with the potential for a two-year extension. Results from theTOPEX/Poseidon will build the foundation for a continuing program of long-termobservations of ocean circulation from space, and for an extensive oceanmonitoring program in the next century.

TOPEX/Poseidon is a satellite that measures the precise shape of the ocean's surface and how this surface changes through time. This helps the scientists to calculate ocean currents, identify climate trends, and improve weather forecasting models. During its first three years in orbit, TOPEX/Poseidon has: Continuously observed global ocean topography; Produced the first global views of seasonal changes of currents; Monitored El Nino and large-scale features such as Rossby and Kelvin waves; Provided global data to validate models of ocean circulation; Mapped year-to-year changes in heat stored in the upper ocean; Produced the most accurate global maps of tides ever; and Improved our knowledge of Earth's gravity field. Learn more about the satellite and its results... The history and future of TOPEX/Poseidon and how it works. What is climate and how does it affect our lives? What is the connection between the oceans and atmosphere? What ocean circulation is and why is ocean circulation is important? Did you know that, like the atmosphere, oceans have seasons and weather,too? El Nino has enormous impacts on the global climate including generating Kelvin and Rossby waves. Predicting ocean tides has puzzled scientists for hundreds of years...now, it can be done. What is the connection between ocean winds and waves?

Hancock III and G. S. Hayne NASA GSFC Wallops Flight Facility Observational Science Branch Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, VA 23337 10 July 1996 An error was called to our attention in the TOPEX Algorithm S1034 whichcorrects altimeter data for oscillator drift. We have confirmed theadditive height correction should have been delta height = [ (Rutc/Rref) - 1]*H, where H is the uncorrected height estimate, Rutc is the measuredspacecraft clock interval, and Rref is the nominal spacecraft clockinterval. In the current S1034 (used in the original processing of all TOPEX data through cycle 132)however, the expression (Rutc/Rref) was erroneously inverted. The Rutc and Rrefare very close in values (parts in 10^8), therefore the upside down divisioneffectively gives a change in sign to the correction. This error was found by Ouan-Zan Zanife, Philippe Escudier, and PatrickVincent, and we are grateful to them for communicating this informationdirectly to Phil Callahan who forwarded it to us. Two important issuescan be explained by the error: 1) much of the sea-level changediscrepancy between TOPEX and Poseidon should disappear, and 2) theapproximately 13 cm bias of TOPEX relative to Poseidon will be removed. If there were no correction for the oscillator drift made to the TOPEXrange estimate, the range after mid 1993 would become shorter with time.The current (about cycle 132) range drift rate induced by the oscillatoris about 5 mm per year. The Algorithm S1034 error because of its signdoubles this rate, so that the TOPEX data product range is shorter (orthe surface height greater) by about 10 mm per year. The initial oscillator offset from the frequency used for the rangeconversion coefficient requires about a 65 mm range correction. Thiscorrection was applied with the wrong sign because of the S1034 error. After correcting the TOPEX range for this effect, the TOPEX range willbe increased by about 13 cm. The following table gives the range correction, in millimeters,which should be ADDED to the TOPEX range values already processed by JPLto: i) remove the effects of the S1034 error; and ii) correctly account forthe oscillator drift. This correction is directly proportional to thevalue of the satellite height, and the table's values were produced assumingthe height to be 1347 kilometers. (The TOPEX/Poseidon height variesfrom about 1340 kilometers at the equator to 1354 kilometers at thelatitude extreme values.)Again, because of nearly identical values for Rutc and Rref, the additive correction for the error is approximately double the valueof the true oscillator drift calibration value. Because sea surface height (SSH) reported on theTOPEX GDRs is given by SSH = Altitude - Range , the range correction given in the table should be SUBTRACTED from the GDR SSH: TOPEX GDR SSH corrected for Osc Drift error = GDR_SSH - additive_GDR_range_corr . The midpoint times in the table are calculated, not actual, but shouldbe good to within about 10 seconds of the actual values. Users of the Merged GDR, whether PO-DAAC or AVISO, should correct the rangebefore forming the SSH. The correction should be applied to all the originallyprocessed TOPEX data forcycles 1 through 132. Data from cycle 133 onward will be corrected forthis effect as well as having revised software for tides and otheralgorithms as previously announced.

"Workshop" This series will familiarize you with the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) mission, science, and products that are available for Earth-related studies. It has 22 "slides" (presented in 3 parts) and accompanying text. Each "slide" can be selected to view a full-size version of the image, often with more detailed explanatory text. Forward to "Part 2" of Workshop Forward to "Part 3" of Workshop PART 1 Where Can You Find T/P Data? How Does the T/P Satellite Work? Why is There Motion in the Ocean? What is the Connection Between Wind & Waves? 1- Data Images 2 - Ocean & Climate 3 - Satellite Ground Tracks 4 - Measurement System 5 - Motion in the Ocean 6 - Wind Speed & Significant Wave Height: Jan '95 7 - Wind Speed & Significant Wave Height: June '95 1 - Data Images - T/P data images updated monthly beginning September, 1992. - There are 5 types of products. Four of these will be outlined. - T/P is scheduled to continue collecting data through at least Fall 1998 and Jason-1, the T/P "follow-on" mission, is planned to launch in 1999. Together, these missions will give us at least a decade of data, the minimum amount of data needed to begin to test models of Earth's long-term weather, or climate. - The URL for these images is http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/topex/ 2 - Ocean & Climate - The T/P satellite makes very precise and accurate measurements of sea surface height. - What can such a simple measurement tell us about our Earth? A lot! This is because the oceans are the greatest repository of important "greenhouse" gases such as water and carbon dioxide. Monitoring sea height is a way to measure changes in these over time. - Our basic goal is monitor how the ocean is changing over time. - How do we accomplish this? 3 - Satellite Ground Tracks - By following a ground track that repeats every 10 days. This means that the trace of the satellite on the ground goes over the same spot of ocean once every 10 days. - T/P's ground tracks cover over 95% of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. - During its first month of operation, T/P collected more ocean data than all the ships had during the previous 100 years! 4 - Measurement System - This chart is very complicated so we're just going to focus on how the satellite's measurement is optimized. To do this, we need to know:1) where the satellite is in its orbit and 2) the distance from the satellite to the ocean. - Satellite position is known relative to the center of the Earth and so we measure sea height relative to the Earth's center. - The position of the T/P satellite is determined using 3 methods. - T/P has 2 altimeters that measure the distance from the satellite to the ocean. These altimeters send radar signals straight down which "bounce off" the ocean surface. The time it takes for the radar signal to return to the satellite tells us how far the satellite is from the ocean's surface. - To improve the altimeter measurement, we measure the water content of the atmosphere. This is because water along the path of the signal changes the speed at which the altimeter signal travels. - T/P makes very precise measurements of sea surface height. - Let's discuss the meaning of the term "precise:" You are given two rulers: each a foot long but one only has tick marks to indicate whole inches and the other with tick marks every 1/16th of an inch... which would provide a more precise measurement of the length of your thumb? Answer - The more precise T/P's measurement is, the smaller the ocean feature we can measure. Later, we'll focus on the relative heights of certain ocean features that scientists want to measure. - Right now, T/P's measurement precision for sea surface height is 4.3 cm (1.7 inches). Because the satellite flies 1330 km (830 miles) above the Earth's surface, that's comparable to knowing the sea surface height to much less than the thickness of a dime while flying in a jet at 35,000 feet altitude. 5 - Motion in the Ocean -The Sun's energy and force of the wind. Together, the oceans and atmosphere redistribute the Sun's energy from the tropics (where the Sun's energy input is highest) to the poles (where energy input is the lowest). - What causes the difference in how much energy is received at the Earth's between the tropics and the poles? Answer - One way the Sun drives ocean circulation is the by changing the temperature and salinity of the seawater. Near the poles, ocean water sinks because it is cold and salty. The ice formed at the poles doesn't take up salt very well and leaves it behind in the seawater. This makes it heavy and sink. - The most obvious way the Sun drives ocean circulation is by wind forcing. Energy is transferred directly from the atmosphere into the oceans. 6 - Wind Speed & Significant Wave Height: January 1995 - Here's an example of 2 types of T/P data available at http://podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov/topex/ - The upper image shows wind speed and the lower shows significant wave height. - In this and all other T/P data sets you'll see the color-coding is as follows: purples and blues indicate low values and yellows and reds indicate high values. - Based on these images, is there a correlation or match between wind speed and wave height? Answer - These data show the conditions during January, 1995. What should these data look like during June, 1995? 7 - Wind Speed & Significant Wave Height: June 1995 - The wind speed and significant wave height data for June, 1995 show high values near Antarctica. Thus, these images are the "opposite" of the previous example and clearly show the winter conditions in the Southern Hemisphere. - Did the tropics change character between January and June, 1995?

Dynamic ocean topography is used to calculate the currents in a similar way to how meteorlogists use atmospheric pressure maps to determine wind speed. Around the globe, the overall change in sea surface height caused by currents is about 2 meters (which is up to 75 times less than the influence of gravity!) The highest sea surface height is shown as read and lowest as blue. Click here to access the overall directory "Global Near-Real-Time Altimeter Sea Surface Height Page." The "Global Near Real-Time Altimeter Sea Surface Height Visualization" has interactive software program that lets you generate sea surface height along the satellites' "ground tracks" fora single day. The "Global Near Real-Time Altimeter Along-Track Data Host" gives the following data in ASCII format: Calendar date (month/day/year) Time of day (hour:min:sec) Seconds past midnight 1-Jan-1996 Latitude (degrees) East longitude (degrees) Sea Surface Height (millimeters) In addition to sea surface height is how the shape of the ocean changes over months or seasons. Maps of sea surface anomaly - also known as sea surface variability - are used to study changes in the ocean over months or seasons.

These changes in sea height depend on factors such as relatively short-term variations in ocean currents often caused by eddies, and seasonal changes in the temperature of the upper ocean layer. Sea surface anomaly signals are usually less than 12 centimeters, about one-sixteenth of the overall variation in sea surface height caused by ocean circulation. Access the "Global Near Real-Time Altimeter Data Viewer" for an interactive software program that allows you to create maps of sea surface height anomaly. This processing is designed to retain the sea surface height signatures associated with ocean fronts and eddies. The maps are produced from TOPEX and ERS-2 altimeter data processed in near real-time, usually within 24 to 36 hours of overflight. A map is produced every three days, based on the latest 10 days of TOPEX and/or 35 days of ERS-2 sampling data, if available.

(818) 354.5011 October 30, 1992 P-41223 TOPEX/Poseidon Globe This image from the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite shows preliminary results of waveheight over the global ocean as measured by the Ku-band NASA altimeter. Thedata were recorded from Sept. 25 to Oct. 4, 1992. The highest waves were observedin the Southern Ocean south of South Africa and Australia, where gian waves ashigh as eight meters (26 feet) were recorded. These waves are shown in red.(The small pink square on the shoreline of Antarctica is a artifact ofprocessing.) The pattern of wave height is dependent upon the season. The highestwaves tend to occur in winter and the lowest waves in summer. The time of thisobservation was during the transition of winter to spring in the Southern Hemisphere. Wave height is one of the oceanographic measurements made by theTOPEX/Poseidon satellite. It is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse.A calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse, and a rough sea with highwaves returns a stretched pulse. Calibration and validation of the altimeterobservation against ground truth measurements will be conducted over the nextfew months. TOPEX/Poseidon, a joint U.S./French mission, is part of NASA's EarthScience and Application Division. Launched Aug. 10, 1992, it is the secondsatellite in the Mission to Planet Earth program, a long-term effort to studyEarth from space.

At the same time the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) was designing an oceanographic mission called Poseidon, named for the Greek god of the sea. In the early 1980's, they pooled their resources to form a single mission called TOPEX/Poseidon. TOPEX/Poseidon's ability to accurately measure sea surface height is 3 times better than the original requirement. Given that the satellite flies at an altitude of 1336 km (830 miles), this is comparable to being able to detect less than the width of a U.S. dime on the surface of the ocean from a jet flying at 35,000 feet! As part of the effort "to lay the foundation for a continuing program to provide long-term observations of ocean circulation" a follow-on mission is currently planned to launch during 1999.

The shape of the sea surface is influenced by both gravity and ocean circulation. To find the surface caused by ocean circulation, we remove the sea height caused by gravity and create maps of ocean topography. We then calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents similar to how meteorologists use atmospheric pressure maps to calculate winds. To measure sea surface height we need: the satellite's position in its orbit and the height between the satellite and the ocean's surface, measured with the radar altimeter. Three systems are used to measure the satellite's position: the Laser Retroreflector Array, the DORIS beacon, and the Global Positioning System. We can locate the spacecraft to less than 3 centimeters (about 1.1 inches... about half the length of a stick of chewing gum!) Learn more about how TOPEX/Poseidon works....

Climate is the average course of weather or conditions at a place over a period of years. Climatic changes take place over months, years, thousands or even millions of years. Thanks to technological advances, measuring and studying many factors that affect climate is now possible. Reliable records of weather and climate are available for the past century, but these measurements were usually taken only over land areas. With TOPEX/Poseidon, the remaining 70% of the Earth's surface, the oceans, can finally begin to be accurately included into global climate models.

The oceans absorb the sun's heat and evaporate water into the air. The water falls as rain and the released heat drives the atmosphere and creates winds. The winds, in turn, drive ocean currents and redistribute heat over the globe. White and Tai, JGR, Vol. 100, p. 24943, 1995 The above figure compares heat storage as measured from ocean sensors andTOPEX/Poseidon satellite data.The calculation error for satellite data, shown as line thickness, is half that of ocean sensors. Measuring the ocean's heat storage has traditionally been done using 100's to 1000's of ocean sensors. This may be done more efficiently by satellite. During TOPEX/Poseidon's first month of operation it provided more data about the ocean's surface than had been collected by ships during the previous 100 years! Forward to What is Ocean Circulation?

Ocean water density is controlled by temperature and salinity. When ocean water evaporates, it makes the water denser: it lowers the temperature and increases the salinity. In general, the ocean can be divided into two layers: a thin upper layer whose density is lower because it is warmed by the sun, and a thick lower layer, which is denser and only a few degrees above the freezing point. The rotation of the Earth affects ocean height and the direction of currents as shown below. In the Northern hemisphere, the currents are forced to the right -- this creates "hills" in areas of clockwise-flowing currents and "valleys" where the flow is counterclockwise. In the Southern hemisphere, currents are driven toward the left, and the effect on sea height is reversed. TOPEX/Poseidon's basic goal is to measure the ocean's "hills" and "valleys" and model ocean circulation based on ocean topography. Forward to Why is Ocean Circulation Important?

Ocean circulation the key factor that controls global climate change. Thus, TOPEX/Poseidon's primary science goals include monitoring ocean circulation, studying ocean dynamics, and calculating heat transport. "The Global Conveyer Belt for Heat" represents in a simple way how ocean currents carry warm surface waters from the equator toward the poles and moderate global climate. This global circuit takes up to 1,000 years to complete. A fundamental tool used to study global surface ocean circulation is the Ocean Dynamic Topography map. In the figure below, ocean topography highs or "hills" are shown as red and yellow, and lows or "valleys" are blue and purple. This map reveals large features such as ocean gyres that are fairly stable over time. From these maps, scientists calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents.

These data show how sea level varies from the yearly average during fall and spring. At middle latitudes, the seasonal sea level change depends on the heating and cooling of the upper ocean. The highest sea level occurs in fall when the ocean has been heated throughout summer. The lowest sea level is found during the spring off the east coast of the continents in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because, throughout the winter, cold continental winds blow over ocean and remove an great amount of heat. In fact, the seasonal sea level changes are about twice as great in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, partly because of the greater concentration of continents in the Northern Hemisphere.

Ocean eddies last from weeks to months, have diameters of ten to hundreds of kilometers and extend deep into the ocean. They transport an enormous amount of heat, salt and nutrients in the ocean. Above, TOPEX/Poseidon data show where eddies occur and their sea-surface height changes. The most rapidly swirling eddies can cause great changes in sea height -- over 25 centimeters (10 inches). They are found with strong ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream off the east coast of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Eddies & Their Tie to Whale Sightings In late summer 1993, sperm whale sightings were correlated with eddies in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The whale pods were found near areas of low sea surface height associated with counterclockwise circulation and the upwelling of nutrient-rich, deep waters. In the future, TOPEX/Poseidon data will be used to monitor eddy circulation in conjunction with detailed whale studies in the Gulf of Mexico.

One famous example is "El Nino." El Nino was named by people who fish off the western coast of central America to refer to the warm current that invades their coastal waters around Christmastime. El Nino events disrupt fisheries and bring severe weather events worldwide. In a normal year, the trade winds blow westward and push warm surface water near Australia and New Guinea. When warm water builds up in the western Pacific Ocean, nutrient-rich cold water comes up off the west coast of South America and fosters the growth of the fish population. During an El Nino year, the trade winds weaken and warm, nutrient-poor water occupies the entire tropical Pacific Ocean. Heavy rains that are tied to the warm water move into the central Pacific Ocean and cause drought in Indonesia and Australia. This also alters the path of the atmospheric jet stream over North and South America. TOPEX/Poseidon data helps guide computer models for El Nino prediction. The image below compares a computer simulation with actual observations of sea level during December 1994. The warm colors correspond to higher sea level and a surplus of heat in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These conditions contributed to the heavy rains in California during the winter of 1995.

This is several times the discharge rate of the all the rivers in the world! Thus, even small changes in sea level cause massive adjustments of ocean circulation, which occur as slowly moving waves. Two important examples are Kelvin and Rossby waves. Kelvin waves always move eastward and cross the Pacific Ocean along the equator in about two months. The energy from Kelvin waves can trigger long-lived Rossby waves. Rossby waves always move westward and are caused by the Earth's rotation. Observing them is extremely difficult because they change sea level only 10 - 20 centimeters (4 - 8 inches) and are spread over hundreds of kilometers. Rossby waves can take more than 10 years to cross the Pacific at the latitude of Los Angeles, California and more than 30 years at the latitude of Portland, Oregon. Kelvin and Rossby waves can alter sea surface temperatures and affect weather patterns for long periods of time. For example, in 1994 scientists mapped a Rossby wave that was a remnant of an El Nino that happened ten years earlier! They concluded that the Kuroshio current, found off the east coast of Japan, was pushed northward by this Rossby wave. This may have contributed to the flooding across the midwestern U.S. in 1993 by raising the temperature of the northwest Pacific Ocean.

The changing position of the Sun and Moon causes very small changes in gravity which produces ocean tides. At the Earth's surface, the change in gravity due to the Moon is about twice as great as that of the Sun. Sea level tends to be highest on the parts of the Earth's surface directly toward and directly opposite the Moon, creating tidal bulges, as shown below. Where tidal bulges occur is tied to the Moon's position. As the Earth rotates, the tidal bulges move across the oceans causing two daily high and two daily low tides. The time when daily high and low tides occur changes as the Moon orbits around the Earth. During any month, the biggest range between daily high and daily low tide happens at New Moon and Full Moon. Many of history's great scientists including Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, Newton, Laplace, Bernoulli, Euler, and Lord Kelvin tried to predict the tides using hydrodynamical equations. Now, with TOPEX/Poseidon's global observations, tides are accurately known everywhere in the deep ocean. Better knowledge of ocean tides can improve maritime navigation, help us track Earth-orbiting satellites, and enhance our understanding of the process that is slowing down the Earth's rotation and causing the Moon to slowly move farther away from us.

Shown above is the global distribution of wind speed. Wind speed is determined by the strength of the radar signal after it has bounced off the ocean surface and returned to the satellite. A calm sea serves as a good reflector and returns a strong signal; a rough sea tends to scatter the signals and returns a weak pulse. Comparing the images above and below shows a strong tie between wind speed and wave height. The strongest winds (over 54 kilometers per hour or 33.6 miles per hour) and highest waves are found in the Southern Ocean. The weakest winds -- shown as areas of magenta and dark blue -- are generally found in the tropical Oceans.

Where do Ocean Eddies Come From? What Causes Hills & Valleys in the Ocean? 8 - Ocean Heat Transport 9 - Ocean Eddies 10 - What Factors Contribute to Sea Height? 11 - Earth's Geoid 12 - How Earth's Rotation Affects Winds & Currents 13 - The Coriolis Effect 14 - Hills & Valleys in the Ocean 15 - Dynamic Ocean Topography 8 - Ocean Heat Transport - The "Global Conveyer Belt" shows how the oceans move energy from the tropics to the poles and back again in order to moderate Earth's climate. This is accomplished through long-term ocean circulation. - On this diagram, warm surface water is orange and the cold bottom water is purple. The ocean is generally divided up into 2 layers: a warm upper layer that is much thinner than the cold bottom layer. The cold bottom layer is important because it holds a great amount of nutrients that are basis for the marine food chain. -Why are nutrients concentrated in the cold, lower ocean layer? Answer - Ocean water at the surface is warmed at the tropics, moves toward the poles where it loses heat, becomes saltier, denser, and sinks. - The cold bottom layer circulates through the oceans. It takes up to 1,000 years for water to completely circulate throughout the oceans. - How well this "conveyer belt" transports heat about the world oceans may actually control the global climate. 9 - Ocean Eddies - These T/P data show where ocean eddies occur. The colors on this image show sea surface height changes, up to 25 cm or 10 inches, associated with these swirling ocean features. - Ocean eddies are often found near fast ocean currents. - Are eddies concentrated in certain parts of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans? Answer - Ocean circulation extends over large areas (up to ocean basin-wide) and lasts over many years. Ocean eddies are usually 50 - 200 km across and are considered "mesoscale" or intermediate-sized features. Ocean eddies generally last a few months. - Ocean eddies are a type of ocean "weather." They play an important role in transporting heat in the oceans. Also, eddies bring nutrients from below to enhance the growth of the marine life. 10 - What Factors Contribute to Sea Height? - Many oceanographers are interested in how much the height of the sea surface changes over time. To do this, they measure the sea surface height relative to an imaginary surface called the "geoid." - The "geoid" is the shape the sea surface would have if the ocean were not in motion and only influenced by gravity. - Other than gravity, what factors contribute to sea surface height? Answer - Which of these factors change over days or months? Answer - Which of these factors depend on location in the ocean? Answer - Can you guess the amount that some of these factors contribute to sea height? Answer 11 - Earth's Geoid - Believe it not, the height Earth's oceans changes by about 150 meters (almost 500 feet) from the north Indian Ocean (off the south coast of India) and western Pacific Ocean (off of New Guinea)! - This "smoothed" map does not include the effect of seamounts, trenches, etc. on the ocean's surface height. - What do we call the influence of the Moon's gravity on Earth's oceans? Answer - Earth's geoid is a calculated surface of equal gravitational potential energy and represents the shape the sea surface would be if the ocean were not in motion. How the "real" ocean surface differs from the geoid gives ocean currents. - To study the how various factors like ocean circulation and eddies affect the height of our oceans, oceanographers eliminate the height of sea surface caused by gravity. 12 - How Earth's Rotation Affects Winds & Currents - Our planet's rotation produces a force on all bodies moving relative to the Earth. - The force is greatest at the poles and least at the Equator. This is because of Earth's appoximately spherical shape. - The force, called the "Coriolis effect," causes the direction of winds and ocean currents to be deflected. - The "rule of thumb" is that in the Northern Hemisphere, wind and currents are deflected toward the right; in the Southern Hemisphere they are deflected to the left. 13 - The Coriolis Effect - Click on the image at left to see a movie created by the University of Illinois Department of Atmospheric Sciences. - It shows the path of ball being thrown from a view above the moving merry-go-round, and on the merry-go-round. - From ABOVE the spinning merry-go-round the path the ball travels appears to be straight. - However, from the perspective ON the merry-go-round the ball appears to curve to the left as it moves from person-to-person. - Likewise, to a person sitting on the rotating Earth the path of moving objects appears to be deflected. - Which part of the merry-go-round is moving the fastest: the outside or the inside? Answer - The velocity of the ball itself is constant as it moves from the outside to the inside of the merry-go-round. However, the velocity of the platform beneath the ball is changing as it moves from the outside of the merry-go-round, to the inside, and again. Overall, this makes the ball's path appear to deflect as it moves. - The oceans and atmosphere are not rigidly attached to the Earth's surface and this makes their direction of motion very suseptible to apparent deflection by the "Coriolis" force. 14 - Hills & Valleys in the Ocean - The direction of ocean currents at the sea surface is related to wind forcing. However, the "Coriolis effect" also affects the motion of the ocean. - The "Coriolis effect" causes the movement of water in the uppermost wind-driven part of ocean (known as the "Ekman layer") to create hills and valleys in the ocean topography, or shape. - In the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise winds (black arrows, at top) cause surface ocean water to move to the right and away from a central point (grey arrows), causing a sea surface valley (bottom image). - The "side view" image (at bottom) shows how the slope of the sea surface creates currents that flow around these hills and valleys, "in" and "out" of the page -- known as "geostrophic currents." - In the Northern Hemisphere, clockwise winds cause surface ocean water to move to the right and toward a the central point, causing a sea surface hill. - "Geostrophic currents" flow around these high and low centers of water pressure, similar to how winds blow from high to low pressure. They are located below the wind-driven layer and their velocity is proportional to the slope of the sea surface. - These "hills" and "valleys" -- or ocean topography -- are measured by T/P and used to calculate "geostrophic" ocean currents, similarly to how meteorologists use atmospheric pressure maps to track winds and weather. 15 - Dynamic Ocean Topography - Ocean currents are mapped by studying the "hills" and "valleys" in maps of the height of the sea surface relative to the geoid. - This height is called "Dynamic Ocean Topography." - Currents move around ocean dynamic topography "hills" and "valleys" in a predictable way. - "Cool" colors such as purple and blue correspond to topographic valleys and that "warm" colors such as yellow and red correspond to topographic highs or hills. - Note that a clockwise sense of rotation is found around "hills" in the Northern Hemisphere and "valleys" in the Southern Hemisphere. This is because of the "Coriolis effect." - Conversely, a counterclockwise sense of rotation is found around "valleys" in the Northern Hemisphere and "hills" in the Southern Hemisphere. - In general, our major ocean currents are stable and so maps of dynamic ocean topography change very little over time.

What Can We Learn About Currents from T/P Data? How Does Sea Level Change Over Time and Why? Why Are These Changes Important to Our Weather & Climate? 16 - Dynamic Ocean Topography: Sept '92 & May '96 17 - Currents Calculated from Ocean Topography 18 - Changes in Sea Height Over Time 19 - Mapping Variability in the Pacific Ocean 20 - Normal Pacific Ocean Conditions 21 - El Nino Conditions in the Pacific Ocean 22 - Improving El Nino Predictions 16 - Dynamic Ocean Topography: Sept '92 & May '96 - Maps of dynamic ocean topography are used to track ocean circulation. - Monthly images of this sea surface topography are available for 1992,1993,1994,1995,and 1996. - What is the difference between the highest and lowest parts of the world's dynamic ocean topography? (Click on image to see the color scale) Answer - How does this compare to how much sea height is influenced by gravity? Answer - At top is the first monthly data set taken after the launch of the T/P satellite. At bottom is more recent data. - Do these maps look significantly different from each other? Why or why not? Answer - Notice where very low areas of sea level occur (shown as magenta and purple). How do these areas correspond to how heat is transported by the "Global Conveyer Belt"? Answer - As you know, maps of dynamic ocean topography are used to calculate the direction of surface currents. Can you draw the direction the ocean currents are moving? 17 - Currents Calculated from Ocean Topography - The arrows on this map show the direction of surface geostrophic current calculated from T/P data. - In the Northern Hemisphere "hills" correspond to clockwise ocean currents and "valleys" indicate counterclockwise currents. The sense of motion in the Southern Hemisphere is the opposite. - Before satellites, it took many years of ship data to create a map of global oceans. Now, an updated map of ocean circulation is available every 10 days. 18 - Changes in Sea Height Over Time - Sea surface variability maps are used to study the changes in the ocean over months or seasons. They show how currents vary over short times and distances due to eddies and seasonal changes in the temperature of the upper ocean layer. - Monthly images of sea surface variability are available for 1992,1993,1994,1995,and 1996. - In these examples, what is the overall difference in sea height across the globe? (Click on image to see the color scale) Answer - How does this compares to the overall difference in sea height associated with the dynamic ocean topography? Answer - The two maps are from different months during 1995. Can you guess which season each map represents? Answer - First, look at the top halves of both maps simultaneously and then, look at the bottom halves of both maps simultaneously. How do the "ocean seasons" look different in the Northern and Southern hemisphere? Why do they look different? Answer 19 - Mapping Variability in the Pacific Ocean - These maps have the same data as the previous image but are plotted with the Pacific Ocean at the center. - Make profiles of sea surface height along the Equator from Borneo to Peru for each map. Click here to find out how. - How do these profiles compare? In what way are the graphs different from one another? Answer - In the Eastern Pacific, the difference in sea surface height between these maps is about 18 centimeters (7 inches). - How does this affect our climate? 20 - Normal Pacific Ocean Conditions - This image represents normal conditions in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean in the Western Pacific (around New Guinea). Normally, "Trade Winds" blow steady from east-to-west and "pile up" warm ocean water at in the Western Pacific. The colors in the image correspond to sea surface height. - Click this image to see a 3-dimensional graphic showing the area around the Pacific Ocean. It diagrams how the Trade Winds interact with sea surface height, ocean layers, and heavy concentrations of rain. - Under "normal" circumstances, the Trade Winds blow west along the Equator and allow nutrient-rich bottom water to come up, or upwell, along the coast of South America. This provides good conditions for fish production. - During these times, heavy rains are tied to the warm water concentrated in the Western Pacific Ocean, near New Guinea and Australia. 21 - El Nino Conditions in the Pacific Ocean - Most people have heard of "El Nino" but few realize that it is caused by the interaction between the Trade Winds and the ocean. A "minor" difference in sea surface height means a big difference in the where ocean heat is stored and where heavy rains and severe drought occur. - Click on this image to see a 3-dimensional representation of El Nino conditions around the Pacific Ocean. - The name El Nino was coined by those who fish the waters off of the west coast of Peru to refer to the warm currents that typically appear around Christmastime causing a decline in the fish population. In some years, however, this phenomenon is so severe that fishing is interrupted for many months. - For decades, climatologists have assembled data from around the globe in order to detect links to severe El Nino conditions. Pieces of the El Nino puzzle include dramatic shifts in normal conditions such as: drought in Australia, New Guinea, India, and Africa; mild winters in Canada; severe winters in California, Christmas Island (central Pacific), and Peru. Other, more subtle, evidence tied to severe El Nino conditions includes high pressure records in Australia, fishery production, patterns of marine life, changes in coral reefs, and few-degree increases in sea-surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean. - Scientists have concluded that all of these conditions are tied to weakened Trade Winds that allow warm ocean surface water to travel eastward. This warm water brings heavy rains that disrupt normal atmospheric conditions. - All of this is signaled by a rise in sea surface height of 18 cm (7 inches)! - A good way to monitor this relatively small change in the sea level that has a huge impact is the T/P satellite. - Can you guess the financial impact that the 1982 - 83 El Nino had (in U.S. dollars)? Answer 22 - Improving El Nino Predictions - These images show recent attempts to model one El Nino event. At top is a computer simulation and at bottom is actual sea surface height data from the 1994 - 95 El Nino event. Notice how the computer model underestimates the true ocean signature. - Satellite altimetry data that spans over a decade will be obtained by T/P and its follow-on mission, Jason-1. These data will provide the key to unravelling how El Nino events form, what their long-term impact on the climate might be, and possibly predict future El Nino events.

The "Doppler effect" is what causes the distinctive sound pattern you hear when a car passes. The distance between your ear and the car changes as it passes and so does the frequency of the sound waves generated by the car; Light from ground-based lasers is reflected off mirrors on the T/P satellite; and The Global Positioning System (GPS) network is used. At times, a T/P receiver tracks several GPS satellites simultaneously and, because the position of GPS satellites is well-known, T/P's position can be calculated. This was originally only an experiment but is now a very reliable data source.

The average amount of incoming solar radiation decreases from the Equator to the poles. This is because the low latitudes (near the Equator) receive relatively large amounts of radiation all year, AND at high latitudes (near the poles), the more oblique angle of the Sun's rays together with long periods of darkness in the winter, result in a low average amount of received radiation.

The colors show the sea level relative to a 2-year mean averaged over 1993 - 1994: magenta indicates 15 centimeters lower than average and red 15 centimeters higher than average. El Nino caused the excessive heat (red and yellow) associated with the high sea levels in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. The rise of tropical air and formation of rainclouds contributed to the severe weather and heavy rains in California during winter 1995. This comparison shows that the model underestimated the magnitude of oceanic features during this El Nino event. Using TOPEX/Poseidon data, scientists are working to improve the performance of such models, with the goals of reliably predicting future climatic events. Oceanic Kelvin & Rossby Waves This sequence of 3 TOPEX/Poseidon "snapshots" show sea surface height data in the Pacific Ocean. White and red indicated higher than average levels; purple and magenta indicate lower than average levels. These scenes show eastward-moving Kelvin waves andwestward-moving Rossby waves. Superimposed black circles show how the elevated sea surface moves east in April (top), then west as Rossby waves during July (middle) and December (bottom). The 2 small black circles off the coast of the Americas correspond to sea level highs on the trailing edge of Kelvin waves. The leading edge of this wave group has bounced off the coastline, creating Rossby waves whose rising and falling sea levels are marked by solid and dashed lines, respectively. In the July image, the circles are moving west with the Rossby waves. The "X" marks a relative sea level low caused by a Kelvin wave moving east. In December, the Rossby waves continue to move westward. The shapes of the solid and dashed lines indicate that the Rossby waves are moving away from the Americas faster at the equator than at higher latitudes.

The TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data, combined with information from the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite, are being used in near-real-time to generate circulation feature maps that will be faxed to scientists aboard the research ship R/V Gyre. These maps provide scientists with timely information about rapidly changing ocean features so that scientists can direct the ship toward those areas to determine if whales and dolphins are present. "There is evidence that whales prefer to feed in the edges of cyclonic eddies, and the satellite data give us a good picture of where those oceanographic features are located," said Dr. George Born, a principal investigator on the TOPEX/Poseidon project from the University of Colorado at Boulder. The university is generating the ocean maps and sending them directly to the scientists in the Gulf. "The data from TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-2 greatly enhances our ability to identify and map circulation features as they occur in the Gulf," said Dr. Robert Leben, a co-principal investigator on the project at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The R/V Gyre left Pascagoula, Mississippi, on October 10 and will survey the northeastern Gulf of Mexico until October 28. A previous survey indicated that whales and dolphins were contacted most frequently in the area where warm water eddies break off from the Gulf Loop Current, a strong ocean current that circulates around the Gulf of Mexico. "The goal of our cruise is to make a visual and acoustic census of marine mammals and to define their physical and biological habitat in the northeastern Gulf in areas potentially affected by oil and gas activities now or in the future," said Dr. Randall Davis, head of the Marine Biology department at Texas A & M University at Galveston. "Altimeter data like that from TOPEX/Poseidon are the only information that enable on-site adjustments to the cruise plan to optimize the survey track, ultimately saving us time and money." The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite was developed to study global ocean circulation but it is providing unexpected benefits for marine biologists. "We are very excited that these data are being used in new and different ways. Scientists are continuing to find newapplications for this project and are proving they can study not only ocean currents, but also the creatures that inhabit the oceans," said Dr. Lee-Lueng Fu, TOPEX/Poseidon project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite uses an altimeter to bounce radar signals off the ocean's surface to get precise measurements of the distance between the satellite and the sea surface. These data are combined with measurements from other instruments that pinpoint the satellite's exact location in space. Every 10 days, scientists are able to produce a complete map of global ocean topography, the barely perceptible hills and valleys found on the sea surface. With detailed knowledge of ocean topography, scientist can then calculate the speed and direction of worldwide ocean currents. The R/V Gyre expedition is sponsored by Texas A & M University, the Texas Institute of Oceanography and the National Biological Service. TOPEX/Poseidon is a joint mission of NASA and the French space agency, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the U.S. portion of the mission for NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth, Washington, DC. The Mission to Planet Earth is a long-term, coordinated research effort to study the Earth as a global environmental system.

Oceanographers use ocean topography maps to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents in the same way meteorologists use maps of atmospheric pressure to calculate the speed and direction of winds. TOPEX/POSEIDON is the first space mission that allows scientists to map ocean topography with sufficient accuracy to study the large-scale current systems of the world's oceans. The total relief of ocean topography shown in this image is about 2 meters. The color scale corresponds to the grades of the relief in centimeters. The vertical scale is greatly exaggerated to illustrate the three-dimensional perspective of the topography. In this image, the maximum sea level (shown in white) is located in the western Pacific Ocean and the minimum sea level (indicated by magenta and dark blue) is shown around Antarctica. In the northern hemisphere, ocean currents flow clockwise around the highs of ocean topography and counterclockwise around the lows; this process is reversed in the southern hemisphere. These highs and lows are the oceanic counterparts of atmospheric circulation systems. While the basic structure of these ocean systems is constant, the details of the systems are constantly changing. Although this image was constructed from only 10 days of TOPEX/POSEIDON data (October 3 to October 12, 1992), it reveals most of the current systems that have been identified by shipboard observations collected over the last 100 years. For instance, major current systems such as Kuroshio (the current south of Japan), the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, among others, are clearly visible. The ocean topography data used in this image were calculated by scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center. The image was produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Oceanography Group. The TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Ocean-Monitoring Mission A joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - CNES) to study Earth's oceans, the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will observe the global ocean circulation for three to five years. The oceans play a fundamental role in maintaining the current habitable climate on Earth by transporting an enormous amount of heat through their large-scale circulation systems. Understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and the role this circulation plays in climate change is the main goal of theTOPEX/POSEIDON mission. TOPEX/POSEIDON will measure sea levels; map basin-wide variations in currents, and monitor the effects of currents, such as the Gulf Stream, on global climate change. Additionally, the mission's measurements will allow scientists to study ocean tides and waves, marine geophysics and wind. The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite travels in a 66-degree inclined orbit around Earth at an altitude of 1,366 kilometers. This orbit allows coverage of 95 percent of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. The satellite's position is known to within 10 centimeters from Earth's center, an unprecedented accuracy that will enable the satellite's radar altimeters to make precise measurements in sea heights. TOPEX/POSEIDON carries six sensors: NASA supplied the dual-frequency altimeter, the laser retroreflector array, the TOPEX microwave radiometer and the experimental Global Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver; CNES supplies the single-frequency, solid-state altimeter and the DORIS (Determination of Orbit Radiopositioning Integrated from Satellite) dual-Doppler tracking system receiver.

Wind speed is determined by the strength of the return radar pulses. A calm sea serves as a good reflector and returns a strong pulse; on the other hand, a rough sea tends to scatter the radar signal and returns a weak pulse. In this image, the strongest winds (over 15 meters per second or 54 kilometers per hour) are found in the Southern Ocean and are indicated by white. The highest waves are also located in this region; see the wave height image. In general, there is a high degree of correlation between wind speed and wave height. The weakest winds (represented by magenta and dark blue) are found in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the tropical Indian Ocean. A few bands of these so-called trade winds are also noticeable in the subtropical regions. Wave Heights in Earth' Oceans (P-41497) (Bottom) Global wave height data acquired by TOPEX/POSEIDON's dual-frequency radar altimeter from October 3 to October 12, 1992, were used to create thisimage. Wave height is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse. A calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse whereas a rough sea with high waves returns a stretched pulse. In this image, the highest waves occur in the Southern Ocean, where waves over 6 meters in height (represented by white) are found. The strongest winds are also found in this region; see the wind speed image. The lowest waves (indicated by dark blue) are found primarily in the tropical and subtropical oceans where the wind speed is also the lowest. In general, there is a high degree of correlation between wind speed and wave height. Simultaneous observations of wind speed and wave height by TOPEX/POSEIDON will help improve our ability to forecast ocean waves.

Water vapor in the atmosphere can delay the return of the radar pulses to the satellite, this interfering with the accuracy of sea-level measurements. To correct for this delay, a microwave radiometer aboard TOPEX/POSEIDON measures the atmospheric water vapor content, expressed as the total grams of water vapor in an imaginary column between the satellite and a square centimeter of the sea, at any particular point of the globe. This image shows the global distribution of water vapor measured by the satellite's radiometer from October 3 to October 12, 1992. The highest values (indicated by red) occur in the western tropical Pacific Ocean and the eastern tropical Indian Ocean where the ocean surface waters are the warmest. Without this correction, a water vapor content of 5 grams per square centimeter in these regions would cause an altimeter measurement error of 32 centimeters; such an error could interfere significantly with the study of oceancirculation. The atmospheric water vapor is important in itself because the heat released by its condensation into vapor fuels atmospheric circulation. Water vapor is also related to sea-surface humidity, which controls the transfer of latent heat (heat required by evaporating water) from the oceans to the atmosphere. In addition, it is a greenhouse gas that affects Earth's radiative heat balance. Monitoring the global water vapor content is thus an important task for understanding the role of the oceans in weather and climate change. The TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Ocean-Monitoring Mission A joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - CNES) to study Earth's oceans, the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will observe the global ocean circulation for three to five years. The oceans play a fundamental role in maintaining the current habitable climate on Earth by transporting an enormous amount of heat through their large-scale circulation systems. Understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and the role this circulation plays in climate change is the main goal of theTOPEX/POSEIDON mission. TOPEX/POSEIDON will measure sea levels; map basin-wide variations in currents, and monitor the effects of currents, such as the Gulf Stream, on global climate change. Additionally, the mission's measurements will allow scientists to study ocean tides and waves, marine geophysics and wind. The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite travels in a 66-degree inclined orbit around Earth at an altitude of 1,366 kilometers. This orbit allows coverage of 95 percent of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. The satellite's position is known to within 10 centimeters from Earth's center, an unprecedented accuracy that will enable the satellite's radar altimeters to make precise measurements in sea heights. TOPEX/POSEIDON carries six sensors: NASA supplied the dual-frequency altimeter, the laser retroreflector array, the TOPEX microwave radiometer and the experimental Global Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver; CNES supplies the single-frequency, solid-state altimeter and the DORIS (Determination of Orbit Radiopositioning Integrated from Satellite) dual-Doppler tracking system receiver.

This indicates the distance, or range, between the sea and the satellite. Free electrons in Earth's ionosphere can delay the return of the radar pulses to the satellite, this interfering with the accuracy of sea-level measurements. To correct for this delay, the satellite's National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) altimeter makes measurements in two channels: Ku-band (13.6 GHz) and C-band (5.3 GHz). Because the ionospheric range delay is a function of radar frequency, the difference between the two measurements provides both a measure of the integrated electron content and a correction for the range delay. This is the first dual-frequency altimeter to measure the ionospheric range correction directly, providing the first global, high-resolution view of the ionospheric electron content. The integrated electron content varies with local time - the maximum level occurs during the day and the minimum level during the night. This image shows the daytime integrated electron content of the ionosphere between October 22 and November 1, 1992. Magenta regionscontain less than 8 x 10^16 electrons per square meter (a range correction of 1.7 centimeter or less), while white areas contain in excess of 74 x 10^16 electrons per square meter (a range correction of 16.1 centimeters or more). The range correction can reach values greater than 30 centimeters. The image shows two prominent aspects of the ionosphere - the "equatorial anomaly" and the influence of Earth's magnetic field. The equatorial anomaly refers to the fact that the maximum electron concentration is not at the equator but at about 15 degrees north and south. It is also clear that the band of maximum ionospheric effect is not parallel to the geographic equator. Instead, it slants from north to south across the Pacific Ocean following the geomagnetic equator and reaches its southernmost point in the "South Atlantic Anomaly" region just east of South America.

By doing this, we cover the same areas of the ocean and can monitor how the sea surface height changes through time. "Maintaining" TOPEX/Poseidon's orbit is needed because atmospheric drag reduces the satellite's altitude and causes the ground track to drift eastward, outside the desired path. To correct for this eastward drift, we fire onboard thrusters and cause a westward drift in the ground track. Months later, when atmospheric drag causes the ground track to again drift eastward beyond the acceptable limit, another "Orbit Maintenance Maneuver" is performed. During TOPEX/Poseidon's first three years in orbit, we performed eight such maneuvers. Forward to What is Climate?

The winds were named by crews of sailing ships that depended on them during westward ocean crossings. The trade winds are controlled by ties between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially sea surface temperature. During an El Nino year, the winds that usually blow steadily towards the west weaken and even reverse direction. The figure below shows how winds in the western Pacific Ocean, near the island of New Guinea, reversed their direction between April and October, 1994. With weakened trade winds, the huge mass of warm water usually found in the western Pacific moves eastward. As it does so, it sends a pulse called a Kelvin wave along the equator. This long wave moves eastward toward the west coast of South America, where it thickens the warm, upper ocean layer and causes sea level to rise. The thickened warm water layer prevents upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that fish thrive upon.

Black circles show how the sea surface moves east in a Kelvin wave group in April, then west with Rossby waves during July and December. In the April image, the two small black circles off the coast of the Americas correspond to sea-level highs on the trailing edge of Kelvin waves moving east. The leading edge of this wave group has already "bounced off" the coastline, creating Rossby waves whose rising and falling sea levels are marked by solid and dashed lines, respectively. In the July and December images, the circles are moving west with the Rossby waves. The "X" in the July image marks a sea level low caused by a Kelvin wave moving east. The shapes of the solid and dashed lines indicate that the Rossby waves are moving away from the Americas more quickly at the equator than at higher latitudes. For the first time scientists can track Kelvin and Rossby waves as they move through the open ocean. They have discovered that, at middle latitudes, Rossby waves move 2 - 3 times faster than previously thought. This may help forecasters improve their ability to predict the effects of El Nino events on weather patterns years in advance.

Did you know that if you are using AT&T, MCI and Sprint that you are helping to subsidize the contributions to liberals and anti-family organizations? But you can stop that today! All it takes is a phone call. It's simple. If you use LifeLine's AmeriVision long distance billing service, they will send 10% of your monthly domestic long distance bill to The American Family Policy Institute. This 10% may not seem like much, but when it is multiplied by many thousands of concerned Americans it can become a substantial amount of money. In price and quality, AmeriVision is competitive with MCI, Sprint and AT&T. There is no double billing; you will receive one bill each month from your local carrier. If you are not completely satisfied after 90 days, you can switch back to the carrier of your choice at no charge. Even if your monthly phone bill is not that high, all of us together can make a tremendous difference! You can sign up right now by calling 1 (800) 311-2783. Amerivision-LifeLine was started in early 1990 to help raise funds to stop the moral decline of America. The other major carriers spend millions on advertising promoting sex and violence on T.V., which is a major cause of moral decay and increase violence among our youth throughout our nation, supporting gay rights, abortion and liberal views. LifeLine is in direct opposition to these views. We support justice, morals in our nation, pro-life, and pro-family, and take a stand against abortion, homo-sexual lifestyle, and the sex and violence on T.V. LifeLine is in direct opposition to these views. Major carriers are spending millions on T.V. advertising that only confuse the public about their discounts. Most of the time, the customer does not get discounts they are promised. All other major companies are created in the world's system which is only interested in one goal, The Almighty Dollar. LifeLine's primary goal is to support, defend and promote faith, family and freedom. The difference in LifeLine and other major carriers is that LifeLine gives $1.5 million dollars each month pro-family, pro-America, conservative organizations and causes. For every $20 that you spend on long distance, LifeLine will give $2.00 back to those organizations who are fighting to Reclaim America and defend your faith, family and freedoms. 60,000 people per month are choosing to switch to LifeLine, to save money and support the things they believe in. PLEASE REMEMBER, WHEN YOU BECOME A CUSTOMER OF LIFELINE, YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE PHONE AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE WITH ONE ADVANTAGE. NOW EVERY CALL YOU MAKE WILL HELP RESTORE THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN CULTURE. Federal election records reveal AT&T, MCI & Sprint gave over $6,000 to re-elect Ted Kennedy. AT&T gave The National Organization for Women $115,000 and AT&T and Sprint have spent thousands of dollars to help re-elect some of the most liberal congressmen. Life Line is a long distance company which supports only the pro-family agenda while saving you four to eight percent off AT&T's standard long distant charges. Not only will you save money, Life Line gives 10%% of each domestic long distant call to conservative, pro-family organizations who are fighting for your faith, family and freedoms. Imagine, quality long distance service, savings of 4-8 percent and the assurance that Life Line Long distance is not funding groups like the National Organization For Women. In fact, this year Life Line will give over 15 million dollars to conservatives who are fighting Goals 2000, outcome-based education, the Government's takeover of education and much more. Call Life Line at 1 (800) 311-2783. Lifeline will switch you for free, and you can support the only the conservative agenda with each call you make. That number again is 1 (800) 311-2783.

AFPI spends thousands of man-hours each year investigating alleged constitutional violations. Once an investigation is completed and violations confirmed, AFPI uses its numerous media contacts to bring national attention to the findings of the investigation. Through its contacts with several public-interest law groups, (such as The Rutherford Institute, The Liberty Counsel, and The Alliance Defense Fund) AFPI sees that the appropriate legal action is taken to defend the constitutional rights of individuals, provide a legal remedy of victims governmental abuse, prevent repeated violations from happening again and in some cases help the victims receive compensation. Though its resource list, AFPI provides information to the American people so that they can take a pro-active roll in running and controlling their schools, community and nation.WT02-B08-362IA062-000353-B003-94http://www.familypolicy.com:80/headlines.html 206.107.214.109 19970115204052 text/html 825HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Enterprise/2.0aDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:49:01 GMTAccept-ranges: bytesLast-modified: Tue, 01 Oct 1996 21:37:32 GMTContent-length: 621Content-type: text/html  AFPI Making Headlines  AFPI Making Headlines The Chattanooga Times: Conservative Attacks School Plan (31k) The Chattanooga Free Press, Church News: Howse Slams Door on PEF (80k) The Chattanooga Free Press, Front Page: Schools Hear Critique Tonight (68k) The Chattanooga Free Press, Front Page: Howse Blasts PEF, Goals 2000 (60k)WT02-B08-363IA062-000353-B003-133http://www.familypolicy.com:80/president.html 206.107.214.109 19970115204132 text/html 2743HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Enterprise/2.0aDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:49:34 GMTAccept-ranges: bytesLast-modified: Wed, 02 Oct 1996 19:42:28 GMTContent-length: 2538Content-type: text/html  American Family Policy Institute  AFPI President Brannon Howse About AFPI President Brannon Howse As president of the American Family Policy Institute, Brannon Howse spends a considerable amount of his time each year reading legislation and writing issue briefs in an effort to inform the American people about policies that affect the family, either positively or negatively. Some of his extensive research and knowledge on family and educational issues has been compiled in his first books, Cradle to College: An Educational Abduction and Reclaiming a Nation at Risk . Brannon hosts his own national radio show, "The American Family Policy Update," which is now heard on many stations each weekend as well as hosting "Crosstalk", a live call-in program heard on 30 stations. Brannon has been a featured speaker at Dr. D. James Kennedy's "Reclaiming America Conference," along with such notables as Alan Keyes, Cal Thomas, and Dr. Kennedy. He has also addressed the ACSI conference, which is the world's largest private school association, and spoken at numerous colleges and universities. Due to his expertise in family issues, Brannon has been a guest on hundreds of radio and television programs, including "Truths That Transform" with Dr. D. James Kennedy, "The G. Gordon Liddy Show," "The Michael Reagan Show," The Ken Hamblin Show," "Action Sixties," "Point of View," "Family News and Focus," and "The Phyllis Schlafly Show," to name but a few.

Peddle, Ph.D. Director of Research This is the first installment of the semi-annual newsletter of the Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT). In recent months the CRCT has been involved in reorganizing the activities of the various Henry George groups in Canada. The primary objective of the reorganization has been to coordinate research and administrative activities in our Ottawa office. For some time now I have been the Director of Research for the CRCT, albeit on a part-timebasis. I hope to continue in that capacity. At the same time I am a lawyer in private practice inOntario as well as a part- time lecturer in philosophy. Exploring the relationships between thedisciplines of philosophy, economics and law has been a long-time passion of mine. From my current vantage point here in Ottawa, I find myself ideally situated to pursue these interests as never before. Itwill also be necessary to reach out to many diverse groups - governmental, academic, commercial, environmental - to name only a few, if the thought of Henry George is to be expected to have anydegree of resurgence as a guiding light for the systems of public finance in our country. Our intuitiveand reflective sense of the justness of the principles espoused by Henry George must be tempered byan acceptance of, but not a submission to, the fact that our less than civil society has managed to hornswoggle its members into the belief that George's work is an archaic, simple-minded homily to economic salvation more befitting an agrarian epoch than the sophisticated, knowledge-driven global community of the late twentieth century. The CRCT has contracted the services of a part-time administrator in a renewed attempt to maintain contacts with our dispersed membership. We also think it is desirable to develop contacts with other research organizations. Our administrator's name is Cheryl Murray. She maintains hours from 10:00am to 4:30pm on weekdays and can be reached at (613) 232-1740. The CRCT mailing list has been updated. As the recipient of this package of materials you are currently on the mailing list. If you do not wish to receive this newsletter or any other information from the CRCT, please notify us. If you do wish to continue receiving the newsletter and support the objectives and work of the CRCT, then fill out the enclosed membership form on our brochure and remit $20.00 for the 1996 annual membership fee. All contributions are greatly appreciated, but cannot be receipted for income tax purposes as we are not a registered charity. However, contributions to the Ontario School of Economic Science are deductible and will be receipted by that organization. THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community of that value which is the creation of the community. It is the application of the common property to common uses. HENRY GEORGE in Progress and Poverty Comments and suggestions about what you would like to see in this newsletter would be greatly appreciated. If you are an active Georgist, or even thinking about becoming one, let us know about you are doing or intending to do. CURRENT ACTIVITIES The CRCT has recently published two books CITIES AND GREED: Taxes, Inflation and Land Speculation and HENRY GEORGE AND THE END OF TAX COMMISSIONS: An Evaluation of the Ontario Fair Tax Commission. Brochures and attached order forms are enclosed for both publications. Organizations in Canada which promulgate the philosophy of Henry George have gone into serious decline in recent decades. Schools of Economic Science, which conducted classes on George in such cities as Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver have long since ceased operations. The Oscar Boelens Foundation (OBF) in Montreal and the Henry George Foundation of Canada (HGFC) in Toronto currently support the work of the CRCT in Ottawa. Please see the chart at the back of this newsletter. Total endowment funds are limited, but sufficient to underwrite research on a part-time basis. They also relieve the CRCT of the ongoing effort necessary to raise funds continually for operating expenses. The Peterborough Two Tier Property Tax Committee, chaired by Mal McCarthy, was quite active until Mal passed away in 1994. Its trust funds were distributed to the CRCT and to John Fisher's Two Tier Property Tax Committee in Rodney, Ontario. Ben Sevack, Harry Payne and Leo Klag are still active in Montreal. They serve on the Boards of the CRCT and the OBF. Jean Smith in Toronto is an active Georgist who has generously supported CRCT activities. She recently provided the funds to set up a world wide web site on the Internet here in Ottawa that will make available to everyone our tax research materials. Jack Bea and Helen Nesbitt in Toronto are still associated with the HGFC and the Toronto School. John Fisher is quite active in southwestern Ontario. His two tier committee conducts ongoing tax impact studies with respect to lowering the mill rate on buildings and increasing it on land values. John's work is especially important with respect to the treatment of farmland under a property tax regime that incorporates land value taxation as its primary fiscal objective. Some of you may recall a letter sent out by John in August, 1995. Several Georgists replied and followed up with a description of their activities. In western Canada, Gaye and Gerry Shaw, still run the Henry George School of Economic Science in Calgary. Wilbur Freeland is also operating the Georgist Registry. Mary Rawson is a well known and active Georgist in Vancouver and has served on the governing board of the B.C. Assessment Authority for the past number of years. There are, however, many other people besides the few mentioned herein, who are strong supporters of the philosophy of Henry George. If you know of anyone who would wish to receive information on our activities please notify the Ottawa office and we will add them to our mailing list. Our numbers are limited and widely scattered. Nevertheless, it has been my experience that once someone becomes cognizant of the justness of George's economic reforms it becomes a permanent vision and abiding source of enthusiasm for changing our shaky systems of public finance. A person who can articulate the advantages of land value taxation is invaluable when others haphazardly come upon the proper methods of raising public revenues. WORLD WIDE WEB SITE ON THE INTERNET As of March 15, 1996, the CRCT has a world wide web site on the Internet. Our address is http://www.crctaxation.org. E-mail can be sent to raynon@fox.nstn.ca. The information on the web site home page for the CRCT is contained in a separate insert in this package. Henry George's likeness is the first thing you will see when the home page is accessed. The web site will be continually updated with research data, papers and general information on Georgist activities in Canada. If you have any research materials or papers which you think are suitable for the web site, please contact me. Our home page is not static and will undergo continuous development. This newsletter itself is available on the Internet. SIXTEENTH ANNUAL CGO CONFERENCE - OTTAWA The Council of Georgist Organizations (CGO) will hold its sixteenth annual conference in Ottawa from October 11-13, 1996. Official programs and registration forms will be mailed out in June, 1996. If you wish to receive the conference program please contact our Ottawa office. Many of our fellow Georgists will be attending this conference from the U.S. and elsewhere. We are hoping for a significant showing by Canadians. Perhaps this conference will be the catalyst for renewed interest in Georgist-inspired tax reforms in Canada. RECENT TAX REFORM INITIATIVES The recapture of economic rents for the public treasury within the context of current revenue generation and tax legislation is normally oblique, unconscious and fortuitous. Tax researchers often contentedly misread the significance of their findings. Proposed solutions, not infrequently, aggravate the distortionary effects of the tax system on the economy and add another epicycle to arcane Ptolemaic universe of public finance otherwise known as the Income Tax Act and various Assessment Acts in the provinces. In January, 1996 the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) Task Force (the "Golden Task Force") produced a 269 page report that contained a substantial section on reforming the property tax (73-110). The Report itself is very attractively presented with panoramic graphics, charts and tables as well as a CD-ROM attached to the back cover which contains the background research papers listed in the appendices. This document provides us a tantalizing, and at times very insightful, discussion of the acute problems confronting the GTA. Unlike many previous reports it seeks to transcend narrow specialization's in urban planning, property taxation, assessment and the intricacies of municipal finance and politics. The Report, however, does not shed entirely the baggage of many similar reports which tackle the seemingly insurmountable problem of reforming the property tax system in Metro Toronto and its environs. It comes close to stumbling into some genuine adjustments to archaic and often misguided assessment practices. Unfortunately, the same "tax techies" who brought us the non-starters in the Report of the Ontario Fair Tax Commission, and who beguile and befog municipal politicians on a regular and well-rewarded basis, had a hand in the Golden Report. Hence, the status quo well be more or less maintained without undue interference from common sense and basic economics. The two immediate and pressing problems identified in the Report that make property tax reform imperative, especially in the GTA, are assessment appeals and inequities in property taxes paid by businesses (74). It must not be forgotten that task forces, commissions, inquiries and the like frequently immolate themselves before they get beyond their executive summaries by creating a narrow and fragmented mandate or by having it engineered for them by political masters who have no mental image of the edifice they wish to erect. The Report correctly tells us that the differences in effective property tax rates in the GTA are primarily jurisdictional and artificial. The Report also notes that the tax rates on industrial property in the City of Toronto are relatively low (77). Those passingly acquainted with urban land use issues will recognize that this fiscal subsidy, or more properly, subversion of municipal public finance by means of non-legislative assessment fiat, has thwarted efficient land development in conjunction with the zoning restrictions attaching to these often vacant and underutilized sites. To call them industrial is a misnomer. They are the epitome of the dysfunctional, the atrophied, the unindustrious. Assessment lag, states the Report, is the main problem in the GTA. This has led to inequities within classes of property, between classes of property and between municipalities. The Report proposes policy changes which will stabilize the assessment base and reduce property tax inequities. The three areas targeted for reform are the assessment base, mill rates and non-residential education property taxes (83). I will focus here on the assessment base, although from the standpoint of land value taxation there ought to be a differential rate on buildings and land as well as a modernization of the assessment base. The Report considered unit-based and value-based assessment alternatives. The former is based primarily on the size of the property, the latter on an estimate of the value of the property. Unit Assessment (UA) in its pure form is unacceptable because it completely excludes location. Unit Value Assessment (UVA) adjusts assessment valuations by factors that reflect market value, such as rental data and location. Interestingly, when the Task Force studied the tax impacts of the UA and UVA options with land/floor weightings of 70/30, 50/50 and 0/100, the least regressive UA scenario was the one where land was given a weighting of 70% and the building/floor area was 30% (89-90). The worst scenario was where all the weight was placed on the floor area (90). The researchers in the Ministry of Finance conveniently avoided doing a land only weighting, although inconsistently they did a floor area only weighting. Research is in the eye of the beholder, or should we say, she who chooses the option. Actual Value Assessment (AVA) is a hybrid of Market Value Assessment (MVA), what the current system aspires to be, and UVA. The Report wisely proposes to assess land and buildings separately in order to minimize the speculative component in "building values" (87). It would be more accurate to say in the "land values" because there is normally no speculative component in buildings per se. Current MVA practice commingles the two values and thus the ratepayer, and hence many grassroots property tax reform proposals, are confused and confusing. The Report recognizes the unique characteristics attaching to land values, their appreciation and what happens when tax liability is placed thereon. It is therefore recommended that land should be assessed in its highest and best use while buildings be assessed on the income stream generated in their current use. This proposal is infinitely more sound economically than what was stated in the Report of the Ontario Fair Tax Commission. Most Georgists know well enough that the more land is taxed, or the economic rent thereon given back to the community, the less speculation there will be in this limited resource. The Report states that leaving land completely untaxed, as is sometimes proposed by ratepayer associations that have completely gone off the rails, would undermine "urban form policy objectives"(93). It is also noted that Rental Value Assessment (RVA), which measures the value of a property only in its current use, underassesses owners who hold vacant land or who underutilize their properties, while penalizing owners who develop their land and maximize its income-generating capacity (95). Again this is a sound proposal that has been reiterated for generations by Georgists, but who are still elated when it is held forth as an important aper�u in an otherwise unsympathetic and non-systematic tractatus on tax policy. Finally, the Report proposes that AVA be updated every year and that there be an averaging of land values over a three year period, so as to smooth out volatility in the land component of the assessment base. Once again we have another tax report that has walked into a few good, albeit disconnected, proposals. Without conceptual consistency and sound first principles no logical and meaningful conclusions can be reached. The assessment reforms recommended by the Golden Report need to be complemented by an overall change in tax policy. Lower the mill rate on buildings and raise it on the land value component. At the same time, bring assessments into the post-Renaissance era and assess land and capital improvements separately, using up-to-date GIS technology. Tax policy and assessment must work together to achieve common goals. Recent comment on the property tax system loses sight of this in its zeal to keep the two separate. What are these common goals? Non-fiscal methods of land use regulation have historically shown their limitations. It is being increasingly realized that the very design of the property tax plays a, and can play a more, significant role in lowering municipal costs, creating more efficient land use, reducing inequities in property taxation while providing more incentives for economic growth. 1996 FEDERAL BUDGET On March 6, 1996 the Minister of Finance, Paul Martin, brought down his third budget for the current Liberal government. As was widely expected this budget did not contain anything like the cuts in government expenditures that were characteristic of last year's budget - the major number of which are due to take effect beginning April 1st of the new fiscal year. The most dramatic proposed tax change is the elimination of the deduction/inclusion system for child support as of May 1, 1997. This proposal illustrates well the historical problem that the most difficult changes with respect to tax reform are in relation to redesigning the tax base. The deduction/inclusion system for child and spousal support has been around for over fifty years. It provides an annual tax subsidy to divorced couples of an estimated $300 million. The rationale is that the children of families that have broken up have a greater need because of the inevitably reduced circumstances that follows marital breakdown. The reason for this is that the support payer, who is usually the father or former husband, is generally in a higher tax bracket than the support recipient who is usually the mother or former wife. The tax system therefore provides a subsidy for separated and divorced families that is not available to those whose families remain in tact. Many groups successfully persuaded the government that the present system is unfair because it places a heavy tax burden on single mothers, many of whom are now lower middle income age earners. It could also be argued that if you think the tax system should not be used for purposes of social engineering, then the deduction/inclusion system should be abolished. Also some people may find it offensive that the system discriminates between married and divorced couples, and provides a subsidy to the latter. Unfortunately, getting rid of the system will create its own inequities. A widowed mother making $40,000 a year will have the full amount included in income for tax purposes, while a single mother receiving child support of $10,000 and earning $30,000 will only have the $30,000 included in income. This is not an issue that can be resolved by a proportional income tax since it is fundamentally a matter of what should be included in the tax base, although proportionality would obviously reduce the subsidy inherent in the current system. Of course, a public finance system that relied considerably less on the taxation of labour income for revenue would reduce the significance of debates such as those revolving around the taxation of child support, which are irresolvable because different parties to the debate use different criteria for judging the acceptability of the tax measure. CASE COMMENT The Supreme Court of Canada recently released a decision that is of interest to Georgists. In Friesen v. The Queen, [1995] 2 C.T.C. 369 the taxpayer was narrowly successful in convincing the high Court that land bought for the purpose of resale can be categorized as "inventory" in an adventure in the nature of trade and therefore can be written down at the lower of cost or fair market value pursuant to subsection 10(1) of the Income Tax Act. The government has proposed legislation to no longer make this possible after December 20, 1995. Presumably, the decision will be binding for re-assessments for prior taxation years if they are not statute-barred. In a three to two majority, the Court ruled that as illogical as it may be, the conservative principle of accountancy must prevail and that the matching principle need not be strictly adhered to. In other words, land can be written down as inventory, like other stock-in-trade, as a business loss or deduction, if its fair market value falls below cost. The asymmetry in this ruling is that the Income Tax Act does not tax unrealized profits, but it can recognize unrealized losses. Georgists will be appalled at this decision. First of all, land is not like ordinary stock-in-trade. The ruling is frightening testimony to how a thoroughly illogical conclusion can be arrived at using the plain meaning principle of statutory interpretation. Obliquely, the decision is judicial recognition of what has been a deceptive trend for some time - the commodification of natural resources. This is the leveling out of the unique qualities of nature. It is a transformation of the already created and pregiven into the re-creatable and finite commodities of human production. This is a dangerous and very distortionary doctrine in neo-classical economics. If land is inventory to be valued at the lower of cost or fair market value, then the imputed fair market value of land should be brought into the taxable income of the owner on an annual basis. If this were the case, then economic rents would be more comprehensively captured by the Income Tax Act. The government, however, has merely proposed a legislative change which states that the rules which apply to the valuation of inventory do not apply to "property" held as an adventure in the nature of trade. This is mere slashing at leaves. Essentially, it means that speculatively held land will only have a recognition of profit or loss for tax purposes on disposition. Preventing the taxation of inert property will be one of the inevitable consequences of this recent judicial and legislative activity.

It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community of that value which is the creation of the community. It is the application of the common property to common uses." HENRY GEORGE in "Progress and Poverty" Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of societies and brought to a halt social progress. By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and the maintenance of a social safety net. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT) does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.

There is, for example, a general and justifiable belief in the tax community that we must overhaul or do away with the antiquated federal manufacturers sales tax. In doing so we are following, it is thought, the sensible and prudent tax policies of most other industrial countries by implementing a multi-stage or value-added sales tax. Unfortunately, there is little understanding in Canada of what such value-added consumption taxes have done to the economies of other countries. The Department of Finance appears to be simply of the view that since most other industrial countries have this type of tax it must be good. However, the basic issue is not raised of whether or not it is sound policy to double tax individuals when earnings are received, through personal income taxes, and when after-tax disposable income is spent, through broadly-based consumption taxes. Many economists today make the argument that it is the income tax system which creates double taxation because it taxes both earnings and the income from savings or after-tax income. This is a rather strange view of what makes income from savings possible, but it is the source of much of the academic reasoning behind the general policy move towards higher consumption taxes. These economists have a negative orientation towards consumption, which leads them to the position that we should only be taxed on the basis of what we take out of the economy - hence the personal expenditure tax as a panacea for tax reform. Even less is it noted that historically governments often tend towards a greater reliance on consumption-type taxes in times of fiscal crisis. At any rate the so called penalty in the income tax system with respect to savings and double taxation would be virtually removed if income were taxed proportionally and not progressively. Furthermore, while it appears that few get exercised about the double and sometimes triple taxation of individual taxpayers per se, and the multiple taxation of business enterprises, "tax cascading" to borrow a phrase from the economics profession, we devise highly complex systems, such as the integration of the corporate and personal income tax systems, by means of such provisions as the "dividend tax credit", in order to avoid double taxation in other areas. Similarly, our tax system is thought to be based on the vaguely defined principle of "ability to pay", and yet there is much truth to the popular perception that the ministrations of tax professionals will undoubtedly lessen one's annual contribution to the public coffers. Ability to pay is thus very much conditioned by knowledge of the tax system and this knowledge is obviously not of equal distribution. All levels of government generally focus their tax policies on taxable events engaged in by individuals. That is, when people do something it becomes taxable. We can call this in personam taxation because tax becomes payable or exigible when a person does something. For example, if you improve your house to a sufficient degree, it is re-assessed and your property tax increases. If you work over-time, you may find yourself in a higher tax bracket, and thus will have progressively less income, even though you have worked harder. If you run a small business, and lessen unemployment by hiring someone, your payroll tax will increase. And if you help local businesses by purchasing various consumer items, you pay more to the provincial and federal retail and sales tax systems. Keeping in mind that taxes normally tend to diminish the base upon which they are levied, it can be clearly seen that in personam taxes impinge negatively on worthwhile social and economic activities. It is good for your family and the community to improve your house, to work harder and be more productive, to hire, and to buy and sell the products created by labour and capital investment. At all levels of government we tax in ways that are injurious to the economic and social fabric of the country. Municipalities levy taxes on total property values, which in theory are suppose to reflect our ability to pay property taxes. The end result, however, is runaway inflation in land prices, excessive housing costs, inefficient use of land resources in our urban economies, the high cost of municipal services associated with urban sprawl, and the widespread dissatisfaction of ratepayers with the methods of property assessment and evaluation conducted under the rubric of what is benignly, but deceptively, known as "market value assessment". Likewise, we tax business profits in the belief that profits are an accurate reflection of a corporation's ability to pay. The result is the widespread and inefficient inflation and accounting manipulation of business costs. There has been a predictable and significant decline in business profits as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past several decades. We have been left with a corporate tax system that has very high compliance costs. This system yields disappointingly little revenue to the government, and it violates its own principle by allowing many profitable companies to avoid paying taxes altogether. Yet it would be futile to increase substantially the marginal rate on corporate profits given the evanescent quality of profits in general and the necessity of maintaining our international competitiveness, since we are a capital-importing country. In frustration the government is relying more and more on a "capital" tax to be levied on corporate capital employed in Canada in excess of $10 million. This is obviously a tax that has little to do with the ability-to-pay approach, and even less with any recognizable economic principle. Why then do governments tax, or in effect punish individuals and businesses, for doing the very things that everyone would like to see encouraged? Are in personam taxes the only way governments can raise revenues? Must all taxes negate healthy economic activity and encourage deceit and subterfuge, albeit often finely nuanced and professionally articulated? Must all taxes promote those activities which are inimical to the advancement of communal well-being and to sound business investment and practices? Is it necessary to implement pervasive taxes on goods and services which will be inflationary and thereby fuel even further high interest rates and thus hasten the geometrical enlargement of the public debt? The philosophical, economic and common sense answer to these questions is a decisive no. But to design a system of public finance based on sound principles that promote de-inflation, productivity, economic efficiency, job-creation, lower interest rates and a more fair and even distribution of wealth in our society will involve a fundamental critical analysis about what are the proper "objects" of taxation. My feeling is that we are not yet quite ready for such a global re-appraisal of our thinking. However, the loss of fiscal control and leverage over the economy by governments will, in the foreseeable future, result in sufficient socio-economic instability to force a transformation in thinking. Nevertheless, the parameters of the coming changes are broadly discernible. Tax reform has been a feature of Canada's economic landscape for most of its fiscal history. The emphasis on technical and administrative adjustments in the Wilson White Paper of June, 1987, such as rate changes and certain base broadening measures, should not blind us to the fact that the tax reform debate has been traditionally interwoven with more expansive views of the role of government in our society and with the sociopolitical realities of a decentralized federal state such as Canada. The ability-to-pay principle, erroneously declared by the Carter Commission in the 1960's to be the only theoretically defensible principle of taxation, gives governments extremely wide discretion to identify just about whatever they want as a suitable tax base. In England in the 18th century one was taxed on the basis of the number of windows and hearths in the home because it was believed these things reflected ability to pay. Predictably, people began bricking up windows and hearths. Likewise in Ontario, today, if more than $5,000 in improvements are added to a home your property taxes will increase, despite the fact that you may have made such improvements in order to allow your disabled son or daughter to reside at home rather than in an institution. The ability-to-pay principle will always be the inevitable assumption underlying systems of taxation premised on an interventionist view of the state. It is also a principle that readily adheres to democratic governments for it allows politicians to make arbitrary and expedient dispensations to lobby groups and voters, by means of tax expenditures and other provisions, without having to take the responsibility for direct budgetary expenditures. The people are therefore continually bribed with the usufruct of their own labour and fiscal policy becomes subject to the vicissitudes of electoral politics. The Auditor-General himself has said that "the lack of control in the use of tax expenditures may well represent one of the most serious voids in the parliamentary control over the public purse in Canadian history". The irony is that ultimately the ability-to-pay principle, unrelated to the benefits principle of taxation, leads to the erosion of democracy and representative government. Ability to pay cannot, however, be ignored in the design of any tax system. It would be quite unconscionable and immoral to tax the poor more than the rich, even though in many respects this does happen today. In genuine tax reform, ability to pay ought to guide us to equitable, non-arbitrary, and economically sound "objects" of taxation. This means that we must start thinking more in terms of in rem, rather than of in personam, types of taxation if we are to achieve real and equitable reform of the tax system. What does in rem taxation mean? Fundamentally, it signifies a drawing back from the taxation of individuals and labour income per se to tax systems which recapture for the public treasury community-created values that are not the result of the individual processes of labour but value increments which result from the benefits and privileges that are conferred by the community at large. What are the primary things that benefit from the provision of government services and from the material progress of society in general? Certainly, the locational values of real estate benefit tremendously from the provision of tax-funded services and from the growth of the community. Since these values are created by the community and not the individual, does it not make sense that the community should tax back some of this value, irrespective of the use to which a site is put, in order to provide for these services. There is also considerable empirical evidence to show that the taxation of site values, rather than improvement values, which are created by individuals, can go a long way towards reducing the cost of housing, while at the same time providing a stable and equitable form of revenue for municipal governments. In tax jurisdictions where site value taxation has been implemented most homeowners who live and work in the community receive a reduction in property taxes. Corporations and businesses benefit from the provision of government services and therefore should pay taxes to provide for these benefits. The taxation of corporate and business profits, however, is a form of in personam taxation since profits rightfully belong to investors, or the individuals who provide capital to create and run businesses, and not to the companies themselves. In rem taxation of companies would be on that income which they expend in the creation of wealth or value. The more income expended on creating value the greater the ability to pay of the corporation since it is adding more and more to the general fund of wealth. This ability to pay is also a reflection of benefits received from the government. It is the price which must be built into the costing analysis of the process of creating goods and services. That businesses are able to produce such wealth depends on the provision of governmental benefits and sometimes special privileges. It is the current obfuscation of what is properly meant by corporate or business income that has led to the present inability of governments to tax businesses in a way that will enhance productivity and efficiency, while at the same time providing a stable and unavoidable revenue base. Then there is the difficult question of whether individuals should be taxed at all. Some economists and political philosophers have argued that the total recapture of the economic rent of the country by the government would be sufficient to cover all public expenditures. Under the present tax system we do little to recapture economic rent or the community-created value of all natural, primarily land, resources in the country. The untaxing of labour and capital, and the uptaxing of land resources would be a fundamental inversion of current tax thinking, which is focused primarily on the taxation of labour. This is an issue that will have to be confronted at some point, but I suspect we will continue to tax primarily individuals in the foreseeable future. An argument can be made that because individuals in modern society receive the benefit of the provision of a large number of services from the government they ought to pay on a pro rata basis for the cost of these services. It would be more equitable, then, to tax individuals proportionally on their income. A low, proportional rate on all individual earnings above the poverty line would greatly simplify the tax system while at the same time yielding a reliable source of revenue to the public treasury. Indeed, it has been empirically shown that a proportional rate results in more revenue received from higher income groups than under a progressive system primarily because of the elimination of most tax expenditures, exemptions, deductions, and a reduction in the incentive to avoid taxation. It is therefore more "progressive" to institute a proportional income tax rather than continue with the regressivity in the current nominally progressive system. Nevertheless, it is imperative that a shift towards a low proportional tax on individual income, and the eventual elimination of counterproductive consumption taxes, be accompanied by a widespread movement towards the taxation of site values and businesses as recommended above. How is all of this possible in a regionalized federal state like Canada? How can thousands of municipalities be persuaded to tax site, rather than in personam improvement, values? How can the provinces and the federal government coordinate the taxation of business enterprises on the in rem basis of income expended in the creation of wealth rather than relying heavily on counterproductive sales taxes?. The answer has to lie in making explicit an overarching philosophy of taxation, the implementation of which would ease the tax burden on most individuals and thereby free up their labour income and capital for economic activity that will benefit themselves and the community as a whole. Everyone will then see that it is in their interest to adopt sound principles of taxation which promote equity and healthy economic progress. The tax reform process will not be completed with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, as the Department of Finance would have us believe, but has yet to begin in earnest.
