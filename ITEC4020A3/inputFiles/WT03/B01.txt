Yamaha Motor Corp.U.S.A. et al. v. Calhoun et al., No. 94-1387 (U.S.); see ConsumerProduct Litigation Reporter, September 1995.     In an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, thehigh court agreed that the cause of action established in Moragnev. States Marine Lines (U.S. 1970) does not displace stateremedies in maritime wrongful death actions where no applicablefederal statute controls and the decedent was not a seaman orotherwise engaged in the maritime trade.     Twelve-year-old Natalie Calhoun was killed in a 1989accident while piloting a "Wavejammer" jetski manufactured by thepetitioner Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A.  Natalie had rented theproduct while vacationing in Puerto Rico, and died when thevehicle struck a vessel anchored off her hotel's frontage.     Her parents brought suit in the U.S. District Court for theEastern District of Pennsylvania the following year, basing theirclaims in Pennsylvania's wrongful death and survival statutes anddemanding damages including lost future earnings, loss ofsociety, loss of support and services and punitive damages.Yamaha sought partial summary judgment, arguing that Moragnedisplaced state frameworks for awarding maritime wrongful deathdamages.     The trial court agreed, but held that the Calhouns couldstill viably make demand for loss of society and loss of supportand services.  The parties cross-appealed; the Third Circuitruled on Nov. 2 that Moragne would not preempt state wrongfuldeath statutes on claims over non-seamen within territorialwaters.  The high court agreed to review the decision inMay 1995.     In its affirmance, the Supreme Court stated that"[t]raditionally, state remedies have been applied in accidentcases of this order " maritime wrongful death cases in which nofederal statute specifies the appropriate relief and the decedentwas not a seaman, longshore worker, or person otherwise engagedin a maritime trade.  We hold, in accord with the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that state remediesremain applicable in such cases and have not been displaced bythe federal maritime wrongful death action recognized inMoragne."     As a preliminary matter, the high court held that thefederal appellate courts have jurisdiction in an interlocutoryappeal "over any question that is included within the order thatcontains the controlling question of law identified by thedistrict court."  Justice Ginsburg found the text of 28 U.S.C.Section 1292(b) to indicate that "appellate jurisdiction appliesto the order certified to the court of appeals, and is not tiedto the particular question formulated by the district court."     In turning to the substantive issue, the Supreme Court foundthat "[t]he exercise of admiralty [jurisdiction] 'does not resultin automatic displacement of state law'....  Indeed, prior toMoragne, federal admiralty courts routinely applied statewrongful death and survival statutes in maritime accident cases."     The court engaged in a review of wrongful death claims undermaritime law that reached back to its 1886 decision in TheHarrisburg.  The court had then concluded that general maritimelaw did not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death;subsequently, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "[f]ederal admiralty courtstempered the harshness of The Harrisburg's rule by allowingrecovery under state wrongful death statutes."     With the publication of Moragne in 1970, the high courtoverruled The Harrisburg and concluded that an action "lie[s]under general maritime law for death caused by violation ofmaritime duties."     Here, the high court found Yamaha's contention that Moragneencompasses all deaths in state territorial waters to be "notwithout force; in several contexts, we have recognized thatvindication of maritime policies demanded uniform adherence to afederal rule of decision, with no leeway for variation orsupplementation by state law."     Ultimately, the high court wrote, the concerns foruniformity that prompted the scuttling of The Harrisburg "were ofa different order than those invoked by Yamaha.  Moragne did notreexamine the soundness of The Harrisburg out of concern thatstate damage awards in maritime wrongful death cases wereexcessive, or that variations in the remedies afforded by theStates threatened to interfere with the harmonious operation ofmaritime law."               The inconsistencies in maritime law that prompted theMoragne court, Justice Ginsburg concluded, "relate to ships andthe workers who serve them, and to a distinctly maritimesubstantive concept " the unseaworthiness doctrine."  The courtconcluded that Moragne "centered on the extension of relief, noton the contraction of remedies.  The decision recalled that 'itbetter becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings inadmiralty to give than to withhold the remedy, when not requiredto withhold it by established and inflexible rules.'"     The opinion lastly cited at length to the reasoning below ofthe Third Circuit, which had noted that "Congress has notprescribed remedies for the wrongful deaths of nonseafarers interritorial waters."

Wilson et al. v. Pleasant et al., No. 64S03-9506-CV-693 (IN Sup. Ct.).     The lawsuit was lodged by the estate of James Wilson, whodied in a 1988 head-on collision while driving a 1986 Chevrolet.Wilson had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of theaccident.  The suit, which named the driver of the other vehicleas well as GM, alleged that the manufacturer was negligent indesigning, manufacturing and selling a car that wasn'tcrashworthy due to the lack of an airbag passive restraintsystem.     GM sought summary judgment from the Porter County SuperiorCourt, arguing that the estate's common law claims were federallypreempted by the Safety Act and certain safety regulationspromulgated thereunder.  The trial court granted the motion; theIndiana Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed, declaring thatwhile the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the negligenceclaim, implied preemption could be found.               In its review, the state high court preliminarily noted thelanguage of the Safety Act's preemption clause (Section 1392[d])and state common law savings clause (Section 1397[k]); the panelalso observed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, whichgave the manufacturer three options for providing passenger crashprotection.  The court acknowledged that the manual seat beltsystem in Wilson's car fully complied with the third option.     The court agreed with the Court of Appeals' assessment thatthe Safety Act did not expressly preempt the estate's claim."The pre-emption clause found in the Safety Act explicitlyrefers, with respect to 'any motor vehicle or item of motorvehicle equipment,' only to state 'safety standard[s] applicableto the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item ofequipment which is not identical to the federal standard,'" thepanel wrote.     As to the finding of implied preemption, however, the courtobserved that the "clear weight of authority prior to 1992supported General Motors's view that the Safety Act impliedlypre-empts state common law claims like the one asserted byWilson."  The panel then engaged in a review of the alterationsto the federal preemption analysis wrought by the U.S. SupremeCourt's rulings in Cipollone v. Liggett Group (1992) andFreightliner Corp. v. Myrick (1995).     "[W]e cannot help observing that Myrick did not overruleCipollone," the court concluded.  "Rather, the Supreme Court heldthat interpretations of Cipollone to the effect that impliedpre-emption cannot exist when Congress has chosen to include anexpress pre-emption clause were incorrect interpretations."     The court read Cipollone/Myrick to establish the followinganalysis in order to establish implied preemption:  "First, ifthe federal statute at issue contains pre-emption language, wedetermine whether that provision alone provides a reliableindication of congressional intent with respect to itspre-emptive effect," the panel wrote.  Such determination wouldbe made, the court stated, "by employing canons of statutoryconstruction and by examining the other provisions of the statute" and the statute as a whole " to see if they offer any cause tolook beyond the express pre-emption language."     If a reliable indication of congressional intent is found,the panel wrote, there is no need to look beyond the preemptionlanguage itself.  Otherwise, the court continued, "we mustdetermine whether the state law in question is in actual conflictwith federal law, [i.e.,] (1) whether it is impossible for aprivate party to comply with both state and federal requirements,or (2) whether the state law stands as an obstacle to theaccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectivesof Congress."     In turning to the facts at hand, the court found it"immediately obvious that the Section 1392(d) pre-emption clausein the Safety Act, taken alone, does not provide a reliableindication of congressional intent with respect to itspre-emptive effect."  The panel also found that the language ofthe Section 1397(k) savings clause indicated that the SafetyAct's preemptive scope is not governed entirely by the Act'spreemption language.     The court concluded, however, that the language of Section1392(d) and Section 1397(k) read together foreclosed anapplication of an implied preemption analysis.  "[W]e see only aprohibition on state motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipmentsafety standards not identical to federal safety standardsapplicable to the same aspect of performance of the motor vehicleor item of motor vehicle equipment," the court wrote.     Although the panel determined a full implied preemptionanalysis to be unnecessary, it engaged in such a review and stillfound no preemption of the claims.  "[W]e conclude that there isno conflict between state common law in this case and the choicespresented by Rule 208," the panel wrote.  "Assuming, arguendo,that Indiana common law requires airbags, there would be noconflict with Rule 208 because Rule 208 does not prohibit airbags" it only permits some other alternatives."     The court also found that a finding of implied preemptionhere "would be inconsistent with the purpose of and policiesunderlying the Safety Act....  It would defeat the purpose of thestatute if manufacturers were not discouraged from utilizing asafety system that would otherwise be considered negligent understate common law tort theories."

Honda Research & Development Co., Ltd. et al. (ED MI).     The jury also found that the Honda defendants were notnegligent with respect to the design and marketing of the ATV orthe warnings that accompanied the vehicle.     The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail nearJensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearinga helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve andsuffered a severe closed head injury.     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult toturn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequatelywarn about the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda counteredthat Carwile's accident was caused by excessive speed,inattention and inadequate vehicle maintenance.     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer DavidRenfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; GaryLustgarden, M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocationalrehabilitation expert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; andeconomist Michael Thompson.

Norman, who claimed that a defective throttlecable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.Norman v. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56(AL Cir. Ct., Lauderdale Cty.).     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore CycleCenter.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned thehandlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at whichpoint the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over anembankment.     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting atree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  Hesustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, andtore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedicsurgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate hiscondition.     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles ofuse.  Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX,tested exemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda,Kawasaki and Yamaha to determine how much force was needed tocause a separation.  All of the other brands not only out-performed the Suzuki cable, but were more substantial inappearance, he opined.     The defendants argued that the accident was caused byoperator error and Norman's failure to take the offered freesafety course.  Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI,tested the exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involvedin the accident and found no possibility of malfunction asclaimed by the plaintiff.

REJECTSCROSS-PETITIONS FOR REVIEWOF RISK-UTILITY RULING     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 8 denied the separate bids ofHonda Motor Co. and a Mississippi plaintiff to overturn the FifthCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals' May 1995 determinations in amotorcycle product liability action.  Honda Motor Co. et al. v.Satcher, No. 95-653 (U.S.); Satcher v. Honda Motor Co. et al.,No. 95-674 (U.S.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter,November 1995.     The manufacturer had asserted that the appellate panel hadinfringed its due process rights in refusing a new trial, andJames Satcher had averred that the Fifth Circuit had no basis onwhich to vacate his $2 million award for punitive damages.     Satcher, who had been driving the defendant's Nighthawkmotorcycle in the 1985 traffic accident that cost him his leg,obtained $1 million in compensatory damages following a 1991 jurytrial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District ofMississippi.  In its initial review of the case in 1993, theFifth Circuit reversed.  The panel concluded that as a matter ofstate law, the product's claimed defect (lack of leg guards) wasopen and obvious to the ordinary consumer.     Following the Mississippi Supreme Court's issuance ofSperry-New Holland v. Prestage (1993) shortly thereafter, theFifth Circuit vacated its prior ruling and ordered the districtcourt to reconsider in light of Prestage (which held that therisk-utility analysis superseded the consumer expectations testin product liability actions) and the state's recently enactedproduct liability statute.  The trial court found for Satcher onremand.     In its affirmance of last May 30, the Fifth Circuit rejectedHonda's contentions that it was entitled to a new trial asPrestage caused a substantive alteration to Mississippi law.  Thepanel did strike Satcher's punitive award, concluding that thedefendant's conduct in not including leg guards in its productdesign was not so extreme or outrageous as to support it.     Both litigants filed petitions for writ of certiorari in thehigh court late last October.  Honda contended that it wasentitled to new trial in order to defend on a risk-utilitytheory, rather than under the consumer expectations test.Satcher argued that under the Fifth Circuit's punitive damagesstandard, such awards may be reversed on a showing of "meredisagreement in the scientific community as to whether thedefendant's conduct was reasonable."

GOODRICH PETITIONSCA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPERSERVICE OF SUMMONS     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the CaliforniaSupreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was notproperly served with a summons in an exploding-tire case, andthat the trial court disregarded long-standing case authority inadopting the "substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.B.F. Goodrich Co. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529(CA Sup. Ct.).     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded thatservice was improper in that:     " Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;     " there was no notice pursuant to California Code of Civil     Procedure Section 412.30;     " if service was attempted, no designation was made;               " the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the person     who received the summons was served;     " no date of delivery was noted; and     " the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of     the person who allegedly received service.     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire explodedwhile being inflated at a gas station.  He then served whatGoodrich calls an "admittedly defective summons" and complaint on"The B.F. Goodrich Company," not the named defendant "B.F.Goodrich."     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quashand the state appeals court denied review.  In its petition tothe California Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law isclear that 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply wherethe summons fails to identify the individual being served onbehalf of a corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded itsjurisdiction.  Therefore, based on the evidence before it, theSuperior Court abused its discretion in denying petitioner'smotion to quash."     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the casealong" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "Wecannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble thecause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast trackrules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.This case presents clear issues of first impression concerningadequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effectof fast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving casesto trial within the fast track limitation framework even againstentities that are not proper parties."

FINDS LAWN MOWERDESIGN DEFECT CLAIMSNOT PREEMPTED BY CPSA     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 27partially reversed a Minnesota federal court's determinations andfound that a family's design defect claims against a lawnmowermanufacturer were not preempted by the Consumer Product SafetyAct (CPSA).  Moe et al. v. MTD Products Inc., No. 95-1938(8th Cir.).     The panel did affirm the defense judgment on the balance ofthe plaintiffs' claims, holding the remaining theories ofrecovery preempted by the CPSA.     In July 1992, the fingers of 17-year-old Brian Moe wereamputated when he reached into the side grass chute of a self-propelled walk-behind mower manufactured by MTD Products Inc.The mower was equipped with a safety device called a bladebrake/clutch system (BBC), which allows the cutting blade torotate only when the control lever of the operator handle isengaged.  Brian was an experienced operator of the mower, and hadremoved grass from the side chute twice on the morning of hisaccident without incident.     It was subsequently discovered that the BBC's control cablehad been broken.  In their action against MTD, Brian's parentsasserted that the mower was defectively designed in that thecontrol cable was routed in such a manner that it rubbed againstthe throttle control housing, causing it to fray and ultimatelybreak.  In its response, MTD pointed to the fact that in 1991,the mower's handle had broken from the base, and Thomas Moe hadit reattached by a welder.  The repaired handle was 1-3/8 incheslonger than the original, and MTD claimed that the resultantincrease of stress on the BBC control cable caused its breakage.     The Moes also alleged that an additional label warning thatthe cable may fray should have been placed on the mower's handle.While the owner's manual advised that the control cable should beinspected, the plaintiffs asserted that this was insufficientnotice of the potential hazard.  The U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Minnesota determined that all of the Moes' claimswere preempted by the CPSA.     On appeal, the Moes contended that their failure to warn anddesign defect arguments were not federally preempted.  MTDconceded that the design defect allegations were not preempted,but argued that summary judgment in its favor was appropriatebecause the product had been substantially altered.     In its review, the Eighth Circuit noted that the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission has promulgated a safety standard forwalk-behind power motors, which provides that a label warningagainst blade contact injury must be placed on each mower's bladehousing.  In considering the Moes' contention that a warning thatthe BBC cable may fray is required, the court stated that the"risk of injury contemplated by such a warning is the same asthat addressed by the labelling requirements in the MowerStandard " injury to the hands by the cutting blade."  The Moes'claim, the panel wrote, "would create a state standard requiringadditional warnings on lawn mowers or in owners manuals relatedto the same risk of injury addressed by the federal standard."     The panel did find the plaintiffs' design defect claims tobe contemplated by the CPSA's savings clause.  "A successful tortaction based on the defective design of an installed BBC wouldnot create a different standard for mower safety or imposedifferent requirements on the manufacturer," the court wrote.     As to MTD's substantial alteration argument, the courtstated that the "record here shows that issues of material factexist as to whether the BBC design caused Brian's injury....Based on the evidence in the record, it would not be 'sheerspeculation' for a jury in this case to find that the design,rather than the alteration, caused the fraying and the accident."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER PRODUCT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1996MO CT. APP.: CASUAL LENDEROF NAIL GUN NOT STRICTLYLIABLE OR NEGLIGENT     The owner who loaned an allegedly defectively designed nailgun to someone cannot be held liable on theories of strictliability or negligence if the user injures somebody, theMissouri Court of Appeals has ruled.  Bailey v. InnovativeManagement & Investment Inc., No. WD 50922 (MO Ct. App.).     In a unanimous Dec. 19 decision, the panel upheld summaryjudgment against a man injured when a nail was accidentallydischarged into his head.     Innovative Management & Investment loaned a nail gun andother tools to an employee who was building his own home on hisown time.  Plaintiff Ron Bailey volunteered to help with theproject.  The employee's brother was using the nail gun whenBailey inadvertently hit the bottom of the device, causing it todischarge.     A petition was filed in Boone County Circuit Court allegingproduct defect and failure to warn strict liability counts, plusa claim for negligently furnishing a dangerous instrumentality.Judge Ellen S. Roper granted the defense motion for summaryjudgment.     The Court of Appeals, Western District, affirmed in anopinion by Judge James M. Smart Jr.  The panel found no basis forthe strict liability causes of action because InnovativeManagement did not inject the nail gun into the stream ofcommerce and because the employee did not receive the nail gunfor the mutual benefit of the company and himself.  InnovativeManagement supplied the nail gun as an isolated, non-commercialtransaction without financial or other compensation, it said, andthe company was not in the business of selling or furnishingtools.     As for the negligence count, the court said the company'smere furnishing of the nail gun was insufficient to support theclaim because only a gratuitous bailment was involved.Innovative Management owed Bailey no duty to protect him frominjury because the company received no benefit or advantage fromloaning the instrument to the employee, it said.  The court alsocited uncontradicted testimony that the company president wasunaware of any defect or dangerous condition when the employeeborrowed the nail gun.     Debbie S. Champion of St. Louis represented Bailey.  JeffreyO.

REFUSES ROWING MACHINESUPPLIER BID FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTON MARKET SHARE ARGUMENT     Justice Francis X. Spina of the Berkshire, MA, SuperiorCourt on Dec. 12 rejected the attempt of a rowing machinesupplier to obtain summary judgment on a seller's third-partyclaim for market share liability.  Mahar v. Hanover HouseIndustries Inc. v. Etna Products et al., No. 88-0156(MA Super. Ct., Berkshire).     The judge found the present facts distinguishable from thosein a 1982 diethylstilbestrol (DES) case in which the state highcourt declined to adopt the market share liability doctrine foridentifying a liable manufacturer defendant.     The litigation was brought by David Mahar, who alleged thathe sustained injuries in 1987 while using a rowing exerciserpurchased through the mail from Hanover House Industries.Hanover brought a third-party complaint against three of itssuppliers; one supplier was later voluntarily dismissed.     In the two-week period before the product was shipped toMahar, Hanover received some 58,199 rowing machines from supplierE. Mishan & Sons and another 35,686 from Etna Products.  Themachines were indistinguishable as to their supplier, and Hanoverhad no inventory control in place that could identify thesupplier of the product Mahar purchased.  Etna sought summaryjudgment for failure to identify the actual supplier.     Justice Spina wrote that "[n]o Massachusetts appellate casehas ever held that a 'market-share' approach may be used toestablish the requisite element of the 'identity' of themanufacturer or supplier in a product liability case," and notedthe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's refusal to do so inthe DES case Payton v. Abbott Labs (1982).     "Several factors are present in this case which were notpresent in Payton," the judge continued, "and factors whichcaused the Payton Court concern are not present here."  He notedthat all probable suppliers of the product had been named to thecase; he found that the suppliers "were equally as able as thedefendant to identify the unit shipped, and may still inspect theunit to try and determine the route of its delivery to theplaintiff."               The judge further observed that Etna may still offer proofthat it did not supply the unit in issue, and that both suppliersmay implead the product's manufacturer.  He lastly noted that"there is no public policy supportive of research and developmentof new drugs/medicine impacted here."     Justice Spina concluded that the dispute was "an appropriatecase to allow a plaintiff to proceed with and develop a theory ofliability which is in the formative stages in this Commonwealthand which has a reasonably good chance for recognition by theappellate courts."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER PRODUCT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1996EVIDENCE OF SUBSEQUENTREMEDIAL MEASURES CAN BEEXCLUDED, 11TH CIR.

Wood v. Morbark Industries Inc. et al., No. 93-3472(11th Cir.).     The panel did reverse a Florida district judge's denial ofnew trial to the plaintiff/appellant, however, determining thatthe evidence in issue below had been properly admitted forimpeachment purposes.     Morbark Industries Inc. had been sued by Ruby Wood, whosehusband, Ginger, died in a 1989 accident involving an "EegerBeever" wood chipper of the defendant's manufacture.  GingerWood, a municipal employee, was pulled into the device up to hisupper torso.  In arguing that the product was defective andunreasonably dangerous, she asserted that the chipper's 17-inchinfeed chute was too short to adequately protect the machine'soperator.     Morbark was granted a motion in limine to exclude evidenceof post-accident design changes to the chipper that lengthenedthe infeed chute.  In its review, the 11th Circuit noted thatdefense counsel still "sought to imply to the jury that theseventeen-inch chute was the safest length chute available andwas still in use by [Ginger's employer] as well as othergovernment agencies."     In the course of a 1993 trial in the U.S. District Court forthe Northern District of Florida, plaintiffs' counsel cross-examined Norvel Morey, Morbark's president and designer of theEeger Beever, on the issue of subsequent design changes.  Thetrial judge admonished the attorney before the jury, and directedthe jury to disregard any comment concerning the sale of longerchutes.               The panel ultimately found for Morbark, determining theEeger Beever not to be unreasonably dangerous as designed andmarketed.  Ruby Wood sought new trial, claiming that the trialjudge had committed reversible error by admonishing plaintiff'scounsel before the jury.  In rejecting the motion, the trialjudge found that the admonition had not been unduly prejudicialto the plaintiff's case.     In its analysis, the 11th Circuit first rejected Wood'scontention that Rule 407 should not be applied in strict productliability cases.  "We are persuaded that Rule 407 is necessary insuch cases to focus the jury's attention on the product'scondition or design at the time of the accident," the panelwrote.  The panel rejected Wood's entreaty to follow the 10thCircuit's reasoning in Moe v. Avions Marcel (1984), which statedthat federal courts must apply state evidentiary principles ifthey conflict with FRE 407.     Wood next argued that if FRE 407 was deemed controlling,then the trial court should have applied one of the exceptions tothe rule and held the evidence admissible either to show thefeasibility of precautionary measures, or for impeachment.  Woodhad specifically pointed to Morey's testimony that the 17-inchchute was the "safest length chute you could possibly put on themachine."     The court stated that "[w]hile we do not find that thistestimony put feasibility at issue, we do find that it opened thedoor to impeachment....  Wood's counsel should have been allowedto ask why the supposedly safest design possible was modifiedafter the accident involving Ginger Wood."     The panel found that the refusal to allow impeachment of thewitness did not in and of itself substantially affect Wood'srights, but did have such an impact when considered inconjunction with the court's direction to the jury.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER PRODUCT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1996CA JUDGE DENIESPOST-TRIAL MOTIONSOF LORILLARD, H&V     California Superior Court Judge Winton McKibben, withoutelaboration, on Nov. 6 denied the motions of Lorillard, Inc. andHollingsworth & Vose Co. for a new trial of Milton Horowitz'ssuit alleging mesothelioma from asbestos contained in Kent brandcigarettes.  Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al., No. 965-245(CA Super. Ct., San Francisco); see Consumer Product LitigationReporter, September 1995.     Horowitz and his wife, Shirley Horowitz, won jury verdictsfor $2 million against the companies on Aug. 31 after a trialbefore Judge McKibben.  The award includes $700,000 in punitivedamages.               Milton Horowitz, 72, is a retired university professor fromBeverly Hills, CA.  He was still active as a clinicalpsychologist when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June1994.  His suit alleges that his cancer was caused by theasbestos-containing Micronite filters used on Kent cigarettesbetween 1952 and 1956.  The suit named Lorillard, Inc. as themanufacturer of the Kent cigarettes and Hollingsworth & Vose Co.as the manufacturer of the Micronite filters.     During the trial, Horowitz claimed that the Kent Micronitefilter was defective and that it rendered the Kent cigarettesdefective by releasing asbestos fibers which he inhaled.  He alsocontended that the defendant companies were negligent and failedto warn about the asbestos health hazard associated with Kentcigarettes.  He further asserted that the companiesmisrepresented the cigarette and filter by claiming that thefilter was "totally harmless" and that the Kent cigarette"offered the greatest health protection of any cigarette."     Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose defended by arguing thatthe filter did not release asbestos fibers.  They also assertedthat Horowitz did not smoke Kent cigarettes in the time periodbetween 1952 and 1956, when the filter contained asbestos, andthey suggested that he was either mistaken or lying when he saidthat he did.     The jury found for the plaintiffs on all theories ofliability except for the intentional fraud claim " it found thatthe defendants made their health representation without knowingone way or the other whether the filter was "totally harmless."It awarded $350,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in non-economic damages to Milton Horowitz, and it awarded $250,000 on aloss of consortium claim by Shirley Horowitz.  It also found thatLorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose were each 50% responsible forthe plaintiffs' injuries and damages.     The jury further determined that Milton Horowitz hadsuffered appreciable harm before June 4, 1986, a finding requiredby California's Proposition 51, the statute requiringapportionment of non-economic damages for actions accruing afterJune 4, 1986.     Lastly, the jury found that the plaintiffs had shown byclear and convincing evidence that each defendant acted withmalice, oppression or fraud, thus entitling the plaintiffs topunitive damages.     After a brief supplemental argument, the jury retired onAug. 31 to further deliberate the amount, if any, of punitivedamages to award.  It returned with a verdict on Sept. 1,awarding punitive damages of $560,000 against Lorillard and$140,000 against Hollingsworth & Vose.     In its post-trial motion, Hollingsworth & Vose argued thatthe court had erred by admitting the deposition testimony ofElise Comproni, an inspector with the Massachusetts Department ofLabor and Industries, Division of Occupational Hygiene.  Compronitestified that in 1953 he was "appalled" when he learned thatasbestos was being used in the Kent cigarette filters.Hollingsworth & Vose argued that he was not qualified to give anopinion concerning the potential hazards of an asbestos-containing filter in the early 1950s and that it was prejudicedby repeated references to the testimony by counsel for theHorowitzes.     The filter maker also argued that the weight of the evidencepresented at trial was insufficient to justify the jury's findingthat it had been negligent.  "[P]laintiffs were required todemonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that defendants knewor should have known of the harmful health effects associatedwith an asbestos-containing filter between 1952 and 1956.Plaintiffs offered no testimony or studies which suggested thatmedical science believed such a danger existed during thisperiod," it asserted.     Hollingsworth & Vose also contended that it had beenprejudiced by the court decision to allow the jury to considerfraud claims against it.  The Horowitz complaint, it noted, onlyasserted fraud claims against Lorillard, and the plaintiffsfailed to present any evidence of fraud against it.     Lorillard has prevailed in four previous lawsuits alleginginjury from the filters, largely by raising doubts about whetherthe plaintiffs' illness was caused by Kent cigarettes or otherpossible exposures to asbestos.  The company is currentlyinvolved in 10 other lawsuits involving the Micronite filters.     The plaintiffs were represented at trial by Madelyn J.Chaber with Wartnick, Chaber, Harowitz, Smith & Tigerman in SanFrancisco.

Ct., Wayne Cty.).     The amended complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Courtnamed the additional defendants because the lead plaintiff smokedKent cigarettes with "Micronite" filters in the 1950s.  In theoriginal July 25, 1995 complaint, retired tile setter NelsonSorise alleged his mesothelioma resulted from on-the-job exposureto a variety of asbestos products.  Nearly 60 defendants werenamed.     The amendment added the three Kent defendants, alleging thatasbestos fibers in Micronite filters were also a proximate causeof Sorise's mesothelioma.  According to the complaint, whichalleged failure to warn, Sorise smoked Kents between 1952 and1956, the time when Micronite filters were used.     According to Sorise's attorney, Michael B. Serling ofBirmingham, MI, Kents were marketed heavily as being safer thantheir competitors on the basis that the Micronite filters removedtar and nicotine.     Kent's Micronite filters have been the focus of two recentactions, one of which ended in a $2 million award in favor of aCalifornia professor who alleged mesothelioma from the asbestosin the Micronite filters (Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al.,No. 964-245 [CA Super. Ct.]; see story this issue).

Hammersv. United States Tobacco Co., No. 95-1335-MLB (D KS); seeConsumer Product Litigation Reporter, August 1995.     The lawsuit was filed July 24 in U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Kansas, in Wichita, alleging that the manufacturersof smokeless tobacco products have designed sales campaigns thatspecifically set out to lure users of their products to"graduate" to products containing higher concentrations ofnicotine.     The complaint was filed on behalf of all users of smokelesstobacco products in Kansas.  The plaintiffs were seeking classaction status and had the potential of involving approximately30,000 Kansas residents.     Plaintiff attorney Derek Casey of Hutton & Hutton in Wichitasaid he expected to file a new lawsuit on behalf of a nationwideclass by mid-February.

Kernv. Nozaki America Inc., No. 94-12272-RGS (D MA).     Alice Kern filed a personal injury suit in 1994 allegingnegligence and breach of warranty.  She claimed that shecontracted mercury poisoning from eating five to seven cans ofGeisha brand canned tuna per week for 24 years.  Geisha brand issold by defendant Nozaki America Inc., which moved for summaryjudgment.     U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns found that whilethere is no question that Kern is ill, the only disease that shehas been diagnosed as having is rheumatoid arthritis.  Her doctortested her blood for mercury in 1991 and found her mercury bloodlevel to be slightly above normal.  It returned to the mid-rangeof normal after Kern stopped eating Geisha tuna and underwentchelation therapy, Judge Stearns said.     To prevail in her suit, Kern would have had to establishthat eating the amounts of tuna she claims to have ingested cancause mercury poisoning and that Geisha brand tuna containsmercury at levels sufficient to have caused the poisoning.  JudgeStearns found that she could establish neither.     "Viewing all inferences in the light most favorable to Kern,there are no disputed facts in the record that would permit ajury to find that Kern suffers from mercury poisoning, much lessthat any such poisoning resulted from her consumption of Geishabrand tuna," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER PRODUCT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1996CIBA ARGUES CONTACT SOLUTIONNEGLIGENCE CLAIMS AREPREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW     Approved labels and warnings on medical devices are"specific requirements" of federal law that preempt causes ofaction brought under state law, respondent Ciba Vision Corp.argued in its answer to a petition filed by a California womanasking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's rulingthat all of her claims against Ciba are preempted by the MedicalDevices Amendments.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608(CA Sup. Ct.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December1995.     In its Nov. 15 answer, Ciba contended that the CaliforniaCourt of Appeal, Sixth District, was aligned with a majority ofjurisdictions that have held that federal law preempts causes ofaction brought under state law.     Appellant Leslie Scott brought suit in California statecourt against Ciba, alleging claims of strict liability,negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and breach ofimplied warranty.  Scott claimed she had difficulty indistinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogenperoxide, from its saline solution.  She claimed that as a resultof her failure to distinguish between the bottles, she sufferedchemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts in theAOSEPT solution instead of the saline solution.     Scott argued that, around the time of her injury, Ciba hadbegun to market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but alsocontinued to market it in the old bottle, knowing that personsnot wearing their contacts would have difficulty indistinguishing the two.     The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motionfor summary judgment, finding Scott's claims preempted by theMDA.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District,affirmed the trial court.     The Court of Appeal cited to Evraets v. IntermedicsIntraocular, Inc., 29 Cal.App.4th 786, and 21 C.F.R. Section808.1(b), in holding that the "requirement" the Food and DrugAdministration refers to in Section 360k includes "anyrequirement having the force and effect of law 'whetherestablished by statute, ordinance, regulation, or courtdecision.'"     Examining Scott's argument that the MDA contains no specificcounterpart regulations regarding AOSEPT, the Court of Appealheld that all Class III medical devices are subject to therequirements of the MDA, which include the FDA's stringentpremarket approval process.     In her petition to the California Supreme Court, Scottargued that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressedthe issue of federal preemption concerning Class III devicesfound that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v.Pacesetter Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).     Some of the leading cases that have expounded on the issueof preemption have recently been criticized, Scott said.  Forexample, the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' 1984 ruling inMartello v. Ciba Vision Corp. gave Section 360k(a), the MDA'spreemption provision, an expansive reading, but was criticized inthe Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kennedy, Scott said.  "The...NinthCircuit in Kennedy...stated that the language of Section 360k(a)does not create the broad, sweeping preemption found by the'strained reading of the statute' by the court in Martello,"Scott argued.     And, Scott said, state actions that attempt to enforcefederal standards are not preempted.  Citing to Evraets, theappellant said, regarding a claim of negligence per se, since thestate requirements are equal to the federal requirements becausethey adopt the federal standards, they are not preempted.     On the other hand, Ciba argued in its answer that aconsistent line of cases holds that state law tort and warrantycauses of action are preempted because the pre-market approvalprocess envelops the approved product in specific requirements offederal law.     "Scott makes no claim of any defect in the design ormanufacture of AOSEPT," Ciba said.  "Rather, she contends thatCalifornia tort and warranty law required that Ciba Visionpackage and label AOSEPT differently in order to warn usersagainst accidental placement of deneutralized solution in theeye."     Ciba argued that this is a "strong case for MDA preemption"because of AOSEPT's premarket approval and Scott's singular focuson warning deficiencies in the product.     The respondent said that the court's decision in Evraets,which Scott cited in her petition, does not warrant review by thestate Supreme Court.  Ciba said Evraets does not deal with adevice that received FDA premarket approval.     "Evraets contains a discussion of the preemption of statelaw claims for breach of warranty that is consistent with thedecision in Scott," Ciba said.  "Evraets only reaches the issueof preemption in relation to a claim of breach of an expresswarranty."     Ciba concluded that by enacting the MDA, Congress interposedthe FDA as an expert watchdog and preempted certain state lawcauses of action.  A jury should not be allowed to rethink thesufficiency of labels and packaging that the FDA endorsed, saidCiba.     In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeal citedtwo cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  InEvraets and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37Cal.App.4th 1444, the cases involved experimental products forwhich adequate warnings were not yet known, Scott said.     Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label andwarning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect inthe design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scottargued.     "Respondent is well aware that Leslie Scott claims that thedesign of the two virtually indistinguishable white productcontainers containing harmful and harmless ingredientsrespectively are defective under both negligence and strictliability theories," she stated.

CT.: LANDLORDSHAVE NO DUTY TO INSPECTFOR LEAD PAINT HAZARDS     The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Nov. 22 reaffirmed a 27-year-old ruling that landlords cannot be held to haveconstructive notice of the dangers of lead paint to youngchildren occupying their premises and, therefore, that they haveno duty to test for and remove lead paint from their properties.Felton v. Spratley et al., No. 7 East. Dist. App. Dkt. (PASup. Ct.).     The one-page per curiam decision stated that the appeal isdismissed "as having been improvidently granted," with JusticeJohn P. Flaherty dissenting.  It offers no further commentary noris Justice Flaherty's dissent explained.               Lucretia Felton and her daughter, Shakeema, petitioned forrehearing on Dec. 6, and a ruling on that request is stillpending.  Their attorney, Edwin L. London of Matkoff & Shengold,said he was "terribly disappointed" by the dismissal, especiallysince the lower court ruling was a 2-1 split decision, and sincethe Supreme Court had been briefed and had heard oral argumentsin October.     The Supreme Court's dismissal lets stand a ruling affirmingthe dismissal of this suit by the trial court on the grounds thatthe landlord had no actual notice of the lead paint hazards inthe apartment she rented to the Feltons.     The Feltons resided in an apartment leased from MarieSpratley in 1988; Shakeema was diagnosed with lead poisoning thefollowing year.  When Spratley was notified of the chipping andpeeling lead paint by the Philadelphia Health Department, she hadthe paint removed and the apartment repainted within a month.     The Feltons then filed suit in the Philadelphia County Courtof Common Pleas, alleging negligence and carelessness in failingto test for and remove the paint prior to Shakeema's poisoningaround May 1989.     The trial court granted summary judgment to Jessie andMollucye Spratley Pearson, the executors of Marie Spratley'sestate, based on the grounds that Spratley was unaware of thehazardous condition and, therefore, had no obligation to correctit.  The defendants had argued that Lucretia Felton was aware ofthe peeling paint for several months before Shakeema wasdiagnosed, but never reported it to them.     On appeal to state Superior Court, the Feltons conceded thatthe defendants lacked actual knowledge of the presence of leadpaint in the apartment, but, they contended, knowledge about leadpaint poisoning had become widespread among the public by thelate 1980s and, therefore, Spratley should have had constructiveknowledge of the hazard and should have eliminated it.     The Superior Court panel ruled 2-1 that it remained bound bythe state Supreme Court's holding in Kolojeski v. Deisher Inc.,429, Pa. 191, 239 A.2d 329 (1968), which stated that where thelandlord had no notice that the walls were painted with leadpaint until after the plaintiffs had been treated for leadpoisoning, he had no affirmative duty to inspect the premises forlead paint and he could not be held liable for the injuries.     The Feltons argued that public knowledge of lead painthazards had increased substantially since 1968 when Kolojeski wasdecided and, therefore, that the defendants should be held tohave had constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint.  TheSuperior Court majority ruled that the Feltons failed to cite anystate law case or to otherwise persuade it to expand the law ofnegligence between landlord and tenant.               In a New York case in May, a five-judge appellate courtpanel ruled that New York City's landlords do have an affirmativeduty to search out and remove lead paint in apartments occupiedby children, but that ruling was based on a city ordinance thatexplicitly spells out that duty.  In October, the ResidentialLead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X) went intoeffect.  That federal law requires landlords throughout thecountry to inform potential tenants of the presence of lead paintin rental properties or to abate the hazard if the tenantsinclude young children.

United States Liability Insurance Co. v.Selman et al., No. 95-1435 (1st Cir.).     Livingstone Selman owns an apartment house in Roxbury, MA,where Robin Razza and her infant daughter, Carol Ann, resided.Carol Ann was diagnosed with lead poisoning late in 1984.  Selmanbegan removing the lead paint on March 7, 1985, and by March 29,an inspection of the Razzas' apartment showed it to be 95% lead-free.     In May 1985, Selman changed insurance carriers and insuredthe apartment house with United States Liability Insurance Co.(USLIC).  The insurance company renewed the policy in May 1986.The Razzas moved from Selman's apartment building in September1986 and subsequently brought a state law personal injury suitagainst Selman that is still pending.     USLIC, attempting to escape liability, brought a diversityaction seeking a declaratory judgment in U.S. District Court forthe District of Massachusetts.  After a bench trial, the districtcourt ruled that USLIC had no duty to indemnify Selman for claimsfor injuries resulting from Carol Ann's ingestion of lead paintprior to May 4, 1985 (the inception date of the first policy).However, the court ruled, USLIC does have a duty to indemnifySelman with respect to claims arising while the policies were ineffect " from May 4, 1985, to May 3, 1987.               On appeal, USLIC advanced three alternative grounds forreversing the district court judgment:  (1) coverage was nevertriggered because Carol Ann sustained no discernible injurieswhile the insurance policies were in effect; (2) Carol Ann'sinjuries were the result of her initial ingestion of lead paintbefore the policies went into effect; and (3) Selman knew aboutthe liability before the policies went into effect and,therefore, is precluded from coverage under the "known risk"doctrine.     Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya, writing for a unanimousappellate panel, ruled first that the appeal had to be decided onthe "clear error" standard because the issues revolved around theinterpretation of substantial extrinsic evidence and not solelyon questions about the clear meaning of contract provisions.     The district court was correct in determining that coveragehad been triggered because Razza's expert witness, Dr. JohnGraef, testified that "at least a portion" of Carol Ann's claimedinjuries occurred during the policy periods, the appellate courtfound.  Graef's testimony was supported by data showing sharpincreases, or "spikes," in Carol Ann's blood toxicity levelscorresponding to incidents of lead paint ingestion during thepolicy period.     Further, Graef testified that the new incidents of leadpaint ingestion resulted in further injuries that occurred duringthe period covered by the policies because, unlike many otherdiseases such as measles or chicken pox, lead poisoning injuriesare cumulative, the circuit court ruled.     "[T]he district court had before it compelling evidence thatCarol Ann Razza ingested several 'big meals' of lead paint chipswhile the appellant's policies were in force, and Dr. Graeftestified that each such ingestion caused (or potentially couldcause) discrete injury.  On this basis, the district courtwarrantably found a clear nexus between Carol Ann's 'big meals'and the spikes in her toxicity levels," Judge Selya wrote.     On the issue of known risk, Judge Selya said, the centralquestion on appeal is:  "What did Selman know and when did heknow it?"  The known risk doctrine precludes coverage when theinsured knows in advance of the policy's effective date that aspecific loss has already happened or is substantially certain tohappen.     "[T]he presence of risk runs to the very essence of aninsurance contract.  Where there is no risk of loss " as where aloss has already occurred before a policy takes effect "insurance ceases to serve its socially utile purpose of risk-spreading," he said.     Finding that the test for asserting the known risk doctrineis subjective and that the insurer has the burden of proof, theFirst Circuit ruled that nothing in the court record showed thatthe lead paint in Selman's building was the source of Carol Ann'sillness (or that he knew of the connection), nor that Selman knewthat Carol Ann would suffer further injury from continuedexposure to lead paint.  Further, the panel said, given theinspection report that the Razza apartment was 95% free of leadsix weeks before the first policy became effective, Selman couldeasily have assumed that Carol Ann was no longer exposed to anysignificant amount of lead paint and therefore would suffer nofurther injury.     "The district court's finding is strengthened by the utterlack of any evidence that Selman attempted to conceal ormisrepresent the presence of lead paint in his apartment housewhen he applied for insurance.  To the extent that theappellant's application form did not request such information,the appellant was the author of its own misfortune," Judge Selyawrote.     Finally, the panel ruled, the district court did not commitreversible error in declining to interpret a clause in the policylimiting the company's liability to $300,000 per occurrence asmeaning that USLIC's total potential liability is capped at$300,000.  While the district court did not spell out itsreasoning, it seems self-evident that the basis for the rulingwas that the policy does not define the operative terms of thatclause, Judge Selya concluded.     USLIC was represented by Alice Olsen Mann and Mark P. Baileyof Morrison, Mahoney & Miller.  Selman was represented by KennethH. Soble of Soble, Van Dam, Pearlman & Gittelsohn.

Published with Japanese and English text on facing pages,the book is titled Joining In! A Handbook for Better CorporateCitizenship in the United States.  Its 85 pages contain advice toJapan-based companies in America on how to participateeffectively in communities where they have built plants, bysupporting local charities and volunteering to work for localorganizations.     In the preface, Hisao Kondo, president of the JapaneseChamber of Commerce, emphasizes that Joining In! was not writtenjust to expand Japanese understanding of American philanthropy,but as a "call to action."  As such, it urges Japanese executivesin the United States to take the initiative in getting involvedin their communities without waiting to be asked.     "This is a vital means of gaining acceptance and therebyimproving American community perception of the Japanesetransplant company," says the handbook.  It emphasizes thatcommunity involvement can promote a Japanese corporation'sbusiness interests in several ways:     o  by improving its ability to recruit and retain skilledlocal employees;     o  by fostering good working relationships with local andstate government officials;     o  by providing tax deductions; and     o  by improving the company's image.     Language and cultural barriers have prevented many Japaneseexecutives from joining boards and volunteering for othercommunity activities, according to the handbook.  One result ofthis is that some Japanese-based corporations have suffered fromthe image of being uninvolved.     To change this perception, the handbook recommends thatJapanese corporations take a number of steps toward becoming moreinvolved in their local communities:     o  Establish a company policy on volunteering and communityinvolvement, after first seeking suggestions from all employees.     o  Create a program budget.     o  Appoint a community involvement coordinator who, ideally,should be Japanese; alternatively, a Japanese and an Americancould be joint coordinators.     o  Select an initial project for special attention andpublicize it in the company and community.     o  Recognize and reward volunteerism by employees.     "Volunteer programs are a way for corporations todemonstrate moral leadership, `doing the right thing,' whichcomes back to benefit the company by enhancing its image and itsinfluence in the community," says the handbook.  "Communityinvolvement and volunteer programs are ultimately good forbusiness."     Next month CGW will look at areas in the United States whereJapanese companies have a strong presence for an overview oftheir giving policies.     Joining In! is available for $40 from the Japanese Chamberof Commerce and Industry of New York, The Galleria, 115 East 57thStreet, New York, NY 10022.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE GIVING WATCH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJune 1990REEBOK TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT RACISM     Three recent grants by the Reebok Foundation illustrate theathletic shoe manufacturer's long-term commitment to humanrights.     The largest gift, $750,000, went to the Center for the Studyof Sport in Society at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, for aprogram to combat racism.     The three-year program, called "Project Teamwork," plans tosend teams of athletes to schools and community groups around thecountry, starting this summer.  Four cities, Boston, Los Angeles,New York, and Washington, DC, will be targeted in the first year.     The founders of the project say it is necessary because theyfeel civil rights progress has slowed and that racism andanti-Semitism are on the rise.  They believe athletes are key tothe program's success because athletes are among the strongestblack role models.     Project Teamwork will also include elements of a programstarted five years ago to help former college athletes who failedto get their degrees after their athletic eligibility expired.  In the schools and community centers they visit, theathletes will talk about the dangers of racism, the value ofstaying in school, and the fallacy of going through school withthe idea of making a career of professional athletics.     Reebok also announced a $375,000 grant to TransAfrica, aspart of a campaign to discredit rumors that Reebok Internationaldoes business in South Africa.  (Reebok stopped selling itsproducts in South Africa in 1976.)     The grant will help build TransAfricare's new library andresearch center in Washington, DC.  When completed, the centerwill be the primary resource for historical and educationalmaterials on the role of African Americans in the shaping of U.S.foreign policy.     A third grant, for $50,000, went to the NAACP for thegeneral fund of the civil rights group.     The grants exemplify Reebok's long-term commitment to thecause of human rights, says Paul Fireman, chairman and CEO of thecompany.  The foundation is also interested in supporting "theunderserved" children and youth, the handicapped, and theelderly.  It also occasionally assists capital campaigns orbuilding projects "where the result would make a world ofdifference in the lifestyle of the people served," according tofoundation guidelines.     Reebok's total contributions in 1987 were $285,500,increasing to $1.5 million in 1988.

Launched with a grant of $2.5 million, Reading Rocket is aimedat children in grades 2-4 and addresses three majorconcerns: motivating children to enjoy reading, encouragingparental participation, and providing teachers and librarianswith additional books.     Another successful program, Pizza Hut's "Book It!" wasstarted five years ago to encourage children in grades 1-6 toread more by rewarding them with pizza vouchers.  This programhas proved so popular that in 1990-91 it will be offered tochildren in kindergarten, too.  Because many kindergartnerscannot read, teachers will set reading goals that involveparents, grandparents, and siblings in reading to the child.Steven S. Reinemund, president and CEO of Pizza Hut, a divisionof Pepsico, explains his company's motivation for the project:"As an employer, we believe an investment in education is aninvestment in our future."

Lembeck, president of RyanCause Marketing, a consulting company in Westport, CT, told aninternational conference of the National Society of Fund RaisingExecutives in Orlando, FL, in March.     But a lot of nonprofit organizations don't understand theneeds of corporations or how they go about marketing theirproducts, and therefore miss out on this "huge pot of money,"Lembeck noted.     Here are Lembeck's six tips for nonprofits who want to reapthe benefits of cause-related marketing:     o  Think like a marketer.  Identify your organization'smarketable assets.  These may include your name, communityawareness of your programs, and your board members.     o  Learn as much as you can about the companies you wish toapproach.  Read the business press; check the companies' annualreports; watch their ads and promotions.     o  Try to figure out what their target is before youapproach them.     o  Address their needs in your presentation; show them thatyou're on their side and that working with your organization willhelp them sell more products (and incidentally benefit yourcause).     o  Identify key decision makers.  For cause-marketingdecisions, the person to approach is not the head of thefoundation, it's the vice president of marketing and sales.o  Follow up a proposal personally by phone and in letters untilyou get an answer.Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE GIVING WATCH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJune 1990     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holders     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holdersoverwhelmingly turned down a proposal that sought to bancorporate funding for organizations endorsing abortion.

In 1990, with assets that nowexceed $3.2 billion, the foundation expects to make grantstotaling roughly $145 million.  Along with the expanded grantmaking will come a program that emphasizes increased foundationinvolvement with grantees as well as with other grant makers anda stronger commitment to interdisciplinary funding.  Here is aprogram-by-program look at some of the changes at the foundation.     Health and human services.  According to Drew E. Altman, whonow heads Pew's health and human services program, "A naturalrole for foundations is to provide the seed funds for [health andhuman services] programs that ultimately get picked up andintegrated into government funding streams."  In addition to acloser collaboration with the government, Altman predicts morepartnerships with other foundations.  While Altman says heexpects the process of developing a new agenda for the foundationto take several years, he is certain that the problems ofchildren living in poverty will be "a top concern."     Education.  Pew's new program director for education, RobertB. Schwartz, believes there is potential for increasedpartnerships between the government, the corporate sector, andfoundations in education, with foundations providing the "initialrisk capital to test innovative programs."  While highereducation will continue to be a primary focus of the trusts,Schwartz expects to direct increased attention towardintervention programs that will focus on the middle-school years.     According to Schwartz, the foundation will encourageeducators who are taking a broader view of their role, one whichcuts across traditional service lines and includesresponsibilities such as nutrition and health care.  Schwartz isalso interested in exploring the role of private philanthropy inencouraging a more centralized national educational agenda.     Culture.  Marian A Godfrey, the foundation's new programdirector for culture, says she "would like to explorepartnerships at the local and national levels" with corporations,the government, and other foundations.  Godfrey predicts that anumber of existing priorities are likely to receive greaterattention, such as support for individual artists andmulti-cultural programing.  Pew is also looking intoopportunities for funding programs to increase publicappreciation of the arts and culture.     Religion.  Joel A. Carpenter, the new program director forreligion, believes the importance of religious scholarship hasbeen underestimated by American academics.  "An anthropologistgoing to New Guinea would never think of trying to understandthat culture without also studying its religion," explainsCarpenter, "but somehow American scholars have gotten into theframe of mind that they can understand Western culture withoutthis critical component."  In addition to providing continuedsupport for religious scholarship, Carpenter says Pew will alsoexpand its support of church-based community service.  As abeginning, Carpenter says Pew recently initiated a national smallgrants program through World Vision that will support localreligious programs in housing, leadership development, and jobtraining.     The environment.  The foundation recently hired Joshua S.Reichert as its new program director for conservation and theenvironment.  According to Reichert, the trusts look forward to,and expect to encourage, a "groundswell of community-basedactivism" on behalf of the environment.  Reichert says he will beconsidering a wide range of opportunities to promoteenvironmentally sustainable economic development, strengthengrass-roots environmental organizations, increase publicawareness, and encourage new public policy ideas for addressingimportant environmental problems.     Public policy.  Kevin F.F. Quigley is the trusts' newprogram director for public policy.  While Quigley says theprogram's basic priorities will remain the same, he adds thatsome areas will receive greater emphasis in the coming years.  "Iwill be exploring ways to build on our existing Economics andNational Security program to further strengthen the integrationof the two fields at the policy level," says Quigley.  "Also,given the trusts' historic interests in supporting free marketsand democracy, we will be taking a closer look at how Pew mightmore actively promote these values around the world, beginning inEastern Europe."     In 1989, the Pew Charitable Trusts made grants totalingroughly $146.7 million.  Of this amount, 46% went to health andhuman services, 24% went to education, 14% went to culture, 8%went to religion, 5% went to conservation and the environment,and 4% went to public policy.

The foundation alsomakes grants to out-of-state organizations for the benefit ofGeorgia residents.  For example, the foundation has providedfunds for scholarship programs for students from Georgia.

In Charles Stewart MottFoundation v. U.S., the court found that the regulation requiringannual reports on PRI grants was ambiguous.  However, the courtagreed with the IRS that requiring annual reports for the entirelife of the grant was more consistent with the overall regulatoryscheme.  The case concerned a $320,000 PRI grant made by Mott toa community organization in 1976.  After filing annual reports onthe grant for the years 1976 to 1980, the foundation discontinuedits reports, believing that Treasury regulations required reportsfor only the first three years of PRI grants.  In its decision,the court noted that PRI grantees are required to report to thegrantor throughout the life of the PRI, making it consistent torequire that the grantor report to the IRS during the sameperiod.Back to Headline List CopyrightFOUNDATION GIVING WATCH via NewsNetJune 1990     The Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, Portland, OR, has changed     The Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, Portland, OR, has changedits name, effective April 23 of this year, to Meyer MemorialTrust.

For this issue, IIT  askedthese specialists to pinpoint the key changes and take a look aheadin a number of key technologies. Their analyses follow.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996ELECTRONICSLook for a Slowdownin the Coming YearAccording to the Semiconductor Industry Assn.s preliminarynumbers, the worldwide semiconductor device markets grew anunprecedented 43.7% to well over $145 billion in 1995, afterpredicting a growth rate of less than 15%.  The question of whethermarket growth of this magnitude can be sustained at the 1995 levelor not remains.  In short, our reply is, no.  A look at themarkets driving forces in 1995 will fill in the blanks.First, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices accounted fornearly 30% of the total market, up from 17% as recently as 1993.The major factor this past year, of course, was the release ofWindows 95 PC operating (OS) system, and its requirement of up to16 megabytes of RAM for smooth operation.  Since 1993, the influxof graphics-intensive software had pushed memory requirements tothe 8 megabyte range, where it remains for applications of thistype.  No new wunderkind software applications or OSs are on thehorizon to push RAM requirements up further.  Look for a levelingof DRAM demand in particular to soften the market somewhat.This is not to say the market will not experience healthy growth.While the PC market, still the main silicon device driver, may havematured in North America, other areas in the world are seeing PCsales growth in the 20% per year range.  However, hardwarerequirements have stabilized for the time being.  We see thesemiconductor market approaching $180 billion in 1996, which is anincrease of just over 23%.  Major beneficiaries of the overallmarket are manufacturing equipment suppliers, who will ride forfree in 1996, with many companies reporting up to nine-monthbacklogs in orders.A market for which we see little potential is that for cheap, dumbPC terminals under development for World Wide Web access.  Underthe concept, these machines would lack the standard hard drive,floppy disks, and extensive software systems, but would stillrequire RAM and processor power.Anyone who has cruised the Web will tell you that moving from site-to-site is a tedious process, and speed is of the essence.  Inaddition, online time is money, and for any system designed tocruise the Web to be successful, it must provide the processingpower and memory needed to smoothly handle the graphics-intensiveWeb.  At current prices, a powerful, 8 megabyte machine cannot bebuilt and sold with the hoped-for price tag of $500.  A systembuilt for more than that price will collect dust on warehouseshelves (right alongside PDAs)![Marc Favereau is editor of BCCs Electronic Materials TechnologyNews.

A number of categorieshave improved appreciably due to increased demand in segments ofindustrial process applications and biomedical research.Environmental applications are flat to shrinking, so a number ofsuppliers are developing new strategies to reach other markets.Instrument makers continue to find more ways to improve theirmanufacturing methods by reducing the number of parts, simplifyingassembly steps and implementing more stringent testing of keycomponents.  The net result, in some cases, is a product that ismore reliable, and features more capabilities, while actuallycosting less.More importantly though, for future sales, a growing range ofsophisticated technologies are being adapted to variousinstrumentation.  New detectors, more powerful computers, improvedmethods of analysis, new reagents and other factors are pushingmany instruments to new levels of performance.  Also, other typesof hybrid instrumentation are finding new market niches and arehelping to expand the suppliers product lines.Examples of new types of instrumentations that may find significantmarkets in the future are the Smart Nose instruments, field-flowfractionation (FFF),  and newly configured ion mobilityspectrometers.  Also, some product segments that were thought to betechnologically mature are showing surprising new innovations thatare reinvigorating those instrument segments.BCC report G-181 The New Generation of Analytical Instruments, isan upcoming report that surveys the 1995 analytical instrumentmarket, as well as international markets and projects units andsales through 2005 for over 30 instruments.The BCC estimate of the 1995 U.S. market for analyticalinstruments, as defined by the Dept. of Commerce, was approximately$5.1-$5.8 billion in shipments.  Related measuring instrumentswould bring the figure closer to $6.5-$7.5 billion .  ProjectedU.S. sales growth is projected to be approximately 5-7% through2005.It  is worth noting that of those shipments, $1.2-1.4 billion wasjust in parts, components and accessories.  While the overallmarket appears to have grown in the U.S. , the parts segment hasstayed flat.  For 1995, pending further data, the estimated valueof exports of analytical instruments from the U.S. was an estimated$1.90-$2.1 billion, and imports were an estimated $1.2-$1.3billion.[Cort Wrotnowski has managed and conducted strategic and marketingresearch in biotechnology with specific expertise in specializedproduct lines, new market feasibility, scale-up economics, and costanalyses.]Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SEPARATIONSAdvances Point toSteady GrowthThe various ways of separating materials from mixtures are acritical but little known part of industrial production.  Frompharmaceuticals to food and even waste treatment, producers rely onthese rapidly developing technologies. These techniques are alsokey to research and analysis.Lately, we are seeing increased interest in magnetic separations,both on the research front and by commercial concerns.  Developingtechnologies will advance this high tech market. Los AlamosNational Lab (Los Alamos, NM 87545) researchers are using high-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) to extract slightly magneticradioactive contaminants from soil or water.  The process primaryadvantage is the lack of secondary waste produced.In the pharmaceutical industry, PerSeptive Diagnostics (500 OldConnecticut Path, Framingham, MA 10701; Tel: 617/499-1433) havesimplified the process of isolating GAC repeats using BioMagStreptavidin and magnetic agarose.  While scientists report the useof magnetic particles specifically for the isolation of CAGrepeats, in principle, the same techniques could be used to isolateany gene for which a biotinylated PNA probe could be synthesized.Diagnostic test maker, Ohmicron Environmental Diagnostics Inc. (375Pheasant Run, Newtown, PA 18940; Tel: 800/544-8881), hascommercialized two new magnetic particle-based RaPID Assayimmunoassay test kits-cyclodienes and metribuzin.Older processes have also advanced. Researchers continue to testthe boundary of capillary electrophoresis (CE) applications.Recently, considerable attention has been focused on a highlypromising technique for metal ion analysis.  Andrei Timerbaev hasbeen developing a number of migration models based on a generallyvalid equation for electrophoretic mobility as a function of chargedensity.  Two major obstacles affecting CE are electroendosmoticflow (EOF) and sample adsorption onto the capillary wall.Researchers at the University of Uppsala (Dept. of Biochemistry,Uppsala, Sweden) have developed a method of coating the capillariesthat eliminates both problems for a considerable length of time.Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92634; Tel:800/742-2345)  Chia-Hui Shieh has recently patented coatedcapillary columns and a method for their use.Supercritical fluids technology has also expanded its applicationshorizons.  Two separate studies recently compared supercriticalfluid extraction (SFE) with liquid extraction as methods forremoving labile vitamins from creams, lotions, and tablets.  As aresult of their work, the researchers recommended SFE as a methodfor quality-control analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.Supercritical carbon dioxide is now being used as a method torecover uranium and plutonium from nuclear wastes and spent fuels.And Los Alamos National Lab (Chemical Science and Technology Div.,Los Alamos, NM 87545) has used supercritical CO2 as a method ofprecision cleaning that reduces hazardous waste.  The primaryadvantage of this technique is the elimination of chlorocarbons andchlorofluorocarbons as solvents.[Karen Lindsey is editor of BCCs Membrane Technology Reviews,Waste Treatment Technology News and High Tech Separationsnewsletters.

The predicted market surge forfiber optic materials in interexchange, or long distance carrierapplications and in networks involving a single building or a groupof buildings continues unabated.  On the other hand, theuncertainly now creeping into the market revolves around the speedwith which the local exchange carriers (LECs) will upgrade theirresidential networks.Fiber optic materials represent much of the physical structureneeded for existing telecommunications systems, as well as for thevast networks envisioned for installation during the remainder ofthis decade and the 21st century. Telecommunications systemscapable of providing voice, data, text, and video to a variety ofusers will require large increases in the ability to transmit anenormous number of signals over both long and short distances.Technical advances in erbium-doped amplifiers, plastic opticalfiber (POF), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technologies, toname only a few, are spurring the deployment of fiber opticnetworks.Two segments of the fiber optic material market, fiber from localexchanges to the curb and fiber from the curb to the home, were thesubject of very (some would say wildly) optimistic growth estimatesas recently as 1994.  Now many industry sources believe that forthe next 5-10 years, in most cases, fiber optic service will end atthe neighborhood level.There are several regions for the new uncertainty in these marketsegments.  First, the expected merging of and blurring of thedistinct lines between regional telephone companies and cabletelevision operators is not occurring nearly as fast as previouslypredicted.  Second, although legislation opening up competition inlocal communications markets is certain, the pace of itsimplementation may be slower than previously thought.  Finally,despite huge drops in the cost of fiber optic network components,the rush to replace copper and coaxial cable in these applicationshas been slower than forecast.The BCC Fiber Optic Materials report presents a detailed view ofworld market size, growth, and trends for this industry.  The majorproduct lines and applications are identified, and the market sizefor each product line and application is estimated for the nextfive years.  Significant global technological trends anddevelopments in materials and applications are identified andanalyzed, and the structure of the industry is addressed.  Profilesof the major fiber optic materials suppliers are provided.This BCC report provides in-depth information and technologicalevaluations for decision making by those involved in the supply offiber optic materials to the telecommunications industry.  Thisstudy can assist users in strategic planning, acquisition analysis,technology analysis, commercial development of new products, andanalysis of competitors strategies, strengths, weaknesses,pricing, market share, and profitability.[Richard Hilton is completing the new Fiber Optic Materials report.Hilton also edits Optical Materials And Engineering News, a monthlyBCC newsletter.]Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MEMBRANESA Technology ThatIs Coming of Age1996 is expected to see membrane based technologies increasinglyincorporated into large scale industrial processes.  Progress isexpected to continue in an evolutionary mode with newer membranesand devices overcoming earlier shortcomings such as flux, fouling,and scalability. Some of the new concepts up for trial during theyear might include contained liquid membranes, membrane basedstripping, extraction and adsorption. Hybrid process will bring inmembrane separations to augment what cannot be attainedeconomically by either process on a stand alone basis.Ultrafiltration (UF) is up for a greater variety of materials tohelp out the reliable polysulfone. Zirconia on alumina or someother type of inorganic may find wider acceptance. PVDF andmodified PANs can find their niche. Crossflow operational modes forUF and MF (microfiltration) will increasingly be the norm.Pervaporation (PV) will continue its commercial acceptance, but itis a hard sell.  Potential users do not know what this versatilemoney maker can really do for them. Removal of organics from watervia hydrophobic silicone membranes on a microporous substrate inthe spiral wound configuration is being commercialized.  Hollowfiber units with transverse feed flow have been developed. Yet tobe commercialized is the Exxon process to separatearomatics/saturates in the same boiling range into an aromatics-lean retentate for diesel and an aromatics-rich permeate for highoctane gasoline using a polyimide/polyadipate copolymer membrane.Membrane processes that remove VOCs from air or nitrogen should bebetter accepted.  Cation exchange membranes for continuousdeionization should find wider use in deionized water production.Condensation has been integrated with vapor permeation for VOCremoval and additional hybrids such as cryo-membrane permeation,membrane-PSA, and cryogenic-membrane-PSA have been patented. Arelatively new commercial development is the membrane phasecontactor for use in extraction, absorption, and stripping. Anexample of the absorption application of the membrane phasecontactor is used in the beverage industry to add carbon dioxide toaqueous solutions for carbonation.Non-separating functions of membranes are expected to advance intotal usage.  Artificial skin, controlled release applications,biomemitic devices, and breathable fabrics are all examples. Bagfilters still dominate the particulate/air entrapment market, butlow cost membranes could take market share.  An entire market areacould open up if a really low cost membrane material for disposablediapers could be produced.[Anna Crull has 25 years consulting experience in the membrane andseparations industry.

However, the spectre of overcapacitystill plagues the industry for many commodity resins because ofrapid expansion in capacities in Pacific Rim countries.Continuance of this scenario will result in lower prices, andoperating rates along with reduced profits.Opportunities for plastics consumption are strong in Asia, Africa,and the Mideast, with Eastern Europe still lagging behind theglobal pace.  However, only the Asian market is of significantvolume.Main driving forces for plastics consumption still reside withtraditional markets led by automotive, consumer products, andelectrical/electronic. In addition to new polymerization advancescharacterized by metallocene technologies, other aspects stillbeing pursued include alloying/blending, and use of reinforcementsto enhance existing properties.Metallocene-based resins have expanded from polyethylene topolypropylene with polystyrene versions expected in a year or two.The high cost of producing metallocene resins will probably beminimized by converting existing reactors (retrofitting).  Inaddition, it is expected that metallocene catalysts will be used inconjunction with traditional catalysts combining advantages ofboth.Foamed resins have been at the center of the environmental scenewith replacements of CFCs by HCFCs as blowing agents.  Theworldwide agreement to ban CFCs (Montreal Protocol) has been movedup to the year 2000.  Recycled plastic markets are still dominatedby PET bottles and HDPE.  Packaging will remain the largest marketfor recycled resins for the next few years.[Mel Schlechter is the editor of Medical Materials Update and hasover 30 years in the chemical industry, and specialized in plasticsmarket research.]Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996BIOTECHNOLOGYStill Survivalof the FittestSeeing into the future can be a bit tricky.  We're reminded of theConey Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journeyover water.  The next day it rained and in the course of ourperegrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events issomething like that Coney Island experience: if they're generalenough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying somebiotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while otherswill probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trialswill pass, while others will fail.But which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, one couldmake a fortune.  Some people of course believe that test tubeexperiments and preclinical studies with animal models can foretellthe future, can tell how the candidate drugs will behave in humans.And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.One of the big events of the year just past is the recognition thatsome biotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some willsucceed. We may not know precisely which category any particularventure may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failuremay occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, headydays of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place tolet them cope with uncertainty, and survive.Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can bewishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if itreceives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumedpercentage share of its available market, then a reasonableforecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturingcapacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) inmaking business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past andpresent, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier byconsidering several discernible trends.    Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.Big pharma surrounds itself with drug discovery firms to fulfillits research needs, while biotechnology companies surroundthemselves with contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and lesscommittal than hiring in these functions. Marketing may become thenext function to be outsourced.    Differentiation of the biotechnology industry will become moretransparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercializebiomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical moleculesacting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers ofcandidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers ofactual drug candidates.    The struggle to survive will become more intense. Not only isit getting harder to raise money to sustain research, in view ofcoming cuts in the federal budget, but biotechnology companies willincreasingly be judged on their ability to actually deliverproducts for sale.[Philip Rotheim has published numerous reports and is also theeditor of BCC newsletters Applied Genetic News and StereochemicalTechnology News.]Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CERAMICSLess Hype--andSome Real GrowthOne important aspect of the U.S. advanced ceramics industry now isthat the Ceramics Fever of the early and mid-1980s has gone anda new realization has come among the suppliers of advanced ceramiccomponents. One good example was the hype over ceramic engines,thought to be a reality for the 1990s with the component supplierscompeting for shares of a market which failed to materialize.Another setback to the U.S. advanced ceramics industry has been thedrastic cuts in U.S. military programs.  A good example of this isthe militarys earlier plan to use ceramic armor on land-basedvehicles by the late 1980s.  This has been postponed to a laterdate and in some cases abandoned altogether.BCC has been studying the various advanced ceramics market segmentsfor the last 10 years.  The recession in the early 1990s hadseverely affected certain segments of the advanced ceramicsindustry such as structural ceramics and in a limited way, theceramic coating business.  Electronic ceramics has not been muchaffected by the last fact. The electronics segment has been growingat a faster rate than our own earlier forecast in 1990 and 1992.In a recent study to be published in March 1996 (DCD96, CompleteGuide to the U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry), BCC has attempted toanalyze the overall market potential in the U.S.  BCC has furtherestimated the size of the 1995 and future market potential for thevarious advanced ceramics market segments in the U.S.  The totalvalue of the U.S. advanced ceramic components market for 1995 isestimated to be $5.5 billion.  This will increase to $8.7 billionby the year 2000 with a growth rate of 9.5% from 1995 to 2000.[Thomas Abraham has published reports on new ceramics, industrialdiamonds and diamond films and advanced materials..

For all of 1995, the Blue Chippanel foresees a growth rate of approximately 3.2%.  Economistsestimate the nations long-term growth potential at roughly 2.5%per year.A boom in business fixed investment has accompanied the currentbusiness expansion, but curiously, the underlying factors have notignited residential construction.  Despite some improvement in the3rd quarter of 1995, new home construction has been a relativelyweak component of GDP this year.  Real residential investment fell1.4% in the four quarters ending in quarter three of 1995.  Withsingle-unit housing starts remaining generally weak, residentialconstruction will most likely stay soft.  Housing starts declined1.7% in October, the second consecutive monthly drop.An interesting note, although probably nothing that will takeshape, is that the latest inflation indicators are showingsurprising volatility.  After a four-month gain of only 1.8%, theConsumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated to a 4.0% annualized rate inOctober.The median CPE--a measure of core inflation--slowed to 3.3%,hovering between its year-to-date and five-year rates.Taking a longer perspective, the 12-month change in the CPI and themedian CPI rose to 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.  Both are higherthan 1994 rates, but are still within or below the central tendencyrange projected by the Federal Open Market Committee last July.The Blue Chip forecast paints a far more favorable picture ofexpected inflation.  The November 10 projection shows significantimprovement over forecasts made at the beginning of the year.  InJanuary, over 57% of economists were predicting that inflationwould reach 3.5% of more.  In November, that share fell to lessthan 5%.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MNCs to ChangeBasic StructureThe National Assn. of Business Economists (1233 20th St. NW, Suite505, Washington, DC 20036; Tel: 202/463-6223), forecastsinternational trade as a source of growth for 1996.  Net exportsshould average $116.4 billion, an improvement of $7.5 billion over1995.The largest consumer markets in the world--China, India, and themany countries that comprise the ex-Soviet Union--are in a state offundamental transition, and are potentially very lucrative markets.China, for example, is gradually letting other countries into itsmarkets.  Chinas electronics market has experienced an over 20%average annual growth rate during the 1990s, and is expected toreach $40 billion in semiconductor sales in 1996.  And the marketis far from mature.  Mexico is another tantalizing market,especially for U.S. companies to explore, provided CEOs can stomachthe dips, twists and turns that the Mexican market endures.As the world becomes a truly global marketplace, more risk is goinghand-in-hand with more opportunity.  Multinational corporations(MNCs) and companies looking to do business in foreign countrieswill need to make a switch in their organizations. One way tobetter position the organization is instead of just happening tohave expatriates in various countries around the world, companieswill start reorganizing their management structure to create aculture of international-savvy managers who will help in gettingthe most out of the outstanding economic opportunities that arepresenting themselves in foreign countries. This will make theorganization more flexible, with better understanding and abilityto handle the foreign markets.In the next year, MNCs will probably start to undertake changes inorganization.  After assessing opportunities around the world, andtaking into account technologies such as video conferencing, a flatorganizational structure will take hold. There will be switches toseveral headquarters, instead of one central one in the dominantcountry.  Each region that is economically important will receivean important group of professionals from the headquarters.In the world we will soon see, top management all from the samecountry will be a weakness of a MNC.

The newregulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes exportcontrols on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, therepublics of the former Soviet Union, and certain otherdestinations for civilian end uses.In a statement released to coincide with the start of the newpolicy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernizationof export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needlessand costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  Thesereductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas withmajor growth potential over the next decade."The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of theleast controllable and most widely available high-technologyproducts in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old exportcontrols would have damaged U.S. industry without making anymaterial contribution to U.S. security.Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantialprogress in the reduction of outmoded export licensingrequirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization processto reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate businessopportunities and job creation."In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign sharein the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in thethird quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding theU.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted thecompetitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japanagreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said thatindications pointed to a substantial U.S. share in the increase.Armstrong also added that strong relationships between the U.S.and Japanese industries are being built, which would not have beenpossible without the agreement.  Weir emphasized the SIAs supportfor renewal of the pact, due this year, which is meeting someresistance in Japan.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Managed CareIs Really HereHealthcare delivery in the U.S. and in most countries throughoutthe world will experience significant change in 1996. The challengeof  boards, management and physicians, says Albert W. Herman,partner in charge of the Healthcare Services Group of globalaccounting, tax and advisory firm Arthur Andersen LLP, will be toprovide the right care, at the right time, in the right amount, inthe right way and be able to prove it.Market-based changes continue to challenge physicians, executivesand boards of directors in the healthcare industry.  Mergers,alliances and affiliations among and between providers willcontinue unabated in 1996, and managed care will continue itsmarket penetration across the country, according to Herman.Based on the latest data available, about 18% of the total U.S.population is enrolled in some type of managed care arrangement;about 9% of all Medicare beneficiaries are in a managed care plan,and about 23% of all Medicaid enrollees are in managed care aswell.  These percentages all will show marked increases in 1996.At the same time, the debate and decisions from Capitol Hill, theWhite House, and the state capitals will continue to influenceprovider decision-making as will the initiatives and investigationspursued by regulators such as the Dept. of Justice, InspectorGeneral, FBI, IRS, and the SEC.The managed care market will mature as employers encourage workersto switch to managed care, and as leading managed care groups andmedical groups begin to consolidate.  The momentum for directcontracting between the payer and the care provider will grow in1996, as will enrollee choice of their healthcare providers.Eventually, managed care risk will shift to integrated deliverysystems, purchasers will contract with these systems forcomprehensive services, and capitation will prevail.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Rapid Change InDevice MarketDaphne Allen, assistant editor of Medical Device & DiagnosticIndustry, has analyzed the growth in the number of registeredmedical device manufacturers in the U.S.  Data were obtained fromthe FDAs Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, which is apart of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.During the period between August 1994 and August 1995, the FDArecorded an increase of 1,737 registered medical device companies.Overall, however, the total number of medical device establishmentshas declined by 2%.

Their calculations show that this material, a cubic formof carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressiblethan diamond at room conditions.Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it ishighly possible that the new material could be harder than diamondand therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasivematerial and for wear-resistant coatings.These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , restupon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levelsof speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enableinvestigators to design materials by doing experiments on thecomputer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thusbeginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficientmanner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology offinding new materials.The investigators in the new work are David Teter and RussellHemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center forHigh Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew fromwidespread interest in the possibility of finding new lowcompressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides hadbeen proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceedingdiamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorablecandidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4form to be the most incompressible.Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can besynthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in thelaboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure andtemperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are alreadyworking to accomplish this, employing insights gained from thetheoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material caneventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technologysimilar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbonnitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressureconditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressuresynthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Home Office WorkersAre a Dynamic MarketHome offices have been in existence for years, from the employeeswho are scheduled to work at home, to the after hours workers, andincluding the self-employed home office worker.

This newtechnology brings upon itself many problems, including the effectscience fiction has had on the perception of VR technology as wellas difficulties in defining the technology.  Nonetheless, thereremains a class of technology that can confidently be defined as"virtual reality" and analyzed like any other emerging high techindustry.

"This is by far the highestoperating temperature for an interband transition laser at thiswavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with acompact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenicsystem, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-IIquantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVECand then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing thematerial growth and device design for diode lasers that can producesufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVECscientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laserdesign, which should produce higher-intensity light with lesselectric current while emitting within either of two atmospherictransmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicleand air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covertillumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IRcountermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly inthese windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical processcontrol, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IRsystems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compactIR sources are available.The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at muchshorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micronbeam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible lightranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readilyabsorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmissionwindows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within thewindows are too bulky and expensive for most commercialapplications.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Display Panels Madefrom Plastic WrapU.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to theMassachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screendisplay that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwichedbetween crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  Theresulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whosegeometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved orcylindrical configurations.The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting componentsare integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film toprovide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the filmcontains densely distributed light-emitting elements that areaddressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulkprocessing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap withembedded components completely through the film to permitactivation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised ofa flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossedelectrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emittingelements are dispersed`ig the film and extend from one side of thefilm to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  Thelight-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of theelements to exist at a crossover.The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reductionin registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design canbe used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping andsign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for videodisplays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, andbillboards.Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the timebeing, and that no working models currently exist.  He also saidthat calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up tohundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology mostsuitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleableto even larger sizes.  He is currently assembling a production teamand says the only real problem is the same one faced industry-wide-- blue diodes.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Interactive HolographyWill Be EvaluatedAmerican Propylaea Corp.

James Fischbach, president and CEO,reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 wouldinvolve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.American Propylaea, which developed the worlds first full colorcommercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true colorholographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbachpredicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year businesswithin 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possiblefor automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enablingthem to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, comparedwith the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery andassist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-Dinformation in free space in front of a monitor screen to help themdetect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Low TemperatureGrowth MethodA chemist at Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO63130) has discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystalsat temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is thefirst to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sizedcrystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the newmethod may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc playersand computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguingpossibilities of developing integrated devices consisting ofsemiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combiningother materials with the semiconductors because of the very hightemperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currentlyproduced at temperatures of 500-1,200C, but the method William E.Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associateprofessor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, hasdiscovered allows growth at 200C.  Buhros technique, thesolution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used forsome 30 years.Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by thenonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which donot allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at lowtemperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium andindium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are thesites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indiumphosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-Vsemiconductors) nucleate and grow.Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solidmechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs insolution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited intothe liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizesout as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is toturn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new methodexpands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.Back to Headline List CopyrightINDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Building a New FlatPanel Video ScreenA researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel videoscreen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device mayinclude video advertising displays, television, computers,automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well asportable military maps and wall-sized displays for homeentertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages inbrightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation ofliquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is fundingdevelopment of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen formilitary use.The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat paneldisplays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhavenengineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device anddeveloped the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screenhas several advantages over current technologies.Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and noteasily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current videodisplay technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniaturelaser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the propersector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets oflaminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to displaythe video image."The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offersexceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used incold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze astemperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted todisplay 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.Maintenance is easy and inexpensive, says Veligdan.Back to Headline List WT03-B01-5IA074-000493-B046-245http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/gb07.html 205.156.212.5 19970122013729 text/html 591HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:35:42 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:57 GMTContent-length: 406Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/gb07.html Sample Issue Copyright NONPROFIT INSIGHTS via NewsNet March 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES WT03-B01-6IA074-000493-B047-19http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/gb52.html 205.156.212.5 19970122013743 text/html 25659HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:35:50 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:56 GMTContent-length: 25472Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/gb52.html Sample Issue Copyright PRODUCT SAFETY LETTER via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES *NEWS & ANALYSIS* COMMISSION TO DECIDE ON NEW YORK PETITION ON PLAYGROUNDS (251 words) CRACKING BIKE FRAMES LED TO BROKEN BONES AND RECALL (318 words) BREAKING OFF SMALL PARTS ON TOY TRUCK LEAD TO RECALL (213 words) CPSC TO RECEIVE DATA ON BATTERY ONCE DEEMED FLAWED (159 words) CARPET IRRITANT VERIFICATION SOUGHT VIA MOUSE STUDIES (104 words) OVERHEATED CANDLE HOLDERS THAT CAN SHATTER RECALLED (191 words) SQUEAKER TOYS HELD UP BY CUSTOMS GET RECALLED (185 words) TOO MANY LEAF BLOWER WARRANTEE CLAIMS ALERT RECALL (174 words) RATTLES BY GYMBOREE RECALLED FOR CHOKING HAZARD (178 words) CELLULAR PHONE CHARGERS CAN POSE ELECTRICAL SHOCK (160 words) HONG KONG PASSES NEW CONSUMER SAFETY REGULATIONS (139 words) EXTENDED PETITION PERIOD FOR CHILD RESTRAINT SEATS (142 words) *BRIEFS* CPSC ROLLS ON: With only 39 CPSCers classified as "excepted" from federal (26 words) RECALLS: Makita Lamirada, Calif., had 7,500 Makita Angle grinders and angle (86 words) HEATING PADS: CPSC and Food & Drug Administration warnings on hazards of (33 words) TOY TESTING: Besides testing electrically-operated toys, UL can classify (56 words) BILINGUAL LABELS: UL no longer requires product markings on C-UL certified (28 words) NEW ELECTRICAL STANDARDS: The National Electrical Contractors Assn. has (29 words) RECALLS: Time Magazine runner-up recall of the year was awarded (a (45 words) FIRE EXTINGUISHERS: UL announced the first clean agent portable (20 words) PRODUCT SAFETY RESEARCH: International conference, Feb. 15 to 16, Canberra, (21 words) AEROSOL: Federal Trade Commission repealed rule against quick-freeze (25 words) COSMETICS: Stargazer of London, England is subject of import alert for (50 words) CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Office of Government Ethics has granted extension to (36 words) CPSC MEETINGS: Electrical connectors, 1/10; Bethesda, Md., Bill King, (23 words) CopyrightPRODUCT SAFETY LETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMMISSION TO DECIDE ON NEW YORK PETITION ON PLAYGROUNDSDeciding whether to deny a petition from the New York City Dept. of ConsumerAffairs for a mandatory standard on home playground equipment will be on theCPSC commissioners' agenda for January 1996.

Thetelecommunications bill, which includes the Exonamendment criminalizing the use of indecent language onthe Internet, probably will not be voted on for anotherseveral weeks.  Public interest advocates are trying touse that time to lobby against the Exon amendment.Recent incidents such as the shutdown of access to Usenetgroups by Compuserve at the behest of German prosecutorsmay play in favor of those critical of governmentintervention.  As access advocate Jim Warren noted: "Whenother nations' enforcers choose to inflict theirprejudices and dogmas on the global communications net,perhaps American leaders may finally understand thedanger of what Congress is attempting with its `decency'demands on all private and public speech and expressionif aided by any telecommunications device."Back to Headline List CopyrightACCESS REPORTS/FREEDOM OF INFORMATION via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996Agency Can't Glomarize WhereDisclosure May Be in Public Interest          In a case that places some important restrictions onan agency's ability to categorically deny the existenceof information pertaining to individuals, the D.C.Circuit has ruled that the Customs Service actedimproperly when it told Max Holland of the Nation that itwould neither confirm or deny that it had recordsconcerning offers by H. Ross Perot to help the Servicewith drug interdiction activities.  Circuit Court JudgePat Wald, writing for the court, observed that "althoughReporters Committee and the precedent of this circuitmake clear that FOIA extends only to those records whichreveal something about agency action, the mere fact thatrecords pertain to an individual's activities does notnecessarily qualify them for exemption.  Such records maystill be cloaked with the public interest if theinformation would shed light on agency action."          Wald pointed out that District Court Judge CharlesRichey had erred when he concluded that Holland's requestpertained only to the activities of a private citizen.Wald noted that "as the language of the contested requestindicates, it would be disingenuous to suggest thatappellants are not interested in the actions of Perot.Unlike the private activities in Reporters Committee andthe cases. . .from our own circuit, however, what makesPerot's activities significant is their connection toagency conduct.  Appellants want to find out whetherPerot offered to help a federal agency fulfill itsstatutory duties to interdict drugs, and if so, how thatagency responded to his overtures.  Although Perothimself may be a target of their investigative work,appellants also expressed interest in the `privatizationof government functions,' particularly operations whichare covertly funded.  The district court acknowledged asmuch, in stating that appellants sought to determinewhether `Customs planned to privatize certain componentsof the nation's drug interdiction efforts.'  Theseconcerns are about `agency activity,' not just Perot'sprivate activities.  As such, their disclosure may servethe public's interest in knowing `what their governmentis up to.'"          Because the Nation had identified a public interestin the records, Wald found that Customs' use of a Glomarresponse was inappropriate because it swept too broadly."Because the range of circumstances included in Customs'categorical rule do not `characteristically support' aninference that all material in law enforcement fileswhich names a particular individual is exempt fromdisclosure to third parties, a more particularizedapproach is required."  Wald noted that one alternativewas for Customs to adjust its categorical rule.  "Customsis. . .free to articulate a revised categorical ruleregarding disclosure of law enforcement records if it canidentify more narrowly tailored circumstances under whichthe balance of privacy and public interestcharacteristically tips in the direction of exemption."          The court clarified its earlier decision in SafecardServices v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197 (D.C. Cir. 1991), byreining in its application.   In Safecard Services, thecourt had established a categorical exemption for namesof third parties in law enforcement records unless theinformation was needed to "confirm or refute compellingevidence that the agency is engaged in illegal activity."Wald wrote that "to the extent any information containedin 7(C) investigatory files would reveal the identitiesof individuals who are subjects, witnesses, or informantsin law enforcement investigations, those portions ofresponsive records are categorically exempt fromdisclosure under Safecard.  But we do not read Safecardas permitting an agency to exempt from disclosure all ofthe material in an investigatory record solely on thegrounds that the record includes some information whichidentifies a private citizen or provides that person'sname and address.  Because such a blanket exemption wouldreach far more broadly than is necessary to protect theidentities of individuals mentioned in law enforcementfiles, it would be contrary to FOIA's overall purpose ofdisclosure, and thus is not a permissible reading ofExemption 7(C)."          An individual's privacy expectation could also betempered by their voluntary disclosure of their roledocumented in government files.  Wald noted that "Perothimself has made several public statements indicatingthat he has offered to aid the federal government inhostage rescue and drug interdiction operations.Redaction of Perot's name from any responsive documentsin the [Customs' investigatory] files that involve thesubject matter of those disclosures, if those records arenot otherwise exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C)or other exemptions set forth in [Exemption 7], would notserve any useful purpose in protecting his privacy.Perot's decision to bring information connecting himselfwith such efforts into the public domain differentiateshis privacy interest from the interest of unnamedSafecard witnesses who did not voluntarily divulge theiridentities; these public disclosures effectively waivePerot's right to redaction of his name from documents onevents that he has publicly discussed."          The court also found that Customs' search had beeninadequate.  Although Holland's request asked for recordsindexed or cross-indexed under Perot's name, "it alsoexplicitly seeks information `pertaining to' Perot andinformation regarding offers by Perot to assist Customsin drug interdiction efforts. . . Accordingly,appellants' request should be interpreted to includesubject matter files on topics of interest to appellants,in addition to files indexed under Perot's name orpersonal identifier."  Wald noted that "if we agreed withthe agency's position that appellants sought only thoserecords indexed under Perot's name, we might find thissearch adequate.  But we have construed the scope ofappellants' request more broadly than did Customs, toinclude `subject matter files.'  Customs did not describeits recordkeeping system in sufficient detail to permitus to identify what subject matter files, other thanthose in the Privacy Act System of Records, might holdresponsive information regarding Perot's offers to helpCustoms with its drug interdiction efforts.  In theabsence of this information, the agency's assertions aretoo conclusory to allow de novo review of the adequacy ofits search."  (The Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau andMax Holland v.

National Park Medical Center, anunsuccessful bidder on the contract, claimed that staffmeetings held to develop the bid solicitation violatedthe open meetings requirements of the FOIA.  The courtdisagreed, noting that such meetings were not the typecovered by the statute.  The court also found thatNational Park failed to bring the alleged violation tothe attention of the agency before filing its courtaction.  (National Park Medical Center, Inc. v. ArkansasDepartment of Human Services, No. 95-411, Supreme Courtof Arkansas, Dec. 4, 1995)Illinois          A court of appeals has ruled that a political bodyhas standing to bring a suit under the Open Meetings Act,but that the mayor of the City of Northlake failed tofile his suit against the Board of Education of SchoolDistrict No. 87 within the statutory time limits.  Basedon a series of critical letters between the school boardand the mayor, the school board met in closed session --allegedly to discuss employment matters -- to draft aletter to the mayor in response to his recent letters.Several months later, the mayor sued the school board forimproperly conducting a closed meeting.  On the matter ofstanding, the court observed that "we find no compellingreasons to limit the word `person' [in the Open MeetingsAct] to an individual as opposed to a body politic.Indeed, creating an impediment to the explicit command ofthe statute that actions of public bodies be takenopenly, solely on the basis that a political body is notan individual person, ill serves the intent of thelegislature and frustrates the principles underlying theAct.  The deterrence of official misconduct is no lessimportant simply because it is the office of the mayorwhich challenges the infraction rather than the mayor inhis or her individual capacity."  But the court agreedthat the mayor had missed the 45-day deadline for filingthe suit.  The mayor argued that his suit was covered bya special provision allowing a suit to be filed 45 daysafter the state's attorney discovered the violationbecause he had informed the state's attorney prior tofiling the suit.  The court rejected that claim, notingthat "if, as contemplated by plaintiffs, any person couldfile suit as late as 45 days after the State's Attorney'sdiscovery of a violation the Act, then the 45-daylimitation period from the date of the meeting isrendered superfluous."  The court added that "to allowthat same person to file suit in his or her own namesolely upon notification to the State's Attorney would,no doubt, condone dilatory practices.  In fact, it wouldconfer upon persons other than the State's Attorney theopportunity to delay filing an action ad infinitum bysimply not notifying the State's Attorney of the allegedviolation until some future date."

The court noted that "theapplication seeks information about the researcher, thenature of the proposed or ongoing research project, andprocedures to be employed throughout the project.  Thesole subject matter of the application is a researchproject and related personnel and procedures.  Even inthe narrowest sense, the information sought by theapplication concerns research.  As such, it was notsubject to disclosure under the Public Records Act."(Scott Robinson, M.D. v. Indiana University, etal., No.49A02-9306-CV-253, Court of Appeals of Indiana, SecondDistrict, Dec. 11, 1995)New York          The Court of Appeals has ruled that a list oftextbooks for courses at the State University of New Yorkat Farmingdale are agency records even though they arecreated and maintained by a contractor.  The caseinvolved requests from Encore College Bookstores, acompetitor to the university-subsidized bookstore whichwas run under contract by Barnes & Noble.  Encore hadinitially gotten a copy of the textbook list from theUniversity, but after Barnes & Noble said its businesshad dropped as a result, the University stopped keepinga copy of the list.  The list was compiled by Barnes &Noble, which gathered the information through inquiriesto professors each semester.  Both the trial court and anappellate court had ruled that the lists were not subjectto disclosure because they were not agency records, butthe Court of Appeals disagreed.  It pointed out that thefunction of the Auxiliary Service Corporation, whichoperated the bookstore, was "to supply these essentialservices -- including the campus bookstore -- for SUNY.ASC's acts in discharging this delegated duty, then, areperformed on SUNY's behalf."  Applying this to thecircumstances, the court noted that "because ASC receivesa copy of the booklist compiled by its subcontractor,Barnes & Noble, to ensure that the campus bookstore isadequately maintained, it does so for the benefit ofSUNY, a government agency.  In other words, the booklistinformation is `kept' or `held' by ASC `for an agency'.Thus, the information falls within the unambiguousdefinition of the term `records' under the [Freedom ofInformation Law]."  The University urged the court toapply the more restrictive federal standard, which, asinterpreted, requires custody and control of records.But in rejecting that definition, the Court pointed outthat "to do so would undermine the legislative objectiveto provide maximum disclosure by enabling a governmentagency to insulate its records from public access bydelegating responsibility for creating or maintainingparticular information to a non-governmental entity."However, the court went on to find that the list wasprotected as commercial business information.  It notedthat "the booklist has obvious commercial value to Encoresince it would enable Encore to offer the preciseinventory that its target clientele -- SUNY-Farmingdalestudents -- is required to purchase and that is currentlyoffered by  Barnes & Noble. . .The likelihood of harm toBarnes & Noble is enhanced by the economic windfallconferred upon Encore were it to receive the booklist atthe mere cost of FOIL fees.  The information in thebooklist, accumulated by virtue of the effort and expenseof Barnes & Noble, is also directly available to Encore.Disclosure through FOIL, however, would enable Encore toobtain the requisite information without expending itsresources, thereby reducing its cost of business andplacing Barnes & Noble at a competitive disadvantage."(In the Matter of Encore College Bookstores, Inc. v.Auxiliary Service Corporation of the State University ofNew York at Farmingdale, No. 304, Court of Appeals of NewYork, Dec. 27, 1995)          The Court of Appeals has ruled that litigants whoprevail in exposing egregious violations of the OpenMeetings Law should be awarded attorney's fees as amatter of course.  Ruling in a case in which the Board ofTrustees of the Village of Monticello decided at a closedmeeting to play "musical chairs" with their jobs --rotating various village positions among themselves --and then affirmed their prearranged plan at a subsequentopen meeting, the Court of Appeals explained that "onthis record, denial of a request for attorneys' feeswould constitute an abuse of discretion. . ."  The courtrejected the concept that attorney's fees wereappropriate only for repeated violations of the statute,noting that "it is inconceivable that the Legislature hadonly such recidivist offenders in mind when it vestedtrial judges with the authority to award costs and feesin the first place.  In fact, it is very often thepossibility of recovering costs and attorneys' fees thatgives private citizens like plaintiffs the impetus theyneed to bring meritorious lawsuits to enforce the OpenMeetings Law thus advancing the statutory policy ofkeeping New Yorkers better apprised of the actions oftheir elected officials."  (In the Matter of Victor W.Gordon v. Village of Monticello, Inc., No. 276, Court ofAppeals of New York, Dec. 7, 1995)          An appellate court has ruled that the Department ofTransportation improperly withheld contract proposalseven after the contract had been awarded.  The courtnoted that the winning proposal "did not include anyintra-agency confidential information which would assistin DOT's negotiations."  It added that "once the contractwas awarded, the terms of [the winning bidder's] RFPresponse could no longer be competitively sensitive.  DOTimplicitly recognized the validity of petitioner'smodified request by releasing a redacted version of [thewinning] RFP response."  The court pointed out that thedepartment raised the trade secrets exemption for thefirst time at the appellate level, claiming that it hadno time to do so at the trial court level.  But the courtnoted that "respondents, however, offer no explanationfor why DOT did not raise this exemption when it gave theredacted version to the petitioner.  In our view, DOTshould, at that point, have given an explanation forproviding a limited version. . .Simply, this record doesnot provide any basis to support respondents' positionthat there was no opportunity for them to set forth theargument that there was a trade secret exemption."  (Inthe Matter of Cross-Sound Ferry Services, Inc. v.Department of Transportation, No. 73187, Supreme Court ofNew York, Appellate Division, Third Department, Dec. 7,1995)          An appellate court has ruled that the SaratogaEconomic Development Corporation is not a public agencysubject to the FOIL.

Theappellate court noted that the Saratoga Corporation was"an independent entity formed by private businessmen tofurther their own interests. . .It has never beenfurnished offices at County expense; no County employeehas ever served on its board; it receives some of itsfunding from private individuals and corporations; and itis not subject to most of the financial controls exertedover the [Buffalo Corporation].  Significantly, while theCourt of Appeals found that the BEDC described itself asan `agent' of the City, and that a substantial portion ofits activities consisted of the administration of loanprograms and, concomitantly, the disbursement of funds onbehalf of the City, respondent does none of these things;rather it has simply contracted with the County on a fee-for-service basis, much as any other independent businessentity might."  (In the Matter of Farms First v. SaratogaEconomic Development Corporation, No. 73053, SupremeCourt of New York, Appellate Division, Third Department,Dec. 14, 1995)Ohio          A court of appeals has ruled that drafts of proposedchanges to the collective bargaining sections of the OhioCode which were prepared by or received by the Office ofCollective Bargaining must be disclosed.  The court notedthat there was no exemption for the draft records andrejected the agency's suggestion that it adopt adeliberative process privilege.  The court pointed outthat "even if respondents' public policy arguments mayhave some merit, the legislature expresses Ohio publicrecords law and that statute permits no exemption for apre-decisional or deliberative privilege.  The GeneralAssembly has done all of the balancing needed in publicrecords law; public policy arguments should not sway ourinterpretation."  (State of Ohio ex rel. District 1199,The Health Care and Social Service Union, SEIU, AFL-CIOv. Stephen Gulyassy, Deputy Director, No. 95APD01-26,Court of Appeals of Ohio, Tenth Appellate District,Franklin County, Dec. 12, 1995)Wyoming          After federal courts have largely shut down unionaccess to payrolls of federal projects to be used formonitoring compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, theWyoming Supreme Court has made clear that such recordsare subject to disclosure under state law.  TheDepartment of Transportation argued there was no publicinterest in disclosure, but the court disagreed, notingthat "the [plaintiffs] demonstrate the information can beused to audit WTD's, the [Federal HighwayAdministration's], and contractors' efforts to complyboth with federal requirements for a prevailing wagerate, as well as with Wyoming's parallel statutoryrequirements.  For that reason alone, any countervailinginterest of the workers in their privacy is outweighed bya public interest."  The court rejected the claim thatdisclosure was an invasion of privacy.  It explained that"the argument relies almost entirely on construction ofa federal exemption which is not found in Wyoming'spublic records act.  However, we are persuaded the recordmakes no suggestion that affected employees havecomplained about the potential of such a release, norwould it be likely such complaints, if made, couldovercome the mandate of the public records act to releaseinformation.  This is especially so because the workershave already released their names and addresses to thecontractor, who has in turn released them to the State ofWyoming, who has in turn released that information to thefederal government.  There is no indication in the recordthat if the [plaintiffs] did contact the workers at theirhomes that such would be significantly disruptive oftheir privacy.  The record simply does not provide anybasis for denying release of the contested information."(Wyoming Department of Transportation v. InternationalUnion of Operating Engineers Local Union 800, No. 95-47and No. 95-48, Supreme Court of Wyoming, Dec. 22, 1995)Back to Headline List CopyrightACCESS REPORTS/FREEDOM OF INFORMATION via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996        Ontario Government Proposes Changes to FOI,        Ontario Government Proposes Changes to FOI,                  Privacy Statutes          Ontario entered the world of access and privacy inthe latter 1980s with a carefully constructed statutethat combined access and privacy.  The statute createdthe Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner andwas generally seen as one of the most progressivestatutes of its kind.  While Ontario has had its share ofknotty problems under the statute, the law has generallystood the test of time and the Office of the Informationand Privacy Commissioner has emerged as a leader in itsthoughtful and capable implementation and analysis of thestatute.  But Ontario recently underwent a sweepingchange in political direction and now it seems almostcertain that the Freedom of Information and Protection ofPrivacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information andProtection of Privacy Act will be subjected to majorstructural changes in the name of more efficientgovernment.          An omnibus bill, the centerpiece of the province'snew "Common Sense Revolution," was introduced in thelegislature in late November and was slated for approvalby mid-December, all with very little legislative orpublic debate.  However, after a sit-in by oppositionmembers, public hearings were scheduled.  The legislativecommittee considering the omnibus bill was divided inhalf, with one half dealing solely with healthcareamendments and the other half dealing with everythingelse.          The amendments to the freedom of information andprotection of privacy statutes introduce the concept ofan application fee for the first time.  While the federalAccess to Information Act has always included a $5application fee, the provincial acts have largely treatedsuch fees as barriers to access and have never providedfor them.  However the new fees, which will be set byregulation, will apply not only to general information,but to personal information as well, blurring thedistinction that is made in the federal acts wherepersonal information requests are not subject to anapplication fee.  In another break with tradition, theamendments will also require an application fee forappealing an agency's determination to the Office of theInformation and Privacy Commissioner.  The amendmentswill also increase fees for search time, costs ofpreparing a record for disclosure, and computer and othercosts associated with locating, retrieving, processing,and copying a record; the amendments also provide forshipping costs and any other costs incurred in respondingto a request.          The final significant change will allow agencies torefuse requests that are considered frivolous orvexatious.  While multiple or large-scale requests havesometimes been seen by agencies as frivolous andvexatious, Information and Privacy Commissioner TomWright ruled this past summer directly on the issue as away of setting some guidelines for making suchdeterminations.  While Wright had decided that the issueneeded addressing on its own merits, part of therationale for dealing with the issue was to provideguidance which would result in consistent treatment ofsuch requests.  While Wright realized that one agency'sidea of what constituted a frivolous request could wellbe another requester's idea of a perfectly legitimateinquiry, he carefully restrained his decision to dealwith those instances where the request was a clear abuseof process.  Part of the fear that such determinationscan be made on an agency-by-agency basis is the potentialthat such determinations might be abused for no morelegitimate a reason than that the agency did not want toincur the time or cost involved in responding to arequest.  The new amendment allows a requester whoserequest has been rejected as being frivolous or vexatiousto appeal to the Commissioner; ironically, such appealswill be free.          While many governments, including the U.S.government and many state governments, are in the throesof budget-cutting battles, Ontario is the firstjurisdiction where freedom of information and privacyprotections have been singled out for reductions early inthe game.   On the federal level in the U.S.,implementation of such statutes has often been given lowpriority and agencies struggle with inadequate budgetsand staff, but Congress has not moved to trim them asstatutory rights.  If the current Ontario governmentactually views these potential changes as a way toincrease revenues, experience shows clearly that such agoal is very unlikely.  The nearly certain result of theproposed changes will be to lower the number of requests,which, in turn, may save institutions money if theirworkloads become small enough that staff can be let go ormoved to another office.  The addition of an applicationfee for personal information is likely to impact theprivacy rights of individuals to an even greater extentthan will application fees for information requested bysubject matter.  Not only will individuals pay a fee toaccess their personal information, other related rights,particularly the right of correction or amendment, willbe affected as well.  Since most individuals will notknow if their files are incorrect until they haveactually seen them, corrections will occur only afteraccess is made pursuant to the new fee regulations.Since this aspect of fair information practices is basedon the assumption that individuals are in a position tobe most knowledgeable about the accuracy of theirpersonal information and most concerned about ensuringaccuracy, the entire system is premised on the ability ofindividuals to access their files.  Roadblocksrepresented by fees may undermine that premise.          While access advocates are fond of making theconnection between principles of participatory democracy,freedom of speech and press, and the need for citizenaccess to government information, no court has ever quitemade that leap of faith.  But that doesn't mean theconnection doesn't exist.  When governments take measuresthat denigrate the ability of citizens to inquire abouttheir government for no other reason than to save moneyor make government more "efficient," that government hasput a pricetag on that aspect of democracy.  Such actionsare likely to have two results.  The first is that fewerpeople will participate in the scheme of access anddebate on a societal level will be incrementally moreuninformed.  The other result of fees in such statutes isto further exacerbate the chasm between economic havesand economic have-nots.  Those entities, primarilybusiness, which can easily absorb the fees and realizethat government information is still a bargain in thecommercial market will continue to access governmentinformation and reap the potential benefits.  Those whoare driven by grassroots activism or mere personalcuriosity will begin to drop out of the race or at leastthink twice before plunging ahead with a request.  Ifinformation is truly power, the fostering of divisionsalong economic, class or political lines ultimately hasconsequences that resonate throughout a democraticsociety.Back to Headline List CopyrightACCESS REPORTS/FREEDOM OF INFORMATION via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996          The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the Secret Service          The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the Secret Serviceproperly withheld records concerning the breakup of ameeting of computer hackers at the Pentagon City Mall bymall security under Exemption 7(C) (invasion of privacyconcerning law enforcement records) and Exemption 7(D)(confidential sources). However, it told the SecretService to show that the sources had been promisedconfidentiality.  Although the agency said it routinelytreated source information as confidential, the courtpointed out that "the manner in which an agency`routinely' handles information is not sufficient toestablish an implied assurance of confidentiality as toany particular source."  It then noted that "the Serviceoffered no evidence that a fear of retaliation by hackersis sufficiently widespread to justify an inference thatsources of information relating to computer crimes expecttheir identities and the information they provide to bekept confidential."  The agency was able to establishthat at least one source had explicitly requestedconfidentiality.  Ironically, it wasn't until the D.C.Circuit issued its opinion that the plaintiffs --Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility -- evenknew there was more than one source.   As to 7(C), thecourt took a hardline position that virtually any mentionof an individual in law enforcement records gave rise toa privacy expectation.  CPSR pointed out that "therecords also contain information relating to individualswho attended the meeting of the 2600 Club" and arguedthat "the exemption does not authorize the Service towithhold this information because, it its view, no stigmacould attach to persons who `were engaged in whollylawful activity and were peaceably assembled in a publicplace.'"  But the court disagreed, noting that "even ifwe were to assume that the Service's records contain suchinformation and even if those individuals were notsuspects, their public identification with a meeting thatreportedly attracted the attention of law enforcementofficials would subject them to a degree of interest thatwould impinge upon their privacy.  We conclude, then,that Exemption 7(C) permits the Service to withhold thenames and identifying information of persons appearing inits records so long as their privacy interest in notbeing connected in any way with a criminal investigationoutweighs the public interest in disclosure."  (ComputerProfessionals for Social Responsibility v. United StatesSecret Service, No. 94-5247, U.S. Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit, Jan. 2)          A federal judge in Maine has rejected the rationaleof Dismukes v. Dept. of the Interior and has ruled thatdigitized data maintained by the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration for use in electronic chartingsystems was an agency record subject to disclosure.  NOAAhad argued that it was not obligated to provide thedigitized data because its paper-format charts werealready available and contained the same information.But Judge D. Brock Hornby, wondered why "if the materialsare subject to disclosure in some format (here, the papercharts), then why not in any other format in which theyalso exist?"  He provided the agency's answer: "Expenseand inconvenience to the agency are the obvious answers,"but noted that "Congress seems to have addressed theseconcerns by providing specific measures for costrecovery."  Noting that the Supreme Court in Dept. ofJustice v. Tax Analysts had held that agency records maybe withheld only if they are subject to an exemption,Hornby added that "the paper charts -- information thehuman eye can decode -- and the binary number strings --instructions a computer can decode to generate an imageof a chart on a monitor -- are both agency records.  Theyalso each add information to the underlying raw dataabout depths, shoals, buoy locations, etc., in order tomake the data more easily usable -- by eye, the mind, orthe computer.  Nothing in the FOIA excuses an agency fromdisclosing a particular record because it has disclosedthe content elsewhere in a different format."  (DelormePublishing Company v. National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration of the United States, Department ofCommerce, Civil Action No. 95-94-P-H, U.S. District Courtfor the District of Maine, Dec. 11, 1995)          The Eighth Circuit has ruled that a district courtjudge improperly dismissed Jack Urban's FOIA suit for acopy of a polygraph test he took administered by theKansas Bureau of Investigation and provided to the U.S.Attorney for Kansas.  The lower court dismissed the casebased on the government's claim that it could not findthe record.  The court of appeals noted that "when agovernment agency claims that it does not possess orcontrol a requested document, the agency must show itfully discharged its statutory obligations by `conductinga search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevantdocuments.'  Thus, when the question is whether arequested document exists, or is outside the government'spossession or control, an FOIA action is not moot, anddismissal prior to service will almost never beappropriate."  The court said that the response of theAssistant U.S Attorney for Kansas that he could notlocate the records in the files of the U.S. Attorney'soffice was not adequate.  The court noted that "Urban hasnow spent nearly eighteen months seeking a copy ofseemingly innocuous test results.  His early requests gotno response or a cryptic brush off.  He has never beentold why he is not entitled to the documents.  And hisattempt to invoke, FOIA, a statute intended to fostergreater access to government records, has insteadfostered more paper shuffling and lame excuses."Remanding the case to district court, the court ofappeals noted that "there may be a legitimate reason whyUrban is not entitled to the materials he requests, butnone appears in this record."  (Jack Urban v. UnitedStates of America; Kansas Bureau of Investigation, No.95-2386, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,Dec. 27, 1995)          A federal judge in New York has given the FBI a yearto respond to Wayne Pray's request.  Noting that the FBIhad a backlog of 14,055 cases as of May, 1995, JudgeSidney Stein also indicated that there were at least1,616 requests ahead of Pray's and that the agency wasprocessing requests at the rate of 19 per month.  Notingthat this would mean Pray's request would be completed inseven years, Stein observed that "it seems inconceivablethat defendants would be requesting this Court to stayPray's request for seven years.  Therefore this Court isprepared to assume that defendants' declaration containsa typographical error, that the average of 19 cases permonth is actually 190 cases per month and that defendantsshould therefore be able to comply with Pray's request inapproximately 9 months.  Because of the difficulty inestimating time, this Court will grant defendants' motionfor a stay until December 31, 1996 or until Pray'srequest is responded to, whichever is sooner."  (WaynePray v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Civil Action No.95-0380 (SHS), U.S District Court for the SouthernDistrict of New York, Dec. 27, 1995)          A federal court in New York has accepted amagistrate's recommendation and found that the FBIproperly withheld records concerning the murder of PedroBueno and the whereabouts of the plaintiff's wife and twodaughters.  The only record disclosed to Devernon LeGrand was a letter from the Director of the FBI to theNational Center for Analysis of Violent Crime fieldoffice in New York informing it that a Violent CrimeApprehension Program (VICAP) report had been submittedfor Bueno.  In withholding the report under Exemption7(C) (invasion of privacy concerning law enforcementrecords) and Exemption 7(D) (confidential sources), themagistrate noted that there was no public interest in theVICAP report, but that "the administration of VICAP,which seeks to assist state and local law enforcementagencies in their investigations of unsolved violenthomicides, clearly involves concerns of potentialharassment of personnel and interference with lawenforcement efforts."  As to 7(D), the magistrateobserved that "the VICAP Report for Pedro Bueno wassubmitted by the New York State Police to the FBI undercircumstances which support an inference ofconfidentiality.  It consists of information concerningthe investigation by the New York State Police of thePedro Bueno homicide.  It is reasonable to infer that astate law enforcement agency would not turn over to theFBI all of its investigative information on an unsolvedhomicide if the information were not to be treated asconfidential by the FBI."  (Devernon Le Grand v. FederalBureau of Investigation, Civil Action No. 94-0300, U.S.District Court for the Southern District of New York,Nov. 29, 1995)          Judge Louis Oberdorfer has ruled that the FBIproperly invoked a series of exemptions and conductedadequate searches in most instances in responding to arequest from Jeffrey Steinberg.  However, Oberdorferfound that some searches were inadequate, noting that theCharlotte and New York offices had not justified theirsearch for a Terrorist Photograph Album.  He pointed outthat the agency failed to address Steinberg's contentionthat the album should be searched.  He noted that"plaintiff has identified a particular document, the TPA,that is likely to contain any responsive information thatexists . . .In this case, defendant has failed to meetits burden of showing that its search was reasonable."As for the search of the Richmond office for recordsconcerning the Dan Bar Farm, Oberdorfer noted that theagency had alluded to a resident agent in Radford, VA,who had information about the farm; however, the agencytold the court there was no Radford agent.  But Steinbergproduced a document from an Alexandria agent stating thatan agent under Richmond's supervision had informationabout the farm.  Steinberg suggested the agency contactthe Alexandria agent and find out who the "missing" agentwas.  Although the agency claimed to do so would betantamount to conducting research, Oberdorfer noted that"it is not unreasonable to require defendant to obtain asingle redacted name and make a single phone call toclarify defendant's mistake and discover where responsiverecords, if any, are located."  (Jeffrey Steinberg v.U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Action No. 93-2409-LFO,U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Oct.31, 1995)          Judge Louis Oberdorfer has ruled that the CustomsService search for records responsive to a request fromJeffrey Steinberg was inadequate.  Oberdorfer noted that"although defendant has stated in conclusory terms that[the Treasury Enforcement Communications System] is usedto locate investigative files and is, to its mind,comprehensive, defendant has failed to explain or even tostate, `that no other record system was likely to produceresponsive documents.'"  He pointed out that Steinberghad produced a list of 18 possible systems of recordsthat might have responsive records.  He noted that"plaintiff has shown that it is reasonable to concludethat additional systems exist and that TECS does notinclude these systems.  Plaintiff has shown that it wouldnot be `unduly burdensome' to search these systems, giventhat they are organized alphabetically."  To furtherclarify the search issue, Oberdorfer ordered the agencyto respond to Steinberg's interrogatories.  (JeffreySteinberg v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, CivilAction No. 93-2348-LFO, U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Columbia, Sept. 13, 1995)          A federal court in Chicago has ruled that an FOIAsuit against the Veterans Administration is not moot.After William Johnson filed suit against the VA, theagency disclosed records responsive to his request.However, Johnson continued to contend that it had notprovided all the requested information.  Refusing todismiss the case, Judge Suzanne Conlon noted that "whilethe medical center denies the existence of theinformation in issue, Johnson asserts that hisconversations with the medical center's pharmacy indicateotherwise.  The Seventh Circuit views conflicting claimsas to the existence of documents or information as a formof improper withholding.  Accordingly, the case is notmoot."  (William J. Johnson, Sr. v. VeteransAdministration, Civil Action No. 95 C 4909, U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of Illinois, EasternDivision, Dec. 6, 1995)          A federal judge in Michigan has ruled that the IRSproperly refused to honor a subpoena requiring testimonyof a special agent and production of documents pertinentto an ongoing law enforcement investigation.Acknowledging that he was not dealing with an FOIArequest, Judge Gerald Rosen nevertheless found that FOIAcase law was instructive in reaching a conclusion.Relying on the Sixth Circuit's decision in Dickerson v.Dept. of Justice, 992 F.2d 1426 (6th Cir. 1993), whichupheld the Justice Department's decision to withhold allits files on the Jimmy Hoffa investigation, Rosen notedthat "the level of justification demanded from an agencywhen it refuses to disclose information surely mustdepend on the nature of the materials sought and theirrelation to any ongoing criminal investigations.  Thematerials sought by Plaintiffs go to the very heart ofthe ongoing criminal investigation of the Plaintiffs."He concluded that "the subpoena issued in connection withPlaintiffs' state court action seeks testimony andmaterials that are central to an ongoing IRS criminalinvestigation.  The District Director reasonablydetermined that compliance with this subpoena wouldseriously impair federal tax administration."  (BranchInternational Services, Inc., etal. v. United States ofAmerica and Internal Revenue Service, Civil Action No.94-CV-75003-DT, U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Michigan, Southern Division, Nov. 29, 1995)          A federal court in Minnesota has ruled that SteveNetzman cannot have access to IRS information concerningcharges or penalties filed against Philip French.  Thecourt found that the records were "tax information"covered by Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code.The judge noted that the Haskell Amendment -- which"precludes from exemption data in a form which cannot beassociated with, or otherwise identify, directly orindirectly, a particular taxpayer -- was the onlyexception to non-disclosure under 6103.  He pointed outthat the records Netzman was requesting consisted of"information which relates directly to a particularindividual and, therefore, is not subject to the HaskellAmendment."  (Steve Netzman v. Internal Revenue Service,Civil Action No. 3-95-248, U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Minnesota, Third Division, Nov. 21, 1995)          A federal judge in New Hampshire has ruled that theIRS properly withheld records from Terrence Bennett.Judge Paul Barbadoro pointed out that "the documentsrefer to information exchanged pursuant to a tax treaty.The Service reasonably concluded that the disclosure ofsuch documents would chill future cooperation withforeign government treaty partners.  Therefore, it isentitled to withhold the documents on the ground thattheir disclosure would seriously impair federal taxadministration."  (Terrence M. Bennett v. InternalRevenue Service, Civil Action No. 95-73-B, U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of New Hampshire, Nov. 8, 1995)          A federal court in California has ruled that data onwhich the Department of Health and Human Services reliedto show that the Loma Linda Community Hospital had over-represented the number of Medicare patients it servedshould not have been withheld based on the Privacy Act.The Department claimed that only 14.77 percent of LomaLinda's Medicare patients qualified as low-income.  Todefend itself against the charges, Loma Linda requestedaccess to the underlying data, claiming that itsdisclosure would be a routine use under the Privacy Act.The court found that Loma Linda was entitled to see thedata because it had already had access to theconfidential information contained in it in order to makeits own calculations under the state Medi-Cal program.The court noted that "the policy underlying the PrivacyAct of protecting confidential information fromdisclosure is not implicated in this particular factualsituation.  Even if release of the data relied upon bythe [Health Care Financing Administration] in making itscalculation had unexpectedly included information notalready known to Loma Linda, a confidentiality ordercould have been imposed to protect the privacy interestsin issue."

"Ithink we've made our point," Dole told reporters, saying theHouse and Senate should pass a "clean" CR lasting up to a weekand a half, while budget negotiations continue. "There are nottoo many wealthy people working for the federal government," Dolesaid, referring to employees who are not being paid. He said healso is concerned that without immediate legislation, various"expiring provisions" of federal law will prohibit some statesfrom providing certain services. He said, for example, somestates may not be able to send out unemployment checks.      Dole said he would discuss the CR proposal with HouseSpeaker Gingrich later today. Meanwhile, Senate Minority LeaderDaschle said this afternoon Democrats would again attempt tooffer a clean CR in the Senate later today and that given Dole'ssupport, he hoped Gingrich would go along with the proposal. ButHouse members are likely to stick to their position that a CRshould only be passed as part of an overall budget deal, HouseAppropriations Chairman Livingston told CongressDaily. "Ihonestly don't believe that a straight CR would pass over here,"he said, adding that he sympathizes with Dole's position. "I wantto get the government going," he said. A House Republicanleadership aide said, "The last time we gave [President Clinton]a CR, he didn't even come to the table for a month, so it doesn'tgive us much incentive to do it again."      The aide said tonight's White House budget meeting isexpected to be the first time the negotiators try to resolve thelarger issues. "We'll see how serious they are," the aide said,adding that decisions on whether the House tries to overridepresidential vetoes of the Commerce-Justice-State, VA-HUD andInterior appropriations bills depends -- in part -- on whetherthe Clinton administration bargains in good faith. Livingstonagreed, saying, "The shape and content of the discussion willhave great bearing on what we do over the next few days." Clintonearly today met for two hours with his budget advisers to discussstrategy for today's negotiating sessions, which could go lateinto the evening, Press Secretary Michael McCurry said. Whenasked if the president would support a CR that sends all federalemployees back to work without pay, McCurry said, "It's betterthan nothing, but not much better than nothing."      On a related front, the administration has barely startedto piece together the FY97 budget the president is supposed topresent to Congress by Feb. 5 because the final form of the FY96budget is unknown. An administration official said the presidentnormally would be making final decisions on the FY97 budget thistime of the year if an FY96 budget were in place. Administrationbudget officials need to know final figures for FY96appropriations and any planned changes in entitlement spendingformulas before they can craft a new budget, the official said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996GOP Leaders To Meet Wed. On Proposed Telco Changes      At a joint House and Senate leadership meeting scheduledfor Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Dole and HouseSpeaker Gingrich are expected to try to iron out a finalcompromise on four or five outstanding issues intelecommunications reform legislation, sources said today. Theissues include foreign ownership, price regulation, and broadcastownership. Spectrum sales, an issue Dole brought up again lastweek, may also be raised, sources said. Optimistically, if theleadership can settle these issues, the telecommunicationsconference agreement could go to the House floor Thursday. Itcould then be brought to a vote in the Senate on Friday or earlynext week, sources said, while cautioning, "But we've all heardthat before."      The most recent version of an agreement put together by thefour conference leaders dropped a provision that would haverelaxed foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. communicationsfirms. House Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials SubcommitteeChairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, is working to reinstate theprovision, strongly opposed by Senate Commerce ranking memberErnest Hollings, D-S.C. The regional Bell operating companieshave sought "price regulation" of their services to replace thecurrent system of "rate of return" regulation, which caps theamount of profits the RBOCs can earn. Also, some conferees wantto loosen broadcast ownership restrictions for the number ofproperties held by one owner. And Dole has sought to chargebroadcasters for the purchase of spectrum as a revenue raiser.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996House Panels Seeking Superfund Financing Alternatives      With a rebate to private parties for Superfund cleanups atarget of fierce political attacks, the House Commerce andTransportation and Infrastructure panels are seeking alternativesfor financing the program, panel sources said. Among theproposals are further exemptions from liability for new classesof Superfund sites, a Transportation and Infrastructure sourceadded. Transportation and Infrastructure Water Resources andEnvironment Subcommittee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., lastmonth said the rebate -- called the retroactive liabilitydiscount -- will be dropped from the Superfund reform legislationhe is sponsoring with Commerce Trade and Hazardous MaterialsSubcommittee Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. "There is generalagreement that it won't survive," Boehlert said.      Democrats and environmental groups derided the RLD plan asa "pay-the-polluter" giveaway and a costly new entitlement.Boehlert said Democrats were able to target the RLD to portraythe Superfund legislation as an attack on the environment. Asapproved by Oxley's subcommittee in November, the RLD would cover50 percent of the cleanup cost at Superfund sites and would bepaid out of the Superfund trust fund. Bill sponsors proposed theRLD as an alternative to exempting from cleanup liabilityaltogether sites polluted before the Superfund law went intoeffect in 1980. Oxley said repealing retroactive liability wouldbe too expensive, and that the RLD would reduce liabilitylitigation and get more money into cleanups.      To replace the RLD, the committees are consideringexempting more multi-party sites from cleanup liability, theTransportation source said. Cleanup would be financed directlyfrom the Superfund trust fund. The source contended adding newexemptions for multi-party sites to the current plan would reducelitigation costs and increase money going to cleanup by one-thirdto one-half over the amount spent under current law. The billalready would exempt municipal landfills and private oilrecycling facilities.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996Sources: Osprey Exhibits Problems During Shock Tests      The Navy's troubled efforts to improve its historicallyweak ability to counter anti-ship mines suffered another setbackrecently, when the first of a new type of mine-hunting ships cameunglued during simulated combat tests. During explosive shocktrials in late October, some of the interior bulkheads andequipment platforms and decking of the coastal mine hunter Ospreybecame separated from the ship's hull, according to sourcesfamiliar with the tests. The problem appears to be a failure ofthe bonding that is supposed to hold together the interiorstructures and the hull, all of which are made of a specialplastic material, the sources said. One source said the problemsrevealed in the Osprey could require extensive modifications thatalso would have to be retrofitted, at additional cost, to the 11other ships in the class, all of which are completed or nearlyfinished.      The damage to the Osprey is just the latest problem with aproject that ran years behind schedule and well above expectedcost. And it continues a rash of difficulties plaguing the Navy'sentire program to eliminate a war-fighting weakness thathandicapped operations in the Persian Gulf. Capt. GordonPeterson, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that the Osprey experiencedsome damage during the trials but declined to specify howextensive it was, citing security concerns. Peterson noted somedamage is expected during shock trials and said that "the shipmaintained the ability to maneuver, navigate and perform its warfighting missions" at the completion of the tests. But one sourcesaid he was told "they suffered significantly more damage thanthey expected."      Another source said the test was stopped after fiveexplosions, instead of the planned six shots, and repairs had tobe made between the fourth and fifth explosions. Petersonconfirmed repairs were made and the test cut short, explainingthat Navy experts decided "sufficient data was obtained" in fiveshots. A government source said the Navy now is struggling overhow to correct the problems revealed in the shock trials.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996House, Senate Schedule For This Week      Both the House and Senate will adjourn momentarily at noonWednesday to fulfill the constitutional requirement of ending thefirst session of the 104th Congress Jan. 3.

At a meeting last week of HouseBanking and Budget committee staff, Banking aides did not opposea revenue-raising provision that would require federal regulatorsto collect fees for their examinations of state-chartered banks,sources said. Staff took a more "objective" stance, saying thecommittee "has never approved of a position" to collect the fees,according to a source. In contrast, on the issue of whether toraise the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration loans, "staffdoes not recommend this as an option," one source said. Statebanks already pay examination fees to state regulators, andBanking Chairman Leach wrote to the Budget Committee last monthurging budget negotiators not to accept the fee provision,included in the administration's budget proposal.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996Union Asks Congress To Contribute Pay To Furloughed Workers      The National Treasury Employees Union is asking members ofCongress to donate pay they receive during the partial governmentshutdown to furloughed federal workers through the FederalEmployee Education and Assistance Fund. In a letter to CongressFriday, the NTEU called it an "outrage" that Congress, "whocaused this shutdown crisis by not passing the necessaryappropriations bills on time, have been on vacation for theholiday and will receive no reduction in pay due to thefurlough." The union also said it will file a temporaryrestraining order with a federal court asking that the lawrequiring federal employees to work without pay be declaredunconstitutional. Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C., offeredSaturday to make available about $10,000 a month from his own payfor emergency, no-interest loans to furloughed federal workers,the Associated Press reported. "I know I can't help everyone, butat least I can get some people through the crisis times," Taylorsaid.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996Gingrich Admits Mistakes In First Year As Speaker      Looking back at his first year as speaker of the House andleader of the Republican revolution, House Speaker Gingrichacknowledged Saturday that he has made some mistakes and will tryto correct them by confining himself to doing only his job. Thejump from back bench bomb-thrower to key policy decision-makercaused some errors of inexperience, Gingrich said. "Nobody couldgo from being minority whip of the House to the speaker of theHouse in one jump and go from being in the opposition party toworking with [Senate Majority Leader] Dole and being really thedominant agenda-setting force in the country [...] and not makemistakes," Gingrich said on CNN's "Evans and Novak."      Among the errors Gingrich noted was linking his treatmenton Air Force One to taking a hard line with President Clinton onshutting down the government. "There's no question that there aretimes, as I've described it, where it's like throwing aninterception straight into the other team's defense. And onseveral occasions, and that's one, I did things that weren'tright," Gingrich said. The controversy surrounding his originalacceptance of a $4.5 million book advance also could have beenavoided, he added, by taking advice from people "who understoodbeing a national figure in the way I frankly didn't understand."      Gingrich said a major way of avoiding self-inflicted woundsthis year will be to keep to his job as speaker and stopfreelancing as social commentator. Several times in the last yearand a half Gingrich has linked breaking news stories -- likeSusan Smith's murder of her two children in South Carolina -- toa breakdown of civilization caused by liberal policies. "Youknow, I'm speaker of the House. I'm not an assistant professor ofhistory. I'm not an analyst. I'm not a commentator. And I thinkat times I've tried to play other roles, and it's almost alwaysbeen wrong," Gingrich said. "I've got to be the speaker of theHouse and leader of the House Republican Party and stay insidethat particular box to be effective." Gingrich, however, has saiddebate and teaching are the only ways to achieve the broadcultural goals of conservatives.      Gingrich also attributed his low poll ratings to how he iscovered by the media. "If I were the person who was seeing seven-second sound bites, I wouldn't like me either," he said. But headded that over time, "as people see more of what we're reallydoing [...] my ratings will go up." Gingrich also made somethingof a New Year's resolution to engage more with individualreporters and editors in an effort to improve the Republicanrevolution. "I'm going to work harder at interacting withindividual editors and reporters to see if we can't get our storythrough if by no other means than just embarrassing them intobeing professional," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996Washington Pundits   Some observations by Washington experts and pundits on theongoing budget battle, as quoted late last week by Reuters:    "Everyone thought Congress wouldn't leave town for Christmaswith the government shut down because it would look terrible.

President Clinton and Hill leaders met fromabout 6:15 p.m. (EST) to 9:15 p.m. (EST) Tuesday at the WhiteHouse, but did not announce any new agreements on the budget or aCR afterward. Instead, the participants, continuing their effortsto keep the budget negotiations behind closed doors, left withouttalking to reporters and issued a one-sentence joint statementsaid to have been authored by Vice President Gore. The statementdeclared, "Our talks continue to make constructive progress andwe will reconvene tomorrow at 1:30 p.m."      White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry said today'smeeting would be at the White House. Among the participants inthe meeting with Clinton Tuesday night were House SpeakerGingrich, Senate Majority Leader Dole, Senate Minority LeaderDaschle, House Majority Leader Armey, House Minority LeaderGephardt, Gore and White House Chief of Staff Panetta. Afterspending 90 minutes in the Oval Office, the negotiators moved tothe White House residence to continue talks over a dinner ofpasta and shrimp. Meawhile, the Senate earlier Tuesday eveningapproved a "clean" continuing resolution that simply extends thenow-expired CR until Jan. 12. Dole appeared on the Senate floor,shortly after meeting in the afternoon (EST) with House andSenate Republican leaders for more than two hours, to makeseveral unanimous consent requests, including one to pass the newCR. Most programs would be funded at the lowest of House, Senateor FY95 funding levels. Technically, the CR was added tolegislation that would provide most favored nation status toBulgaria.      In a floor statement, Dole declared, "People have been gonefrom their jobs long enough."      He said while some House Republicans want to refuse to passa new CR until a budget deal is set, "I don't quite understandthe logic in all that." And Dole said federal employees "want towork," adding: "They're caught in the middle. They're pawns [...]If there's any point to be made, it should have been made bynow."      While Gingrich refused to consider the possibility of a newCR until he saw how Tuesday night's budget talks progressed, Doledenied there was a split between himself and the speaker, butagreed "there are some differences" between House and SenateRepublicans on "how we should proceed."      Asked later if he was trying to pressure the House to passthe CR, Dole said: "Me? No."      Gingrich speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill declinedto discuss the Senate action Tuesday evening, saying, "I don'thave any comment." And Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley termedthe Senate action as "a tactical judgment for the Senate."      Talking with reporters in the Oval Office later Tuesdaybefore the meeting with Clinton, Gingrich said, "Our members willbe back by noon (EST) tomorrow, and we hope to meet with all ofthem and brief them on tonight's meeting and whatever happenstomorrow morning, and maybe get something done during the daytomorrow." "I think if we can both get movement on the balancedbudget and get the government back to work, and paid for, thatreally would be a good step in the right direction," Gingrichadded.      House Budget Chairman Kasich said it is "very unlikely" theHouse would pass a CR until a budget deal is set, adding, "We seeall this as being connected to balancing the budget."      Anticipating that the House may refuse to consider the newcontinuing resolution, the Senate, by unanimous consent Tuesday,also amended and passed separate House legislation that wouldbring federal employees back to work without pay, but with theguarantee they would eventually be paid.      The legislation in effect declares all federal employees"essential."      In addition, the Senate amended the legislation to providetargeted funding to several programs, which Dole said could notcontinue without the funding.      Those programs include the federal Meals on Wheels programfor the elderly, child protection services, unemploymentcompensation for 11 states, passport offices, programs for nativeAmericans, certain veterans programs and national parks.      The Senate also deleted a House provision that wouldrequire the Senate to consider any budget deal on an expeditedbasis. However, Dole also requested, and received, unanimousconsent that if Daschle agrees at the time, any budget deal beconsidered as budget reconciliation legislation and be subject tothe same limits. Those limits would prohibit a filibuster andlimit debate to a maximum of 20 hours. "That would speed up theprocess considerably," Dole said. Because the Senate amended theHouse-passed "essential" employees proposal, it apparently wouldhave to be reconsidered by the House before it would be sent toClinton.      Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Tuesday applauded Dole's effortsto reopen the federal government, saying, "This is a major stepforward."      In addition, Senate Budget Chairman Domenici, commenting onthe CR said: "I think it's time we do this [...] Most federalemployees are saying they'd like to work to be paid [...] I hopethe House gives serious consideration to this."      On another front, as public officials continue to feel theheat from their constituents over the government shutdown, Rep.Martin Hoke, R-Ohio, Tuesday announced he donated his $11,133congressional pay for the month of December to 28 northeast Ohiocharities. Hoke in a statement called his decision a "matter ofconscience."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY A.M. via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996Oxley Wants To Head House Commerce Telco Panel      There seems to be some dissension in the GOP over who willchair the House Commerce Telecommunications and FinanceSubcommittee in the next Congress. Last week, newly convertedRepublican Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana, in announcinghe will not run for the open Senate seat in his state this year,also reportedly said he is the anointed chairman-in-waiting forthe subcommittee after its current chairman, Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, retires later this year. But sources Tuesday said Tauzin'snews came as a surprise to the panel's current second-rankingRepublican, Rep. Michael Oxley of Ohio. "Mr. Oxley intends to bethe next chair of the telecommunications subcommittee," saidPeggy Peterson, his spokeswoman, adding, "He is currently thevice chairman, and he is pursuing the chairmanship."      Tauzin last week told reporters Speaker Gingrich promisedhim the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee chairmanshipin the next Congress. When he switched parties, the Republicanleadership agreed to retain Tauzin's seniority in the House.Tauzin said he would not usurp a "sitting" chairman. In his ninthcongressional term, Tauzin has four years on Oxley and two yearson Commerce Chairman Bliley.      Asked if Oxley had discussed the matter with Gingrich,Peterson had no comment. However, she said: "Mr. Oxley does notthink that Republicans are the party of seniority. Seniority isonly one factor in picking a chair."      Ever since Tauzin made his remarks, sources on and offCapitol Hill have speculated about whether the reports wereaccurate and, if so, why the speaker would make such a deal.      Some close to the matter said Gingrich hoped Tauzin's plumspot would lure other senior Democrats over to the GOP, andstrengthen the Republican position in the House.      The speaker's office did not return several inquiries fromCongressDaily Tuesday.      Technically, under House Rule 19, the speaker does notappoint subcommittee chairmen, staff noted. The chairman of thefull committee proposes a leadership slate that must be ratifiedby the majority members of the committee, they said. The HouseCommerce Committee spokesman had no comment on the matter.      Oxley intends to file for re-election in his districtFriday, according to his staff.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY A.M. via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996Roberts Seems Reluctant To Extend Food Aid Programs   House Agriculture Chairman Roberts appears to be resistingwriting an extension of authority for the Food for Peace and Foodfor Progress programs, which provide food to poor countries,including war-torn Bosnia.      Authority for the two food programs expired Dec. 31, alongwith the rest of the 1990 farm bill. The vetoed GOP budgetreconciliation bill would have reauthorized agriculturalprograms, including the international food assistance programs,but the reauthorization has been tied up in the ongoing budgetnegotiations.      A Roberts spokeswoman Tuesday said the Clintonadministration has not "conveyed to us that there is a particularproblem" regarding the two food programs, adding, "Our effort isstrictly working on the balanced budget."      But a farm organization lobbyist speculated the underlyingreason probably is that Roberts does not want to break out anypieces of the farm bill reauthorization that are contained in thebudget reconciliation bill.      Agency for International Development Administrator BrianAtwood, Agriculture Secretary Glickman and House InternationalRelations Chairman Gilman have been pushing Roberts to extend theprogram since mid-December, when it became apparent no budgetagreement would be reached before the 1990 farm bill expired.      Atwood and Glickman both wrote Roberts and other Hillofficials Dec. 13 asking for an extension, and Gilman planned tointroduce it before Christmas. However, Roberts insisted onobtaining another letter from Glickman explaining the situationwas an emergency. The second Glickman letter was held up forclearance at the White House, but arrived at the HouseAgriculture Committee Tuesday morning.      The letter states that "any lapse in authority couldseriously undermine the ability of the United States to meet theneeds, particularly emergency needs of vulnerable populations,and to augment food supplies in food-deficit countries."      Nevertheless, Agriculture Committee staff director GaryMitchell Tuesday through a spokeswoman said the letter was notspecific enough to require action.      Commenting on the turn of events, a House InternationalRelations Committee staffer Tuesday said: "We felt that there wasso much agreement to go ahead and do this anyway that therewasn't a need to go through the specific contracts. We're talkingabout a program to feed starving people. If they need specifics,we'll get specifics."      In addition, Atwood told CongressDaily he does not thinkRoberts needs more specifics to act. "I think a request by DanGlickman and me citing that OMB has no objections is clarityenough. We really need the clear support of Congress and needtheir authorization to deliver food in emergency circumstances,"Atwood said. Atwood said he had a good relationship with Robertsand believes Roberts "is thinking about this not in partisan butlegislative, tactical terms. I think the approach he is taking isa risky one and I hope that he would reconsider."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY A.M. via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996A Third Of Calif. Delegation In Play As Filing Closes     Filing for the March 26 California primary closed lateFriday, and while there will be no megabucks Senate race in theGolden State this year, there will be competitive races in atleast a third of the state's 52-member House delegation.      The California congressional elections this year arecomplicated by several minor party candidates who are largelyconservative and could draw enough votes away from Republicans toaffect some close races.      This is the first year the Natural Law Party and RossPerot's Reform Party have qualified as official parties, whilethe Libertarian Party has fielded candidates in the past.      For example, Libertarian candidate Ross Crain took 4percent of the vote against Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio in 1994 and9 percent against Fazio in 1992; Fazio won only 50 percent of thevote in 1994, and 51 percent in 1992, while the GOP nominees andCrain divided the conservative vote in the Sacramento area seat.      As a chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Fazio is oneof the GOP's top House targets this year. But Republicans couldencounter a bitter primary battle for the right to oppose Faziobetween 1994 nominee Tim LeFever, a conservative, and Espartoschool board member Charles Schaupp, a moderate.      The LeFever-Schaupp ideological battle has split GOPcentral committees in two of the district's counties, resultingin attempts to remove people from those panels.      While Fazio is the GOP's most prominent California target,his is but one of up to eight Democratic-held seats being eyed bythe Republicans.      In the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, whereDemocratic Rep. Anthony Beilenson is retiring, Richard Sybert, aformer aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, is expected to emerge as thewinner of a three-way GOP primary.      Sybert, who owns a toy manufacturing company and can tapinto his family fortune, spent $1.6 million in 1994 to win 48percent against Beilenson.      Leading a field of five Democrats is Brad Sherman, who hastwice won elections to represent the Los Angeles area on thestate's four-member tax board. Sherman also has family wealth onwhich to rely.      On the southern side of the Los Angeles area, DemocraticRep. Jane Harman faces the prospect of a rematch against 1994 GOPnominee Susan Brooks, who lost to Harman by a mere 812 votes.After the election, Brooks pursued a legal challenge claimingelection irregularities, including that illegal aliens voted.      Torrance businessman and physician Irwin Savodnik has filedto challenge Brooks in the primary.      Another prime GOP target is Democratic Rep. George Brown,ranking member of the Science Committee, who edged GOP candidateRobert Guzman by just 51-49 in 1994. Guzman is again seeking theGOP nod, but so are four other candidates. Widely regarded as thefront-runner in the primary is Linda Wilde, a state SuperiorCourt judge who has taken a leave of absence to run.      Included in the next tier of GOP targets are twoconservative Democrats from the state's Central Valley, Reps.Gary Condit and Calvin Dooley, as well as two northern Californialiberals, Reps. Sam Farr and Anna Eshoo.      Three Republicans have signed up to challenge Farr, whoholds White House Chief of Staff Panetta's former House seat. Thewould-be nominees against Farr, who won just 52 percent in 1994,include Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau Director Jess Brown.      Eshoo appears more secure: She was re-elected with 61percent in a difficult year for Democrats. Her 1994 opponent, BenBrink, is one of two candidates seeking the GOP nod this year.      Challenging Condit, a leader of The Coalition, will beRepublican Bill Conrad, a general contractor who has never heldelective office. Condit won his 1994 race by a 2-1 margin,although GOP nominees for governor and senator won the district.      Three Republicans are contending for the right to opposeDooley, who won 57 percent in 1994. The GOP front-runner isAssemblyman Trice Harvey, who reportedly did not want to runagainst Dooley, but opted to do so because the state's termlimits law is forcing him out of the California Assembly.      At the southern end of the state, Republicans also thinkthey may have a shot against San Diego-based Rep. Robert Filner.While three Republicans have filed for the nomination, localobservers feel Filner is in greater jeopardy in the Democraticprimary.      San Diego Councilman Juan Vargas, a Democrat who lost toFilner in a crowded primary in 1992, is running again. Vargas'assets include a Harvard degree and a Hispanic background in adistrict that is 40 percent Hispanic.      For the Democrats, the targets include three GOP freshmen:Reps. Frank Riggs, Andrea Seastrand, and Brian Bilbray.      Riggs, who represents a district that stretches from northof San Francisco to the Oregon border, first won the seat in1990, lost it in 1992, and regained it in 1994. Former DemocraticRep. Dan Hamburg, who lost to Riggs last time out, opted not torun again this year.      There are a half-dozen contenders in the Democratic primaryfor Riggs' seat, with the three leading contenders including tworecent immigrants from San Francisco. They are Carol Ruth Silver,a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors whomoved into the district last year, and Michela Alioto, a daughterof former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and, until recently,an aide to Vice President Gore.      The third major contender is attorney Monica Marvin. She isbacked by state Sen. Mike Thompson, who was the Democrats' firstchoice to take on Riggs.      In the Santa Barbara area, Seastrand will face a rematchagainst Democrat Walter Holden Capps, whom she defeated by just1,500 votes in 1994. And in San Diego, three Democrats are vyingto take on Bilbray. But Democratic prospects there received asetback just days before the filing deadline when former Rep.Lynn Schenk, who lost to Bilbray in 1994, announced she would notrun again.      The leading contender in the three-way Democratic primaryis University of California at Irvine professor Peter Navarro,who hosts a local talk show. But Navarro carries politicalbaggage from unsuccessful runs for supervisor and mayor. Alsorunning is small business owner Nancy Casady, who has ties tosome leading state Democrats.      The Democrats also are eyeing the open seat of retiring GOPRep. Carlos Moorhead in the Los Angeles area and the Long Beach-based district of GOP Rep. Stephen Horn.      Two Democrats have filed to take on Horn: 1994 primarycandidate and professor Peter Matthews, and attorney Rick Zbur.Horn won in 1994 with 58 percent, but won with only 49 percent in1992.      Assemblyman James Rogan is the leading GOP contender forMoorhead's seat, while the Democrats will have tough primarybattle between Douglas Kahn, a wealthy businessman who wasMoorhead's 1992 and 1994 opponent, and Barry Gordon, an actor andformer president of the Screen Actors Guild.      In the second tier of Democratic targets are GOP Reps.Richard Pombo and Sonny Bono. Pombo likely will face DemocratJason Silva, a public relations consultant, in the Stockton areaseat. Former radio personality and retired businesswoman AnitaRufus has filed for the Democratic nod against Bono in the PalmSprings-based district. Meawhile, 10 Democrats have entered thespecial election to succeed Democratic Rep. Walter Tucker, whoresigned last month following his conviction on federal briberyand tax evasion charges.      The special primary will coincide with the March 26primary. If no candidate for the open seat receives more than 50percent, a runoff will be held. The Los Angeles area district isthree-quarters black and Hispanic and is overwhelminglyDemocratic.      The leading Democrats in the race include Assembly membersWillard Murray and Juanita McDonald, Lynwood Mayor Paul Richards,Compton Mayor Omar Bradley and Compton City Clerk Charles Davis,as well as Tucker's wife, Robin, who has operated a youthtraining center.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONGRESS DAILY A.M. via NewsNetJanuary 3, 199681 Republicans Oppose Deal That Trims $245B Tax Cut      A group of 81 Republican senators and House members, aswell as one House Democrat, has sent a letter to PresidentClinton, House Speaker Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Dolevowing to oppose any final budget deal that has less than the$245 billion in tax cuts contained in the budget reconciliationbill vetoed by Clinton. "We urge you to support a plan thatprovides real tax relief for families and economic growth forsmall businesses and that balances the budget in seven years; wealso urge you to reject any plan that does not," said the letter,which was initiated by Rep.

Chite, Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division.18 pages.  Farmer participation in the federally subsidized cropinsurance program has fallen short of goals anticipated in 1980 whenthe program was greatly expanded.  Low participation rates havecontributed to the enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance bills,which have authorized more than $6 billion in additional directpayments since 1988. Many policymakers are concerned that the federalbudget cannot continue to support both crop insurance and disasterpayments, and that Congress might be required to reconsider theproper role of the government in farm risk management.

As Congressdebates alternative tax plans in 1992, one question it is consideringis the fate of 12 temporary tax provisions that are scheduled toexpire at the end of June 1992.  In each case, the immediate issue iswhether to let the particular provision expire, or to extend it ormake it permanent.  And while each of the so-called "extenders" isunique, at a very general level they all pose a similar questions:each extender is a tax benefit for a particular activity, and eachresults in a loss of tax revenue.

Duke, a Yale University Law Professor;Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Kurt Schmoke, Mayor ofBaltimore; Thomas Szasz a Psychiatrist at Syracuse University, and RobertW. Sweet, a federal judge in New York.Buckley writes in the lead article that the war on drugs "is divertingintelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, thatit is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, andpenal procedures associated with police states." He said that the series ofarticles in National Review was designed to mobilize "fresh thought on thedrug problem." However, prominent law enforcement and political leadersfrom both major political parties sharply condemned the magazine.DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine said that legalization would be adisaster and that "As a citizen, I'm appalled at adding one more social ill to a country that already has AIDS and murders."Former Drug Czar and Education Secretary William Bennett said that"National Review's position on drug legalization is bankrupt morally,intellectually and, thank god, politically."In his National Review article Ethan Nadelmann said the "drugenforcement/treatment complex" is so "hooked on government dollars thatthe anti-drug crusade has become a vested interest." Nadelmann also hadharsh words for DEA's "ideologically driven bureaucrats who intimidateand persecute doctors for prescribing pain medication in medicallyappropriate doses, who hobble methadone programs with theiroverregulation, who acknowledge that law enforcement cannot alone solvethe drug problem but then proceed to undermine innovative public healthinitiatives."Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke recommended that the war on drugs befought as a "public-health war." Under this system, he explains, thegovernment would set up a regulatory regime to "pull addicts into thepublic-health system. The Government, not criminal traffickers, wouldcontrol the price, distribution, and purity of addictive substances-which italready does with prescription drugs. This would take most of the profit outof drug trafficking, and it is the profits which drive the crime," saysSchmoke.He also recommended an expansion of needle exchange programs andcalled the war on drugs "our domestic Vietnam."Joseph McNamara, Former police chief (in Kansas City, Mo., and San JoseCa.) said the "military industrial complex pales in comparison to the host ofindustries catering to our national puritanical hypocrisy-researchers willingto tell the government what it wants to hear, prison builders, correction andparole officers's associations, drug testing companies, dubious purveyorsof anti-drug education."Robert Sweet, a District Judge in New York City argues that the rights ofthe individual have been curtailed in the name of the War on Drugs. "Wehave seen the elimination of an accused's right to pretrial release for mostcharges under drug laws; heightened restrictions on post-conviction bail;and invasions into the attorney-client relationship through criminalforfeiture"He also states that the "fundamental flaw, which will ultimately destroy thisprohibition as it did the last one, is that criminal sanctions cannot, andshould not attempt to, prohibit personal conduct, which does no harm toothers." He does not address the tragedy of drug addicted babies.Thomas Szasz, of the Department of Psychiatry at Syracuse University,charges that the war on drugs is a mass movement characterized by thedemonizing of drugs, addicts, and traffickers as the incarnations of evil. "Itis foolish to dwell on the drug prohibitionist's failure to attain his avowedaims. Since he wages war on evil, his very effort is synonymous withsuccess. It is a fatal weakness of prudential critiques of drug policy that they ignore the Treligious' character of the war on drugs," says Szasz.He asks that the right analogy for America's war on drugs is not theVietnam war, but communism. Szasz further suggests that "self-medication" is a basic human right and drug criminalization is sinful.Steven Duke, Law of Science and Technology Professor at Yale LawSchool argues that under legalization, with drugs regulated by thegovernment, the "proportion of users who would consume drugs withoutsubstantial health or other problems would be greatly increased.

Clinton earlier had vetoed both the Commerce, Justice and Statebill and the VA-HUD measure.Programs funded under the Labor, Health and Human Services andEducation bill (HR 2880) and the vetoed Interior spending measure (HR2880) would be financed at fiscal 1995 levels or the House- or Senate-passed levels, whichever is lowest. Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiatorson the District of Columbia spending bill (HR 2880) said that final action isimminent on the measure after they reached agreement on a controversialschool voucher plan.The final product reflected an unusual degree of bipartisanship, given therancor displayed during the two prior partial federal shutdowns.

Clinton earlier had vetoed both the Commerce, Justice and Statebill and the VA-HUD measure.Programs funded under the Labor, Health and Human Services andEducation bill (HR 2880) and the vetoed Interior spending measure (HR2880) would be financed at fiscal 1995 levels or the House- or Senate-passed levels, whichever is lowest. Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiatorson the District of Columbia spending bill (HR 2880) said that final action isimminent on the measure after they reached agreement on a controversialschool voucher plan.The final product reflected an unusual degree of bipartisanship, given therancor displayed during the two prior partial federal shutdowns. With theHouse, Senate and the administration all seeking to avoid anothershutdown, the frequently intense negotiations required give on all sides.Conspicuously absent was any effort to put more pressure on Clinton.  "Wewant to get a signable bill," said Dan Meyer, the top aide to House SpeakerNewt Gingrich, R-Ga., as the talks were in the late stages.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996TOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS"Drug law enforcement has proven to be an effective and integral part of thebattle against illicit drugs and crime in United States," writes formerMichigan State Drug Czar Robert E. Peterson in a fact-filled new reportentitled, The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement.Peterson uses scores of Justice Department studies to explain and describethe positive impact of drug enforcement.The report notes that from 1986-1992, a 13% rise in drug enforcementmanpower brought about a 39% increase in violent crime arrests and a110% increase in heroin/cocaine trafficking arrests. Since 1980 drugincarceration rates have increased over 400%. Peterson says that thisincreased incarceration had let to the plummeting of murder rates andnarcotics related homicides in most American cities."Contrary to popular belief, most drug convicts, and nearly all druginmates, are repeat or violent offenders." Thus, getting them off the streetssharply reduces crime.Although some advocates for decriminalization of drugs state that U.S.prisons are bursting with first time or minor offenders, Peterson finds"Over 93% of state inmates are repeat and/or violent offenders and first timenon-violent marijuana inmates constitute only 1/10 of 1% of the prisonpopulation. He also notes that the average amount of drugs in a marijuanatrafficking case is 3.5 tons, and for cocaine it is 180 pounds. Over 80% ofcrack cases involve trafficking of an average quantity of over 18,000 crackdoses.The report states that although the odds of imprisonment for drugs haveincreased over the last ten years, the nation is still far too lenient withdrug felons.  A person, Peterson says, is more likely to go to a federalprison for violating federal tax, regulatory, immigration, or liquor laws thanfor possessing heroin, crack or marijuana.Nonetheless, those drug criminals that are placed behind bars, result in asignificant cost savings to the public. This is due to the fact that most drugfelons are repeat offenders, many involved with drugs. One study foundthat heroin users committed more that 200 crimes per year to support theirdrug habit.The cost of incarcerating criminals averages $20,000 to $27,000 per year.The estimated cost to society for crimes committed by the average releasedcriminal, range from $172,000 to $2.36 million per year. Under thesefigures, based on several recent federal, state, and think tank studies, itcosts society at least seven times less money to keep someone in prison thanto let them go free.Peterson strongly supports drug treatment, both for those who are in prisonand for those who are not.  However, he warns that without a regular regimenof drug testing, treatment failure rates increase.  "Self-reports, counselorreports, and infrequent or random drug testing significantly under-reportsindividual drug use," says Peterson.  He cites a program in Lansing Michiganwhich has kept 75% of participants drug-free over a five year period.  As partof this program drug offenders are drug tested three times per week.  Iftested positive participants face a first sanction of three days in jail, asecond sanction of ten days in jail, a third sanction of 20 days jail and 30days for each positive drug test thereafter.  Only a small proportion ofprogram participants ever served jail time.  Although counseling and supportgroups (such as AA or NA) were provided, success rates did not vary amongthose who participated in these activities.Another area touched on in the report was the remarkable cost effectivenessof the Drug Enforcement Administration-through bringing in assetforfeiture funds. From 1990 to 1993 DEA's budget was $2.7 billion while$2.2 billion in drug assets were forfeited to the United States. In 1990 anaverage of over $250,000 was forfeited by drug dealers for each DEASpecial Agent.An entire chapter of The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement is dedicated toanalysis of drug enforcement and race.  Peterson find that racial disparitiesfor drug offenses were lower than that for other crimes, such as murder,robbery, and violent crime.  Generally, he explains, arrest and incarcerationrates are correlated with victimization rates, crime rates, and complaintrates.  For example, the robbery rate among blacks is over three times that ofwhites and the robbery convictions for blacks is two times that of whites instate courts.  The rape conviction rate was nearly two times higher for whitesthan blacks, and rape victims also were nearly twice as likely to be white.Overall, blacks were victims of  violence at a rate of 40% higher than that ofwhites and arrests of blacks were 39% higher than they were for whites.Time served by drug offenders also does not vary significantly by race. Fordrug trafficking offenses, blacks serve an average of 6% less time in prisonthan whites.Peterson makes a series of drug control policy recommendations in thereport. He suggests that drug enforcement efforts target youth withsentences that include "strict zero tolerance drug testing" with  treatmentimposed by courts and probation departments. More serious repeat andviolent youth offenders "must be incapacitated and kept from victimizingcommunities," he said.The report also recommends a radical overhaul of probation and parole."The current failure rate of those on community release and lack ofconsequences for violators indicate that this a weak link in the criminaljustice systems," Peterson says." The earlier that tough, but fair,community release sanctions and conditions are applied, the greater thelikelihood of deterring crime and drug use, he argues.Finally, Peterson recommends tougher marijuana enforcement, which hasbecome, he argues, "far too lax" while use of the drug by youth has rapidlyescalated. The proportion of violent juveniles on marijuana when arrestedhas climbed and high school use of the drug has doubled in the last severalyears. Peterson recommends that public benefits, student aid, and otherprivileges be suspended, reduced, or conditioned on cessation of drug useand criminal activity. Hefty finds and license revocations can be invokedand public service conditions applied to repeat marijuana offenders.The report's author, Robert Peterson served as Governor John Engler'sDrug Control Director from 1991-1995 where he Administered andevaluated education, health, and law enforcement grant programs. Beforethat he served as a prosecutor in Buffalo and a policy adviser toPennsylvania's Attorney General.

To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commandedbefore. He needs all of us - every one of us has a role to play on this team.Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country onemore time." The general's stint as commander-in-chief of the United States SouthernCommand in Panama included collaboration among Latin Americancountries, especially Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, in the war on drugs."McCaffrey has praised the Andean range countries, where most of thecultivation of cocaine takes place, of working together. He has always saidwhen countries work together, they benefit economically and socially," amilitary spokesman said.McCaffrey is a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars known for his toughyet conciliatory style, McCaffrey, 53, was assigned in February 1994 ascommander-in-chief of Southcom, which is responsible for all U.S. militaryactivities in Latin America south of Mexico.Some Army officials wondered though whether he did the right thing inaccepting the anti-drug post because as the highest decorated officer, he wasin line to become the next Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff.Some Panamanian officials hope he will make a case to keep some U.S.troops in Panama after the canal treaties expire in the year 2000, especiallyHoward Air Force Base which serves as the South American headquartersof the  U.S. military's anti-drug trafficking efforts.American AWACs reconnaissance aircraft fly regular missions from thebase to seek out drug planes flying up from South America towards CentralAmerica and Mexico."They've given us information about flight plans of drug traffickers andhelped us detect shipments," said Panama's anti-drug chief Gabriel Castro.Previously, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategic Plans andPolicy, Joint Staff, from 1993 to 1994, and as Assistant to the Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1992 to 1993.  From 1990 to 1992, GeneralMcCaffrey commanded the 24th Infantry Division, which he deployed toSaudi Arabia in 1990.  He led the Division on combat operations duringOperation Desert Storm, for which he was awarded the DistinguishedService Medal.From 1989 to 1990, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategy,Plans, Policy and Joint Affairs for the Department of the Army.  He servedas the Deputy U.S. Military Representative to the NATO MilitaryCommittee from 1988 to 1989.  He has also taught American Government,National Security Studies and Comparative Politics at the United StatesMilitary Academy at West Point.General McCaffrey has been decorated for valor twice with theDistinguished Service Cross - our nation's second highest award for valorin combat - twice with the Silver Star, three times with the Bronze Star, andwas three times awarded with the Purple Heart for wounds received incombat.  He is the most highly decorated Army General on active duty.General McCaffrey received the NAACP Roy Wilkins Renown ServiceAward in 1991, and the U.S. Department of State's Superior Honor Awardin 1992. He is a 1964 graduate of the United States Military Academy atWest Point, and earned a Master of Arts degree in civil government fromAmerican University.The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established in1988 and is organized within the Executive Office of the President.ONDCP's mission is to develop and coordinate the policies, goals andobjectives of the nation's drug control program for reducing the use of illicitdrugs.  The ONDCP Director is the Administration's primary spokespersonfor drug issues, and develops and coordinates the National Drug ControlStrategy.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996VIOLENT CRIME COMMISSION ISSUES REPORTSThe first report of a bipartisan commission on violent crime finds thatdespite a welcome decline in crime rates in many U.S. cities, the chancesthat Americans will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.The report also deplored the "revolving door" American criminal justicesystem in which one of three criminals are supposedly under thesupervision of the justice system at the very time that they murder, rape andcommit other serious crime.The report, entitled The State of Violent Crime in America, was issued bythe Council on Crime in America, which is co-chaired by former U.S.Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Former Drug Czar William J. Bennett.According to the report, the risk of becoming a victim of violent crime todayexceeds many significant life risks, including injury in a motor vehicleaccident and death from heart disease. Much violent crime, moreover, goesunreported. The actual number of violent crimes in 1993 (10.9 million) was5.6 times higher than the number of violent crimes reported to the police(1.9 million)."This study paints a realistic and sobering picture of violent crime inAmerica, but it is not without its ray of hope," said Bennett. "If the successthat cities such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime ratesteaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American people isright when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement is part of the solution,not part of the problem."The report attempts to refute some myths about incarceration rates in theU.S. It found, for example, that the American prison system imprisons justone criminal for every 100 violent crimes.John Walters, who served in the Drug Czar's office during the BushAdministration, is the Council's Executive Director. Other Council membersare former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney GeneralRobert Butter-worth, Princeton University Professor John DiIulio,California Board of Prison Terms Commissioner John Gillis, IndianapolisMayor Stephen Goldsmith and Colorado Attorney General Gale Northon.For a copy of the report, contact Lara Stead by fax at (202) 822-8328.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996HOW TO KILL MANUAL CRITICIZEDThe instructions are precise and clinical, with gruesome detail to clearlyexplain the best way to kill."At least three shots should be fired to insure quick and sure death. Aim forthe head-preferably the eye sockets if you are a sharp shooter."That's just what James Edward Perry did when he walked into a suburbanMaryland home outside Washington in 1993 and pulled the trigger of hisrifle, killing two women before suffocating a severely disabled child in analleged  murder-for-hire scheme.His method, his weapon, his attempted coverup-all allegedly were straightout of the book, Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.Perry was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders. But, accordingto a novel lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Maryland, thebook's publishers alsoshould have to pay."This book makes no bones about it. It is simply an instruction manual likethe one you operate your VCR with, but this one tells you how to killpeople," said John Marshall of Rockville, Md., one of the lawyers whofiled the suit.The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money from PaladinEnterprises Inc. and its founder, Peder C. Lund, is believed to be the firstof its kind against a book publisher.Courts have held magazines like Soldier of Fortune liable for runningadvertisements offering hit-man services. But they've yet to hold publishersresponsible for the conduct of someone who learned how to commit crimesfrom a book.Already it's got some legal experts talking about dangerous precedents,because the case, they say, raises troubling 1st Amendment issues. Whencan a court punish publication of truthful information, even information thathas no redeeming value? And if you allow a lawsuit against the bookpublisher in this case, what's to stop lawsuits against, for example, makersof violent movies whose crimes are duplicated in real life?That's not to say those distinctions can't be drawn, legal experts say, but,as with most 1st Amendment issues, it would be tricky."It would require a change in 1st Amendment analysis to hold publishersresponsible for the crime that ultimately would occur," said Douglas Kmiec,a  professor at Notre Dame University Law School in South Bend, Ind.Perry was convicted last year of killing Mildred Horn, her quadriplegic sonand nurse Janice Saunders. He allegedly committed the crimes at thedirection of Horn's ex-husband, Lawrence Horn, who is accused ofordering the murders to get a $1 million award his son received in a medicalmalpractice lawsuit. Horn will stand trial in April.In Perry's trial, prosecutors cited more than two dozen instances in whichhe followed the book to the letter in carrying out the alleged murder-for-hirescheme. He used the same kind of rifle, rubbed out its serial numbers andshot the women three times each in the eyes. He also used a homemadesilencer and filed down parts of the rifle, just as the book said.Furthermore, he allegedly followed the book's suggestions to requestmoney up front, make the crime scene look like a burglary and discard thegun. But Dan Hale, a lawyer for the book's publisher, said those thingsshouldn't make the Boulder, Colo.-based company liable for Perry'sactions."The people who are responsible are the people who committed the crime,"Hale said. To hold otherwise, he said, would mean scaling back the 1stAmendment.The 1st Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and press, doesnot protect all speech. The Supreme Court has carved out certainexceptions, ruling, for example, that speech that is obscene or libelous orcreates a  clear and present danger of imminent lawless action is not alwaysentitled to  1st Amendment protection. As a result, the government canrestrict it or, in some cases, punish people for engaging in it.The victims' families in this case argue that the information in "Hit Man"should be considered unprotected speech, just like libel or defamation. "Ourargument is that there is currently no protection for speech that aids andabets an illegal transaction," said Rod Smolla, a professor at the College ofWilliam and Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va., who is alsorepresenting the families. "Because it has absolutely no value of any kind,it is not protected under the 1st Amendment."But finding a judge sympathetic to that argument will be difficult, Kmiecsaid. Though a libel lawsuit limits speech, it is justified under the 1stAmendment because the material is false. Here, the material is true-and itstruth only makes it more awful, Kmiec said. "The plaintiff will have toprove not that the material is false but that it is worthless," Kmiec said."There's no directly applicable precedent."But, as Kmiec noted, deciding what's worthless would be as difficult asdetermining what's obscene. Courts have long struggled with trying tofigure  that one out. Hale argued that "culpability lies with Mr. Perry. And ifhe conspired with Mr. Horn, he'll  probably be convicted, as well."The courts will have to decide-meanwhile, the murder manual is still forsale.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996VIRGINIA REFORMS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMHundreds of violent juvenile offenders would be tried automatically asadults and face stiffer prison time under a compromise struck last monthbetween Gov. George Allen and state General Assembly leaders. Thecompromise proposal could clear the way for overhauling Virginia'sjuvenile justice system, which many say is ill-equipped to handle theincreasingly violent crimes committed by children as young as 14.Juvenile offenders currently can serve no more than seven years in prisonand must be released when they turn 21, no matter how dangerous they aredeemed to be. Allen, who made juvenile justice reform a top priority of hislegislative agenda this year, was quick to trumpet the bipartisan compromiseat a hastily arranged news conference held just hours after striking the deal."This will send a message to young people that we're not just going to giveyou a slap on the wrist," Allen said.The agreement, which resolves differences between two competing plans,calls for automatically trying as adults all juveniles 14 and older accused ofviolent crimes such as murder, rape and forcible sodomy. As part of thenew compromise, juveniles charged with some less-severe  violentcrimes - robbery, carjacking, kidnapping - would be tried as adults  at thediscretion of the local prosecutor.  In addition, judges would be given newsentencing options beyond  incarceration and probation.Allen's budget includes $8.5 million for new boot camps and "wildernesswork camps" that are aimed at giving young offenders a second chancethrough rehabilitation. Even a juvenile offender sentenced as an adult couldget his or her sentence suspended if a Circuit Court judge chooses to makeuse of such alternative programs. "The compromise we offer today reflectsa concern and commitment to be responsive to the vast majority of theyoung people who come before the court on minor charges and are in needof remediation to turn their lives around," said Del. Jerrauld C. Jones, D-Norfolk, who chaired a legislative task force and helped broker the newcompromise.The plan also opens long-secretive juvenile court proceedings to the publicwhen juveniles are charged with felony crimes. Juvenile criminal historyrecords would also be made public when youths are convicted of felonies.Attorney General James S. Gilmore III, who headed Allen's advisorycommission, said the compromise struck a careful balance between toughersentencing and increased prevention and rehabilitation programs. "We willprevent, rescue and redirect where and when we can," Gilmore said. "Butwe will also punish where we have to, with the paramount concern beingthe protection of the community."The compromise, reached in the opening weeks of the 60-day session, alsoreflects the conciliatory tone Allen has taken with the legislature this year,after watching Democrats kill most of his initiatives in last year's morepolarized session. "Obviously, you can't do things with just Republicansalone," Allen said. "I think this is a good sign for this session of theGeneral Assembly."The actual, practical effect of the plan, if approved, may be difficult tomeasure and could vary by locality.  Prosecutors say many of the mostviolent juveniles, such as those who commit murder, are already tried asadults. Judges increasingly transfer teen-agers into adult courts in responseto soaring juvenile crime rates,  they say.But administration officials say the proposed automatic transfer would targethundreds more violent teen-agers who now escape any serious punishmentin the juvenile system.  A state study found that of 1,400 juveniles aged 14and older charged with violent crimes in 1993, fewer than 20 percent weretried as adults.Under the juvenile system, the average prison time served for murder wasless than six years. Juveniles who commit rape serve less than five years onaverage. And those who commit armed robbery serve about a year,administration figures show. "I think that sends the wrong message," Allensaid. "Most people say this is just ridiculous."  But critics, who packed acommittee hearing Wednesday, said the plan offers nothing but a simplistic"harsher-is-better" philosophy."That may be the stuff of good politics," said Judith Bennett, of theVirginia Council of Churches. "It is not the stuff of which sound publicpolicy is made."  There is little evidence in other states to suggest thatsentencing children as adults will reduce crime, said Julie McConnell,associate director of the American  Civil Liberties Union's Virginia chapter."It is an abdication of our obligation as adults to protect and guide  childreninto responsible and socially productive lives," McConnell said.But few dispute the need to crack down on violent juvenile crime, whichhas increased by 36 percent since 1975, according to a study by the JointLegislative Audit and Review Commission, the General Assembly'sinvestigative  arm. To fund the plan, Allen has included $16.7 million in abond package that would pay for a renovation and expansion of theSouthampton Correctional  Center, which would house violent juvenileswho are sentenced as adults.Overall, Allen's budget includes nearly $200 million to meet the rising costsof a burgeoning juvenile justice system, although more than half that figurecomes from bonds to build new juvenile prisons.  Those bonds includeabout $41.6 million in debt already authorized by the legislature to renovatethe Beaumont Correctional Center west of Richmond and build a new 180-bed center in Chesterfield County.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996JUDGE SAYS ITS OK TO RUN FROM POLICEA federal judge who came under fire for tossing out evidence in aWashington Heights drug case said  that there was little chance he wouldreverse his ruling, and he called prosecutors' bid to get him to change hismind a "juvenile project."In a three-way conference call with lawyers from his chambers, JudgeHarold Baer, Jr. said he would listen to prosecutors' arguments that drugevidence and a videotaped confession should not be thrown out in a federalcase against Carol Bayless, 41.More than once, however, the judge made it clear that he probably wouldnot change his decision that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion topull over Ms. Bayless's car in the Washington Heights section ofManhattan."While I consider it a rather juvenile project to engage in at this juncture,"Baer said of prosecutors' bid to get him to reconsider his Jan. 24 ruling, "Idon't have a problem in letting them re-argue."Baer went on to say: "I doubt that the government has anything new anddifferent that they can show me in the papers or on the law. But so far as Iam concerned, they certainly should have that opportunity."In a ruling last week that has been criticized by many of the city's and thestate's top officials, Baer refused to allow as evidence 75 pounds of cocaineand more than 4 pounds of heroin that the police said they had seized fromMs. Bayless's rented car on Amsterdam Avenue at 5 a.m. on April 21. Thedrugs were estimated to have a street value of $4 million.The judge ruled that the drugs and Ms. Bayless's videotaped confessionwere not admissible as evidence because officers stopped her car withoutreasonable suspicion.An officer who saw Ms. Bayless said he suspected criminal activity in partbecause four men who had loaded two duffel bags into her trunk ran awayafter seeing him.But Baer, who served on the Mollen Commission, which investigatedpolice corruption, said that it was not necessarily suspicious behavior forpeople to flee the police in Washington Heights, a neighborhood where, hesaid, residents regarded police officers as "corrupt, abusive, and violent.""Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at  them, it would havebeen unusual," Baer wrote.The ruling immediately touched off a firestorm of criticism from politiciansand law enforcement officials, and quickly became fodder for newspapereditorials and radio talk shows. Critics accused Baer of being moreconcerned about protecting criminals than protecting the public, and saidthat his comments about the police unfairly maligned hard-working, honestofficers. Police Commissioner William J. Bratton went so far as to say thejudge was "living in a fantasy land."Baer, a 1994 Clinton administration appointee to the federal bench, hasrepeatedly declined to speak to the public or the press about his ruling andits potential impact on law enforcement efforts. During the 10-minutehearing no one mentioned the publicity or criticism that the ruling hasattracted for more than a week.But the judge's remarks are the first indication of how he would viewprosecutors' efforts to persuade him to change his mind. His remarks wereincluded in a 10-page transcript of the hearing released late on Friday.A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the judge's latest remarkswere relayed  to the mayor, who had harshly criticized the judge's originaldecision."The mayor is hopeful that Judge Baer's decision will be reversed so aconfessed drug dealer will not go free," the spokesman, Colleen Roche,said on Friday night. Ms. Roche added that the mayor would notspecifically comment on what the judge said.A spokesman for Gov. George Pataki said the governor would have nocomment beyond his earlier criticism of the ruling.In a conference call prosecutors asked the judge for more time to preparepapers on the issue. But Jay Holtmeier, assistant U.S. attorney, saidprosecutors plan to ask Bear to reopen the hearing on the motion tosuppress evidence."Reopening the hearing had never been an item that I had focused on at all,"Baer told him. "So I am not clear how I come out."Ramon W. Pagan, Ms. Bayless's lawyer, argued that the prosecutorsshould not be permitted to ask Baer to reconsider his decision."I think they are trying to create something which is very new and unusual,"Pagan said. "If they lose a case, they want to redo it again and do an instantreplay, without the direction of the Court of Appeals, and that is not theway." Baer said prosecutors still had seveal more days to file their motionfor reconsideration.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996CRIME DISCUSSED AT STATE OF UNION ADDRESSPresident Clinton, preparing to embark on his re-election campaign,dedicated a significant chunk of his State of the Union Address to crimeissues.He said during the speech, "At last we have begun to find the way to reducecrime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catchcriminals and to prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing isclearly working," Clinton said.He cited declining Violent crime rates. In New York City, murders aredown 25%, in St. Louis 18%, in Seattle 32%.  But, he said,  we still have along way to go before our streets are safe and our and our people are free offear.  He told the audience of Members of Congress that the Crime Bill of1994 "is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We are already a third ofthe way there and I challenge Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick withthe strategy that's working, and keep the crime rate coming down."Clinton also asked all Americans to respect and support our lawenforcement officers, and told police, "our children need you as role modelsand heroes. Don't let them down."In spite of its unpopularity with the current Congress, Clinton reported thatthe Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal recordsfrom buying guns. He also said that the assault weapons ban is keeping 19kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. "I challenge theCongress to keep those laws on the books," he said.The President also announced several new initiatives. "Our next step in thefight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the Mob. Iam directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs thatinvolve juveniles in violent crime and to seek authority to prosecute - asadults - teenagers who maim and kill like adults," thePresident said.He also offered hope to public housing residents who have been frustratedwith the long legal process usually required for drug-related evictions."From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugsshould be: One strike and you're out," the President said.Clinton challenged every state to match federal policy, to assure thatserious, violent criminals serve at least 85% of their sentence.However, the President also emphasized the importance of drug and crimeprevention programs. He said more police and punishment are important,but they're not enough. "We have got to keep more of our young people outof trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, butdeveloped in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of ouradults, to give these children futures to say yes to. And I challengeCongress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-rootsprevention efforts."Clinton added that to reduce crime and violence, we have to reduce the drugproblem. "The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to theirchildren openly and firmly, and embraces our churches and synagogues,our youth groups and our schools. I challenge Congress not to cut oursupport for drug-free schools. People like D.A.R.E. officers are making areal impression on grade school children that will give them the strength tosay no when the time comes," he said.The day after the speech Clinton traveled to Louisville, Kentucky to test hisanti-crime themes on the road. Clinton does not plan to officially announcehis re-election bid until spring. But the State of the Union speech toCongress and the next day's trip to a state that will be an election-yearbattleground effectively launched his campaign.In a roundtable discussion with police and community leaders, he arguedthat Republican efforts to transform the current COPS program into a blockgrant program for states should be defeated.The split over community policing underscores the philosophical dividebetween Clinton and the Republican-led Congress over spending and taxpriorities that's led to the budget stalemate.But Wednesday House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republicans are readyto take Clinton up on his budget compromise offer. He suggested that theWhite House and Congress agree to a budget "downpayment" of around$100 billion.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996RAP GROUPS TO RAISE MONEY FOR SLAIN OFFICER:On Sunday, February 18, members of Philadelphia's hip hop communityand Philadelphia police officers will host a benefit for slain police officerLauretha Vaird's family.

The National ForensicScience Technology Center has officially opened for business at St.Petersburg Junior College's Allstate Center.  It is likely to attract more than1,000 visitors this year and far more in future years, said Dr. Joan Wood,Pinellas-Pasco medical examiner and  president of the new center's board ofdirectors. She said job opportunities  in forensics have been expanding, buttraining programs have failed to keep  pace with the demand. "I think wehave a tremendous future ahead of us," she said. This week more than 100people, most of them from out of state, attended the center's inauguralthree-day workshop, which featured Bruce Weir, a DNA expert whotestified in the O.J. Simpson trial.  Eventually the center could be offering aworkshop every other week, Wood said. It also will be involved in jointeducational programs with the junior college, the University of SouthFlorida and the University of Central Florida. Other activities will includeresearch, creation of teaching videos and  computer discs, and developmentof industry standards. The center will have a  director and a small supportstaff, Wood said.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996ATLANTA TARGETS VIOLENT CRIME FOR OLYMPICS:Atlanta, ranked the most violent U.S. city for the second straight year in anew survey, is battling to cleanse its image ahead of playing host to theworld for the Olympic Games.  City officials said a private survey thatnamed Atlanta as the most dangerous U.S. city in violent crime such asmurder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was using outdated statisticsthat don't reflect improvements in 1995.  The Morgan Quitno survey, basedon 1994 FBI crime statistics, found Atlanta for the second year in a row tobe the least safe of the 100 largest U.S. cities, or those with more than100,000 people. The Atlanta Olympics, from July 19 to August 4 this year,will be the biggest ever, bringing together more than 10,000 athletes from197 countries. Atlanta officials boast that it will be the most compact Gamesin history, with most events and the Olympic Village concentrated in a smalldowntown area. But that area is in a high-crime part of the city center wherelocal residents fear to tread at night. Panhandlers and the homeless are afrequent sight in the area dubbed "the Olympic Ring."

Since April,Martinez has roamed the neighborhood west of Lakeview Avenue in a vanthat touts his Community Oriented and Problem Solving program (COPS).He has helped set up Neighborhood Watch, clean up vacant lots andhouses, install and replace street lights, remove abandoned vehicles andincrease street police patrols. In addition, the city closed off Gorrill andRalston streets at Lakeview  Avenue three years ago to reduce pedestrianaccidents and street-corner drug  dealing. One effect has been that sinceJune, the neighborhood around Gorrill Street has had only four burglaries,Martinez said. That's remarkable because it would not have been unusualfor the neighborhood to have four burglaries a  week, he said. "It is thepeople in the neighborhood who are taking care of each other," Martinezsaid.  Citizens credit Martinez with helping to make changes in theneighborhood.

Theshoe had ben scheduled for distribution to its vast network of retailers overthe next few months. "Hemp" is a street slang for marijuana. In a statementamplifying a letter to Adidas America President Steve Wynne, Brown said."The people at this shoe company apparently think this is cute, but it isreally quite deadly--especially at a time in which more and more of ouryoung people do not fear illegal drugs and as a result are using them.Moreover, it has been widely reported that the shoe" had previously beencalled the Chronic--another street name for marijuana. Wynne's response toBrown stated that "Hemp is not marijuana." But Brown, in a second letterreplied, "You fail to get the point. It doesn't matter what the your shoe ismade of -- the question is what you call it." Brown also charged that Adidasshows a blatant disregard of the fact that we now have a crisis among kidswho think using marijuana is the thing to do.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Alfonse M. D'Amato,R-N.Y., last month announced plans for legislation aimed at pressuringMexico for increased cooperation. The action comes as the Clintonadministration is poised to extend for  six months Mexico's $20 billion inU.S. loan guarantees. President Clinton provided the guarantees on his ownauthority last Jan. 31, after lawmakers balked at his request that Congressauthorize a $40 billion bailout. "The measures my colleague and I areintroducing are meant as a shot across the bow to the government ofMexico," Feinstein said. "These measures... should send the signal that thisCongress is prepared to back up the president's effort in the strongestpossible terms if Mexico's actions do not match their words in the war ondrugs." The senators measures would tie the six-month extension of theloan guarantee to Mexico to that country's efforts to curb drug trafficking.Specifically, Feinstein said Mexican officials would have to comply with alist of 10 requirements such as meeting extradition requests, prosecutinglocal government officials for accepting graft, strengthening the prohibitionon money laundering and regulating chemicals used to producemethamphetamine and other narcotics. Another measure would suspendtrucking applications from Mexico under border crossing provisions in theNorth American Free Trade Agreement until Mexico improves its safetyrecord.

Garcia Abrego was flown toHouston and taken into federal custody to face an indictment filed inSeptember, 1993 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District ofTexas. The indictment charges that Garcia Abrego is the leader of one of themost powerful drug trafficking organizations in Mexico, which, whileoperating on both sides of the border, is responsible for transporting tons ofcocaine into the United States for the Cali Cartel. The indictment furtheralleges that Garcia Abrego authorized acts of violence, including murder, topromote drug activities. Garcia Abrego, who faces a life sentence if he isconvicted, was placed on the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" inMarch of 1995.

In what prosecutors called the biggestmoney laundering case brought in New Jersey, special agents of the U.S.Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service arrested suspects in threestates beginning the night of February 5, officials said.  Special Agent DanHolmes of the U.S. Customs Service said the arrests were made in NewJersey, New York and Florida and at least $300,000 in cash had beenconfiscated. U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg said in a statement that thegovernment would ask to have the suspects held without bail because theypose a high risk of flight. All face a 20-year prison term and a heavy fine ifconvicted.  The indictment said the 14 suspects operated through three frontcompanies, using money transfer agents and banks over more than twoyears to launder cash obtained from illegal narcotic sales in the United Statesback to Cali, Colombia.

According to a report from the New York Times, the JAInternational Jewelry Show displays no signs outside, disseminates nogeneral publicity, posts no show dates in lists of upcoming events andsends out literature in plain brown envelopes. The  reason for the secrecy isthe concern that public notice would weaken security, though none of thepress officers from the parent company, Blenheim Group U.S.A., wouldacknowledge this. Many participants covered the badges identifying them aspart of the show, which is intended only for those in the industry. Policesaid that they had not yet made any arrests in the shooting. At the JavitsCenter a steady stream of armored cars, vans and taxis dropped offexhibitors bearing bulky crates, bulging briefcases and duffel bags like theone stolen earlier. Security was heavy.

City CouncilSpeaker Peter Vallone delivered an unusual reproach to Giuliani in hisannual address to the Council last month, charging that on issues likeeducation, housing, and health, Giuliani had been "a very good mayor - oncrime." The crime rate may once have been the voters' top priority, butsome New Yorkers are asking "What have you done for me lately?"Giuliani seemed conscious of the need to broaden his portfolio when, afterthe beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, he announced that he wouldreorganize the Child Welfare Administration with the same energy andcommitment he had earlier applied to the Police Department. Then he wentfurther, proclaiming in his budget message last week that his top prioritywas protecting the rights of society's most vulnerable, a category he saidincluded troubled children, the elderly, the sick and the handicapped. Tohelp pay for some of his new priorities, he agreed to trim the police force by1,500 officers. Caught off guard, social-welfare advocates praised thepolice cut but remained skeptical of the mayor's real intentions, particularlyif budget cuts continue to grow over all, as now seems likely. The budgetplan for next year, for example, includes a $160 million cut to the Board ofEducation, and projects the removal of more than 275,000 people from thewelfare rolls.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996VETERANS HOSPITALS NOW PROVIDING DRUG TREATMENT:The Department of Veterans Affairs is best known for its network ofhospitals, which continues to expand despite a decline in the population ofveterans and despite health care trends that are forcing many other hospitalsto close. But now the department's insulation from the fiscal and politicalpressures confronting the rest of the government has helped give it animportant new role as an agency that cares for the poor.  And a poor veteranoften gets assistance that a welfare recipient accustomed to nothing morethan cash or food stamps might find lavish.  "If you're a vet," said MarthaBurt, director of social service research at the Urban Institute, aWashington-based research organization, "you have a resource that a lot ofother people don't have." With the plunge in the number of war-maimedveterans treated at the agency's 173 hospitals, the VA has been turning moreof its attention to veterans who are among the nation's drug-addicted orindigent, mentally ill or physically disabled. To qualify, most need onlyhave put in some time in the service, in combat or not, in wartime orpeacetime. "If you serve 180 days on active duty," said one Republicancongressional aide who specializes in veterans issues, "and if for whateverreason you do not succeed in life, you get this complete safety net." As aresult, a department that is the nation's largest employer of doctors andnurses has also become the largest employer of social workers, with 4,241on the payroll last year.Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG POLICY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary, 1996NOBEL WINNERS TAKE ANTI-VIOLENCE CAMPAIGN TO U.S.:In a bid to combat teen violence three Nobel peace laureates will take theirmessage of non-violence to young people, Nobel laureate Betty Williamsannounced last month. ``We're going to change things for the young peopleof America,'' said Williams, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in1977 along with Mairead Corrigan Maguire for their work in NorthernIreland.

Instead of sloggingthrough pages of extraneous text dealing with agencies inwhich readers may have no interest, readers can key intoonly the information they need."It's what they've always asked for," says RichardClaypoole, director of the Federal Register.And the electronic version has caught on, he says.  Evenbefore the Register went public,  subscribers logged 558,369document retrievals from November to December.In whatever form, grantseekers can use the Federal Registerto:*  Mine grant nuggets:  The Health Resources and ServicesAdministration, Centers for Disease Control and EnergyDepartment regularly use the Federal Register to announcegrant competitions.Browsers will find health-related Education Departmentnotices and health and life science notices from theAgriculture Department and the Environmental ProtectionAgency.*  Check on winners:  A few agencies, such as theHousing and Urban Development Department, use the FederalRegister to announce recent awards.  Announcements areoccasional, but they can provide insights about programconstituents and reveal subgrant and subcontractingpossibilities.*  Respond to proposed program rules and funding priorities:Laws creating grant programs often require agencies topublish regulations before getting down to grantmaking.Grantseekers can influence program direction by commentingon the proposals appearing in the Federal Register.*  Keepup with grant-related policies:  The Register provides thefull text on government-wide policies affecting grants andcontracts, such as Office of Management and Budget circularsrelated to university research costs.*In fact, revisions toOMB Circular A-21, which deals with university costs, couldhit the Register late this month. *  Learn about meetings:Agencies publish announcements for meetings, ranging frompreapplication workshops and advisory group sessions topolicy-setting forums, including meetings on grantseekers'home turf.  Notices specify when and where meetings will beheld and which parts will be open to the public.But the Federal Register also has its drawbacks -- for hardcopy and electronic users.  Agencies used to solicitinggrant applications via the Register sometimes bypass thepublication these days, finding it faster and easier to gowith electronic announcements.For example, EPA's 1996 grant competition, announced on theInternet last month, has yet to make it into the Register.Unless their announcements have regulatory impact, saysClaypoole, agencies are not required to publish applicationnotices in the Register.And whether users are hard copy or on-screen readers, theyroutinely must trudge through pages of often confusinglegalese.  To make things easier, the Federal Registeroffice regularly holds workshops on how to use the FederalRegister system.  The 1996 schedule includes workshops inand out of Washington.Other efforts to make life easier include a new column onregulations taking effect that day and a daily reminder ofimpending closing dates for comments on proposed rules.--Pam MooreContact:  The paper Federal Register is $375 a year from theSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government PrintingOffice, Washington, DC, (202)783-3238.Logging Into The Federal RegisterGPO Access, an online service of the Government PrintingOffice, provides searchable versions of the Federal Registerthrough the Internet.

The firstvolume of this report provides an overall perspective onfederal efforts to ensure food safety and quality. GAOdiscusses (1) the statutory responsibilities, programs,activities, staffing, and budget of the federal agenciesinvolved with food safety and quality; (2) the inter-agencyagreements used by the agencies to cooperate in meetingtheir statutory duties; (3) the ways in which funding andstaffing levels have changed during the 1980s relative tothe agencies' work loads; and (4) the issues that federalofficials believe will be critical for food safety andquality in the 1990s. The second volume contains a moredetailed description of the food safety and qualityactivities of the 12 agencies that were the focus of thefirst volume. These 12 agencies include the following: Foodand Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control(HHS); Agricultural Marketing Service, Federal GrainInspection Service, Food Safety and Inspection Service,Agricultural Research Service, and Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service (USDA); the Environmental ProtectionAgency; the National Marine Fisheries Service (Department ofCommerce); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms(Department of the Treasury); U.S. Customs Service; andFederal Trade Commission.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

AlthoughUSDA agencies are reacting positively to some of thechallenges of strategic marketing, GAO concludes thatoverall the Department is not prepared to guide agribusinessin a market-driven economy. Important marketing policies,practices, and skills are lacking within individualagencies, impairing USDA'S ability to fulfill a leadershiprole. For example, three of the four agencies GAO examineddo not coordinate their program planning or systematicallyexchange information.  These factors have contributed toUSDA's inability to develop a plan for marketing as acoordinated, Department-wide issue under the new management-by-objective system.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

This structure alsodates to the 1930s and reflects the more limitedtransportation and communication systems in use at thattime. Given changing patterns in American agriculture andmounting constraints on federal spending, GAO looked forways to improve the overall management of USDA's fieldstructure. GAO found that USDA can save millions of dollarswhile maintaining or improving operational effectiveness by(1) more aggressively pursuing incremental improvementsthrough field office collocations and consolidations and (2)restructuring to provide a more flexible, integrated fieldorganization GAO notes the likelihood of many sources ofopposition to the restructuring of USDA field operations. Asa result, USDA Will need to engage its grass roots staff,top management, farm clients, and Congress in updating itscurrent structure to one that can effectively deliverservices into the next century.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

OMB'S treatment producedhigher outlay estimates for fiscal year 1991 than did CBO'S.GAO believes that the key to resolving the issue would befor the administration and Congress to reconsider the matterin light of a common set of assumptions about the contracts'financing and the required scoring rule. GAO understandsthat the administration will be initiating discussions withCongress to develop a mutually acceptableway of resolving the issue.  GAO believes that this is anappropriate course of action.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

GAO found that the 1990sequester had only a minimal effect on the five agencies.The five agencies actually lost less than 1.4 percent oftheir final budget authority because (1) growth in agencyappropriations offset sequester reductions and (2)appropriations enacted after the sequestration werepartially exempt from that process. As a result, agenciesabsorbed the sequester reductions by postponing programexpansions and improvements rather than by cutting coreservices. Final 1990 figures peg the deficit at $220.4billion, or $120.4 billion over the target level. Had OMBpredicted the need for a $120 billion sequester in itsearlier sequestration reports, GAO believes that meaningfulnonsequester deficit reduction might have been achieved inthe face of massive, across-the-board cuts. GAO continues tobelieve that sequestration alone will not eliminate thedeficit.

However, theOffice of Inspector General found that many problems plaguedthe administration of grantees' programs. GAO reviewed threeDepartment of Housing and Urban Development field offices(Baltimore, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; and Detroit, Michigan)to determine how they monitored entitlement grantees ofCommunity Development Block Grants. GAO found thatweaknesses in HUD'S guidance for monitoring entitlementgrantees may have contributed to inadequate supervisory andevidentiary control practices.  Without adequate supervisoryand evidentiary controls over its monitoring program, HUDcannot ensure that management problems are detected or t hatstaff do not duplicate previous work. In addition, withoutusing information found in Office of Inspector Generalreports when planning their monitoring, field offices maynot be using their limited resources most effectively.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

A main problem at theStafford Student Loan Program is the lack of an informationsystem to protect the government's interests; in fiscal year1990, more than half the program's funds--$2.4 billion--wereused to repay defaulted loans. Today the Department isrunning a multi-million-dollar, commercial-type loanoperations with a data system containing incomplete,inaccurate, and unreliable information. Consequently, theDepartment has no way of knowing whether (1) student loandefaulters are trying to obtain new loans or (2) borrowershave exceeded legal loan limits. GAO found that loandefaulters may have obtained about million in new loans, andthat students have received million of dollar in loans overthe legal limits. While the total impact of such abuses isunclear because the data are so poor, GAO believes that asignificant problem exists--one that is costing the federalgovernment millions of dollars in interest subsidies andadditional defaulted loans. The Department of Educationplans to install a new data base in 1993. Until then GAObelieves that the Department needs to do much more to (1)improve the accuracy and completeness of the current database and (2) make this information available to guarantyagencies. GAO concludes that much is at stake. If the abusesgo unchecked, they will continue to corrode the financialaid system and ultimately deprive eligible students of themoney they need to finance their education.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

This legislationrequires firms employing 20 or more employees and offering agroup health insurance plan to provide employees and theirfamilies the option of continued coverage in cases of jobloss, death, or divorce. This report discusses (1) Labor andIRS efforts to help private individuals who bring cases ofalleged noncompliance by employers to their attention, (2)procedures for investigating these allegations, and (3)enforcement history. Both IRS and Labor provide informationabout COBRA to those who inquire, and Labor will contactemployers to help employees obtain benefits. However, ifemployers refuse to provide benefits, IRS cannot and Laborgenerally does not try to force employers to providebenefits. Further, the extent of COBRA violations isunknown. IRS' method of dealing with potential COBRAbeneficiaries, in GAO'S view, discourages the reporting ofviolations. GAO believes that Labor and IRS should do moreto ensure that IRS is made aware of potential COBRAviolations. The knowledge that excise taxes may be assessedfor these violations could deter such violations. Also,people referred by IRS to Labor could get help quicker ifthey were given Labor's phone number along with its address.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

While GAOconcluded that these expenditures represented an allowableuse of funds, concerns were raised that GAO had not fullydeveloped and considered the evidence of wrongdoing ormisuse of funds in connection with these expenditures.  In asupplement addressing these concerns, GAO notes that it didfind evidence that some local Downriver rules were violatedand that available evidence provides a basis to question thewisdom and prudence of some of Downriver's actions.

Among strikes reported to the Federal Mediation andConciliation Service in 1985 and 1989, GAO estimates thatemployers announced an intention of hiring permanentreplacements about one-third of the time and actually hiredthem in 17 percent of the strikes. GAO found  littledifference in the use of permanent strike replacements byemployers  in larger versus small strikes. Many employersand union  representatives involved in strikes in 1985 and1989 believe that permanent strike replacements were morecommon in the late 1980s than in the late 1970s. However,GAO estimates that--had it surveyed all employers and unionrepresentatives--about one-third of employers and 13 percentof union representatives would have said that they had nobasis for providing an opinion on trends in the hiring ofpermanent replacements.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

To provide this protection, DOE must be ableto offset the supplies lost by quickly drawing down reserveoil from its storage sites and distributing it topurchasers.  This report (1) reviews DOE'S current andplanned capability for removing oil from reserve sites andgetting it to users via oil distribution networks,(2)examines the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's compliance withpipeline safety requirements, and (3) discusses DOE'Sefforts to correct problems that GAO previously reported.GAO concludes that a major distribution could be hamperedbecause buyers of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil arerequired to use U.S.-flag tankers to ship the oil betweenU.S. ports.

In fiscal year 1989,DOE paid these contractors almost $8 billion thesecontractors, in turn, awarded about $3.2 billion tosubcontractors. In response to concerns about subcontractorconflicts of interest, GAO looked into the situation andfound that while DOE'S written policies and proceduresprovide guidance on how to spot and avoid conflicts ofinterest among subcontractors, DOE field offices have notbeen implementing these internal management controls.Contrary to DOE regulations the DOE Albuquerque field officeabdicated responsibility and allowed the research centers tomake conflict-of-interest determinations themselves.Although GAO was unable to determine whether DOE'S policiesand procedures were, in practice, effective, GAO noted twomanagement control problems. First, Albuquerque has reliedextensively on subcontractor self-certification in makingconflict-of-interest decisions even though certificationsmay not always be accurate. Second, Albuquerque'sdocumentation of conflict-of-interest decisions is limited.GAO also found that neither Albuquerque nor DOE headquartersexercised effective oversight to ensure that conflicts ofinterest were avoided in the subcontracts awarded by the LosAlamos and Sandia National Laboratories.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

The act provides a formula forcalculating the limit and sets aside $50 billion infinancing to resolve troubled savings and loans placed intoconservatorship or receivership. On the basis of its reviewof RTC'S September 28,1990, report and schedule and itsfinancial records, GAO concludes that none of the categoriesfor the formula were omitted from RTC'S calculation and thatthere is little risk that RTC exceeded the limitation.However, RTC is facing a funding crisis. Without enoughmoney to absorb the losses and to buy the assets of failedinstitutions, RTC will have to slowdown its resolutionefforts. As a result, failing institutions will continue toincur operating losses, thereby increasing resolution costs.GAO believes that only quick action to identify a long-termsolution to RTC's funding needs will ensure theCorporation's continued ability to respond to the thriftcrisis.

Onthe one hand, INS enforces laws meant to prevent the illegalentry of millions of poverty stricken, often repressedpeople naturally drawn to a better life in the UnitedStates. On the other hand, INS facilitates legal immigrationby processing millions of requests relating to citizenshipand asylum and by inspecting hundreds of millions of peopleat ports of entry. This report, one in a series of generalmanagement reviews of major federal departments andagencies, concludes that over the past decade weakmanagement systems and inconsistent leadership at INS haveallowed serious problems to go unresolved. As a result, theagency has degenerated into a group of segmented autonomousprograms, each trying to handle its own set of problems withlittle attention to their interrelatedness. Compounding thislack of overall direction is a chaotic budget developmentprocess that has produced budgets that are simplycompilations of program submissions with littleaccountability for funds or attention to agencywidepriorities. The current INS organizational structure, markedby complicated lines of authority and communication, adds toand perpetuates the agency's segmented management. AlthoughlNS' problems did not happen overnight, the agency needs totake immediate action to improve both enforcement andservice operations.

Further, has the goalof the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980--to reduceregulatory burdens on small businesses, small governments,and nonprofit organizations--been met for small governments?GAO found that federal agencies are not doing as manyanalyses for small governments as they might, largelybecause of weaknesses in the act. First, the Small BusinessAdministration may be unable to monitor compliance with theact because it lacks expertise in small government issues.Second, that act has no provisions for ensuring federalagency compliance. Third, neither the act nor SBA hasprovided criteria or definitions for determining whetherfederal rule-making agencies are conducting sufficientanalyses of regulations affecting small governments and howthese analyses should be done.

This testimony updates the status of the issues GAOcited in 1988.  The Comptroller General first reviews theoverall state of the economy and the budget, cautioning thata protracted war in the Middle East, the recession at home,and further increases in the cost of deposit insurance couldtrigger another explosive rise in the deficit over the nextseveral years; the general fund deficit--excluding thesurpluses in the Social Security and other trust funds--already appears likely to top $400 billion in 1991.  He thendiscusses critical policy problems in the following programareas:  defense, the financial sector, health,transportation, agriculture, energy, the environment,financial management, and the public service. In some casesGAO reports significant progress, but that is the exception.Many of the problems, including some of the most importantones like the thrift crisis, have become more severe. Giventhe rapid developments in international affairs--asevidenced by changes in the Warsaw Pact countries and by theeconomic and political integration of Western Europe--theComptroller General believes that it is time to revisit thequestion, What is required of our government?  If the UnitedStates is to succeed in this new world order, theComptroller General believes that several prerequisites mustbe satisfied.  First, we must have a government that works,one that operates efficiently and effectively, both in itsinternal functions and in its delivery of services to theAmerican people.  To reach that goal, investment ingovernment, its people, its facilities, and its technologyis needed.  Second, we must have a government whosefinancial performance relates properly to the national andworld economy.  For that to be achieved, the United Statesmust move toward a long term fiscal policy that recognizesthe need for a much higher level of national savings.Third, we must have a financial system in whose safety andsoundness the American people can have complete confidence,so that our market economy can effectively allocate capitalto the most productive uses.  To accomplish that, we mustresolve the thrift crisis, restore the soundness of thebanking industry, and ensure an efficient and effectivelyregulated structure of capital markets.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

GAO found that two majorproblems hinder states from collecting from private insurersfor recipients' covered health care costs.  First, statescannot prohibit some out-of-state insurers from trying toavoid paying state Medicaid agencies for such costs.  Statesnow lack jurisdiction over insurers that operate onlyincidentally in the state.  Second, states' limitedauthority over plans covered under the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) does not allow them toprohibit these plans from trying to avoid payments forrecipients' covered costs.  Further, many states have notexercised the authority they do have to mandate that noERISA plan include any contract provision that might limitor exclude payments for Medicaid recipients' health carecosts.  While  state officials found it hard to pinpointlosses resulting from their payment systems, examples ofstate Medicaid losses obtained by GAO suggest that theproblem may be substantial--perhaps millions of dollars inlosses each year--and growing.  To minimize future losses,federal legislation is needed to clarify Medicaid's role asa payer of last resort and to enhance the ability of statesto collect from out-of-state insurers and ERISA plans.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

If implemented, theIndividual Social Security Account may change the mix ofpublic and private saving but not necessarily the magnitudeof national saving.

The Social SecurityAdministration's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) isresponsible for managing these judges.  GAO reviewedproductivity initiatives underway in OHA'S Chicago RegionalOffice and found that they complied with AdministrativeProcedure Act and OHA guidelines.  GAO also found that byincluding dispositions of regional chiefs and retired judgesin hearing office statistics, average production figures forthe Chicago region and some hearing offices were slightlyoverstated.

Those reports looked atthose agencies that obligated $50 million or more formainframe computers and mainframe peripheral acquisitions.This capping report provides consolidated statistics onmainframe computer and mainframe peripheral procurements by35 federal agencies. In particular, GAO looked at the extentto which the 35 agencies required compatibility with IBM orother equipment manufacturer. GAO found that during the 3-1/2 fiscal years ending in March 1989, the agenciesobligated $1.9 billion for mainframe and mainframeperipheral procurements.  Eighty-two percent ($1,587.8million) of all the procurements required compatibility withexisting systems. IBM-compatible procurements comprised 64percent of the compatibility-limited procurements and 52percent of all procurements. With a 47 percent share of thetotal federal market, IBM was the largest vendor; Unisys,with a 20-percent share, was the next largest. Almost 60percent of the total value of all procurements involved onlyone vendor.  When GAO used the number of procurements--rather than dollars--for comparison, it found that theagencies had 3,225 procurements for mainframe and mainframeperipherals and over 90 percent required some kind ofcompatibility. The agencies required IBM compatibility 60percent of the time. When IBM compatibility was required,IBM equipment was supplied 68 percent of the time.Back to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL/INDUSTRY WATCHDOG via NewsNetMAY, 1991INTERNATIONAL BANKING:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITALADEQUACY STANDARDSOrder No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-80Pages:  41Concerned that banks may not be holding enough capital toensure their safety and soundness, Congress passedlegislation in 1983 encouraging other countries to maintainor improve banks' capital bases.

Inresponse, DOD developed the Defense Management Report, whichoutlines steps to improve DOD management. GAO found that DODhas implemented several Defense Management Report savingsinitiatives and has begun to realize some savings, but thelarger, more complex initiatives are still in the planningstages. To fully implement the initiatives and achieve DOD'Ssavings goal, GAO believes that continued management supportis necessary. Although the initiatives were estimated tosave about $39 billion over fiscal years 1991-95, theseestimates did not always rely on cost analyses supported byhistorical facts or empirical cost data. GAO'S review of$24.5 billion in estimated savings showed that about 82percent of these savings were based primarily on managementjudgment, suggesting that the reliability of the estimatesmay vary.  DOD officials said that current budgetnegotiations and international security developments--including Operation Desert Shield--will not delay theimplementation of the efficiencies to generate thesesavings.  As of June 1990, none of the Packard Commission'srecommendations to streamline and reduce the acquisitionwork force had been made; in fact, the number of acquisitionpersonnel increased slightly. DOD estimates that over fiscalyears 1991-95, Defense Management Report initiatives willeliminate almost 2,400 civilian and almost 2,000 militarypositions from the acquisition work force.

GAO found that--asprescribed in the Defense Management Report--each militaryservice has revised (1) its three-tier structure and (2) theroles of its materiel and systems command. GAO believes thatthese revisions, if fully implemented as intended will moreclearly separate the streamlined acquisition structure fromthe service's existing structure by (1) appointing ServiceAcquisition Executives and Program Executive Officers whoare devoted full-time to acquisition matters, (2) givingthree-tier officials more control over acquisition matters,and (3) removing unnecessary review layers from theacquisition process.

However, GAO found that operationaltesting did not demonstrate that the system wasoperationally suitable. The system fell far short of itsavailability requirements, in large part because many systemcomponents were unreliable, and many effectivenessrequirements were not met. While the Army acknowledges thesystem's problems, it believes that the system hasdemonstrated sufficient operational effectiveness to warrantcontinuation of the program. In August 1990, the Army optedto defer production of the system for two years in hopes ofresolving the system's problems. Because the system has notproven that it can meet established requirements, by law theArmy cannot obligate any procurement funding after fiscalyear 1989 until the system meets or exceeds the Army'soperational test performance criteria.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

Aircraftprocurement unit costs generally increase as theirprocurement rates decrease. However, some mature Air Forceand Navy procurement programs, including those for the KC-135R engine modification, F/A-18, F-16, AV-B, and F-15 wouldnot show as significant a unit cost increase as otheraircraft programs if their procurement rates were cut.According to contractors, the procurement unit cost of somemature aircraft is less sensitive to procurement ratereductions when at least one of the following factors ispresent  (1) contractors have a chance to manage overheadand other costs in anticipation of production rate changes,(2) foreign customers' requirements can offset reductions inthe U.S. procurement quantities, and (3) multiyearprocurement can be used to stabilize prices over a longerproduction period. Contractors also said that unit cost isespecially sensitive to sudden unanticipated changes inproduction rates. In GAO'S view, these circumstancesunderscore the importance of program stability. Whenprocurement rate decreases are necessary, contractors shouldbe given enough advance notice so they can eliminateunnecessary facility, overhead, and other costs before theproduction rate decreases begin.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

This report provides information onDOD'S processes before passage of the act. GAO discusses (1)how DOD had selected the domestic military bases announcedas candidates for disclosure and realignment by theSecretary of Defense in January 1990 and (2) whether themilitary services had developed realistic cost estimates forclosing and realigning the forces at those bases.  GAO foundthat DOD did not provide specific written guidance to theservices on how to choose bases for closure and realignment.Instead, the Secretary of Defense spoke to the services ingeneral terms, instructing them to consider anticipatedforce structure and budget reductions in selecting candidatebases. In selecting candidate bases, none of the servicesused a process as comprehensive and well documented as theone followed by the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment andclosure.  Further, the processes used by the services inselecting bases for closure varied.  The Navy did notdevelop cost and savings estimates prior to the Secretary'sJanuary 1990 announcement, and the Army and Air Force costand savings estimates were only preliminary; efforts torefine these estimates were suspended with passage of thefiscal year 1991 Defense Authorization Act.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

GAO found that the Navy's revisedacquisition strategy adds risk to the Tactical SurveillanceSonobuoy Program because the sonobuoys may need to bemodified if deficiencies are revealed during operationaltesting in fiscal year 1993. Also, if the development of theaircraft software is further delayed, the Navy will beunable to use the sonobuoys for some time after they aredelivered. Finally, the revised strategy contradicts Navyguidance, which generally requires operational test andevaluation of an entire system before production isauthorized. The Tactical Surveillance Sonobuoy Program isnot an exception to this rule.

These justifications were to includemeasurable mission-related goals and the resources need tomeet them, a method for measuring the degree to which thegoals have been met, and an explanation of any differencesbetween the goals and the actual results. GAO found that theNavy added three performance indicators in its fiscal year1990 steaming day budget justifications. The Navy has notyet developed performance indicators for its flying hourbudget justifications but expects that indicators will beincorporated into the fiscal year 1992 budgetjustifications.  In addition, the Navy has made an effort toquantify the relationship of flying hours and steaming daysto proficiency and mission readiness. However, becausefactors other than the number and frequency of flying hoursand steaming days--such as personnel, equipment, materiel,and maintenance--affect proficiency and mission readiness,quantifying the relationship between budget requests andaccomplishment of program goals is difficult.

Since then, DOD has transferred excess propertyto an increasing number of other countries.  This fact sheetprovides information on (1) the quantity and category ofexcess material and equipment donated through the program onan annual basis; (2) the value of these items, based on theacquisition cost or other valuation; (3) a list of countriesand organizations within those countries that have receivedexcess property; (4) the annual costs for transportingexcess property; and (5) an assessment of how well excessproperty has been used.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

The highcost of maintaining a balanced and ready enlisted forceunderscores the need for efficient and effective managementof these resources, particularly as the services move towardsmaller forces. This report examines how the services (1)manage the size and composition of their enlisted forces,(2) are planning for enlisted force reductions, and (3)comply with DOD requirements for enlisted force management.Because the Navy and the Marine Corps do not keep records onkey enlisted force management data submitted to DOD, GAOonly reviewed the Air Force and the Army.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

IOWAOrder No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-4Pages:  64In the April 1989 explosion aboard the U.S.S. Iowa, 47sailors died when bags of gun powder ignited in one of thebattleship's gun turrets. GAO asked the Department ofEnergy's Sandia National Laboratories to review the Navy'stechnical analysis of the incident; the Navy had concludedthat the explosion was caused by a deliberate act and not bya defect in the gun or propellent.  While Sandia couldneither confirm nor deny the Navy's conclusion, it dididentify a plausible alternative explanation--that due toits impact sensitivity, the gun powder could have explodedas it was being rammed against the base of a shell. As aresult of Sandia's findings, the Navy halted all firings ofthe 16-inch guns. With Sandia's help, it is doing moretesting. On the basis of that testing, and because of thebattleships' role in Operation Desert Shield, the Navy haslifted the firing suspension for the U.S.S. Missouri and theU.S.S. Wisconsin.  GAO found no evidence of any systemicsafety or serviceability problems aboard the battleships.GAO did discover problems with the adequacy of supervisorypersonnel levels, including the personnel for operating theturrets, and with training for 16-inch gun operations.   GAOrecommends that, unless current Middle East operationsconvincingly demonstrate the utility of the battleships tosupport an amphibious assault, the Navy decommission theMissouri and the Wisconsin.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

Of the1,047 contracts valued at over $25,000 awarded by theDefense General Supply Center in Richmond, Virginia, duringthe third quarter of fiscal year 1988, less than two percentwere classified as based on other than full and opencompetition; the rest were considered fully competitive.However, GAO found that almost half of these contracts wereactually based on solicitations giving only part numbers asitem descriptions. In general, GAO believes that thesepurchase descriptions were inconsistent with full and opencompetition. Although the Defense Logistics Agency hasrecently stopped classifying and processing solicitations asfully competitive on the basis of part numbers, otherproblems remain that may be causing opportunities forcompetition to be missed. This report discusses actionsneeded to ensure that Defense Logistics Agency supplycenters award future contracts on the basis of full and opencompetition.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

This estimate consists of three componentsthe baseline cost of the U.S. forces committed to DesertShield ($100 billion); the incremental cost of mounting theoperation, including troop deployment, calling up thereserves, and providing required additional support for theforces ($30 billion); and related costs like debtforgiveness for Egypt and humanitarian assistance ($7billion). The first component involves funds that would bespent whether the troops were in the Middle East orelsewhere.  To date, 35 countries have furnished troops andequipment.  Yet contributions to defray U.S. expenses aresmall relative to the total U.S. cost of the operation; DODhas reported receipt of cash contributions of about $4.3billion and in-kind contributions of about $379 million. Asa result of Operation Desert Shield, DOD is obligating itsfiscal year 1991 appropriations at a rapid pace and willexhaust some of these funds by spring. A supplementalappropriation to cover the costs of Operation Desert Shieldseems inevitable, the Comptroller General testified. Becauseof many uncertainties in the cost estimates, however, GAObelieves that it would be inappropriate to provide a lumpsum supplemental now. Instead, Congress should provideperiodic appropriations during the fiscal year, as actualcosts become clearer. Some of the uncertainties are (1) theunknown value of offsets like assistance in kind, includingfuel and water; (2) inadequate DOD guidance on whatconstitutes Desert Shield costs (an important factor in anyemergency appropriations under the Budget Enforcement Act);and (3) other factors like a decision to implement arotation policy.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

An effective trespassprogram must reasonably ensure that offenders, especiallywillful ones, (1) will be detected and (2) when detected,will be assessed a penalty that will not only penalize thembut serve as a deterrent to others. However, GAO found thatthe Bureau of Land Management's trespass enforcement effortsdo not meet either of these requirements. Because manygrazing areas are inspected infrequently or not at all,offenders are unlikely to be detected. Even when offendersare detected, BLM often exacts no penalties and--for themore serious violations--seldom assesses the minimumpenalties its own regulations require. BLM staff attributethe shortfalls in trespass detection and deterrenceprimarily to insufficient staff levels. While more staffwould undoubtedly improve performance, GAO believes thatmore effective and aggressive detection and deterrence arepossible with existing staffing levels.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

In 1959 mining claimswere filed for silica sand along the Oregon coast--a sitewhich in 1972 became the Oregon National Dunes RecreationArea. In October 1989, at the request of the claim holder,the federal government transferred title through the patentprocess to 780 acres of mining claims in this scenic area.GAO found that the federal government acted properly when itconcluded that the claims contained an uncommon variety ofsand and, therefore, the claims were subject to the patentprovision of the Mining Law of 1872. In addition, the claimholder and the federal government complied with the legaland administrative requirements for patenting. GAO notes,however, that this situation does raise questions about theconsistency of the mining law's patent provision with morerecent national natural resource policies that call for thefederal government to maintain ownership of federal landsand to obtain fair market value for public resources.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

About 13,000 of thesesites are developed, featuring campgrounds, picnic areas,and boating and interpretive sites.  GAO estimates that theForest Service had a $449 million backlog of unmetmaintenance and reconstruction needs at these sites, morethan double the amount the agency reported in 1986. GAOdeveloped its own estimate of the backlog because the ForestService lacks a reliable system for monitoring or reportingon the nationwide condition and maintenance needs of itsdeveloped recreation sites. Forest Service officialsattributed the backlog to a lack of personnel and funds. GAOfound that little of the agency's overall recreation budgetis devoted to making the needed repair, and factors likeaging facilities and increased usage are compounding theproblem. GAO is concerned that deferred maintenance couldultimately result in the loss of many sites. Resourcelimitations were only one of several factors affectingchanges in the size and type and to a lesser extent thenumber and length of season of developed recreation sites.However, resource limitations have reduced and eliminatedservices like garbage collection and site cleaning. TheForest Service is now relying on volunteer and apublic/private cost-share program to help compensate forlimited resources. GAO believes that this strategy--whilehelpful--faces constraints that will limit its effectivenessin reducing the backlog.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

Upwards of 900,000refugees have entered this country over the past decade.Although funds have been appropriated since the expirationof the act in 1988, the amounts involved have declined,shifting refugee resettlement costs to state and localgovernments. As a result of this and diminished funds tostates for job training and other services, Department ofHealth and Human Services assistance per refugee fell 48percent in 1989 constant dollars--from $6,921 to $3,600.This report provides (1) estimates of the costs transferredfrom the federal government to states as a result of recentcuts in federal refugee assistance, (2) information from andviews of public and private sector officials on whetherrecent reductions have resulted in service cutbacks torefugees, and (3) data on changes in the percentage ofrefugees receiving cash assistance and changes in otherindicators of refugee self-sufficiency.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

States generallycomplied with key program requirements by assuring theDepartment of Health and Human Services that they were (1)doing outreach activities, especially for the elderly andhandicapped, and (2) targeting benefits to households mostin need. Also, the four states GAO visited had incorporatedfiscal controls to prevent erroneous payments. GAO foundthat in nearly all states, other government and privatesector programs provide home energy assistance to low-incomehouseholds In fiscal year 1989, this assistance amounted toabout $200 million.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

The Internal RevenueService has had problems with what it characterizes asincompetent and unscrupulous tax return preparers whounderstate their clients' tax liabilities. GAO found thatIRS needs to better ensure that preparers engaged innegligent or abusive tax practices are penalized. AlthoughIRS generally assesses the right penalty once it decides topenalize a preparer, penalty cases are often not opened whenpotential preparer misconduct was evident on returns with atleast $5,000 in taxes owed. This limits IRS' ability topenalize preparers who are guilty of misconduct and mayweaken the agency's ability to deter preparer misconduct forthe large number of returns not reviewed in IRS' examinationprogram. IRS examiners and their supervisors said that theywere reluctant to pursue the penalties because of the lowdollar amounts involved.  Even though preparer penalties maynot yield significant revenues, GAO believes that theirpotential long-term effect in encouraging voluntarycompliance by preparers and their clients should also beconsidered. GAO also found that IRS district officessometimes assess different penalties and penalty amounts forsimilar misconduct. IRS referral of taxpayer preparers fordisciplinary action can provide further incentives forcompliance. However, the effectiveness of this process islimited because referrals are often not made when required.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

Under current agreements to which the UnitedStates is a party, an airline is liable for a maximum ofonly $75,000 per passenger. A new agreement--MontrealAviation Protocol No. 3--is now before the U.S. Senate forratification, accompanied by a plan to provide supplementalcompensation for victims of international aviationdisasters. Overall, GAO concludes that American victims ofinternational aviation accidents and their families would bebetter compensated under Protocol No. 3 than under existinginternal agreements. Claimants would no longer have to provethat the airline was at fault before they receivedcompensation, and incentives would be provided for airlinesto settle claims quickly. Claimants' costs would be reducedbecause in many cases a trial would be avoided. In addition,the Protocol would raise the airlines' liability limit,provide funds for additional compensation of victims, anddecrease the proportion of the damage awards that go topaying claimants' legal costs. The Protocol and the planwould also increase the likelihood that Americans' lawsuitswould be tried in U.S. courts if compensation offers areunsatisfactory, resulting in U.S. standards of compensationbeing used in determining damage awards. Finally, GAOconcludes that Protocol No. 3 is unlikely to harm airlinesafety.  Adverse economic impacts due to aviation accidentsand government safety regulations--not fear of litigation--are the primary incentives for airlines to operate safely.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

InOctober 1986, FHWA began a safety review program to educatemotor carriers--persons or companies that transport goods orpassengers as a business--about federal safety regulationsand to rate the safety management controls that carriershave in place to comply with these regulations. GAO foundthat FHWA had rated about 40 percent of the interstate motorcarriers in business as of May 1990. While the agency hasaccomplished a great deal, about 129,000 carriers still needto be rated before FHWA'S established deadline of September30, 1992. GAO believes that FHWA is unlikely to meet thisdeadline because (1) the universe of carriers is constantlychanging (due to the entry of new carriers and carriers thatmerge and go out of business) and (2) FHWA has assigned alimited number of safety investigators to this task.Although 70 percent of the motor carriers assessed under thesafety review program received a less than satisfactoryrating, FHWA has not adequately implemented its two follow-up procedures for ensuring that carriers correctdeficiencies in safety management controls--certificationletters from carriers and compliance reviews. Until FHWAknows whether carriers have improved their controls, itcannot be sure that its safety review program is promotingthe safe operation of commercial vehicles.The above-described report is available free from the U.S.General Accounting Office, P.O.

Seeks Approval to Divest Twenty-threeSupermarkets in St. Louis AreaFOR YOUR INFORMATION......................JANUARY 10, 1996     Schnuck Markets, Inc. has applied for Federal TradeCommission approval to divest 23 St. Louis, Missouri-areasupermarkets to Family Company of America, which intends tooperate the stores as a single grocery chain under the "National"trade name (see attached list of stores proposed fordivestiture).  The application will be subject to public commentuntil Feb. 9.     Schnucks is based in St. Louis.  Family Company of Americais a newly-formed company, also based in St. Louis, and itssenior management consists largely of former senior managers ofthe National Holdings, Inc. supermarket chain.  The divestituresare required under a 1995 consent order Schnucks signed to settleFTC charges that the firm's acquisition of supermarkets owned byNational Holdings, Inc. would violate federal antitrust law andpotentially lead to anticompetitive pricing and other conductthat could hurt supermarket customers in the St. Louis area.  Theconsent order requires 24 supermarket divestitures so as torestore competition.  Schnucks stated in its application that itstill is seeking a buyer for the 24th store.     According to the application, the proposed divestiture planwill establish a "substantial competitive force in the market." Family would be the third-largest competitor in the market andits size "will enable it to take advantage of available economiesof scale, especially in such areas as purchasing and advertising,and its use of the  National' trade name will help ensure animmediate procompetitive impact," the application states. Schnucks also maintains that the proposed subleases of realestate on which some of the stores are owned "will not adverselyaffect the ability of incentives of Family, Schnucks, or anyother party to compete."

Praxair, based in Danbury, Connecticut, is the largest supplier ofindustrial gases, including atmospheric gases, in America, and the thirdlargest supplier worldwide.  CBI, which competes with Praxair, isheadquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois.       The products at issue in the case are "merchant" atmospheric gases-- nitrogen, oxygen and argon -- supplied to customers via tanker truckor in cylinders (as opposed to atmospheric gases produced for customerson-site or near their production facilities.)  Merchant nitrogen is usedin industrial applications such as heat treating, chemical blanketingand freezing.  Merchant oxygen is used in foundries, steel and glassproduction and for medical purposes.  Merchant argon is primarily usedfor welding. There are no adequate substitutes for any of the threegases, the FTC alleged.     According to the FTC complaint detailing the charges, theacquisition would reduce competition in the merchant oxygen and nitrogenmarkets in both northern and southern California, and also would reducecompetition for merchant nitrogen, oxygen and argon in easternConnecticut and western Wisconsin/southeastern Minnesota.  Entry by anew firm in those markets would be time consuming, costly and unlikely,the complaint says.  Thus, the proposed acquisition would violatefederal antitrust laws in those areas by:     -- eliminating direct competition between Praxair and CBI;          -- enhancing the likelihood of collusion or other anticompetitivepractices among the      remaining competitors in California;     -- eliminating competition between the two closest competitors ineastern Connecticut      and the two closest competitors in westernWisconsin and southeastern Minnesota;     -- increasing the likelihood that Praxair would unilaterallyexercise market power in      eastern Connecticut, western Wisconsin andsoutheastern Minnesota; and,     -- increasing the likelihood that prices for the gases wouldincrease in those geographic  areas.     The proposed consent agreement to settle the charges and restorecompetition would require Praxair to divest, individually or in somecombination, CBI's atmospheric gas production facilities in Vacavilleand Irwindale, California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.The proposed divestitures would have to be completed within 12 monthsfrom the date the order becomes final.  If Praxair were to fail todivest the assets within the specified time frame, the Commission couldappoint a trustee to divest the four plants.      To remedy any anticompetitive effects of the acquisition pendingdivestiture, Praxair must maintain the four CBI production facilities asviable, independent competitors of Praxair's nearby plants. Accordingly, Praxair has agreed to hold the plants separate from itsother businesses and take steps to assure that no confidentialinformation is exchanged between the plants and those other businesses.      The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement forpublic comment was 5-0.  The proposed consent agreement will bepublished in the Federal Register shortly and will be subject to publiccomment for 60 days, after which the Commission will decide whether tomake it final.  Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of theSecretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.20580.NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does notconstitute an admission of a law violation.  When the Commission issuesa consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law withrespect to future actions.  Each violation of such an order may resultin a civil penalty of $10,000.

Therequested modification would eliminate Columbia/HCA's obligationsto "hold separate" the Utah Healthtrust assets pendingdivestiture of a lease for commercial office space in a third-party-owned building in the Salt Lake City area afterColumbia/HCA's divestiture of certain Utah hospitals.  The FTC isseeking public comments on the petition for 10 days, until Jan.22.  Columbia/HCA stated in this petition that, shortly, it willsubmit a second petition in which it will seek to end itsobligation to divest the lease.     The agreement at issue accompanies a consent order thatColumbia/HCA signed to settle FTC charges that its $3 billionmerger with Healthtrust would impair hospital competition --leading to higher prices, reduced services, or both -- in areasof Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Utah.  To restore thatcompetition, the consent order requires a total of sevendivestitures and mandates that Columbia/HCA terminate itsparticipation in a joint venture.  Under the accompanying "holdseparate" agreement, Columbia/HCA is required to operate theassets to be divested independently of its other hospitals.     Columbia/HCA maintains in its petition that the lease is foroffice space used by a company, Infusamed, that provided homehealth/home infusion services and pharmacy services. The consentorder did not require Columbia to divest Infusamed.  And this isa different market than the market at issue in the FTC case,which is acute care inpatient hospital services, the petitionstates.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requestedcomments regarding the promotion of prescription drug productsdirectly to consumers (DTC) through print, broadcast, and othermedia.  Among other things, the agency announced that it "isparticularly interested in exploring whether, and, if so, how,the agency's current regulatory approach should be modified."  The staffs of the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau ofEconomics of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offer thefollowing comments to assist the FDA in its deliberations, basedon our experience in analyzing the effects of information inconsumer product markets and in considering legal requirementsthat address information issues.     The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, whichamong other things prohibits deceptive or unfair practices in oraffecting commerce.  One of the FTC's primary responsibilities isto enforce the law prohibiting deceptive practices in nationaladvertising.  The FTC considers the prevention of deceptivehealth-related advertising claims to be of utmost importance, andhas taken action in numerous cases involving deceptive health-related claims about OTC drugs, food products, dietarysupplements, and medical devices.  In implementing its mandate,the FTC has developed considerable expertise in the role ofadvertising in the consumer information environment.     The staff of the Commission also has experience examiningthe effects of laws affecting advertising on market performance,including in the prescription drug market.  While importantdifferences between advertising for prescription drugs andadvertising for other products might lead to differentapproaches, we believe that the staff's experience, particularlyregarding marketing and economic issues, has a bearing on many ofthe DTC advertising issues on which the FDA is seeking comment.     Truthful and non-misleading advertising can help consumersmanage their own health care.  Advertisements can, for example,provide timely information regarding medical advances, remindconsumers about good health care practices, and supplyinformation needed by consumers to understand and evaluate theirphysician's recommendations.  On the other hand, deceptive ormisleading advertisements in the prescription drug area canimpose particularly high costs on consumers.  Whether or not aparticular advertisement might mislead consumers will turn on thespecific facts associated with that ad (and a determination ofthe claims being made).  Any analysis of the likelihood ofdeception would therefore depend on a case by case evaluation. The FTC staff believes that the Commission's Deception PolicyStatement and its Statement on Advertising Substantiation mayassist the FDA in evaluating prescription drug advertisements.II.  The Potential Effects of DTC Advertising on Consumers and     the Marketplace.      Assessments of DTC regulatory options are likely to dependon one's understanding of DTC advertising's effects on consumersand the marketplace.  In this section we consider this issue. First, we consider the incentives to provide consumers withinformation about drug therapies.  Second, we describe the uniquerole of advertising, in general, and of DTC prescription drugadvertising, in particular, in the consumer informationenvironment.  Third, we describe the potential effects of DTCadvertising on competition.  Finally, we consider how regulationscan be designed to encourage the potentially beneficial effectsof advertising while discouraging its potentially harmfuleffects.     A.   Incentives to Provide Consumers with Information About          Alternative Drug Therapies.     We believe this is a particularly good time to examine thepotential value of DTC advertising.  With the growth of managedcare organizations, consumers are expected to become moreactively involved in their health care decisions and to demandmore information on alternative therapies.  The recent growthof DTC pharmaceutical advertising expenditures is consistentwith the view that consumers are demanding more productinformation.      Substantial information about drug therapies is provided toconsumers by independent parties.  Newspapers report on newdrugs, books describe drug options, magazines discussalternative therapies, and public health organizations providea wealth of information.      Despite the existence of these sources, economic reasoningsuggests that advertising can be an important supplemental sourceof information.  Information, like most goods, is costly toprovide.  However, in contrast to most products, information isnot used up when it is consumed, and it is often possible to useinformation without paying for it, that is, to "free ride."  As aresult, markets may tend to provide consumers with less than theoptimal amount of information.     Advertising can reduce this problem.  Firms will providehealth information to consumers when it is profitable to do so. Profitability depends on several factors that affect the marginal benefits and costs of advertising.  For example,extensive disclosure requirements can substantially increase thecost of advertising, thereby decreasing a firm's incentive toadvertise. (Of course, such disclosures may nonetheless beneeded sometimes to prevent deception).     Firms have strong incentives to provide information aboutdisease conditions and possible treatments if they can associatethe information with products they sell.  Although firms withrelatively large market shares may find it profitable to provideadvertising messages that do not make such an association,smaller competitors are less likely to find such advertisingprofitable, due to the "free-riding" phenomenon.       Incentives to advertise are also enhanced when firms caninitiate new campaigns quickly.  For example, the soonerinformation on product improvements reaches consumers, the soonerfirms can begin through sales to recoup research and developmentinvestments and advertising expenditures.  Similarly, theincentive to advertise is likely to be greater when firms canrespond rapidly to advertising by competitors.     B.   Prescription Drug Advertising as a Unique Source of          Some Information that Can Enhance Consumer Welfare.     Prescription drug advertising, like any type of advertising,represents only one component of the total consumer informationenvironment, which includes the media, package inserts, referencebooks, doctors, and pharmacists.  Advertising, like any of thesecomponents, is better at some tasks than others.  For example,broadcast advertisements are relatively good for disseminatingshort bits of information to large audiences but not forproviding complex information.  Complex information is oftendisseminated more effectively at another point in the productconsideration and purchasing process, such as through labeling atthe point of sale.  Although reference books that describe drugcharacteristics are useful, they may lack information aboutrecent innovations and may not reach a wide audience.  Incontrast, advertising can inform about product innovations assoon as they are brought to market.  Advertising can also remindpeople of information that they might already know but that hasfaded from memory.     Different forms of advertising may have different advantagesand disadvantages as means of communicating information.  Complexinformation is often communicated more effectively through printmedia than through broadcast media.  Internet advertising may beparticularly efficient at reaching small sub-populations with astrong interest in certain types of drugs.       Obviously, one concern with advertised information is thatmanufacturers will be inclined to favor their products. Although some forces weigh against this outcome, they may beinsufficient to prevent firms from making unfounded claims,whether intentionally or inadvertently.  Deceptive claims in theprescription drug area can have serious consequences.     Although prescription drug advertising shares manycharacteristics of advertising in other markets, prescriptiondrugs have several characteristics that make the analysis ofprescription drug advertising to consumers distinctive.  Forexample, product safety and efficacy is a particularly importantissue in this advertising market.  At the product level, thisconcern is addressed by the requirement that all prescriptiondrugs be pre-approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy.       Concerns about product safety and efficacy are reflected incontrol of access to prescription drugs.  Doctors must prescribethem, and they must be dispensed by pharmacists.  These controlsshould help ensure that inappropriate drugs are not used.     Advertising may make consumers aware of more convenient orotherwise more desirable versions of drugs than those theycurrently use.  Advertising may encourage consumers to see adoctor for advice about conditions they might have previouslyignored or for further information about conditions already beingtreated.  Advertising may cause consumers to inquire aboutdiagnostic tests that might not otherwise be performed.  Betterinformed consumers will be better able to understand and discusstheir individual needs with their doctors and pharmacists.  Thus,advertising can help consumers make decisions about their healthcare and health care costs.       C.   Potential Effects of Prescription Drug Advertising on          Price and Quality Competition.     Advertising is an important catalyst for price and qualitycompetition.  Advertising can put downward pressure on prices byspurring competition among alternative therapies.  To theextent that prescription drugs compete with OTC drugs,prescription drug advertising potentially can lead to loweraverage prices for both product categories.  We recognize,however, that the ultimate effect is likely to depend on theevolution of the health care market and on the individualcharacteristics of drug classes and disease conditions.       Quality competition can also be motivated by advertising. Advertising can help foster product improvements by deliveringinformation to consumers on quality variables that they may nototherwise know about.  If consumers prefer products with theadvertised qualities and receive prescriptions for these productsafter consulting with their doctors, then their demand for theadvertised products is reflected in sales and the market reflectsconsumer preferences.     D.   Considerations Regarding Regulation.     We believe that truthful and non-deceptive DTC advertisingcan contribute to consumers' health information environment and consumer welfare.  A review of some recent DTC advertisingsuggests beneficial outcomes are likely, because manyadvertisements focus on the types of claims that we would expectto help consumers, such as, for example, improved convenience andcost advantages.  In addition, recent consumer research evidencesuggests that DTC advertisements are likely to encourage peopleto seek advice from their doctors, which may result in improvedhealth care.      In a regulatory scheme for DTC advertising, therefore, wewould encourage balancing the benefits and the risks of allowingpharmaceutical manufacturers greater latitude in theiradvertising.  In particular, it is important to protect consumersfrom deceptive information but not to stifle truthful informationthat could benefit consumers.  As discussed below, we believethat the net benefits of DTC advertisements can be increased bylimiting current disclosure requirements and by adjustingdisclosure requirements according to the characteristics ofdifferent advertising venues.III. The FTC's Approach to Advertising.     During the FDA's public hearings on October 18 and 19, 1995,regarding DTC prescription drug advertising, many commentatorssuggested that the FDA consider adopting an approach similar tothat used by the FTC.  In light of these suggestions, it may behelpful for us to describe the framework used by the FTCconcerning deceptive advertising.     The Commission's policy with respect to deceptiveadvertising is set out in its Deception Policy Statement andits Statement on Advertising Substantiation.  An advertisementis considered deceptive if it contains a representation oromission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonablyunder the circumstances, and the representation or omission ismaterial, that is, it is likely to affect consumers' decisionsregarding purchase or use of a product.  Thus, the FTC'sapproach involves identifying the claims that are conveyed by anadvertisement, both expressly and by implication, and determiningwhether those claims are truthful and substantiated.       In analyzing an advertisement, the FTC focuses on the netimpression it conveys rather than on the individual elements ofthe ad in isolation.  Because advertisements can misleadconsumers by what they do not say as well as by what they do say,the omission of material information may also render anadvertisement deceptive in some circumstances.  Deception canoccur through omission of information when that information isnecessary to prevent an affirmative representation from beingmisleading, or simply by remaining silent, if doing soconstitutes an implied but false representation.  TheCommission has made clear, however, that "[n]ot all omissions aredeceptive, even if providing the information would benefitconsumers."  An omission is considered deceptive only if theabsence of the information causes the advertisement to convey aninaccurate impression about a material fact.        The FTC's focus when analyzing the adequacy of disclosuresis on their effectiveness in communicating the necessaryinformation in the context of the advertising at issue.  Whendisclosure of information is necessary to prevent anadvertisement from conveying an inaccurate impression, the merephysical presence of the information may not be sufficient toprevent the ad from being considered deceptive.  Thus, theinformation must be included in a manner that is calculated to benoticed, read (or heard, if orally presented), and comprehendedby consumers.IV.  Considering DTC Prescription Drug Advertising Issues in     Light of the FTC's Approach.     A.   The "Brief Summary."     The FDA in its Federal Register Notice asked whether, and ifso, how, the "brief summary" disclosure requirements forprescription drug advertising should be modified in the contextof consumer directed advertising for prescription drugs.       Under an FTC deception analysis, the primary questions wouldbe whether the brief summary requirements are necessary toprevent deception, and, if so, whether they effectivelycommunicate the necessary information to consumers.  Pursuantto the FTC's deception authority, this would be a case-by-caseanalysis, as the focus would be on the net impression conveyed bya specific advertisement, and whether any or all of the briefsummary requirements would be necessary to prevent thatadvertisement from conveying a deceptive impression.     The FTC's experience in enforcing the law pertaining todeception indicates that it is often difficult to effectivelycommunicate information to consumers.  More complicated messagesare more difficult to convey to consumers in an understandablemanner.  Fine print disclosures, whether in print or broadcastadvertising, are often insufficient to effectively communicateimportant information.     The "brief summary" that currently appears in consumerdirected prescription drug advertising is obviously highlytechnical, complicated, and lengthy.  It is often presented infine print, in language that is designed for health careprofessionals rather than lay persons.  We believe that theinformation contained therein is therefore unlikely to be readilyfocused on and understood by consumers.      Moreover, if the "brief summary" included information thatwas necessary to prevent deception or other consumer injury, wewould be concerned that it would not be effectively communicatedby the current format.  The sheer volume of information requiredto be disclosed may itself contribute to a reduced comprehensionof any such specific important information.     Alternative means could be considered for ensuring consumeraccess to information that is important for consumers to have butthat is not necessary to prevent deception or injury.  Forinstance, certain kinds of DTC advertisements could provide an"800" number for consumers to call for further information, oran alternative source for consumers to obtain the information. They could also encourage consumers to ask their doctors aboutproduct risks and benefits and to ask their pharmacists forpackage insert information.     B.   Tailoring Regulation to the Advertising Medium.     The FDA also asked whether broadcast advertisements shouldbe subject to the same "brief summary" requirements asadvertisements in other media.       Differences among media may affect the likelihood ofdeception from advertising claims and, therefore, theappropriateness of particular approaches to preventing deception. Television advertising typically is presented in thirty to sixtysecond lengths, although fifteen and even ten secondadvertisements are not uncommon.  The brevity of televisionadvertising makes it very difficult to include lengthy or complexdisclosures, or to do so in a comprehensible manner.  Printadvertising, on the other hand, is more conducive tocommunicating relatively complex information than TV advertisingbecause people can read print advertisements at their own speed,and even re-read the information if so inclined.  Similarly,advertising on the Internet can be read at one's own pace and canbe saved or printed for future reference.  Thus, a claim readquickly in a broadcast advertisement might present a differentlikelihood of deception than does the same claim appearing in aprint or on-line format.  Given the variety of media in whichadvertising appears, it may be appropriate in designing measuresto prevent deception, such as disclosure requirements, to takeinto account practical differences among various advertisingvenues.  For instance, the FTC has recognized these differencesand in some cases in which disclosures have been imposed hasdesigned abbreviated versions for use in broadcast media.  Ifnecessary, abbreviated disclosures could be supplemented throughrequirements that more detailed information be made available onrequest and that consumers be made aware of this option.     The FDA has also requested comments regarding the regulationof new advertising technologies, such as the Internet.  Althoughdeveloping information technologies present new possibilities forthe innovative delivery of valuable information to consumers,these technologies can be used to deceive consumers.  Althoughnew media such as the Internet clearly present new challengeswith respect to monitoring and enforcing laws against deception,we believe that the core principles underlying the FTC'sdeception policy apply as well to these developing technologiesas to more traditional advertising media.     C.   Identifying the Source of an Advertisement.     The FDA also seeks comment concerning infomercials andmanufacturer-supported DTC promotions that appear to be sponsoredby independent third-party services.     Consumers' evaluation of information may be affected by aninaccurate perception regarding its sponsorship.  A potential fordeception therefore exists when consumers do not know that whatappears to be a news broadcast or other programming is really aninfomercial, or that what appears to be independently suppliedinformation is really supplied by a product's manufacturer.     This concern about infomercials underlies numerous actionsin recent years by the FTC, challenging the formats used asdeceptive.  In these cases, the FTC typically barredadvertisers from misrepresenting the nature of the "program" andrequired them to disclose, at the beginning of an infomercial andimmediately before any product ordering information, that whatconsumers are watching is a paid commercial.     The FTC also has addressed the third-party endorsementissue, both in its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements andTestimonials in Advertising and in law enforcement actions. The Guides suggest that the connections between an endorser and aseller of an advertised product that "might materially affect theweight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection isnot  reasonably expected by the audience')," should bedisclosed.  The FTC has applied the standards described in theGuides in particular cases, involving endorsers that werebusiness associates of the marketer, an endorser that was anofficer or director, an endorser that was an employee of theadvertiser, and an endorser that was a product distributor. The concern in these cases is that the endorsers had anundisclosed financial interest in promoting the products.  Again,the likelihood of deception depends on the specifics of anindividual ad, and the analysis is therefore conducted on a case-by-case basis.     D.   Regulation of Price Advertising.     As the FDA reviews its advertising regulations, one issuenot mentioned in the Notice may also deserve attention.  TheFDA's existing brief summary requirements may have theinadvertent effect of unnecessarily restricting the disseminationof price information.  While the FDA regulations exempt certaintypes of price claims from the brief summary requirement, theexemption is narrow and apparently would apply only toadvertisements of the price of a specific quantity of a drug, andnot, for instance, to comparative price claims, coupons or otherforms of price reduction information.       The brief summary requirement adds to the cost ofadvertising and may be expected therefore to reduce the amount ofadvertising.  With respect to price advertising, therefore, thebrief summary requirements may result in less price competition. Price advertising can result in lower prices for consumers.  Wetherefore suggest that FDA evaluate whether its limitations onthe exemption for price claims are necessary and desirable.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FTC AND ANTITRUST DIVISION TODAY via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996Calendar for Week of January 15, 1996Issue No. 96-02                 For the week of January 15, 1996                       COMMISSION MEETINGS          (Meetings and agendas are subject to change)Wed.

In the past, the partieswould nevertheless be facing a lengthy administrative trial, the price forhaving forced the FTC's hand.  But under the Commission's new enforcementpolicy, the matter is now moot.The $226 million transaction would have given Questar a monopoly over naturalgas transmission services in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC charged in itsshort-lived suit.Questar had a monopoly until 1992, the FTC said, when the Kern River pipelineopened to provide competition in the area.  Kern River is jointly andequally-owned by Tenneco and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company.  Allowing Questarto gain half ownership in Kern River would halt newly emerged competition inthe area, according to the agency.A senior FTC official said the agency is paying "special attention" toacquisitions in this newly deregulated industry and assigned at least 10Competition Bureau attorneys to this investigation.  In this instance, theofficial said, the staff identified an unusually strong "potentialcompetition" case:  although the acquired company hadn't made a single sale inthe market in which the acquiring company was selling, it had been makingoffers and Questar allegedly always lowered its price and won the business.The case, filed in federal district court in Utah, bears a strikingresemblance to the Justice Department's successful attempt to halt theacquisition of one California natural gas company by another area company inthe 1960s.  The district court allowed that transaction to proceed.  But theSupreme Court, in U.S.  v.  El Paso Natural Gas Co., et.  al.  (376 U.S.  651)reversed the district court, ruling that mere attempts by the acquired companyto enter the market -- though unsuccessful -- had a "powerful influence" onthe market.Questar's decision to abandon the transaction effectively ended theCommission's enforcement activities in this case.  In the past, Questar couldhave been facing administrative litigation.  FTC decisions on whether toproceed with administrative litigation have been made on a case-by-case basis,but respondents rarely escaped.For instance, in 1991, the Commission chose not to proceed to administrativelitigation after going into court to enjoin Wiggins Teape Appleton plc fromacquiring a Vancouver, Washington paper mill owned by Boise CascadeCorporation.  Wiggins did not abandon that transaction until 20 days after theFTC asked a federal court for a preliminary injunction.Under the Commission's new policy it is standard for the agency to close casesonce the acquisition in question is abandoned.  The FTC previously pursuedmost cases administratively when the parties pushed the matter into court,even if only to get an order requiring prior approval of future transactions.Prior approval provisions in orders are now the exception, not the rule, underthe Commission's new policy.REFERENCE: FTC Press Release, December 27Civ. 2:95CV 1127S (D.

Praxair has agreed to divest four merchantatmospheric gas production plants to settle those charges.Those who stayed awake through science class know that nitrogen, oxygen andargon are the three "atmospheric gases."  They are also very popularcommercial, or "merchant," gases and are shipped to customers either as aliquid, by tanker truck, or in cylinders.Nitrogen is used to create inert environments for heat treating and chemicalblanketing.  Food industries and others also use nitrogen for freezingproducts.  Oxygen is used for combustion and oxidation in foundries, steel andglass plants and for medical purposes.  Argon is used primarily for welding.The common trait of all three gases is that they have no common traits withother gases; there are no suitable substitutes for any of the three.But the gases also have their differences, and the FTC's case against Praxaircarefully balances those differences.  Nitrogen and oxygen can be economicallyshipped only 150 to 300 miles, for instance, while argon -- a more expensivegas -- can be economically shipped much longer distances, up to about 1,000miles, according to the FTC.If Praxair were to acquire CBI, unfettered by divestiture, the Northern andSouthern California markets for nitrogen and oxygen could be hard hit, theagency charged.  In both areas, five competitors would become four.  InNorthern California the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) would jump 431 pointsto 3366, and Praxair would control 32 percent of the market, the FTC said.  InSouthern California, the HHI would take a similar jump, 440 points, landing at2727 in a market where Praxair would dominate with a 34.8 percent share.Nitrogen and oxygen markets in the Northern Midwest and Northeastern U.S.  --and narrower markets therein, such as the Western Wisconsin/SoutheasternMinnesota area and Eastern Connecticut -- could also be harmed, according tothe FTC.The same goes for the merchant argon markets in Eastern Connecticut and theWestern Wisconsin/Southeastern Minnesota area, where Praxair and CBI are "eachother's closest geographic competitor."  CBI's share of the argon market issmall, the FTC said.  But because its plant is so close to Praxair's in thosetwo areas, "localized unilateral anticompetitive effects are likely."Praxair has agreed to divest four of CBI's atmospheric gas productionfacilities.  Plants will be divested in Vacaville, California; Irwindale,California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.REFERENCE: FTC Press Release, January 11961-0017; Contact: James H.

Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divestthe Cordis's neuroscience business to a Commission-approved buyer within oneyear to settle charges that the acquisition would place 85% of the U.S.neurological shunt market into the hands of only two firms.Neurological shunts are used to treat patients -- primarily children --suffering from the potentially fatal brain disorder hydrocephalus, whichinvolves excessive pressure on the brain from an increase of fluid in theskull.  The shunts, once installed, divert cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into thebloodstream of patients suffering from hydrocephalus.Combining the shunt businesses of Johnson & Johnson and Cordis would raise theHerfindahl-Hirschman Index to 4059 for the market, the FTC charged.  Themerger would likely lead to higher prices and reduced innovation in themarket, according to the agency.Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest the Cordis neuroscience business, whichincludes shunts, intracranial pressure drainage systems and neuroendoscopyproducts, tools used to install shunts.  The FTC alleged competitive problemsonly in the market for shunts.  But "[significant synergies between theproducts manufactured and sold by the [Cordis neuroscience business] exist,and Cordis's shunts are sold as part of a broader product line," the FTC staffsaid in its analysis.  "Therefore, a divestiture of the whole business isnecessary to maintain competition in the shunt market."There is one potential snag to the divestiture:  a joint venture betweenCordis and Nobles-Lai Engineering, Inc.  to research, develop and manufactureneuroendoscopy products.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, thedivestiture could be held up, allowing Nobles-Lai to benefit from Johnson &Johnson's marketing outlet and possibly giving Johnson & Johnson control overCordis, a situation the proposed order was meant to prevent.To prevent that from occurring the proposed order includes an insurancepolicy.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, Johnson & Johnson hasagreed not to contract with Nobles-Lai to research, develop or market anyneuroendoscopy products.  Johnson & Johnson further agreed not to purchasefrom or distribute for Nobles-Lai any such products.REFERENCE: FTC Press Release, December 20961-0014; Contact: Ann Malester or Michael R.

As envisioned, the company would not directlydivest to another company its turbomolecular pump subsidiary, Balzers-PfeifferGmbH, but would instead offer the shares in Balzers-Pfeiffer.  After that, thepump unit would operate as a stand-alone business.Divestiture of Balzers-Pfeiffer is required under a 1995 order settlingcharges that Switzerland-based Oerlikon-Buhrle's acquisition of Leybold AG, aGerman corporation, would harm competition in the U.S.  turbomolecular pumpmarket.  Turbomolecular pumps are small "jet engine-like devices" whichproduce high vacuum atmospheres used in the production of semiconductors.[FTC:WATCH No.  422, November 7, 1994]The FTC has requested public comment until February 1 on the proposed IPO,though no details of the plan are currently available.  Oerlikon-Buhrle mustfirst jump through Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hoops beforeBalzers-Pfeiffer can go public, and securities law prohibits disclosure of allbut the most basic data about an IPO until a registration statement has beenfiled with the SEC.  Once that statement has been filed, the Commission plansto offer the public an additional opportunity to comment, though notnecessarily an additional 30 days.The FTC has approved novel forms of divestiture in the past.  In March, 1994it approved Valspar Corporation's plan to combine four of its own plants andfive plants from a company it acquired into a new company, which was then spunoff to shareholders.

The agency staff, responding tosuggestions from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is busy readying aproposal for the FTC that could change the way cigarette tar, nicotine andcarbon monoxide values are determined and how they are advertised.An NCI panel announced it would suggest changes a year ago after concludingthe FTC testing procedures yield tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide figuresthat do not accurately reflect the amount of those substances consumersactually get from smoking.  The tobacco industry may agree with thatconclusion, according to a December 28 Wall Street Journal report.  The reportquotes an internal Philip Morris document that said the FTC testing method"should be retained:  It gives low ratings."Consumer Protection Bureau Chief Jodie Bernstein acknowledged that her staffis working on a proposal based on the NCI panel's suggestions.  The NCI hasnot yet released an official report of the two-day conference conducted by itspanel in December 1994 but the report is expected within the month.  The panelitself released its findings at the conclusion of the conference.  [FTC:WATCHNo.  425, December 19, 1994]The NCI panel recommended modifications to the FTC's testing methodology totest the "ranges" of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes.Those ranges should be graphically depicted on each pack of cigarettes sold,according to NCI, which further suggested use of "appropriate" disclaimers onpackages and in ads for cigarettes classified as either "light" or "ultralight."  The disclaimers would inform consumers that, at best, evidencesuggests minimal health benefits from smoking lower tar cigarettes.The FTC staff is exploring ways to change the machine testing protocols tomore accurately reflect the way smokers actually smoke, according toBernstein.  The staff proposal will also focus on changes in advertising thatwould more accurately reflect the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxidesmokers actually get from smoking.  A graphic depiction of the ranges is amongthe proposals under consideration at the FTC.The NCI panel's suggestion of a graphic depiction of the ranges on every packis a recommendation that could run up against the Cigarette Labeling andAdvertising Act.  That law mandates rotating health warnings on cigarettepackages and bars the FTC from requiring any alternative warning.  But the Actdoes not restrict the FTC from requiring alternative health warnings inadvertising.  It is in ads, not on packages, that the FTC staff is consideringmandating the graphs of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide values.At the FDAThe FDA attempt to restrict tobacco advertising in the name of children istaking heat off any FTC effort at tobacco advertising regulation.  The tobaccoindustry launched a major legal strike against the FDA proposal earlier thismonth, on the deadline for comments.  As the media scrambled to cover thetobacco industry offensive, the FTC's comment to the FDA got lost in theshuffle.But those comments supported the FDA's goal -- to make cigarettes lessaccessible and less attractive to children.  The FTC recommended narrowlytailoring the regulations to that goal to avoid a First Amendment fight butencouraged the FDA to "consider a coordinated regulatory enforcement approachwith state and local government agencies."Commissioner Mary L.  Azcuenaga concurred with the FTC filing of comments atthe FDA, but only "insofar as it reflects the Commission's expertise inanalyzing advertising claims."  The constitutionality of the FDA's regulationsis not for the FTC to consider, she said.  "I would have preferred that theCommission's comment focus on the empirical basis for the assumptions on whichthe proposed regulations rest."  Azcuenaga would also have preferred that heragency's comments have addressed those studies not contained or referenced inthe FDA notice that could "undermine the basis for the proposed regulations."FDA will have to face that issue sooner or later if there is a First Amendmentchallenge, she opined.The FTC comments also noted that the panel's Notice of Proposed Rulemakinglinked use of tobacco products by kids with advertising but did "not indicatethat tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ratings play any role in the decisionsof children and adolescents to use tobacco products, or to choose among thevarious products."Advertising industry associations added their voices to the FDA's mountain ofcomments.  It is the FTC, not the FDA, that has jurisdiction over tobaccoadvertising issues, according to the American Association of AdvertisingAgencies (AAAA).  The AAAA also opposes the FDA proposal on First Amendmentgrounds but was careful to limit its objections to advertising issues alone.The ad group did not address whether the FDA has authority to regulate tobaccoproducts as drugs.REFERENCE:  FTC Press Advisory, January 3 (FTC comments to FDA); Contact:  Lee Peeler, 202/326-3090 FAXLine No.  1681 (32 pages)Back to Headline List CopyrightFTC:WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996Lighter hand proposed forprescription drug advertisingThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should use a looser, less regulatorystyle for direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs, the FTCstaff has advised.  Important benefits can come from DTC advertising.  But thecurrent structure required in ads could be limiting those benefits, said staffmembers of the FTC's Economics and Consumer Protection Bureaus in comments tothe FDA last week.Currently, disclosures that appear in ads -- known as "Brief Summaries" -- are"highly technical, complicated and lengthy," the FTC staff said.  A bettersolution might be simple disclosures advising consumers to check with theirdoctors for more information.The FDA's existing brief summary requirement may also inadvertently preventprice advertising and the use of coupons and other price reduction devices,according to the FTC staff.  Because price advertising can result in lowerprices, the FDA should consider whether limitations on price advertising are"necessary and desirable."REFERENCE: FTC staff comments (January 11, 1996); FDA Docket No. 95N-0227; Contact: Susan Cohn, 202/326-3053 or Jan Pappalardo, 202/326-3380FAXLine No.  1693 (30 pages)Back to Headline List CopyrightFTC:WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996Self-regulation may move to labels;but NLEA not part of the planThe current self-regulatory mandate for the advertising industry should beextended to include claims made on product labels, a panel of advertisingindustry experts has recommended.  But it is not the industry's business toconsider whether labels meet specific Food and Drug Administration (FDA)labeling requirements, the panel said.  The National Advertising ReviewCouncil (NARC), overseer of industry self-regulation efforts, is expected tovote on the group's recommendations within the next few months.The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Better Business Bureau, thefirst stop for ads in the industry's self-regulation process, has looked atlabel claims in past cases.  But it has done so cautiously, admitting in a1994 case report that "labels are not normally held to be within thejurisdiction of the NAD."  The panel's recommendations, if accepted, wouldmake label inquiries commonplace.But it is the duty of the NAD to evaluate only whether the ads are false,deceptive or misleading, not whether the labels violate FDA or othergovernment regulations, the panel stressed.  The FDA maintains rules fornutrition labeling, promulgated under the Nutrition Labeling Education Act(NLEA), that are stricter than the FTC standards for food advertising.In other news:* Champion's Jogbra may be "technically unsurpassed," but the company hadinsufficient evidence that its product was superior to all others in thecategory "across-the-board," NAD ruled.  Champion promised to cooperate withthe NAD and "communicate more clearly" intended claims.* John O.  Butler Company submitted test data for its Secure Denture AdhesivePaste showing consumers preferred Secure to other denture adhesives.  The testwas flawed, the NAD ruled, and could not back claims that Secure "outholds theleading brands."  The disputed ads are scheduled to run through January 1996,after which they will not be repeated, the company said.* Life Services Supplements, Inc.  agreed to modify ads for its Citri-ThinDiet Supplement after the NAD expressed concerns that the ads might suggestthat Citri-Thin alone could help shed and keep off pounds.  The ads shouldinclude a statement informing consumers that a proper diet and exercise shouldsupplement Citri-Thin.REFERENCE: For copies of NAD or NARB case reports contact Eve Carr, 703/247-9316.Back to Headline List CopyrightFTC:WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996Federalism:Maine goes it aloneagainst debt collectorsWell before the GOP-dominated Congress decided to give more power to thestates, the state of Maine decided it would seek a little power on its own.In 1994 Maine asked to be exempt from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act(FDCPA).  The FTC granted that request just before the new year.The FDCPA, passed in 1978, has always allowed states the option ofindependently regulating debt collectors.  In theory, the Act is a minimumsafety net -- states are allowed to pass stricter regulations, but theirregulations must be at least as strict as those outlined in the FDCPA if theyhope to be exempt from the Act.The FTC has now ruled unanimously that Maine's laws protect consumers at leastas well as the FDCPA.  In some instances, the agency noted, the state offersbetter protection.  For instance, Maine has a staff in its Bureau of ConsumerCredit Protection (BCCP) dedicated to protecting the state's consumers fromunfair debt collection practices.  The staff can pursue leads and bringactions the federal government does not have the manpower to pursue.  Andbecause Maine takes a "hands-on" enforcement approach, unfair practices can bestopped quicker, the FTC said, before much damage is done.Civil penalties are lower under Maine's law than under the FDCPA.  But thatState has an enforcement tool the federal government does not -- revocation ofa debt collector's license.  Maine's "strengths more than offset theweaknesses," the FTC said.  And Maine consumers may still privately sue debtcollectors under the FDCPA.Maine is required to file a report with the FTC every two years to keep theCommission apprised of its activities.  The FTC solicited public comments onthe State's proposal in May, 1994.  [FTC:WATCH No.  413, May 23, 1994]REFERENCE: FTC Press Advisory, December 28Contact: John F.

The lucky ones dodged thepotentially fatal effects of inhaling quick-freeze aerosol glass frostingspray and steered clear of nasty itching fits from fiberglass curtains.  Butstill they were liable to succumb to shady salesman looking to make a fastbuck on non-prismatic binoculars, too-tiny sleeping bags and tablecloths, andextension ladders that didn't quite do the job.The FTC made some rules to stop all that.  All that stopped.  Now, those ruleshave gone the way of disco, and not a decade too soon.  By repealing six morerules, the Commission has now killed seven rules and eight guides.* The Quick Freeze Spray Rule (1969-1995) required manufacturers of aerosolspray products used for frosting beverage glasses to warn consumers thatinhaling the product could be fatal.  The product left the market in 1982,according to the FTC staff, ushered out by that bastion of good taste, Ronco,Inc., marketer of the Popiel Pocket Fisherman.  No product, no rule, theCommission said in repealing the rule.* The Fiberglass Curtain Rule (1967-1995) was likewise unnecessary, sincefiberglass curtains are no longer sold for consumer use.  They were popular inthe 1960s because they were fire retardent.  They were also, well, fiberglass,which says "itchy" to anyone who knows the material.  But technology hasevolved and many fire-retardent fabrics that do not cause skin irritation havereplaced fiberglass fabrics.  No product, no rule.* The Binocular Rule (1964-1995) required marketers of non-prismaticbinoculars to say that their product was non-prismatic.  Technology has driventhe price of prisms down since the rule was promulgated, and nearly allbinoculars today use prisms.  Those that don't -- opera and field glasses, forinstance -- are clearly marketed in a category separate from binoculars, theFTC staff reasoned.  No product, no rule.* The Sleeping Bag Rule (1963-1995) and the Tablecloth Rule (1964-1995) bothgoverned the measurements manufacturers could use when advertising, labelingand marking their products.  The National Conference on Weight and Measures'Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation, adopted by 47 states, now governsthe very same thing, for sleeping bags, tablecloths, etc.  State rules in, fedrules out, said the FTC.* Finally, the Extension Ladder Rule (1969-1995) set out rules for labelingextension ladders.  Surprised?  American National Standards Institute (ANSI)standard A14 does the same.  Industry standard in, fed rule out.The FTC's review of old rules continues.  The initiative was started wellbefore President William Jefferson Clinton and his sidekick, Albert Gore, Jr.,decided to reinvent government, but they're not complaining about "overzealousderegulation" at the FTC, either.REFERENCE: FTC Press Advisory, December 21Contact: Carol J.

Workshopscheduled for late March;consumers reactingJudging from the latest consumer comments to hit the public record in theFTC's search for a "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and labeling standard,the Commission's old standard is still the best standard.The FTC has historically required unqualified Made in the U.S.A.  claims to bebacked by a product made entirely, or virtually entirely, in the UnitedStates.  Manufacturers, citing the increasingly global marketplace, haveargued that few products can nowadays meet such a stringent standard.Consumers, however, have asked the FTC to maintain that high standard forunqualified claims.  "If 75% of the product was made in the USA and 25% wasmade in China, then state that on the label," says one commenter.  Moregruffly, another expressed the same sentiment:  "If a shoe is 20% foreign +80% [Made in the] USA, say so -- we can handle it."The Alabama Textile Manufacturers Association, Inc.  agreed.  "The consumer isentitled to know where a product is manufactured.  We believe any attempt to'fuzzy' that information is wrong," the association said in urging the FTC toretain is standard.The Commission will grapple with "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising andlabeling issues at a public workshop to be held March 26, 27 and possibly even28, 1996, depending "on the number of issues raised."  Requests to participatein the conference are due by January 16.Commissioner Roscoe B.  Starek III dissented without comment on the 4-1Commission decision to schedule the workshop.

In a December7, 1995 letter to an attorney representing the proposed Southern ArizonaTherapy Network, Inc.  (SATNET), the FTC gave a clean bill of health to theventure which, among other things, will rely on a messenger model whencollecting fee information and reporting that information to its members.Under the messenger model, SATNET will act merely as a messenger of feeinformation, collecting it from third-party payers and reporting thatinformation to its members without recommendation.  The FTC/DOJ Health CareStatements set out a safety zone for messenger model ventures that leave up tothe venture's individual members decisions on whether to accept or rejectreimbursement levels.SATNET's plans to collect non-fee information also fall within the safetyzones in the policy statements, the FTC staff said.  And potential futureplans for SATNET to coordinate the setting of capitation rates for its membersis unlikely to cause problems because of the low number of therapistsparticipating in the plan.  Only 13% of physical therapists in the area, 6% ofoccupational therapists and 1% of speech therapists have signed on.REFERENCE: FTC Press Advisory, December 19Contact: David R. Pender or Judith A.

In fact, collusion is actually encouraged in the shipping industry,and that may lead to higher rates with few offsetting benefits, according to anew government report.Paul S.  Clyde of the DOJ's Antitrust Division and James D.  Reitzes, formerlyof the FTC's Economics Bureau, argue that the use of shipping conferences toset prices for international shipping leads to higher rates when the marketshare of the conference participants is high.  The Shipping Act of 1984,overseen by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), grants antitrust immunityto these conferences, which have existed since the 19th century.  While theconferences do not act as perfect cartels, they don't promote perfectcompetition either, say Clyde and Reitzes in their December, 1995 report, "TheEffectiveness of Collusion Under Antitrust Immunity:  The Case of LinerShipping Conferences."Conference participants must submit rates to the FMC for review and approval.The FMC is charged with assuring the rates are neither too high nor too low.In some conferences, shippers are legally allowed to discount the fees theyfile.  But in many others, discounting is deemed rebating, a practice that theFMC condemns.  Between 1985 and 1989, the FMC assessed more than $12 millionin penalties for rebating, the report states, essentially charging companieswith the egregious practice of competing on price.The evidence "indicates that conferences do not act as perfect cartelsmaximizing the joint profits of their members," according to the report."Nonetheless, we find that the level of freight rates is significantly loweron routes where conference members are free to negotiate service contractsdirectly with shippers."The authors note that higher prices were found "on routes where theconference's market share is relatively high (over 80%)."  There may beefficiencies that spring from conferences.  But "even if collective pricing isrequired to encourage efficiency-enhancing investment, the associatedanticompetitive harm may still outweigh the efficiency benefits."REFERENCE:  FTC Press Release, January 4 "The Effectiveness of Collusion Under Antitrust Immunity:  The Case of Liner Shipping Conferences;" Contact: Timothy P.

While pondering thatquestion (until the comment deadline of January 31), consider these other CareLabeling Rule teasers:* Should the mention of new technologies, such as "professional wet cleaning,"be allowed on care labels?* If a garment can be washed or dry-cleaned, should manufacturers be requiredto let consumers know how to wash the product at home?  The rule now allowssuch garments to be labeled with the words "dry clean," though they may notbear the tag "dry clean only."* Should the FTC clarify what constitutes a "reasonable basis" for careinstructions?* Should the definition of water temperatures be changed to reflect currentwashing machine settings?Proposed answers to those questions will be accepted until March 12 as theFTC's review of the Care Labeling Rule continues.

PETA, a combative animal rights group, has proposed"ordering" manufacturers to come up with simpler labels for leather andnonleather goods.  The group recommends that all leather products be labeled"Animals Suffered to Make This Product."  Any non-leather good could belabeled a "Cruelty-free Product."  In this respect, PETA differs from theNational Consumers League (NCL), which has asked the FTC to examine the use ofgeneral claims such as "cruelty-free."  NCL believes such claims are fuzzy.Dead Animals (II):  Leather Industries of America, Inc.  has asked theCommission to set a minimum leather content standard -- 75% -- for productslabeled as "bonded leather."  Bonded leather is leather and non-leather bondedtogether to make a consumer product.  The FTC's Leather Guides currently allowuse of the term bonded leather even if only 1% of a product is leather,according to Leather Industries President Charles S.  Myers.Stephen F.  Quill, President of Ecological Fibers, Inc.  suggests callingproducts with a low leather content "reinforced bonded leather."  Quill's firmmakes book bindings that contain 20% leather.

Ads for InternationalServices allegedly implied the company knew of available jobs, had ties toFortune 1000 companies and had an 80% placement rate, none of which was true.The suit could land Mink in a federal penitentiary for several years ifsuccessful, based on current Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

Ang sending checks throughthe mail or by Federal Express to pay for ads placed in newspapers across thecountry qualifies as mail fraud, the indictment states.Though ads promised significant job placement assistance, Mink's businessconsisted mainly of resume preparation, according to the indictment.Last September a federal district court judge ordered Mink to pay a$593,206.27 judgment, the amount the court determined had been taken in thescheme.Back to Headline List CopyrightFTC:WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996Calorie claims don't add upfor Mama Tish's ice cups, agency allegesRepresentations for Mama Tish's Italian Specialties ice cups get a chillyreception from the FTC.

Those of us who teach law and try to engage in scholarshipknow better than most that, without him, the world is a lesser place.Much of Phil Areeda's public life was committed to antitrust scholarship andhis teaching at Harvard Law School.  I once mentioned to Phil that histreatise was the longest in the history of Western thought not written inGerman.  He enjoyed the description.  At the time he was still working onvolume six or seven, and his response was:  "you have no idea".  At his death,he was working on volume eleven (and anxious that there would not be timeenough to complete the task) and planning volume twelve.The treatise --unique in legal scholarship in its ambition and scope -- wasbegun jointly with Donald Turner and completed with the help of HerbHovenkamp.When work on this treatise started, antitrust was a jumble of conflictingideologies, irreconcilable cases and some diffuse and half--baked ideas.  Thegoal of the authors was nothing less than to bring some order out of thatchaos and they succeeded admirably.  It is amazing the way sections of thetreatise migrated directly to Court of Appeals and Supreme Court decisions andestablished the standard for competitive behavior.Other aspects of Phil Areeda's scholarship were special.  He was endlesslycareful and meticulous -- some scholars would conclude after two or threedrafts,that they were "close enough" to being right and move on.  Phil neverquit reworking a subject until he was fully-satisfied.  There is also aquality of "fairness" in his work -- to scholars with whom he might disagree,to legislative intent, to prior judicial opinions -- that is all too rare inscholarship.  It often appeared that Phil was at greater pains in statingfairly the position of adversaries than in elaborating his own views.  Healways tried to give judicial decisions the benefit of a best rather than aworst interpretation.  Even when he disagreed, he did so with respect andwithout rancor.  Finally, Phil was comfortable with ideology but practical aswell.  He recognized that people and courts are fallible, and that life is notinvariably rational, and his interpretations and conclusions reflect thatunderstanding.Much of the history of antitrust development in recent decades involves theintegration of economics into antitrust analysis.  Phil Areeda (along with DonTurner) were among the very best in bringing economic analysis to bear withoutallowing it to become overly technical or impractical.  It is common now forlegal briefs and scholarly analysis in the antitrust field to cite and discusseconomic insights as well as legal precedent.  That was not true (or at leastnot as true) before Phil helped reshape the field.While most people are aware of Phil's work through the treatise, his principalcommitment may have been as a teacher at the Harvard Law School.  He wasexceptionally popular in the classroom and invariably respected.  Some havedescribed his teaching (heavy with the traditional Socratic method) asorthodox and even "old-fashioned.  That is a fair description if"old--fashioned" means that he was rigorous in class, well organized, andconstantly courteous to his students.  Unlike the current style in somequarters, Phil in the classroom was not there to inculcate students with hispersonal views of the world, but rather to teach a subject.  He brought to theclassroom a sense that he thought his subject was interesting and important,and an infectious enthusiasm that never waned.Somewhere along the way, Phil developed a discriminating taste for good food,good wine, good books and opera.  His wine cellar was the most extraordinaryprivate collection I have seen.  Occasionally we would have lunch or dinner atexcellent places like Lutece, the famous French restaurant in New York.  Philwas a connoisseur and knew the best from second-best, but once the mealstarted, he never discussed the food or the wine -- he enjoyed them anddiscussed other interesting things.Through his teaching, Phil influenced the attitudes and careers of thousandsof Harvard students.  The Areeda Turner Treatise and his other scholarshipwere the most important and constructive influences on antitrust policy in ageneration.  Scores of scholars around the country can testify to hisgenerosity in offering advice, ideas, even inspiration.  Shortly before hisdeath, Phil said "my life has been teaching and writing."  It was a life welllived.Back to Headline List CopyrightFTC:WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1996EmploymentThe Washington, D.C.  office of a growing national firm seeks attorney with6-8 years experience in antitrust counseling to help serve the firm's existingclients and to develop new business opportunities.

But its temporary effect, at least, was to maintain theindustry's unbroken string of victories in product liability suitsbrought by smokers and their families.The verdict was returned in 1988 in a suit by Antonio Cipollone,widower of Rose Cipollone, who died of cancer in 1984 at the age of58 after more than four decades of smoking.Like the trial judge, the appeals court accepted a distinctionbetween tobacco companies' liability before and after 1966, when thegovernment began requiring warnings of health hazards on packs. Butinterpretations differed on several points.At the trial, only the Liggett Group Inc. was found liable becausebefore 1966 Rose Cipollone smoked only one of its brands. PhillipMorris Inc. and Lorillard Inc. were dismissed as defendants becauseshe smoked their cigarettes after that period.And the jury returned a verdict only for Antonio Cipollone, notRose's estate, because it found her principally responsible for herown injury.The appellate court overturned U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin onboth counts.Elements of the Third Circuit's decision:* To prevail on the theory known as express warranty, plaintiffs'attorneys must prove not only that tobacco companies ran pre-1966advertisements implying that smoking wasn't harmful but also that theplaintiff relied on those representations.Rose Cipollone's reliance on the ads cannot be presumed but must beproved, the court said, and Liggett's lawyers should have the chanceto prove that Rose Cipollone either was unaware of the ads or didn'tbelieve their message."The advertising constituted an express warranty...as long as Mr.Cipollone can prove that Mrs. Cipollone was aware of theadvertisements and as long as Liggett does not prove that shedisbelieved them," the appellate court ruled.Sarokin had ruled that it was enough to show that the commercialswere in public use, and it was this ruling upon which the $400,000award to Antonio Cipollone was based.* New Jersey's comparative fault law mitigating the manufacturers'liability for failure to warn should be applied only to the periodbefore 1966.The jury found Rose Cipollone was 80 percent responsible forcontinuing to smoke and Liggett 20 percent responsible for failing towarn her of the dangers, so her estate received no award.But the appeals court ruled that the question of her responsibilityfor her actions applied only to the period before warning labels wererequired, rather than to her entire life."The jury should have been instructed that Mrs. Cipollone's post-1965conduct bore only on the apportionment of damages, but not on hercomparative fault for her own injuries," the court said.* The doctrine of inherent characteristics, which holds thatmanufacturers cannot be sued if the product's defects are bothinherent and well known, applies only to the period after 1966.For alleged injuries occurring before that period, a jury can decidethe facts on whether the average person can be expected to know aboutthe dangers of smoking and, if not, whether a company should be heldliable for defects of a product because its risks outweighed itsbenefits.Sarokin had ruled that the doctrine applied to the years before 1966and thus barred recovery from Liggett for health effects due to thedesign of the cigarettes.The appeals court rejected Liggett's claim there was insufficientevidence to prove that smoking the company's cigarettes caused thecancer."The jury could have reasonably concluded...that Mrs. Cipollone'ssmoking from 1952 to 1966...caused her lung cancer," the court said.Both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys claimed victory."We repeatedly stated that the verdict was wrong and would bereversed on appeal," said Liggett General Counsel Josiah Murray.Plaintiffs' attorney Cynthia Walters expressed pleasure in thedecision, even though it overturned the $400,000 award."From our standpoint, we won beyond dispute on two areas of greatconcern," she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990U.S. JUDGE RULES OUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR FLIGHT 103 VICTIMSU.S. District Judge Thomas J. Platt of New York ruledJan. 3 that an international agreement bars families of victims ofthe 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from suing the airlinefor punitive damages.The ruling "adds insult to injury in today's world," Platt said, butthe Warsaw Convention covering international flights limits relief tocompensatory damages.He said "it is simply not within this court's power to construe thetreaty in a manner inconsistent with the contracting parties'expectations."Central to the plaintiffs' case is a charge that Pan Am received awarning of a bomb threat but neither increased security adequatelynor notified passengers of the risk.Many of the 259 victims on the plane were American college studentsstudying abroad who were returning home for the Christmas vacation.Flight 103, en route from Germany to the United States, blew up overLockerbie, Scotland, apparently as the result of a terrorist bomb.Suits brought by families across the country have been consolidatedinto one proceeding in the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn.Of more than 150 plaintiffs involved, 95 are represented by the NewYork law firm of Kreindler & Kreindler, which specializes in aviationlitigation.The firm's Lee Kreindler indicated there will be an appeal of JudgePlatt's ruling."I don't think this is the last word on it," he said.The Warsaw Convention limits compensatory damages to $75,000 unlesswillful misconduct is proven. It doesn't explicitly address punitivedamages, but Platt said the ban is implicit."While the Warsaw Convention does not expressly refer to punitivedamage claims, it appears that the Warsaw Convention bars such claimswhether or not willful misconduct exists," he said.He said those who drew up the treaty in 1929 had a "sharedexpectation" of setting "some uniform limit on an airline carrier'sliability in order to promote the civil aviation industry which atthe time of the Warsaw Convention was in its infancy.""I think the judge was eminently correct in his decision," said JamesM. Shaughnessy, a lawyer for Pan Am.He added that he is not worried about an appeal.Pan Am argues that it was prohibited by the U.S. government fromnotifying passengers of the bomb threat.The ruling in New York doesn't affect a case being brought againstPan Am in the Florida courts by families of British passengers andthe 11 persons who were killed on the ground when the jet crashed inLockerbie."This group specifically chose to pursue our cases through theFlorida courts since it was felt that there would be a better changeof establishing punitive damages through the Florida courts than inNew York," spokesman Peter Watson said in London.Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990TAIWAN GOVERNMENT HELD LIABLE IN JOURNALIST'S SLAYINGThe government of Taiwan can be held liable for its role in theCalifornia slaying of a journalist and critic of the regime, theNinth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Dec. 29.Henry Liu was shot and killed in Daly City, Calif., on orders of ViceAdm. Wong Hsi-ling, then director of Taiwan's Defense IntelligenceBureau. But Taiwan claimed Wong was acting outside his officialduties and had a personal grudge against Liu.Several of those involved in the scheme, including Wong, wereconvicted of murder in Taiwan, and one was convicted in California.Liu's wife, Helen, filed a wrongful death action against thegovernment of Taiwan.Overturning a lower court, the Ninth Circuit said she could proceed."Wong's act of ordering the assassination of Henry Liu was not whollypersonal but arose from his employment as director of the DIB," theappellate panel said."When an employee, such as Wong, uses governmental authority in amistaken attempt to benefit his employer by silencing an outspokencritic of the government, there is nothing inequitable aboutspreading the loss among all the beneficiaries of the government."Judge Robert Boochever also wrote that holding Taiwan accountablewouldn't interfere with formation of foreign policy by the executivebranch of the U.S. government.John Martel, an attorney for Taiwan, said he would review thedecision and consider an apepal.He said the government of Taiwan "was as appalled as anyone" by thekilling "and there is no proof that the government had anything to dowith it."Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990CALIFORNIA PUNITIVE DAMAGES UP SINCE 1987, TORT REFORMERS SAYThe average amount of punitive damages awarded by California jurieshas risen by 178 percent since 1987 alone, according to a study bythe Association for California Tort Reform.The average award for punitive damages in 1989 was$3.01 million, up from $1.69 million in 1987, the group reported.The study was based on a review of 1,846 jury verdicts reported byJury Verdicts Weekly.It found 48 punitive damage awards of $1 million or more and 19awards of $5 million or more.At the same time, the number of awards is down, from 15.2 percent in1987 to 9.3 percent in 1989.Tort reformers say that's because of a change in the law andincreased willingness of defendants to settle.Victor Schwartz of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Crowell &Moring, a specialist in torts, noted that in 1987 California raisedits standard of proof for punitive damages from preponderance of theevidence to clear and convincing evidence.In addition, he said, "many punitive damage cases are being channeledinto settlement" because punitive damages "are constantly being usedas a threat by plaintiffs' lawyers, and many defendants prefersettlement to the Russian roulette system of punitive damagelitigation."The study's findings were presented last month to the CaliforniaLegislature's Joint Committee on Tort Liability."This study indicates that the threat of punitive damages is a realand major concern for the business community of California," saidFrank Schubert, president of the Association for California TortReform."When one out of ten jury verdicts is likely to result in a punitivedamage award averaging more than $3 million, it is not difficult tounderstand why business leaders are leery of California's legalclimate."It is a major reason why California is slowly losing its competitiveedge to less litigious international competitors."Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990FLORIDA SUPREME COURT FINDS INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER SELF-DEFENSEThe Florida Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21 that a clause common tohomeowners' insurance policies bars coverage for policyholders whoinjure assailants in their homes in self-defense.State law authorizes individuals to use force in self-defense, thecourt acknowledged, and self-defense is a "worthy" motive for causinginjury.Self-defense is nevertheless an intentional act and thus excludedfrom coverage under a clause barring claims for intentional acts, thecourt held in a 5-2 decision.The case arose from an incident in which Edward Marshall shot his ex-wife's son after the younger man broke into the house. A jury saidMarshall acted negligently and awarded the son $575,000 incompensatory and punitive damages.State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., which wrote the policy, refused topay the claim.The court's unsigned majority opinion said clauses excluding coveragefor intentional acts are non-negotiable elements of most homeowners'liability policies.Allowing coverage of intenational acts, even in self-defense, wouldskew actuarial tables and encourage individuals to commit wrongfulacts, the court said."We will not rewrite a policy under these circumstances to providecoverage where the clear language of the policy does not; nor will weinvoke public policy to override this otherwise valid contract," themajority said.Justices Parker Lee McDonald and Rosemary Barkett dissented, sayingthey would side with courts in other states that ruled acts of self-defense are not the sort of intentional acts that would beconsciously undertaken by a homeowner because he or she is aware ofinsurance against liability."It would be ironic to exonerate an individual on the basis of self-defense but deny him insurance coverage of the costs of defense; yetallow insurance coverage to a person who negligently causes injury,"McDonald wrote.Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990FLORIDA COMMISSIONER CHARGES LAWYERS WITH INSURANCE FRAUDNine persons including two lawyers have been charged withracketeering in a scheme to defraud insurance companies with falsemedical claims, Florida Insurance Commission Tom Gallagher chargedDec. 22.Those charged included Mark Marks, 64, head of a law firm withoffices in Miami, North Miami, Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale, andhis son Gary, 32.Prosecutors charged that the pair arranged for medical tests from theCenter for Neurological Services in Fort Lauderdale and dictated bothwhat the test results and the bills for the service should be.They said employees of the law firm were told to alter or concealclients' medical records to provide false information to insurancecompanies.Those who cooperated allegedly shared up to thousands of dollars froma fee-sharing fund.Gallagher called the operation "an outrageous example of a criminalconspiracy" designed to "cheat insurance companies out of millions ofdollars.""The insurance companies were the biggest target, but the people arethe real victims," he said."Every lost dollar in insurance gets passed on to the public in theform of more expensive insurance premiums."Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990PENNSYLVANIA COURT HOLDS UNION ISN'T LIABLE FOR STRIKE VIOLENCEThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Jan. 3 that the InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters isn't liable for damages over violence in a1977 strike against Freeport Transport Co.The court said liability of Teamsters Local 538 was clear, but saidevidence didn't prove the international union was involved.The high court upheld the trial court's judgment of $51,753 incompensatory damages against the local and the international butstruck down an award of $250,000 in punitive damages against theinternational.Testimony showed that the international union said strike-relatedviolence would end if amnesty were provided one striker, JackRobison. Dissenting Justice John Flaherty said that was enough toprove union involvement but the majority disagreed.Robison was later convicted on criminal charges stemming from strikeviolence."The appearance of a representative of the international in an effortto end a strike does not mean that the IBT approved or encouraged theviolence during the strike," the court said.It said the Pennsylvania Labor Anti-Injunctrion Act requires "ahigher showing than the common law rules of agency to establish aunion's liability."Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990PENNSYLVANIA COURT BARS WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT OVER PREMATURE TRIPLETSA three-judge panel of Pennsylvania Superior Court has upheld a lowercourt's ruling that a wrongful-death suit cannot be filed in the caseof triplets who were born prematurely."In the absence of any expression of intent from the Legislature orany analysis by our Supreme Court, we cannot decide that fetuses bornprior to attaining viability should now be accorded the same rightsthat children who have attained viability have been accorded underthe Wrongful Death and Survival Acts," the court said.Michael and Ann Hudak conceded that their triplets weren't viableafter their premature birth.

But the state's highest court unanimously heldthat the immunity applied to policy decisions, and failure to cleanthe culvert was an operational decision that didn't necessarilyfollow established policy.The Legislature passed legislation later in 1983 extending governmentimmunity to flood control, but the Supreme Court ruled that it wasn'tretroactive.Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RULES INSURERS MUST PAY FOR WASTE CLEANUPThe Washington State Supreme Court ruled Jan. 4 that insurers for theBoeing Co. and several other corporations must help theirpolicyholders pay for cleaning up hazardous waste.The decision was the latest in a string of court disputes overwhether cleanup costs are "damages" as the term is used in standardcomprehensive general liability coverage.In its 7-2 ruling, the Washington court said they were.The suit arose over cleanup of a land owned by Western Processing inKent, Wash. A major site for hazardous industrial waste for manyyears, it was put on the original Environmental Protection Agencylist for Superfund cleanup.On one side are Boeing, which said it's spent $40 million on thecleanup; Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, Inc.; RSR Corp.; John FlukeManufacturing Co., Inc., and Davis Walker Corp.They were notified in 1983 that, as generators of waste at the site,they were responsible for costs of cleaning it up. They agreed to doso in a consent decree entered in 1987.In turn, they sought indemnification from their insurers: AetnaCasualty & Surety Co., Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., Granite StateInsurance Co., American Centennial Insurance Co. and HartfordAccident & Indemnity Co.The suit was filed in federal court, which certified the question ofinsurance company liability under Washington law to the state SupremeCourt.Writing for the court, Justice Fred Dore gave short shrift toinsurers' arguments that cleanup costs ordered by government aren'tdamages."Response costs in response to actual releases of hazardous wastes"are damages within the meaning of the insurance policies at issue, hesaid."The reported decisions across the country, the lay dictionary, theinsurance dictionary, the failure of the insurance industry to writedown what it meant, each of these facts lay waste to insurers'argument," Dore said.But the majority said the term doesn't cover safety measures or otherpreventive costs taken in advance of any damage to property.Chief Justice Keith Callow wrote a dissent in which he said themajority ruling "upsets settled rules of insurance construction,violates controlling precedent, and contravenes public policy."Back to Headline List CopyrightLIABILITY WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990LAWYER ATTACKS IDEA OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST FUNDLegal Times published an opinion article in its Dec. 18-25 issueattacking the proposal of Maurice Greenberg, president of AmericanInternational Group, for a National Environmental Trust Fund to payfor cleaning high-priority hazardous waste sites."Greenberg's proposal, if enacted into law, would allow the insuranceindustry to escape part or all of its massive contractual liablity toprivate- and public-sector policyholders for environ-mental cleanup,"Peter Kalis wrote in the legal news weekly published in Washington,D.C.Kalis is a partner in the Pittsburgh firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockartwho represents manufacturers in their disputes with insurers.Greenberg's proposed fund would be financed by a tax on allcommercial and industrial property/casualty insurance policies, aswell as equivalent fees paid by self-insured corporations.In suggesting it last March, he argued that most pollution of soiland ground water "did not result from deliberate, conscious acts" butis "the residue of progress." Because all U.S. society benefited, hesaid, we have a common interest in cleaning up.But Kalis argued that comprehensive general liability insurance "wasmarketed (and purchased) as a wholesale external-ization of risk, andone of the risks insured against was the possibility that the lgealsystem would change and casue policy-holders to incur new types ofliability for property damage and bodily injury..."One must wonder about the constitutional consequences ofcongressional nullification of the contractual entitlements ofthousands of policyholders in order to effect an anticipated bailoutof the insurance industry."Back to Headline List WT03-B01-21IA086-000615-B037-227http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/gt48.html 205.156.212.5 19970122014359 text/html 29616HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:41:44 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:48 GMTContent-length: 29429Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/gt48.html Sample Issue Copyright PRIVACY JOURNAL via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES COURT REQUIRES LIST OWNER TO OFFER 'OPT-OUT' (356 words) VARNEY OF TRADE COMMISSION TO THE FOREFRONT (280 words) QUOTABLE (48 words) 'BOSTON GROUP' HOLDS UP MEDICAL PRIVACY BILL (630 words) AUTOMATED MEDICAL FILES NOW LESS SECURE?

One of the remainingassets of a company that filed for bankruptcy was itsmailing list.  The company, Shocking Gray Corp., published acatalog for gay consumers, many of whom expected that theirnames on the list would remain confidential.At a court-supervised auction to sell off the customer list,some vendors of sex-related products made bids.  Further,there was no assurance that whatever company purchased thelist would keep it discreet.One of the bidders at auction and the leading marketer ofgay products by mail, Sean Strub, told U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeRonald P. King that if the list fell into the wrong hands itwould deter many gay consumers from letting their namesbecome part of marketing lists.  He urged the court to orderthe buyer to give everyone on the list an opportunity to getoff of it.The lawyer for the bankrupt company argued that givingpersons on the list the opportunity to be removed woulddiminish its value.  "My job is to generate as much cash aspossible," he said.  But the judge ordered the company withthe winning bid at auction, Tzabaco in Northern California,to offer everybody on the list an opt-out option.  DavidDow, Tzabaco's president,  said that his company, whichsells clothing and furniture by catalog, would have donethis anyway, because it knows the sensitivity of its gayclientele.  About 15,000 of the 200,000 persons on the list(7.5 percent) exercised the option.Lawyers for Shocking Gray said afterwards that this orderexceeded the judge's authority.  But, bankruptcy courts havewide latitude in managing the disposition of a company'sassets, including attaching conditions to purchases.  95-52856-RPK (W.D.

Now it seems to be the Federal TradeCommission's turn, in the person of its commissioner,Christine A. Varney.Not only has the FTC stepped up its compliance activity inregulating credit bureaus and telemarketing, it has begun a"Privacy Initiative" involving other agencies of the federalgovernment and state consumer-protection offices "to beginto incorporate [privacy] principles in our consumerprotection mission," according to Varney.  After a series ofhearings last fall, the FTC plans a public workshop  thisspring (for information contact Martha Landesberg, e-mailmlandesberg(at)ftc.gov).The Bureau of Consumer Protection has been assigned togather comments from consumers, businesses, and privacyorganizations.  At the same time, the FTC established aWorld Wide Web on-line site (ftc.gov) "to facilitatethoughtful electronic debate about the rules that shouldapply in the use and dissemination of consumer informationon-line," according to Varney, who was chief counsel toPresident Clinton's 1992 campaign then cabinet secretarybefore being named an FTC commissioner in 1994.  "Animportant goal of the FTC's Privacy Initiative is to avoidcumbersome regulation by facilitating the development of aset of voluntary principles to govern the use of consumerinformation in on-line transactions," Varney told a privacyconference last fall.  This echoes the mantra of PresidentBush's Consumer Advisor, Bonnie Guiton, who proved that "thebully pulpit" of a federal office can prod businesses evenin the absence of laws.Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVACY JOURNAL via NewsNetJanuary 1996QUOTABLE"It combines casualness of speech with the permanence ofwriting.

In fact, the main sponsor of S 1360, Sen.Bob Bennett, R-Utah, planned to rush it though the chamberbefore Christmas, after a cursory day of hearings Nov. 14.Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had signed onon as a sponsor in expectation that the American CivilLiberties Union would endorse the bill.  Sen. Patrick Leahy,D-Vt., signed on assuming that the confidentiality bill wasendorsed by privacy advocates.Janlori Goldman, a former ACLU staff member who as deputydirector of the industry-funded Center for Democracy andTechnology aided in the drafting and the industry responseto the bill, led Senate staff to believe that thelegislation was supported by privacy and patientorganizations.But a tiny organization of patients and practitioners calledthe Coalition for Patient Rights spotted weaknesses in theproposal.  Its New England representative, Massachusettspsychiatrist Denise Nagel, persuaded the ACLU affiliate inMassachusetts to oppose the bill.  She activated a fewprivacy advocates in Washington, notably James Love of theRalph Nader-founded Consumers Project on Technology and MarcRotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, whooppose the current draft.The ACLU in Boston demanded a showdown with its nationalleadership and persuaded it to reverse its neutral orfavorable stance towards the bill.Perhaps in response, Goldman's organization and the AmericanHealth Information Management Association (a trade group ofhospital records administrators) organized weekly strategysessions in Washington beginning before Christmas andextending into late February.  Nagel, Rotenberg, and Lovehave been a part of these meetings.  At the same time, onthe first working day of the New Year in Boston, Nagelconvened an impressive coalition of medical confidentialityadvocates who are preparing an amended version of theBennett bill and a totally new substitute to offer Congressby next month.The attendees included Love, Rotenberg, PRIVACY JOURNALPublisher Robert Ellis Smith, and representatives of theHealth Law Institute in Boston, the national and local ACLU,the Council for Responsible Genetics, and the AmericanPsychiatric Association.In the meeting, CPR, CRG, and CPT were criticizing a billand strategy embraced by CDT.  One had to stay alert.(Smith has been quoted by COMPUTERWORLD as saying, "The billhas three or four weaknesses that, if cured, would make it anet plus for consumers.  Right now, it's a net minus, but itdoesn't miss by much.")The Boston group thinks that the bill accelerates thecomputerization and linkage of patient data and that itpermits wide access to law enforcement and insurancecompanies, as well as to employees within a medicalfacility.  The Center for Democracy and Technology says thatthe Bennett bill is the strongest medical privacy proposalever seriously considered by Congress.The dispute has accentuated a growing schism among privacygroups  in Washington and, in the process, has stalledconsideration of S 1360 and caused some Senate liberals toreconsider their endorsement of the current language.The bill creates a new nationwide right for patients toinspect their own files and a framework for patients toconsent to a wide variety of disclosures.  The billgenerally gives approval to current disclosures of medicaldata.  If medical providers comply with the new law theywould be immune from lawsuits by patients victimized bydisclosure of their medical information.  The bill wouldpre-empt stronger state laws in eight states, California,Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts,  Minnesota,Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVACY JOURNAL via NewsNetJanuary 1996AUTOMATED MEDICAL FILES NOW LESS SECURE?In 1994 52 percent of 355 hospital records managersresponding to a survey said that computerized records aremore secure than paper records.

Barton, "was raised tothe status of Holy Writ."In the early 1990s, TRW Information Systems abandoned theprinciple in its revised code of practices (although itscompetitor, Equifax, continues to endorse the principle, ina code of standards revised in 1993).Now, Barton says that the principle probably doesn't applyto the direct marketing industry of the 1990s.  "TheInternet and other interactive services have differentprotocols and privacy expectations than traditional forms ofdirect marketing," he writes in an essay in DM News (Dec.25, 1995).  "We now enjoy a greater ability to collect,store, and organized data than was imaginable just 18 yearsago.  As well, security problems on the Internet haveincreased people's privacy concerns.  We must examineprivacy issues with a fresh perspective.  If we do not, wemay not have as great a success in molding the regulatoryenvironment as we have had in the past."This revisionism comes when the DMA's most influentialmember, Metromail, a direct-marketing firm, has beencriticized for violating the principle on secondary use, byselling information traditionally used for marketing to lawenforcement, private investigators, and skip tracers.Metromail has a call-in service whereby anyone, for $3 aminute, may learn the telephone numbers, names, and ages ofall residents at a known address [see PJ Dec 95].

The case of Toni MarieAngeli came to light only late in December, perhaps becauseshe is not famous.Angeli said that she took pictures of her four-year-old boyfor a class at Harvard, where she is a graduate student.The photos show the boy nude inside their apartment andoutdoors; in some shots he is urinating.A photo lab alerted Cambridge police to the photos, anddetectives showed up at the lab to confront the mother whenshe picked up the photos.  An argument and scuffle ensued,and she was arrested for assault and disorderly conduct.  Nocharge was issued concerning the photos because there was no"lascivious intent."Police said that they wanted to satisfy themselves that thephotos were taken by a parent, without coercion to thechild.Opinion seemed split in Boston whether the police hadoverreacted or whether they were right in checking out allsuspicions of child abuse.  "There is a moral panic afoot inthe U.S. that has been accelerating in recent years," saidthe Boston Coalition for Freedom of Expression.  "If thereis no direct evidence of sexual abuse in the pictures, thenthat should have been enough."Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVACY JOURNAL via NewsNetJanuary 1996DISCOUNT ON REFERENCE BOOKS FROM PRIVACY JOURNALNEWSNET subscribers make take a 20 percent discount whenordering any of the following books and reports:(Write NEWSNET on your order.)COLLECTION AND USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, a report *($15)COMPILATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS * ($29)DIRECTORY OF PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS, with 200 key names andaddresses * ($14.50)OUR VANISHING PRIVACY, essays with consumer advice onprotecting privacy ($16.95)PRIVACY: HOW TO PROTECT WHAT'S LEFT OF IT, a 1980sbestseller now available in a spiral-bound, photocopyversion ($14)SEARCHES AND SURVEILLANCE IN THE WORKPLACE, a brief reporton current law ($8)THE LAW OF PRIVACY EXPLAINED ($14.50)WAR STORIES, 500 real-life accounts of privacy invasions *($17.50)WORKRIGHTS, a book on employees' rights ($9.95)Three-ring binder with PRIVACY JOURNAL logo ($9.50)    Three binders   ($25)PRIVACY JOURNAL custom coffee mug  ($7.50)PRIVACY JOURNAL custom pen    ($1)*  These publications include new update.)(Add $4 per order for shipping)                      TOTAL ENCLOSED __________NAME __________________________________ADDRESS ______________________________________________________________________ZIP CODE _________ COUNTRY ____________MASTERCARD OR VISA ACCOUNT NUMBER       ________________________________Send order and payment to PRIVACY JOURNAL, P.O.

AZRAEL, ATTORNEY, BALTIMORE, MD.:  Thank youfor including in last month's issue information aboutMaryland's medical records data base.  The day after Ireceived my issue in the mail I received a call from aBethesda, Md., subscriber who somehow tracked me down formore information.  The more Marylanders who get involved inthe process, the more accountable the state will be toconsumers who have legitimate concerns about their medicalrecords privacy.FROM SAN DIEGO, CAL.:  Our organization received a complaintfrom a person who received a letter from a hospital sayingthat "an employee retrieved some computer generated medicalsheets from a recycling box to use as scratch paper at home. . . . A friend of our employee inappropriately used severalof these sheets as stationery.  You have been identified asone who received correspondence from that person on the backof these medical records and are, therefore, in possessionof this health care information."  The hospital thencautioned the recipient not to violate California's medicalconfidentiality law by disclosing the information andinsisted that the "stationery" be returned to the hospitalimmediately.[In addition to the breach] we are concerned that thehospital now has in its possession the personalcorrespondence list of the [non-employee] individual whoused recycled paper as stationery.FROM TRUMANSBURG, N.Y.:  I wrote to MIB Inc. and asked for acopy of my file.  They sent me the form, I filled it out(they didn't ask for a SSN, amazingly), and they wrote backand said that they had no file on me at all.  I don'tbelieve them - I had [individual health] insurance in effectabout three years earlier and the insurance company hadadded stuff to my application which they presumably got fromMIB.  Do I have any recourse?RESPONSE: At present you have to take a consumer reportingagency's word when it says it has no file on you.  But ifyou discover in the future that it did have information onyou, you can take action, based on a violation of the FairCredit Reporting Act.It is not surprising that MIB does not have a file on you.It has records on only about five percent of the U.S.population, mainly for life insurance underwriting.  MIB,located in Boston (617/426-3660), keeps computerizedsummaries taken from prior insurance applications and thenprovides them to another insurance company to which youapply for coverage.  It is an example of a huge data basethat does not use Social Security numbers in its files.FROM MT. HOPE, ARK.:  What kind of background checks onpatients do doctors and dentists do?  How can I get accessto this data base?RESPONSE:  There are a few data bases that will tell adoctor whether a person has filed a malpractice lawsuit inthe past.  These entities are subject to the Fair CreditReporting Act, which requires them to disclose to you whatinformation they have stored on you and requires the doctorto identify the data base if you are turned down as apatient because of information in them.  (There  is also afederal data base listing doctors accused of malpractice andother misconduct, although it is not available to thegeneral public.  There are a few private data bases thatsell similar information to the public.  They are notsubject to the FCRA.)Back to Headline List WT03-B01-22IA086-000615-B037-271http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/gt08.html 205.156.212.5 19970122014437 text/html 138668HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:42:25 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:52 GMTContent-length: 138480Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/gt08.html Sample Issue Copyright SET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNet APRIL 24, 1995 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES House Small Business Panel Finishes SBA Review (409 words) Clinton Defends Preferences, Hopes to Diffuse Anger President May Look at Helping Non-Minorities (466 words) Washington Insider (857 words) What's on your mind?

Everything is on the table and undecided,committee sources say, but they are hoping to releasetheir proposal by mid-May. Other key players willbe the Budget Committee, which sets theauthorization for the agency, and the AppropriationsSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, andJudiciary, which divvies up the funds. The HouseSmall Business Committee proposal will most likelybe the starting point for legislation.     SBA recently made its own proposal, whichwould eliminate the government's subsidy for thesmall business loan programs, the agency's costliestprogram, and consolidate local SBA offices andcenters. These changes would reduce the agency'sfiscal year 1996 budget by almost a third, providingnearly double what the House committee proposed.     But it is unlikely the House Small BusinessCommittee will stop there. Chair Jan Meyers, R-Kan., has repeatedly said she believes the 8(a)program is "duplicative" with the new SDB andprice preference program created as part of last year'sfederal acquisition bill. The Small BusinessInvestment Program has also been pointed to as aprogram that could be cut, possibly privatized.     House aides indicated the committee is concernedabout SBA's proposal to reduce the government'ssubsidy loan cost to zero through increases in fees tobanks and borrowers. Several members haveworried additional loan fees would put SBA loansout of reach of smaller businesses.     Members, including Meyers, also voicedconcerns about an SBA plan to close local SBAoffices, which might affect their districts. Theproposal would consolidate regional offices withtheir district counterpart and eliminate many localoffices, leaving most states with just one SBA office.Due to their concerns, committee members areworking closely with SBA officials on this matter.     If Meyers' committee rejects or pares down thesetwo proposals, as it seems they might, it could meancuts may need to be found in other SBA programs,though no one program will yield as much savingsas the loan program.     SBA hopes it will have a champion in freshmanRep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. and a member of theHouse Appropriations Subcommittee, which hasjurisdiction over SBA funding. Forbes is a formerdirector of congressional affairs for SBA andregional administrator for the Northeast Region.Staff aides say he is a strong advocate of the agencyas a whole.Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995Clinton Defends Preferences, Hopes to Diffuse AngerPresident May Look at Helping Non-Minorities     Republicans and Democrats may be looking forways to help broaden the base of programs for thedisadvantaged, but for very different purposes.     Republicans hope to promote economicdisadvantage over race as a better way to help lift uppoor Americans than affirmative action. The Clintonadministration appears to be hoping to deflect angeraway from affirmative action, by looking for ways tohelp non-minorities.     In a speech to the California Democratic Party,Clinton said Democrats should not retreat on thoseaffirmative action programs that work, but, rather,should look to what we can do for those hurt bydownsizing and other structural changes in theeconomy.     It was the President's first indication he may takethe initiative on affirmative action. But other reportshave implied the administration's review may call foradditional review and the creation of a bipartisancommittee to study the matter further.     If the administration lets conservatives take thelead, it could result in the substitution of economicfor racial preferences. Clint Bolick of the Institute forJustice, one of the think tanks behind the GOP attackon affirmative action, has suggested the use ofeconomic disadvantage-based programs andspecifically targeted aid to help expand opportunitiesfor those in poor areas.     For instance, he suggested the Small BusinessAdministration should narrow its focus to target onlythose areas of the nation, namely inner cities, wherethe barriers to small business success are highest.     But a large-scale attempt to help the poor isunlikely when the federal government faces amassive deficit. At a panel discussion sponsored bythe conservative Center for Equal Opportunity,Randall Kennedy of the Harvard Law School warnedthat a move to replace economic for socialdisadvantage would require more money andpossibly end up unfunded.     Michael Dyson of the University of NorthCarolina said that to truly help the poor masseswould require raising taxes on the rich and increasingthe minimum wage.     He contended that affirmative action programsactually cost very little and their elimination wouldonly help the poor if funds for affirmative actionwere being diverted from anti-poverty programs.     Affirmative action opponents' suggestion toredirect these programs to target the poor specificallyseems particularly inconsistent when Congress is inthe process of cutting anti-poverty programs,Kennedy said.     Kennedy and Dyson were not completelyopposed to changes in affirmative action, particularlywhen it came to the subject of whichgroups shouldreceive such preferences. Asked whether somedistinctions should be made between new immigrantgroups and those groups, such as African Americansand Native Americans, who suffered historically atthe hands of this nation, Dyson said he was not asinterested in preserving programs in their currentstate.     But, he added, affirmative action should not bethrown out just because "some of the beneficiariesare suspect."Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995Washington Insider     Federal officials, at first seemingly caught off-guard by attacks on affirmative action, are nowstrongly promoting it as a sign of good businesssense. At a recent conference, Postmaster GeneralMarvin Runyon, head of the U.S. Postal Service,said that supplier diversity "is good for the nationbecause it gives small, developing businesses a fairchance. Organizations with strong minority supplierprograms say these small businesses are often ableto respond better and faster to their specific needs.Encouraging supplier diversity encourages the bestfrom our country."***     But attacks on affirmative action programs on thestate level continue. According to The Los AngelesTimes, California Governor Pete Wilson is expectedto announce the elimination of all state affirmativeaction programs not mandated by state law.Although this will not affect California's majoraffirmative action programs in education, hiring, andcontracting, it will mean abolishing several stateadvisory boards and councils charged withmonitoring state compliance with those laws.     Wilson, who also backs a ballot initiativerepealing all state and local affirmative actionprograms, rejected diversity initiatives in his hiringand judicial appointments. According to the LosAngeles Times, his overall percentage of hires andappointments of minorities have hovered around17%, not coming near the percentage of minoritiescomprising the state's labor force (39%) or itspopulation (43%).***     Some interesting facts regarding minority set-asides and the 8(a) program...According to a recentstudy done by the SBA Office of Advocacy, the sixlargest federal prime contractors receive moregovernment contracts than do all small, minority-,and women-owned federal contractors.

TheCompetitive Enterprise Institute has recently issued astatement advocating the elimination of SBA and itsloan programs. The groups seems to reject the ideathat financial institutions are turning away smallbusinesses, particularly minorities and women,because these loans don't offer the same returns asbigger loans.

Can you give me anyadvice on winning subcontracts from primes?***A: As part of last year's Federal AcquisitionStreamlining Act, the federal government set a 5%SDB contracting goal for all federal agencies, withagencies negotiating subcontracting goals withprimes that can be either above or below this 5%threshold.     Subcontracting with primes, however, is actuallyno different than contracting directly with agovernment agency, except that primes may be moremotivated to work with you. Many primes areworried about fulfilling their subcontracting goalsand, in fact, some even have problems locatingcapable minority-owned firms in their particularsubcontracting niche. In some cases, primes caneven lose their contract if they cannot meetsubcontracting goals. So many primes may be quiteinterested. But, just like with the federal agencies,you will still need to provide a capabilities statementand make a competitive bid. And, of course, not allprimes have problems finding SDBs.     In any case, there are ways to improve yourchances for subcontracting with primes. As with allgovernment contracting, relationships are vital. Onceyou have identified those primes that do work inyour field, call the main switchboard and ask for thename of the person to contact. Most large primeshave a department or a person designated to helpthem locate qualified small and minority businesses.Look for the small business liaison officer or asimilar title. If they have a subcontractors list, requestto be added to it. But remember this is just a firststep.     Because some contracts require primes tospecifically name the minority firm they will using, itis important to make them aware of your firm early.Try and schedule a meeting with the contact personto give them a brief presentation of your firm's skills,pertinent prior experience, and key personnel.     The liaison officer will be able to give youvaluable information, such as what companylocations may need your service or product. Theycan also help put you in touch with the prime's buyerif they think you are qualified.     Once you have successfully worked for a prime,it will be much easier to get additional subcontractsfrom the prime. So it is worth all the hard work toget that first subcontract, even if it isn't very big.***Q: When will I be able to take advantage of the 10%price preference for small disadvantaged businessescontained in the Federal Acquisition StreamliningAct?***A: The regulations, which tell government agencieshow to administer the new rules, must be in place byOctober 1995. So you must wait until final rules arein place--which could be earlier than the Octoberdeadline, but don't count on it.Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995Congress Agrees to Paperwork Reduction Bill     Before adjoining for their Easter/Passover recess,the Senate and House approved the PaperworkReduction Act, clearing the measure for PresidentClinton, who is expected to sign the bill.     The bill was heavily supported by small businesslobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,National Federation of Independent Businesses, andNational Small Business United. It is estimated thatsmall businesses spend one billion hours annuallyfilling out government paperwork at a cost of nearly$100 billion.     The legislation, which is part of the GOP Contractwith America and aims particularly to lessen thepaperwork burden on small business, will:     * require a 10% reduction in governmentpaperwork for two years and 5% for four years afterthat;     * allow individuals and small businesses toignore paperwork requirements if the issuing agencydid not obtain public input in developing them; and     * reauthorize for six years the Office ofManagement and Budget's (OMB) Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs, which is theprimary review arm for reducing governmentpaperwork.     The second and most controversial provision ofthe bill would excuse the public from filling outgovernment forms that do not have OMB-issuedcontrol numbers. The lack of such a number meansthe federal agency issuing the form did not receiveOMB approval for the information request. If this isthe case, the public is legally excused from any finesor repercussions as a result of not complying,including the denial of government benefits.     The bill is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, once thepresident signs it.Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995GSA May Contract Out More, Less     The reorganization of the General ServicesAdministration (GSA) may result in morecontracting out for some services but less for others.     GSA has divided its operations into 16 "businesslines" and over the next year will study each of themfor ways to save money and increase efficiency.     The first two up for review are internal computeroperations and brokerage services.     Computer operations include 22 data processingcenters, which are staffed largely by contractoremployees. The review found the centers to be two-and-a-half times less efficient at data processingcompared to private industry.     GSA spends about $65 million a year in salaries,contracts, and equipment and facilities rent to run itsinternal computer operations.     To save money, data processing will beconsolidated into two large centers, which GSAbelieves will operate more efficiently.     Older computer equipment will be phased outrapidly and two large computer services contractswill be allowed to lapse in 1996 and 1997. Then,GSA will consider if it can bring service in-houseusing commercial software.     GSA employs about 850 people in brokerageservices to manage the 7,700 buildings which theagency owns or rents space in for federal workers.     The agency spends about $94 million a year tomanage $2.4 billion in property leases. About 70%of leases are considered "small leases" for 10,000square feet or less.     GSA takes 200-400 days to complete a leasetransaction, and has begun a pilot program in threeregional offices to cut 100 days from that process.     In the review, GSA will look at whether it wouldbe cheaper to contract out for commercial brokerageservices or to keep performing it in-house.Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995Audit Says Defense Unit Awarded Too Much to8(a)s     The Defense Construction Supply Center(DCSC) awarded a "disproportionate share" of itsconstruction contracts to 8(a) firms, according to aDefense Dept. Inspector General's audit.     The audit looked at DCSC contract awards madefrom Oct. 1, 1990 to June 30, 1994, when the centerawarded 95 construction contracts worth $27.1million. DCSC's procurement budget for the sameperiod was about $2.4 billion.     An Ohio contractor's complaint that DCSC paid"substantially" more than fair market value for theinstallation of a sprinkler system by awarding acontract to an 8(a) firm without competition and gavethe 8(a) "preferential treatment" sparked the audit.     Auditors determined that the contract wasawarded properly, but said DCSC concentrated its8(a) awards in the construction industry (defined aswork under SIC Codes 15, 16, and 17) at theexpense of other firms.     DCSC awarded 97% of the value of itsconstruction contracts to 8(a) firms. All but four ofthe contracts awarded to 8(a)s were awarded as sole-source contracts, which, the audit said, cost morethan contracts awarded competitively.     For all other industries, DCSC awarded 2% of thevalue of contracts to 8(a)s, the audit reported.     Congress set the Defense Dept. a goal ofawarding a minimum of 5% of the value of contractsto small disadvantaged businesses. DCSC, accordingto the audit, established an unwritten policy ofrelying on awards to 8(a)s in construction to helpachieve its 5% goal. DCSC officials told auditorsthey believed it was easier to locate qualified 8(a)firms in construction than in other industries.     Auditors recommended that DCSC monitor itscontract awards more closely, so 8(a) awards are notconcentrated in just a few industries.     The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), of whichDCSC is a part, said it would begin publishing aquarterly report listing SDB awards by SIC Code.     DLA disagreed with the audit's findings, howeverDCSC has never met the 5% SDB goal andtherefore, could be argued, that DCSC shouldincrease its 8(a) awards to meet the goal.     DLA also said all of DCSC's sole-source awardsfollowed long-established government rules. It addedthat auditors did not count millions of dollars inconstruction contracts the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers awarded for DCSC requirements which,if included, would lower the share of contracts goingto 8(a)s.Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995SBIR Sails Through Congressional Hearing     Except for a few minor recommendations, theSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR)program emerged from a congressional hearingshowered with laurels.     The hearing, held by the House Small Businessgovernment programs subcommittee, was the last ina two-month series that examined programsadministered by the SBA.     SBIR was lauded for creating jobs and generatingtax revenue while adding little or no extraadministrative cost. Congress created the program in1982 and requires federal agencies with annualresearch and development (R&D) budgets of morethan $100 million to devote a percentage to fundingproposals for new and innovative technologies theysolicit from small businesses. The goal of theprogram is to develop a product for the commercialmarketplace.     Subcommittee Chairman Peter Torkildsen, R-Mass., said  he would consider just a few changes tothe SBIR program.     Suggestions offered included:     * reducing paperwork and developing standardprocedures for submitting and evaluating proposals;     * reining in solicitation topics that one businessowner described as too "far out" for people topropose a commercially viable product in SBIR'slimited time frame; and      * designing a computer system to verify SBIRparticipation and prevent duplicate awarding ofgrants.     Few cases of multiple awards for the sameproposal have been proven, but SBIR funding wasincreased beginning in fiscal year 1993 and theGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) raised concernsthat more companies could try to take advantage ofthe system.      SBA officials said a computer system to verifySBIR participation much quicker than the systemnow in use should be available in the next three tofour months.     SBIR is promoted as a program that helps smallbusinesses develop new and useful technologies withlittle government investment. It's a three-phaseprocess: In Phase I, companies receive up to$100,000 over six months to see if their proposal isviable. In Phase II, companies get up to $750,000over two years to refine a product or service. Nogovernment money is offered in Phase III,commercialization.     All grants are awarded competitively.     Other suggestions touched on the types ofassistance agencies can offer to SBIR grantrecipients. The legislation allows agencies to providetechnical assistance, but program officials saidrecipients appear to need more help in marketingtheir products commercially. The Energy Dept.created a business assistance program, funded withnon-SBIR money, to do that.     Dr. Samuel J. Barish, the Energy Dept. SBIRprogram manager, recommended that a smallpercentage of SBIR money, possibly 1%, bepermitted for business development assistance. Thiswould require an amendment to SBIR legislation.     Rep. Cleo Fields, D-La., asked about minorityparticipation in SBIR programs. No recent studieshave been done, but SBA officials said they believeminorities are underrepresented as a whole, receivingabout 10% of SBIR awards. GAO backed up SBA'sestimate.Back to Headline List CopyrightSET-ASIDE ALERT via NewsNetAPRIL 24, 1995DOE Awards Contract to Run Rocky Flats     Small Business to Get 15% of Contract's Value     Small and minority-owned businesses will winmore than a half-billion dollars from a major newEnergy Dept. contract.     DOE earlier this month awarded a $3.5-billion,five-year contract to Kaiser-Hill Co. for cleanup of aformer nuclear weapons plant at Rocky Flats, inGolden, Col.     Kaiser-Hill, a joint venture between ICF Kaiserand CH2M Hill, two leading environmentalmanagement companies, will take over the RockyFlats contract July 1, 1995. The incumbent contractoris EG&G Rocky Flats Inc.     In its proposal, Kaiser-Hill set a goal of awarding15% of the contract's total value, $525 million, tosmall businesses. The company said it intends toaward at least $262 million in professional andtechnical services contracts to small firms and morethan $130 million to small disadvantaged businesses.     Kaiser-Hill's proposal beat out one submitted byParsons Rocky Flats Corp. and promises to save$1.2 billion over the life of the contract. The RockyFlats contract was the second  awarded competitivelyunder DOE's Contract Reform Initiative announcedlast year, which calls for contracts to beperformance-based as opposed to fixed-fee.     Work at Rocky Flats will include cleaning up andremoving all high-risk "hot spot" contamination,stabilizing plutonium and plutonium residues,consolidating plutonium supplies into a singlebuilding, shipping highly enriched uranium off-site,rehabilitating 4,100 acres of land for public use, andremediating five hazardous sites. Kaiser-Hill said itwill complete these tasks three to four years ahead ofestablished targets.     For information, contact Ron Shatrow of CH2MHill, 303-771-0900, ext. 2110. To get on the bidder'slist, firms can mail a capabilities statement andcorporate brochures to Kaiser-Hill, 6060 S. WillowDr., Englewood, Col. 80111.

EST   THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.  Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, a timefor celebration, friendship and hope.  Nineteen ninety-five has beena good year for our country, and the coming year can be even better.   In Washington, we all know this has been a year of seriousdifferences and profound debate over our nation's future direction.But if we remain true to our values, we will prove once again that inAmerica we can have serious differences without leaving deepdivisions.  We know our nation is strongest when we're true to ourfundamental values, giving every American the opportunity to make themost of their lives, remembering the duty we owe to our parents andour children, preserving our families and our communities, keepingAmerica the strongest force of peace and freedom in the world.   In our effort to advance these values, 1995 has been a time ofreal progress and concrete achievement.  The key to our strength iseconomic opportunity for every American.  In 1995, the ingenuity andhard work of our people has kept the economy growing, steady andstrong.  In the past 12 months the economy created 1.75 million newprivate sector jobs.  In every month the unemployment rate has beenbelow six percent.  All told, since 1993, we Americans have creatednearly eight million new jobs.  The stock market has broken everyrecord.  The deficit dropped for the third year in a row, for thefirst time since Mr. Truman was President.  Long-term interest ratescontinue to fall, bringing lower mortgage payments for workingfamilies and more affordable credit for small businesses andconsumers.   A growing economy and lower interest rates are why a million newAmericans became homeowners for the very first time in 1995.  Therewere more new businesses incorporated this year than in any previousyear.  And here in Washington, in spite of all of our differences, wemade some real progress on an important issue -- political reform.At long last, Congress passed a law which applies to themselves thesame laws they oppose in the private sector.  And at long last, afterthree years of effort, the Congress passed lobby reform legislation,banning gifts to congressmen and requiring extensive disclosure aboutthe activities of lobbyists.   Most important, our communities all over America are comingtogether around our values again.  In city after city, in state afterstate, violent crime is down; the welfare and food stamp rolls aredown; the poverty rate is down; even the divorce rate is down.  Andfor two years in a row now, the teen pregnancy rate has dropped.   It hasn't always been an easy year for America.  There have beenmoments that tested our national community.  In the wake of theterrible bombing in Oklahoma City, which took the lives of 169people, our nation reached out and recognized the bonds that hold ustogether.  Out of the ashes of that tragedy a new sense of nationalspirit took hold.  We affirmed once again that all Americans are init together.  We recognized once again that we can't love ourcountry and hate our government.   And a strong America has been the world's strongest force forfreedom, peace and democracy in 1995.  Our brave men and women todayare in the snows of Bosnia, helping to uphold the peace agreement toend the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II.  And from thecobblestone streets of Northern Ireland to the sands of the MiddleEast, a strong America has helped to bring peace to regions long tornby strife.   Yes, 1995 has been a good year for America.  Our people haveaccomplished a lot.  And it goes without saying, we still have onemajor task to finish to top off the accomplishment of this year.  Wehave to finish the job of balancing the budget and to do it in theright way.   As you know, for the last two weeks the Congress has refused topass legislation that would keep the federal government open to servethe American people.  This has never happened before for this lengthof time in the whole history of the republic.  And it's been veryhard on three-quarter of a million public servants who have to payrent and utilities and mortgage payments and buy food.  And they'relosing pay at holiday time.  And it's also cut off services formillions of Americans who depend upon them.   This Tuesday, if the government is not open, clean-up effortswill be stopped cold at 32 toxic waste sites in neighborhoods aroundour country.  Next week, federal funds for unemployment insurancewill begin to run out, forcing states to scramble to find ways tokeep helping workers who have lost their jobs.  And the Meals OnWheels program to our senior citizens won't go forward.  Every day,nine of 10 work place safety complaints go unanswered.  And every day2,500 people can't get guaranteed home mortgages.  Every day,thousands of young people looking for college loans can't apply forthem.  If ever we needed a reminder that our government is not ourenemy, this is it.   Let me be clear: I am committed to balancing the budget.  Ouradministration already has cut the deficit nearly in half, and I amdetermined to finish the job.  For weeks I've been working in goodfaith with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to find commonground, to balance the budget in a way that reflects our values.Yesterday I met well into the evening with Speaker Gingrich andMajority Leader Dole.  And in just a few moments I will sit down withthem again, along with the Democratic congressional leaders.   We are making real progress.  We know that our work is not done.We know we have much to do, so that the American Dream will remainalive for every citizen, and so that we can come together as apeople, and so that America can remain the strongest force for peacethe world has ever seen.   So on this New Year's, let's resolve that we will balance thebudget, but that we'll do it in a way that will keep our countrygrowing and that will be true to our basic values.  That is, we'llbalance the budget without gutting Medicare and Medicaid, withoutdeeply cutting education or the environment, without raising taxes onworking families.  Let's resolve to reopen the government and do itnow.  And let's resolve to act without rancor or partisan bitternessin the spirit of the new year and in the interests of the Americanpeople.   Nineteen ninety-five has been a year when we've been true to thebest of America.  If we'll just work hard and work together andfollow our values, 1996 can be even better.  Hillary and I want towish you and your families a happy and health New Year.  Thank youfor listening.             END 10:11 A.M.

EST     MR. MCCURRY: Hi.  I wanted to appear briefly with my colleagueshere and give you a very short update based on the guidance that wejust got from the budget principals, who obviously continue theirhard work in the Cabinet Room, sleeves rolled up, sheets of paperflying back and forth, and coffee being produced in copiousquantities.  I'm doing my color since I don't have much substance toreport.     Q How many --     Q Was it being consumed in copious quantities?     MR. MCCURRY: The President, the Majority Leader, the Speaker,the minority leaders and the others participating agreed that theywould work about another hour tonight.  They are working through aseries of difficult budget issues, but they clearly are very seriousabout addressing those issues that are on the table.  They expect towork about another hour tonight, take a break.     The budget advisors group, which consists of Mr. Panetta,Chairman Domenici, Chairman Kasich, and the two ranking members --Mr. Sabo and Mr. Exon -- will reconvene on the Hill at approximately8:00 p.m. or roughly a half hour after they conclude here.  They willcontinue to do the type of work that they did today, working throughsome of the issues that they're attempting to analyze for the benefitof the principals.  And then, according to the President and theothers, they expect to reconvene tomorrow as early as possible basedon the advice they get from the budget advisors who will meet laterthis evening.  We don't have a time or --     Q The principals?     MR. MCCURRY: The principals will meet again tomorrow.  We don'thave a time set, although the preference is to begin as early in themorning as they can based on however late the advisors group workstonight.     That's about all I am afraid I can report at this point.  Byagreement, we're not going to attempt to summarize any of thesubstance.  As one participant said, we obviously wouldn't becontinuing to meet if we thought it was going poorly.  But other thanthat, I don't want to characterize any --     Q -- no chance that the House or Senate would take up theproposals that they mentioned in --     MR. MCCURRY: I really don't want to speak to that.  I think itwould be more appropriate for you to direct that to either theSpeaker's or the Majority Leader's -- but if you want --     Q Are there any plans for the --     MR. MCCURRY: I think you know the President's view.  ThePresident's view is that it would be good to get the federalgovernment up and running, federal workers back at their desk.     Q But what about back pay?     Q But wait a minute, wait a minute.  Can we get them to answerthe question of whether the House or Senate will take up the issuetonight of --     MR. BLANKLEY: It has to be taken up in the Senate first --     Q Could you go to the mike?     MR. BLANKLEY: Sure.  I like that.  (Laughter.)     MR. MCCURRY: Don't get used to it.  (Laughter.)     MR. BLANKLEY: It would have to be taken up in the Senate first,and it's not clear whether the Senate Democrats would be supportive.So we have to be checking on that before we can move it --     Q Why wouldn't they?     Q They voted for it last time.     Q Why wouldn't they?     Q Is this because of the expedited --     MR. BLANKLEY: Well, it's not clear.  That may be an issue.  Sowe're still checking.     Q What about the House?     MR. BLANKLEY: It will have to start in the Senate, so we can'tget out of the Senate.     Q But as of now, it is still the plan of the leadership to tryto push it through both chambers --     Q Tonight?     MR. BLANKLEY: We're trying to, but as I said, it would have tostart with the Senate.  You need unanimous support on both sides ofthe aisle there.     Q The Senate is still --     Q What is it that you would try --     Q I don't get this --     MR. MCCURRY: Would you guys calm down?  One of you at a timewill ask a question.     Q What are you trying to put through tonight in the Senate?     MR. BLANKLEY: What the Speaker mentioned earlier at the photoop, which is to have basically the provision that passed in theSenate last week, which is attached to the Middle East act, thatwould bring -- designate all government employees essential and wouldnot pay them, but would guarantee their pay once there is agovernment up and running again, and would also have an expeditedprocedure rule for the Senate so that we could get whatever agreementwe get out of here moved to the Senate with alacrity.  And there'ssome speculation that the Senate Democrats may not want to consent tounanimity on that point.     Q Do you know what the state of play in the Senate is?     MR. HINE: The Senate is still in session, prepared to deal withit, and Senator Dole may have more to say on the floor once we'redone here.     Q Logistically, Mike, what would you anticipate that will happenat the end of the principals meeting?  Would you come out and saysomething or will they return to the Hill, have --     Q Yes, what happens in an hour?     MR. MCCURRY: We did not cover that point.  We will eitherprovide another brief readout which will not be much different fromthis readout, or alternatively, have some type of joint statement aswe did at the conclusion of the meeting last Friday.     Q You wouldn't expect an appearance by the principals here?     MR. MCCURRY: I don't expect an appearance by them here, and I'mnot aware of any plans by the Republican leaders or the Democraticleaders to attempt to do any type of readout tonight on meetings ormake any type of comment.  There obviously -- this is a work inprogress, and the work will continue tomorrow.     MR. HALLEY: On the continuing resolution -- I work for SenatorDaschle -- when this bill comes up, the Democrats will object becauseof the fast track procedures that are being attached to it that wouldaffect consideration of any budget bill.  But at the same time, wewill offer a clean continuing resolution to fully open thegovernment, as we've been trying to do for days.  So the one that isbeing considered by the Republicans, we will object to that becauseof the expedited procedures that have been attached to it.  But wewill offer a clean continuing --     Q Does that mean you won't give unanimous consent tonight tothat?     MR. HALLEY: That's correct.     Q What's wrong with the expedited procedure?     MR. HALLEY: It violates basically most of the procedures of theSenate in terms of amendments and debate, et cetera.     Q But hold on for a second.  Didn't you vote for something justlike this before Christmas --     MR. HALLEY: No, that was the Middle East part of it.  There'sthree parts to this thing that's being put --     Q No, we're talking about just calling all the workersessential.  Do you have an objection to that?     Q That passed last Friday evening.     MR. HALLEY: No.  There are three pieces to the thing that arebeing put together by the Republicans.  One is deeming workers to beessential, which we agree with that.  Two is the Middle Eastinitiative, which we agree with that.  What we will be objecting tois the legislating of expedited procedures to -- that would harm ourability to both amend and debate the budget bill.  And so we willobject to that vehicle, but then we will offer a clean continuingresolution to open the government.     Q Well, when you mean a clean continuing resolution do you meanto --     Q -- what the prospects for that?     Q Michael, what's the White House position on this legislationwith the three parts?  Do you support the Senate Democrats or theHouse --     MR. MCCURRY: The President indicated that, earlier today, hewants federal workers back at their desks and working.  He wants theservices of the government available to the American people.  And weunderstand that there will have to be discussions on Capitol Hill tomake that happen quickly.  We hope that that will happen as quicklyas possible.     Q In other words, he sides with the Republicans, not theDemocrats on this?     MR. MCCURRY: No.  In other words, I very artfully ducked thequestion.  (Laughter.)     MR. BLANKLEY: Let me just point out that the provision thatapparently the Senate Democrats are going to block is the sameexpedited procedure that you have on a reconciliation bill.  And,obviously, their concern would be that they wouldn't -- it would getan agreement here that certain Democratic senators might not be ableto destroy the agreement by a filibuster on the floor after themembers here have worked it out.  So there's -- that's a proceduralquestion.     Q Tony, the Speaker is still against a clean CR, is that notcorrect?     MR. MCCURRY: Listen, I want John to do -- and this is -- ourpurpose here is -- my colleagues are here to give you an update onthe meeting that's going on here.  I think if they want to talk aboutthe procedural issues, which are important, and the rights ofindividual senators to raise points, which the White Houseacknowledges is a very important part of the procedure on CapitolHill, they should really brief you up on Capitol Hill about thoseprocedures.     Q But he has the right of rebuttal.     MR. HALLEY: Yes, thank you.  But to restate, the Democrats, aswe've tried to do for weeks, are fully supportive of opening thegovernment and fully supportive of that -- the piece of this, whichis to deem workers as essential.  And so that's not the issue.     The reason we'd be objecting to this procedural notion is,again, because it would deny the ability to amend and debate fully.And as we did in 1990, there is a way to reestablish a reconciliationbill.  As you may recall, in 1990 after the agreement was reached, wedid another budget resolution that would then trigger areconciliation bill under the full procedures of reconciliation.  Andso that option is open to us.  And we felt that, therefore, we didnot need to run around completely the entire budget process withsomething that we'd do this evening.     MR. MCCURRY: Okay, anything more on the meeting going on nowbefore we exit?     Q Yes, Mike.  Does the President intend or feel he will need tobefore Senator Daschle and Senator Exon leave the White Housetonight, make the point to them that apparently if everything is soclose to reopening the government, they should set aside -- does heintend to have a separate thing with them, saying set aside yourobjection to this; I really want you to do it?     MR. MCCURRY: No, he has such good working relations with themthat I don't think he feels that there's a need to cover that point.     Q There were briefings on the Hill earlier about the areas thatwere covered at the budget advisory report, or whatever it's called.Can you say whether the leaders here essentially worked within thatframework?  Did they go in it or out of it or --     MR. MCCURRY: Based on what I know -- I don't have a completereadout of their entire discussions tonight.  They did review some ofthose issues that the advisers dealt with today.  They also movedinto what are referred to in their argot now as the tier threeissues, which are more difficult issues that are -- where thedifferences are more fundamental between the sides.     Q Which one?  Medicaid --     MR. MCCURRY: I'm just not -- we're not authorized to get intothe substance of their dialogue.     Q Mike, can you explain what the benefit would be of this pieceof legislation that's having its difficulties this evening?  Itsounds as though what you're talking about doing is essentiallybringing 260,000 people back who then will join a bunch of otherpeople who aren't getting paychecks.  They'll all be getting theirpaychecks, there still will be money for their designated agencies to--     MR. MCCURRY: We would prefer, obviously, any type of continuingresolution that would reopen the government.  That's been thePresident's view all along.  We believe the government should beopen.  We have believed for a long time there should be a clean CRthat would do so.  But we're dealing, and we have to be realisticabout the environment we're dealing with.  And these gentlemen canspeak better than I can on the attitudes on the Hill.     On the other hand, the effective legislation that would exceptfederal employees who are currently furloughed from the furloughwould be to incur a legal obligation to pay them.  That legalobligation would be very useful to federal workers that need any typeof short-term loan to make mortgage payments or who can produce thatas evidence to a creditor that they got the ability to pay bills thatare due.  I think that would be at least some comfort to federalworkers.  It would be far better for them to get a paycheck, farbetter for them to go back to work, far better for them to provideservices to the American people.  That at least it's something, andsomething is better than nothing.     Q So you don't mind if they try to amend -- they block theability to amend the --     MR. MCCURRY: As I just heard, that -- I could tell from theirdiscussion, that's way over my head.  I think there is some work,clearly, that Congress will have to do on this.  The President's viewhe stated very clearly earlier; he would like to see those federalworkers back to work as quickly as possible.     Q Any guidance beyond talks tomorrow?     MR. MCCURRY: No, I don't have anything for the days beyond thator what time they might finish tomorrow, or would they finish in timefor various people to make travel plans.  I don't have any guidanceon that.     Q How are you going to let us know, Mike, if they're going tomeet and what time in the morning?  All-call or --     MR. MCCURRY: We will do an all-call tomorrow and also put in onthe recording as soon as we know what the time is.  But I would checkin here.  I think the President still plans to do the radio addresslive tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., so you will -- at least at thatpoint --     Q Live from the talks?     Q You wouldn't expect it before the radio address, would you,Mike?     MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, let me amend that.  Just in case theywant to start earlier, if they end up deciding they want to startearlier, there's some chance that we might have to pretape the radioaddress earlier in the morning.  So check here tomorrow morning.     Q What is it going to be on?     Q If Senator Dole give the rebuttal, will he do that live --     Q Pass the mike around the table.     Q Is he going to do that from here?     MR. HINE: I think we're operating under the same conditions thatMike on that.  It's entirely possible --     Q Mike, just to clarify -- you're not suggesting that thismeasure that's being conducted this evening would restore thegovernment to full functioning.     MR. MCCURRY: No, it would -- our understanding is it would allowfederal workers to return to their work, it would allow them to docertain accepted activity that would be authorized by theirindividual agencies.  That would be some progress.  It would allow insome cases, my understanding is, for applications to be processed.For example, one example is it's conceivable to me under thislegislation, unless my colleagues disagree, that they might be ableto begin issuing passports again for people who wish to travel, justas one example.     Now, that's an activity that doesn't incur any additionalobligation to spend money on the part of the government, but itallows some measure of government services to be restored to theAmerican people.  And that would be better than nothing, as I saidearlier.     Q Can you open the national parks under this?     MR. MCCURRY: I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know theanswer.     Q Sometime this evening could you get us a reaction to -- thePresident's reaction to the Senate Democrats stopping that processthat you just outlined?     MR. MCCURRY: I think I commented on that already.  They didn'tsay they were stopping it --     MR. HALLEY: We're not.  We're --     MR. MCCURRY: They've got a plan to reopen the government by aclean continuing resolution, which is something, as you know, thePresident is strongly supportive of.     Q What's the chance of getting a clean CR?     Q Do you have any idea what the mood is in the room?     MR. MCCURRY: Unless my colleagues would dispute thischaracterization, they clearly are very serious in purpose.  As Isaid, many of them have their coats off, they've got their sleevesrolled up, they've got pens out and --     Q Why didn't they do that before?     MR. MCCURRY: -- they're working very seriously on the relevantissues.     Q Is the Senate essentially in town?     MR. HINE: Yes, we're in session.  We're in recess subject to thecall of the chair.     Q So if there had to be a roll call -- you don't expect aroll-call vote tomorrow, for example?  If the majority found itnecessary to have a roll-call vote to tamp down the Democratsthinking --     MR. HINE: I'm not certain that that's how events are going tounfold.     Q Mike, why couldn't all of this have been done Tuesday orWednesday?     MR. MCCURRY: Tuesday or Wednesday -- you mean earlier in thisweek?  The process that was defined by the principals last Friday, aweek ago today, called for the staff-level discussions and analysisto begin on Tuesday and Wednesday, which occurred.  It clearly wasvery useful for that to happen because it's been the premise for alot of the work that occurred today, and that the principals aredoing now.     There was an alternative procedure that had been discussed awhile back.  That was not available to the President or theprincipals for reasons everyone in this room knows.  This is theprocess that was available.  This is the process that at the momentappears to be working.     Q A question for John, just to clear up the Senate action.  Doesthe Senate action -- say, it happened tonight or tomorrow -- doesthat have to be by unanimous consent, or can there be a vote on it,which presumably could override the Democrats' objection?  And thencould the Democrats, say, filibuster to prevent a vote?     MR. HALLEY: No -- I mean, our intent is to -- I mean, you wouldneed consent at this time of day.  Again, our intent -- we've triedI'd say 10 times in the last two weeks to pass a continuingresolution that would open the government, and that's our position.     Q A continuing resolution, not just this deeming measure?     MR. HALLEY: Right.     Q You're talking about a real, live CR?     MR. HALLEY: Right, a complete opening.  A real, liveput-people-back-to-work and pay them, and open the agencies.     MR. MCCURRY: This meeting will be over before the briefing endsif we don't move on.     Q John, can you spell your last name?     MR. HALLEY: H-a-l-l-e-y.     Q Any idea when you might be able to give us some guidance aboutHilton Head?     MR. MCCURRY: It won't be tonight, and it will be late in the daytomorrow.  I just don't have any way to give you any guidance.     Q Can you say how early could these talks -- 7:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m.tomorrow morning?     MR. MCCURRY: I believe that will depend entirely on how late Mr.Panetta, the chairman and the congressional group works this evening.I think their intent is to work rather late and that might make thestart not at the crack of dawn, but somewhat around mid-morningtomorrow.     Q At 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.?     MR. MCCURRY: And then I would suspect that the President and theother principals would commence shortly after that.  So I don't -- myguess is around mid-morning, but we'll wait and see and give youguidance as we've got it.     Q Tomorrow the principals meeting would be back here, not at theCapitol?     MR. MCCURRY: It sounded to me like the intent is to meet here.     THE PRESS: Thank you.             END 6:40 P.M.

EST     MR. MCCURRY: Second verse, same as the first.  Bye.  (Laughter.)     Q Do you know now how the President feels about the Democraticmove in the Senate?     MR. MCCURRY: The President believes that we'll able to work --given the cooperation shown today, we can work something out thatwill allow federal workers to resume their diligent service to theAmerican people.     Q Tonight?     Q What's that mean?     MR. MCCURRY: It will be up to senators and leaders on the Hillto resolve those issues, but we hope they will.     Q Well, does he agree that the Democrats have a point?     MR. MCCURRY: He understands the concerns the senators have tomake sure they've got the right protected to debate very importantbudget matters and the very few hours of hearings and debate devotedto aspects of the Republican budget.  And he well understands whypeople are protecting the right to have further debate.  At the sametime, he will encourage all members of Congress from both parties toact quickly to allow federal workers to return to their posts.     Q Mike, when you say work something out, does the President --is the President given to understand that there will be somethingdone today or tomorrow to work something out to return furloughedfederal employees back to the job -- to their jobs?     MR. MCCURRY: The sense the President got is that congressionalleaders on both sides of the aisle are working urgently to solve thematter.     Q -- conciliatory to me.     MR. MCCURRY: -- let me tell you what I know about tonight.They're taking a break.  Mr. Panetta and his group from the WhiteHouse will return to Capitol Hill, begin meeting with the so-calledbudget advisers group, approximately 8:00 p.m.  It's my understandingthey do not plan any further readouts this evening.  They arecontinuing to work through issues that they then prepare fordiscussion by the budget advisers.  I anticipate that staffs aregoing to be working throughout the evening and into the morning toprepare discussion documents that will be used by the principalstomorrow.  They've agreed to reconvene here at the White House at10:30 a.m. tomorrow.  That's the principals group.     Q How does that affect the radio address?  Still be done live?     MR. MCCURRY: The radio address is going to be done taped just toprotect -- make sure we don't have any -- because the President maybe involved in pre-briefs prior to the meeting.     Q What's the subject?     MR. MCCURRY: It will be about the budget.     Q When will that be available, Mike?     MR. MCCURRY: He's taping it tomorrow morning, and we expect itwill be available just shortly before air time.     Q Mike, the Republicans all left tonight without comment.  Didthe meeting end in an atmosphere of --     MR. MCCURRY: It ended very amicably.  And the President, theSpeaker, the Majority Leader and the Democratic leaders agreed thatthe readout that you heard earlier this evening would suffice for thework that they did between roughly 6:00 p.m.  and 7:20 p.m.     Q -- resolution tomorrow, Mike?  What does it look like?     MR. MCCURRY: Say again.     Q For the prospects of a resolution tomorrow.     MR. MCCURRY: A resolution -- you mean a resolution of issues or--     Q Yes.     MR. MCCURRY: They will make progress tomorrow, but I don't --the work they're doing, it would be very hard at this point topredict that they would arrive at any final agreements tomorrow.They've got a lot of work to do tomorrow.     Q Do you this going, then, into Sunday?     MR. MCCURRY: Conceivably, yes.  But that's not been decided yet.     Q Do you have a reaction from the President to the Daschleblocking this plan that --     MR. MCCURRY: Yes, we talked about that earlier.     Q Is there a meeting with Panetta and the budget adviserstomorrow morning before the principals meeting?  There was some talkabout a 9:00 a.m. meeting on the Hill before the principals came downhere.  Was there any talk about that?     MR. MCCURRY: They may -- the budget advisers group may reconvenetomorrow morning, but they -- that would be prior to the 10:30 a.m.meeting --     Q Why did the President cut off a reporter from asking Gingrichwhether he had caved?     MR. MCCURRY: The President -- (inaudible) -- felt that there hadbeen any indication by the Speaker that he had, quote, unquote, caved-- (inaudible) -- the President also thought he might give a betteranswer than the Speaker might.  (Laughter.)     Q What?     Q He wants peace to reign.     Q -- single issue was set aside as agreed upon or anythingnarrowed substantially --     MR. MCCURRY: The procedure they've been using for thesediscussions is that any element discussed and any element that theyreach consensus upon would not change the admonition that nothing isfinally agreed until everything is agreed.     Q Your sense, Mike, about any travel plans the President mayhave that could be tomorrow or more likely Sunday now?     MR. MCCURRY: I have no sense, but the President seemed to beenjoying himself here as much as he would in South Carolina.(Laughter.)     Q You have no sense of that?     Q -- answer to that question that nothing is agreed untileverything is agreed -- what you're saying is, whatever differencesthey narrow today have no permanent status because everything has tobe agreed to or--     MR. MCCURRY: As a common negotiating device, they usually --even as they work through complicated issues, that they reserve theright at the end of the discussion to go back and look at the entirepackage.  And they have done so here, and I suspect they willcontinue to do so -- that they will go back and look at the finalpackage that they get, if they in fact get one, before they agreethat they've got a final agreement.     Q But you -- as you agree, you guys are just checking it off andmoving on to the next one, and then --     MR. MCCURRY: Yes, but what they're doing -- they're doing -- Imean, without getting into the substance, because I'm not authorizedto get into the substance, they are working through a set of issuesthat have been identified.  The budget advisers today met, dealt witha series of budget issues, not all of them, but many of them.  Theywere analyzed in some detail, discussions papers were prepared.  Theywere reviewed today.  The budget advisers will now go back up to theHill, continue to address elements of the budget discussion.  Theywill be analyzed, discussion drafts will be prepared, and they'llwork again on it tomorrow.  They're taking these issues serially asthey work through a series of contentious issues that range from the-- starting with the less controversial and moving to the morecontroversial.  And they clearly now are moving into areas that aremore controversial.     Q On the Hill tonight do you think there will be action to getthe workers back to work?     MR. MCCURRY: I cannot predict that.  You've heard the discussionof the representatives and the congressional leadership earlier, andit will be up to them to --     Q Mike, are there going to be simultaneous meetings with thebudget leaders up on the Hill, meeting at the same time that themeetings down here are taking place, or do they complete --     Q I think Tony Blankley said --     Q He did indicate -- Tony indicated that they'd be up on theHill, you know, working on churning stuff out even for future issues-- even as --     MR. MCCURRY: Oh, yes, they have -- well, we have -- there havebeen staff -- staff work has continued even while the principals aremeeting, yes.  In fact, there's some -- staff has been available inthe Roosevelt Room in case there is a need for expert advice onbudget related issues, and they continue.     Q With Cabinet-level people?  Will they be meeting also at thesame --     MR. MCCURRY: I wouldn't rule it out, but mostly the people whoare there are more staff level experts.     Q -- radio address subject?     MR. MCCURRY: It will be the budget situation generally.  It willalso be, because it's the last radio address of the year, it will bea review of 1995.     Q Mike, unrelated, is the policy out here changed at all, or wasthat just a mis --     MR. MCCURRY: That was a regrettable misunderstanding, and Ibelieve we have got meetings going on right now to straighten out --     Q That's not the first time it's happened today.  It's happenedseveral times.     MR. MCCURRY: I understand, and there's --     Q Some people decided not to provoke a fight and --     MR. MCCURRY: Right.  They're working to clarify what the groundrules are on -- (inaudible) -- because they obviously --     Q Is the President going out tonight?     MR. MCCURRY: Say again.     Q Is the President going out tonight?     MR. MCCURRY: Not that I'm aware of.  Is he?  He is?  Pool alert-- that he may go out for dinner apparently.     Q Where?     MR. MCCURRY: Okay, see you all tomorrow.     THE PRESS: Thank you.             END 7:35 P.M.

EST     THE PRESIDENT: I want to be brief today because we're gettingoff to a little late start.  We've got a lot to do.  I have threethings to say.  I think we made a good start yesterday, we're makingprogress, and I believe we need to open the government.  I hope wecan agree to do all that.     Q Sir, do you know any more information on the soldier who waswounded in Bosnia?     THE PRESIDENT: Our reports are sketchy and I have tried to getan update, but what I do know is that there were apparently twovehicles and four soldiers involved.  Only one was seriously hurt andhe has been medivacked to Croatia in a hospital there, and weunderstand he's in stable condition.     But mines have always been our biggest concern and we're workingvery hard on it, but that's what happened.  And we'll continue tomonitor it and do the best we can.  The mission itself is going verywell.  The people have received our soldiers very well and I'm verywell satisfied with the progress.  And I'm obviously very sorry thishappened, but they're making good progress on the mine problem, butit's going to be difficult to get rid of them all.     Q -- the measure to get the workers back that's going to getthrough Congress?     SENATOR DOLE: Well, it passed the House.  We hope we can pass inthe Senate today, so make some progress.     SENATOR DASCHLE: We tried to pass a clean CR, one without anyconditions.  And that was objected to, but I hope we can worksomething out.     Q But isn't the fact now that the Democrats are holding thingsup?     SENATOR DASCHLE: Not at all.  As a matter of fact, as I said, wepassed a continuing resolution -- we had no conditions.  It sentpeople back to work, and that was objected to.  So we're not tryingto hold anything up here.  We hope we can get some sort of anagreement as early as today.     Q Well, what's it going to take to get a deal?     SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just something.  I think thePresident had a right -- we're glad to have you all in.  We have alot of work to do.  We made, I thought, real progress last night.  Itis not easy.  We have very significant areas we have to work on, butI thought the spirit was very positive.  We don't just want to getthe federal workers back, we want to get them paid.  And in order todo that, I think we've got to get this whole thing worked out.But I thought we had a great start last night.  And with you all'spermission, I think we can get a lot more done in the next few hours.     Q Mr. President, is the message from the Democrats basicallythat they don't trust you?     THE PRESIDENT: We've got to go to work.  Thank you very much.     THE PRESS: Thank you.             END 11:37 A.M.

EST     Q  Mr. President, are you close to a deal today?     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you where we are today.  We hada very long discussion yesterday.  We discussed almost all the issueswhere we had differences on our plans financially, in termsthe dollars.  And this morning we're going to have an extensivediscussion of the Medicare policy.  And then we're going to give ourstaffs some instruction.  We're going to meet again on Tuesday andwe're going to do our best to work through this and come to anaccord.     My New Year's wish is that we'll get this balancedbudget plan and we'll do it in a way that protects the things that wecare about -- the Medicare, the Medicaid, the education andenvironment, the other issues, and we've been working at it.  I'vebeen very well pleased and I think we've been somewhat successfulbecause we haven't said very much about it.  We've just got to keepworking until we reach an accord.     Q  Mr. President, will you touch on -- negotiations --     Q  Will you leave town today without reopening thegovernment, of the three --     SPEAKER GINGRICH:  I'm sure we'll be talking about that, that'sone of the things we want to get done and get agreed to.  So we'retrying to work out how to get the federal employees back to work-- we'd also like to get them paid, I think that's an integralpart of getting them back to work.  But as the President said, Ithink, frankly, most of our success so far has been that we've beenin this room talking with each other and not getting involved innegotiating in public, and I think we've made a lot of progress.     Q  To follow on that, sir, is it healthy to have theHouse speakers talking on CNN yesterday on the --     SPEAKER GINGRICH:  Oh, that is nonsense.  I told thePresident on Friday that I was so favorable about him in answeringtheir big question on Evans & Novak that I thought he'd want to seeit.  The fact is we're working very well together.  I was asked aquestion about the campaign next year, and I suspect if you ask Mr.Gephardt or Vice President Gore about how they'll campaign next year,they'll give you similar answers.  We're negotiating very well from agovernment standpoint in here and I think we have a lot to be proudof.  Our New Year's wish ought to be that we get this done and givethe American people a balanced budget and the government paid for andback to work.     SENATOR DOLE:  The Senate is going to meet at noon,we'll try to pass something to help the federal employees.     Q  Are you closer?     SENATOR DOLE:  Oh, we're about six feet apart.(Laughter.)     SENATOR DASCHLE:  We'll be a lot closer in a couple ofhours.  (Laughter.)     THE PRESIDENT:  We're working at it steady.  Happy NewYear everybody.     THE PRESS:  Happy New Year.

EST -0- /U.S. Newswire  202-347-2770/Back to Headline List CopyrightU.S. NEWSWIRE via NewsNetJanuary 01, 1996 Transcript of White House Press Briefing by Mike McCurry To: National Desk Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 /U.S. Newswire/ --  Following is a transcriptof a press briefing by Mike McCurry:                          The Briefing Room12:40 P.M. EST     MR. MCCURRY:  Let me just tell you what's going on rightnow.  The President of the United States is thanking individually thevarious members of the budget staffs that have been supporting theadministration team during these discussions, folks from Health andHuman Services, Treasury, OMB, the National Economic Council, Mr.Panetta's staff, those that have done extraordinary work over thelast week and, as you'll be able to tell in a moment, have got anextraordinary amount of work today and tomorrow.     The budget discussions today led to an agreement by theprincipals to instruct staff to really summarize the discussionsthey've been able to have over the last several days, which resultedin exploring the differences that exist in a range of areas fromincome support programs to welfare, to tax issues, to health carefinance issues -- to really summarize those discussions and drawtogether the places where there appeared to be some agreement betweenthe Republican side, the administration and the congressionalDemocrats; and then, also set forth in more precise detail the areasthat there clearly are still differences.     That will lead to a meeting that will happen here at theWhite House Tuesday evening, either late afternoon or early evening-- I suspect more early evening -- between the budget principals.They will reconvene, review the discussion document that is preparedby staff over the next day and a half, and they will begin, I thinkthey all believe, the more serious discussions of tradeoffs thatexist on the large issues that will be fundamental to a finalagreement.  But they all clearly remain committed to this process andthe process is working.  They are making progress because they aredefining the areas of agreement and disagreement more clearly.  Andthe President's satisfied that they're making progress.     The President also strongly encouraged the congressionalleaders to find a way to pass some measure that would restore federalworkers to their rightful places of employment.  He also wants themto be paid, but he understands that those are -- there are differentpoints of view on that issue.  He hopes they can resolve some ofthese issues.     Q  What's his point of view on that?     MR. MCCURRY:  He believes they should be working, theyshould be paid, and the government should be fully open, as he saidover and over and over again.     Q  Any suggestion, any hint that they were close toworking some deal today?     MR. MCCURRY:  They worked on it a lot.  There wasconsiderable side-bar discussion during this meeting between Houseand Senate staffers, and Senate staffers between the Republican andDemocratic side, and that will lead to whatever action occurs on theHill shortly.     Q  Did Dole and Daschle say they would --     MR. MCCURRY:  I'm not going to comment on the businessthat they need to do themselves on the Hill.     Q  Mike, Tony Blankley said that there was one areathat was not covered in the walk-through.  What is that area?  Hesaid it was one major area.     MR. MCCURRY:  I suspect -- can you run and check onthis?  I suspect the answer to that is Medicaid.  But Barry will runthat down.     Q  They didn't act on that at all?     MR. MCCURRY:  They spent a lot of time discussingMedicare.  The almost entire discussion today was devoted to Medicareand different options.  And what the President and congressionalleaders asked for is something that really defines more clearly whatthe policy choices are in Medicare given the respective positions ofthe various budget proposals that are out there.     Q  Mike, in the event that there is some kind of dealin the Senate, will there be any briefing here on what -- thetechnicalities of what that means for the government?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, if there's a final agreement inCongress that would restore federal workers to their jobs, OMB staffwill be available to talk about how that will affect any restartactivities that they have.  But we'll direct that to OMB becausethey'll be in the best place to analyze that.     Q  Mike, can you confirm that as of yesterday they hadan agreement in principle to at least a packet of savings of $100billion in social spending?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, that would be -- that requires somerough eyeballing that I don't think you can really do under thecircumstances.  There are different ways that you can look at thecategories of things they've done here.  There are some areas wherethere are clear agreements and they should be able to rather quicklywrite the legislative language that would lock in some of the thingsthey've agreed to.     There are other areas where it's a little fuzzier, wherethere are some different options that exist and you could get a rangeof savings depending on how you calculate it.  But my guess is -- Isaw that comment in one of the stories today; I think that wasprobably a rough eyeball guess that someone made that would try toput a numeric value on some of the work they've done.  Frankly, I'dcaution people here against using that kind of calculation becausethe ranges are so large when you look at the big ticket issues.There could be considerably more in savings, depending on how youjudge the progress they made on some of these discussions.     Q  What are the differences on Medicaid without goinginto detail?  Are they financial or are they philosophical?     MR. MCCURRY:  Both.     MR. TOIV:  Medicaid is the issue, but it was discussedin the context of block grants, the whole block grant issue, but notseparately as a --     MR. MCCURRY:  The fundamental dispute there is theguarantee of health care coverage and the federal entitlement andwhat happens if you block-grant it.  Now, that's a large issue andone of the issues covered particularly as they dealt with domesticdiscretionary spending, which they did both yesterday afternoon andyesterday evening.     So I think that they've touched on that aspect ofMedicaid, but they haven't gone through all the -- they haven't gonethrough it in the same detail and precision on that issue as theyhave some of the other areas that they've looked at.  Now, that willbe covered by some of the staff work.  They are going to take somelook at issues related to that as they work over the next day and ahalf.  They'll be preparing some side-by-side analyses of how thedifferent issues play out.     Q  Are they working from the same base numbers?     MR. MCCURRY:  They're working from the same calculationof what the budget impact is based on CBO numbers, yes.     Q  What's the point of all these hours of walkingthrough this?  It seems to me we all know what the big differencesare.     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, that's not necessarily true.  Imean, everyone knows what the big differences are and what the bignumbers look like on a single sheet of paper.  But remember, everyone of those large numbers is premised on fundamental policydecisions that have a great deal of nuance and complexity associatedwith them.  And I think it's encouraging and the principals areencouraged at how detailed these discussions have been.  They havelooked item by item at these policy implications of the largenumbers.     I think many Americans think, well, gee, you gettogether in the room and you split the difference in a simplearithmetic.  That's not policymaking.  Policymaking requiresattention to the detail that underscores each of those numbers.  Andthat's the work they've been doing.     Now, based on the very intense discussions they've had,the staff can now summarize in a much more detailed fashion what thespecifics of a legislative approach to a final budget agreement wouldlook like.  That's encouraging because it means if they do reach anagreement on a final budget package, the work of assembling that andputting it in legislative language would be considerably easier basedon the discussions they've had here.  In a sense, one participantcompared this to something like a conference committee on the Hill;they're doing much the same thing they would do in a House-Senateconference committee, looking at big issues, discussing the policydifferences, and then making it possible for staff to write whatamounts to a conference report.     Q  Are they getting a sense of how far away they arefrom reaching some kind of final agreement?  Are they getting a senseof the kind of time frame they're looking at?     MR. MCCURRY:  They could be so near or so far awaybecause it will depend in part on what types of tradeoffs they makeon the large issues.  They have not attempted to take the big issues,as Hillary just said that everyone knows are out there, and reconcilethem.  They've approached this from saying, let's narrow as closelyas we can the differences that exist and define better what types oftradeoffs will exist once you've reached those big decisions.  But Isuspect that by Tuesday night when they meet again, they're going tostart moving to those more fundamental issues that will have to beembraced if there's going to be a final agreement, which is why rightnow it's impossible to say one way or another whether they willactually reach an agreement.     Q  -- an agreement in the order in which they'll takeup the big issues?  Because, as you've said in the past, you wouldprefer that the spending and the final decisions on spendingdetermine the size of a tax cut.     MR. MCCURRY:  I don't believe -- they have given a listof specifics to the staff to address, but I can't say for certainthat the principals will work through those issues in the same order-- that they go from income maintenance through health care financeissues to discretionary spending issues to revenue issues.  But Idon't guarantee that that's the order in which they will be addressedon Tuesday night.     Q  Would you say that they have finished stage one,the walk-through process, then and are getting -- are heading intostage two, the decision-making process?     MR. MCCURRY:  They finished the walk-through processduring the course of the day yesterday, with the exception of themore detailed discussion of Medicare that they wished to have today.They are now preparing for what amounts to the tradeoffs that willhave to occur.     Q  Is the President ready to compromise and trade off?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, the President is ready to continueto discuss these issues in good faith.     Q  In what context have they discussed SocialSecurity?     MR. MCCURRY:  It has been related to many of theirdiscussions of health care finance, Medicare in particular, andrelated in some respects to their AFDC discussions since they're allcovered by the various titles of the Social Security Act.     Q  Did they talk about it in terms of --     MR. MCCURRY:  They've had -- I believe they had a verybrief discussion of the CPI issue, and there was not instantresolution of that.     Q  You said that there's a day-and-a-half discussionbeginning on Tuesday evening that concerns --     MR. MCCURRY:  I'm sorry, it was a day and a half forwork now.  The staff is going to be working -- one of the reasons thePresident wanted to spend some time with our courageous and noblestaffers is they are now going to work for the rest of the day todayand they're apparently going to start about 9:00 a.m. tomorrow andthey'll be able to work all day long tomorrow.  That's not going tobe any -- we're not going to arrange any press coverage of that,that's just the work they're going to be doing, both informal andprobably getting together at various points.     Q  Going back to -- how would you characterize theagreement so far money-wise?  You won't say $100 billion.  How wouldyou characterize it -- issue-wise, money-wise?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, they've made good progress.  It's alarge sum of money, but it's not satisfactory -- wouldn't besufficient to reach the balanced budget goals.  That would requiresome additional decision-making that obviously wouldn't happen beforeTuesday night.     Q  Can you offer any color or anecdotal details oftoday's meeting?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, they continued -- we do the best onfood more than anything else.  (Laughter.)  They had the traditionalcongressional meeting donuts back today, for some reason.  We were ona health food kick yesterday, but today -- normally, when thebipartisan congressional leadership meet with the President they havewonderful donuts available.  And they reappeared and quicklydisappeared during the meeting today.     There was a lot of kibitzing.  As the result of beingtogether over the couple of days, there were moments where thepartisan sides are able to tease each other or get little quips in oneach other from time to time, and there was a fair amount of thatgoing on.  I don't have a specific example of that that I can thinkof off my head, but there's some of what I would describe as generalribbing back and forth.     The Speaker was concerned that we all make sure that--he was concerned about a question he got in the pool session thismorning and he was nervous that we not over-interpret those -- theappearance on the Evans and Novak Show.  Some of us watched that andsome of us managed to stay awake through it.  (Laughter.)     Q  As he shouted Ron down -- did they discuss that?As he shouted Ron down, did he and the President then discuss that?     MR. MCCURRY:  No, they didn't.  They didn't, althoughthe Speaker reached that with some of us and we didn't take anyoffense at his remarks.     Q  You didn't take any offense at the remarks at all?     MR. MCCURRY:  No.  Compared to other things that hesays, they -- (laughter.)     Q  Dole and Gingrich have said before that they seeWednesday as sort of a deadline; they're going to be adjourningCongress and reopening Congress.  Is there any sense that you'll knowby Wednesday that you're going to have a deal or you're not going tohave a deal?     MR. MCCURRY:  You mean on this question of federalworkers and --     Q  No, no, no.  No, over the budget deal, the budgetnegotiations.     Q  The CR would expire -- I mean, they're saying thatyou're supposed to have it finished in the first session, whichis --     MR. MCCURRY:  In the statutory and in the first sessionis on Wednesday, and clearly one reason they're meeting Tuesday nightis with that deadline in mind.  But I wouldn't predict at this pointit would be possible to get an outline of agreement by Wednesday.Certainly everyone hopes to get an agreement on a balanced budget asquickly as possible.     Q  I watched the back-and-forth there.  The money thatwe're not supposed to put a numerical figure on that's notnecessarily $100 billion, but is something -- what does that concern?     MR. MCCURRY:  I made that so absolutely, magnificentlyimpenetrable, there would be no way you could answer that.(Laughter.)  Look, the reason is as you look through these issues itcould be -- they've got -- $100 billion is a rough estimate of someof the work that were in the so-called tier two issues that werebeing handled at the budget advisors level.  That's where it has comefrom.     Now, if you look at some of the other issue areas -- theso-called tier three issues -- where they've identified someagreement in policy approaches, they've got considerably more thanthat, I would guess.  But I can't put a dollar figure on that, norshould I, because it's subject to further discussion.  And in anyevent, as we've said all along again, they have to get agreement on awhole package before it all matters.     Q  Tier two is what?  Tier two is nonentitlement,discretionary --     MR. MCCURRY:  Tier one -- they've defined issues as theyworked at both the staff and budget advisor issues as tier one, tiertwo, tier three issues, as they rank order some of the policyquestions.  And just, for example, in the area of revenues I thinkthere were, what, Barry -- 70 separate issues that they needed toexamine.     Now, they range from -- tier one would be somethingwhich there is a common approach both in the balanced budget act, inthe President's approach on policy terms that's reflected in some ofthe other discussion documents they've looked at, whether it'sBreaux-Chafee, whether it's Daschle, whether it's the coalitionbudget, that there's some commonality approach and they think theycan lock in language that would satisfy everybody.  So, in otherwords, a done deal; it looks like that will be easy to do.     Tier two are areas where there are differences, butthey're fairly close.  They can be significant policy issues, butthere are ways in which you could bridge the gaps.  And theyconcentrated a lot of work on the tier two issues.  And I thinkthat's where they found agreement that would take you beyond thismythical $100 billion that was reported somewhere today.     And then tier three issues are the more fundamentaldifferences that really are central to getting final agreement.  Andas I say, those are ones in which they agree to sharpen up thediscussion by really looking for how you define and analyze thetradeoffs that would have to happen in order to reconcile those twoor three issues.  But that's work that will have to go on on Tuesday.     Q  Does it have to be balanced down to a penny?  Imean, it has to be actually -- the numbers have to be coincidingtotally?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, they -- it's more -- the moreimportant issue and then more of these discussions have been aroundthe policy has to be agreed to, how do you -- what's the policy goingto be.     Q  Are tax cuts on the table?     MR. MCCURRY:  Tax relief for working families has alwaysbeen on the table.     Q  I didn't ask that.  I asked would tax cuts --     Q  When this is all finished, for each of the majortopics they talked about will there be a figure for each of sevenfiscal years that will be the limit leading to a zero deficit?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, when it's all said and done and theyhave a final agreement they will have a document that then can bescored by CBO that could produce that type of analysis, sure.     Q  Going back to -- can you characterize at all this-- without the figure, what kind of subject areas there areagreement?  How will you characterize the areas they have agreementon?  You don't want to do it money-wise.  Subject-wise, anythingbesides --     MR. MCCURRY:  No, that's a -- I mean, substantivelywe're not -- that just is more fuel for a lot of incorrectspeculation.  And as the Speaker made the point today, that it hashelped them that they've not tried to score points in the publicdiscussion of these deliberations.     Q  I just want to clarify -- if, for purpose ofdiscussion the President is talking about CBO assumptions in all ofthese discussions, is he then acquiescing to CBO's growthpredictions, its interest rate predictions?     MR. MCCURRY:  Not necessarily.  I mean, that might bethat the issue of how you define assumption, will look at assumptions-- and more importantly, how you decided when certain budget featureswould trigger on or trigger off.     Q  I'm sorry, could you run that past me one moretime?  You're saying he is not in agreement with the CBO --     MR. MCCURRY:  I said that -- the question is aboutassumptions, has he agreed to lock in the CBO assumptions.  I thinkthat's still an area that the principals could explore as they lookat issues like when certain budget features trigger on, trigger off,how you measure that and how you look at impact.  For purposes ofthese discussions they have agreed to a CBO evaluation on what thebudget options are.  I'm not going to get any more specific than whatI just said, although I just gave you a very good hint.     Q  In talking about Medicare today and trying to talkabout their differences of viewpoint on medical inflation, what arethey -- whose numbers are they utilizing?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, for an informed discussion they use-- they were relying on budget experts at CBO, at HHS, they werelooking at different types of analysis.     QQ  Oh, this is the last tier thing where if you savemoney on discretionary in the last years then you have to triggeroff, based on if you beat the CBO assumptions?     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, trigger-on, trigger-off is an aspectof various budget proposals that are out there.  There are some inthe coalitions, there is one in the President's most recent offer.     Q  What's he going to do at Hilton Head?     MR. MCCURRY:  In Hilton Head he's looking forward toseeing his friends, first and foremost; spending time with hisfamily; having dinner with his friends tonight and spending some timeoutdoors tomorrow.  It's been raining --     Q  What time do you expect --     Q  Mike, will he say anything on going out to thehelicopter?     MR. MCCURRY:  No, I think he wants to just get downthere and see his friends and have New Year's Eve with people he'sspent New Year's Eve with for the last 12 years.     All right, happy New Year, everybody.  Have a safe andprosperous 1996.     Q  Did they all wish each other a happy New Year?     MR. MCCURRY:  They did.  Actually, they said goodbye toeach other, happy New Year to each other.  There was a little bit ofdiscussion about travel plans for everybody.  I think, as you know,Senator Dole after the senate session is going up to New Hampshire.     Q  Did the President wish him well?     MR. MCCURRY:  There was some good natured discussion.He's going for the first eve festivities, or something like that.  Iwould say that there continues to be a good atmosphere in thesediscussions, but everybody is realistic enough to know that there aresharp differences that still exist and that there's a lot of hardwork ahead.     Q  Any idea when they're going to actually be donewith any sort of an agreement on the seven-year plan -- to they havea time -- can't do it by Wednesday?     MR. MCCURRY:  No, I think -- I think that everyoneunderstands -- the President is very cognizant of the Speaker'sconcern about doing this within the statutory calendar of the firstsession.  In fact, the President, at several points when it wassuggested there's going to be a lot of work that would have to bedone to get this discussion document together, that it might not bedone by Tuesday, the President admonished everybody again and said itwas very hard to ask people to work on the holiday.  But that becauseof the Speaker's concern about January 3rd and that date, that it wasimportant to have a meeting during the day on Tuesday, even if it hadto be late in the day.  So we understand the importance of that andthat's why everyone is committed to trying to work this through asquickly as they can.     Q  Do you think there will be meetings between theprincipals Wednesday, Thursday -- every day until there's --     MR. MCCURRY:  I can't predict.  I'm taking it a day at aday.  I'll tell you what I know, they plan to meet Tuesday night andwe'll see where we go from there.     Q  So they have until midnight Wednesday night,Thursday morning -- or is that --     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, that's not -- I want to make itclear that's not a -- that's a date that's important to the Speaker,for reasons that the Speaker can tell you because it relates to thestatutory deadline of the first session, and it also relates to thecontinuing resolution issue.  But I think we need -- you know, fromour point of view we just need to continue to work to try to resolvethe issues and do it as expeditiously as possible.     Q  Is it midnight Tuesday or midnight Wednesday --     MR. MCCURRY:  You should ask the House Speaker.  It'stheir deadline, not ours.     Thank you.             END                          1:00 P.M.

The current constitution does not allow an incumbent president to bereelected or a civil servant to run for president if he didnot resign from his post two years before the polls. Amendments to these two articles will be considered.

Qusayy was last referred to as the chief of the SpecialSecurity Organization (Jihaz Amn al-Khass), President Saddam'spersonal secret service.     Al-Majid was apparently sacked in connection withrevelations concerning several Iraqi assassination operations against suchtargets as German Journalist Lisi Schmidt in Kurdistan and Ghalibal-Suhayl, a leading Iraqi opposition figure, in Lebanon.

He also reallocated the portfolios of some otherministers.  This reshuffle, which was the second since Rao cameto power in 1991, was designed to resuscitate a cabinet depleted bya string of sackings and resignations following the ruling Congressparty's defeats in regional polls last November.(See WGR, Vol4.,No2)     Two appointments stand out.

Raden Hartono as Army chiefof staff on February 11, replacing Gen. Wismoyo Arismunandar, whoretired the day before.  As a 1962 graduate of the NationalMilitary Academy, Hartono is senior to Wismoyo, who graduated in1963.  Hartono, 53, however, is two years younger that hispredecessor, for he was the youngest graduate in his class.     Officially, the 55-year old Wismoyo, the president'sbrother-in-law, chose to retire because he has reached the military ageof retirement.  But Suharto could have kept him on until he was 60.Gen. Fesal Tanjung, 57, chief of the Joint Service and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI),has had his retirement deferred twice.  According to informedsources, the president's decision not to extend Wismoyo's serviceis related to the latter's tumultuous private life, which hasirritated his extended family.  And in order to show hisindependence, he has at times shown more solidarity with the Armythan Suharto might have liked.  Having turned down anambassador's post, Wismoyo will become head of the National Indonesian Sports Committee.     Wismoyo's retirement will not weaken Suharto's positionwithin the military.  The appointment of Hartono, considered to a be aloner in the Army, reflects the president's desire to surroundhimself with officers who owe their positions solely to him.Before his recent appointment, Hartono was the chief of the ArmedForces Sociological Department.  The son of a Muslim religiousscholar from Pamedasan, Madura, he held several senior posts inthe ABRI.  After his tenure as commander of the Brawijaya RegionalMilitary Command in East Java, he was appointed commandant of theArmy Command and Staff College (Bandung).

Kim, living up to hisreputation as a recluse, failed to make an appearance at thefestivities.  This did not stop the celebration from beingofficially proclaimed as the "greatest holiday of nation," atitle that used to be formally reserved for the April 15 Birthday ofKim's father, the late President Kim Il-sung.     Kim Chong-il's avoidance of the lime-light since hisfather's death last July has fed speculation that he was ill, which wasdelaying his formal takeover of the two key posts of nationalpresident and secretary general of the Korean Worker's Party.  Inthe past six weeks, however, he has made four public appearances,seemingly in better health than last summer when the emaciatedKim appeared to suffer from facial paralysis.  Although these recentappearances have laid to rest speculation about poor health, theyraised new questions whether Kim is engaged in a politicalstruggle with hardline elements within the high command since all wereliked to military events.     According to informed South Korean sources, Kim wants toextend the period of mourning for this father in order toincrease public acceptance of his succession.  One indication that he maytake power in Late April is the staging at that time of aninternational sports and cultural festival in Pyongyang to which10,000 foreign guests have been invited.  The event will mostlikely also correspond with his father's embalmed body beingbrought to its final resting place in the capital, which wouldformally end the mourning period.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLDWIDE GOVERNMENT REPORT via NewsNetMARCH 1995SOUTH KOREAN ARMY RELEASES REFORM PLAN     In early February, the ROK Army revealed its plan fordrastic reorganization and downsizing of its headquarter.(HangyoreSinmun, February 3)  According to the plan, which was apparently overseenby Chief of the General Staff Yun Yongnam, around two-thirds ofthe officers attached to the present headquarters will betransferred, many to field army staffs and educational institutes, such as the National Defense college and Military Staff College.

He said that hewould resign before the end of February when a constitutionaltribunal is scheduled to rule on whether he can legally hold thegovernment portfolio.     Thaksin, who is not an elected member of parliament, wasoffered the foreign affairs post in November when Prime MinsterChamlong Srimuang, the leader of the Palang Dharma party, sackedall 11 of his party's ministers to try to boost its flaggingpopularity.  Critics criticized the prime minister for givingsuch a delicate job to an aggressive entrepreneur who had built up hiscompany (Shinawatra Telecommunications Group) on his ability towin contracts for Thai and foreign governments.  Thaksin's positionwas made more difficult in December when the legislature passed a newconstitution that banned ministers from holding governmentmonopoly concessions.(Financial Times, February 1)  He refused to divesthis more than $2 billion worth of shares in the Shinawatra groupwhich owns the country's two commercial satellites and a mobile phoneconcession.  On becoming foreign minister, he resigned aschairman of his flagship Shinawatra Computer and Communications group butsimply passed the reins to his wife.  This was not thought enoughto distance him from the corporate empire.  Under constantpressure for critics inside and outside the government, Thaksin decided togive up his government work and return to the private sector.     Because of his short tenure, Thaskin's departure is unlikelyto disrupt Thai foreign policy.  Most of the more innovativepolicies, covering cross-border economic cooperation, have beenoverseen by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi.  As forThaksin's successor, the new foreign minister will probably be aPalang Dharma MP.

The nomination of tworespected bankers is designed to restore confidence in Hungary'sfinancial management structure which was undermined by FinanceMinister Laszlo Bekesi's resignation on January 30.     Bekesi, the architect of the Socialist party's economicreform program, resigned after a long battle with government hardlinersover control of privatization.  Coming just two weeks after thesacking of another prominent reformer, Privatization Chief FerencBartha, and a two month delay in naming a new central bankgovernor, Bekesi's resignation cast doubt on the government'scommitment to economic reform.  In addition, his departurereflected a growing strain within the ruling coalition.     The uneasy ruling coalition, which was formed last Julybetween the Socialist party and the Alliance of Free Democrats(ADF), began to show signs of serious disagreement over economicpolicy almost from its inception.  The ADF, which is composed ofrefugees from the former dissident movement, prefers marketreform and rapid privatization of state industries.  The Socialistparty, made up of reform elements of the former communist party,however, prefers market reform and rapid privatization of stateindustries. The Socialist party, made up of reform elements of the former communist party, however, prefers a slower pace to economicreform and is not enthusiastic about widespread privatization.  Thetension between the two parties increase dramatically in Januarywith signs that Socialist Prime Minister Gyula Horn, whose rulingstyle has become progressively more autocratic, had decided toslow the pace of reform.  Bartha, who was the finance ministry'sostensibly independent privatization commissioner, was seen as athreat because he answered to Bekesi and not the prime minister'soffice.  His sacking spurred ADF protests that the Socialistswere abandoning the coalitions's agreed economic program for thesteady transformation of the country's economic system.  Horn was alsocriticized for not sufficiently consulting his coalition partnersbefore making policy decisions.     In an attempt to repair the damage caused by Bekesi'sresignation, the two ruling parties agreed on February 14 toappoint a new minister without portfolio to superviseprivatization.  The two parties also agreed to extend theauthority of the finance minister, giving him veto power over alleconomic proposals forwarded to the government, a responsibility thatBekesi had requested.  The ADF originally opposed creating the new postand wanted the finance minister to supervise privatization.  Theextension of the finance minister's authority was a compromisesolution. Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLDWIDE GOVERNMENT REPORT via NewsNetMARCH 1995POLISH PRESIDENT FORCES CABINET'S RESIGNATION     On February 6, President Lech Walesa called for theresignation of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and reshuffle ofthe coalition government composed of the ex-communist Left DemocraticAlliance (SLD) and Pawlak's own Peasant Party (PSL).  Walesaaccused Pawlak of incompetence and said his government was makinglittle progress in reforming the country.  Three days later,Pawlak in a speech before the PSL executive committee announced that hewould resign after the formation of a new government.  Walesa hasgiven preliminary backing to Speaker of the Parliament JozefOlesky, a compromise candidate from the SLD, to become the fifthPolish prime minister in the post-communist era.     Political and personality conflicts have plagued thecoalition since its creation in 1993, in particular between AlexanderKwasniewski, the pragmatic SLD leader, and Prime Minister Pawlak.Walesa, for whom the prospect of a long-term, stable governmentled by his former communist opponents meant relegation to virtualirrelevance, was quick to seize upon the internal stresses toundermine the coalition.  By delaying the appointment of theheads of the "power ministries" (defense, internal and foreignaffairs), he has campaigned to erode the government's efficacy.  Followingthe resignation or sacking of all three ministers in the last fewmonths, none of the portfolios have been filled.  In addition,Walesa in recent weeks has sought to drive a wedge between Pawlakand Kwasniewski, denigrating the former and pointing to thevirtues of the latter as a potential prime minister.     Walesa's actions are directly linked to his plans to seek asecond-five-year term in November.  Politically isolated by aparliament in which he has few allies and which was elected in1993 for a four-year term, the president decided that his politicalsurvival was based on his ability to win the non-communist rightbehind his candidacy.     Pawlak's resignation may, however, prove to be a pyrrhicvictory.  For, while agreeing to replace the prime minister, thePSL refused to nominate Kwasniewski as Wales had suggested.Since Kwasniewski is regarded as one of the main potential contendersfor the presidency in November, his diversion into the premiershipwould have removed a major obstacle to Walesa's reelection.Instead, the PSL opted for Jozef Olesky, an intelligent anddeeply cynical former communist turned pro-market reformer.  Olesky isopenly contemptuous of Wales who he describes as the "proletarianpresident."  An SLD-led government under his control would bemore efficient and less amenable presidential sabotage, leavingKwasniewski free to run against Walesa as the candidate of theleft.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLDWIDE GOVERNMENT REPORT via NewsNetMARCH 1995RUSSIA MAY CREATE NATIONAL GUARD     President Boris Yeltsin's advisers are preparing toestablish a National Guard directly subordinate to the president'soffice.(Izvestiya, January 24)  According to informed sources,the guard will be used during times of turmoil as "an armedorganization that will be an instrument in the battle forpolitical power."  In periods of stability, the National Guard will be an"armed pillar of the political leader of the state."  Itsresponsibilities will mostly revolve around internal problems andthreats which are outside the army's jurisdiction.  Itsmembership will be small, but elite.  Aleksandr Korzhakov, chief of thePresidential Guard, is said to be the main force behind theguards' creation.  The idea for it sprang from an "analytical center"under his control which employs between 60 and 100 former KGB expertsand headed by Georgii Pagozin, Korzhakov's deputy.  If reports of thecreation of yet another internal security force is true, they addto the increasing evidence that Korzhakov is exercising ahardline influence on the president.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLDWIDE GOVERNMENT REPORT via NewsNetMARCH 1995RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY RESHUFFLED     President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on January 19appointing new deputy defense ministers as part of a shakeup ofthe Ministry of Defense.

Gen.Konstantin Kobets, the inspector general of the armed forces andCol. Gen. Vladimir Toporov, who had been in charge of logistics,also retained their posts.  Toporov was described in the decreeas a deputy minister without portfolio, although subsequent reportshave stated that such tasks as physical fitness training andcultural and recreational activities will fall under his purview.Col. Gen. Anatolii Solomatin, chief of construction and billetingfor the armed forces, and Col. Gen.

GeorgiiKondratyev and Col. Gen. Valerii Mironov were not reappointed,nor was previously dismissed Col. Gen. Matvei Burlakov.  It is clearthat their removal was linked to their negative attitude toRussian operations in Chechnya.  While Kondratyev and Mironov were"assigned to other duties," presumably within the Ministry ofDefense, Gromov was appointed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairsas the "chief military expert at large."  He is to serve as aliaison between the two ministries as well as handle issues relating torelations with NATO, strategic stability in Europe, and militarycooperation between CIS countries.

Gen. Oladipo Diya, the number two person in the Nigeriangovernment, announced on February 9 that military ruler Gen. SaniAbacha had dissolved the cabinet in order to allow some ministerto enter active politics.  The ministers are seeking to run foroffice under a program for the military government's transition todemocratic rule which is yet to be announced.(Reuters, February9) In light of an apparent narrowing of support for Abacha withinthe military and a recent Constitutional Conference's decision toforce a transition within on year, many of the more ambitious ministersare eager to establish their individual political credentials.Diya said that a new cabinet will be named after a meeting of theruling all-military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) but did notindicate when it would meet.     In the wake of last year's opposition attempt to forceAbacha to cede power to Moshood Abiola, the businessman widely believedto have won an annulled 1993 presidential vote, Gen. Abacha promisedto make major changes in the government to make it moreeffective. He also promised to announce a new transitional program thatwould conclude with elections and a return to civilian rule.  AConstitutional Conference was convened in Abuja to consider thesequestions.  In december, the Conference stunned the government byannouncing that the military should turn over the reins of powerby January 1, 1996.  Almost immediately, the government beganlobbying to overturn the decision.  Conference delegates were courted andenvoys were sent abroad to explain that a quorum was not presentwhen the hand over vote was taken.  The Conference reconvened onJanuary 9, it decided to adjourn proceedings for two months thusdelaying the submission of its constitutional report to thegovernment and setting back the timetable for the unbanning ofpolitical parties and fresh elections.  Even though Abacha wassuccessful in stifling the conference's attempt to enforce aschedule for transition to civilian rule, the episode revealedthe limited amount of political loyalty he enjoys.     In the midst of this leadership crisis, 14 of the 32-membercabinet have signified their intention to quit the government topursue political careers.  All of these ministers belong to thetwo political parties that vied for power after former military rulerGen. Ibrahim Babangida's promised transition to civil rule, whichled to Abacha a coming to power.  They are not keen to be linkedto an increasingly unpopular government and want to be free to fromtheir own alliances before it is too late.  Two of the morenotable politicians in the cabinet are Baba Gana Kingibe, foreignminister, and Lateef Jakande, works minister, who have both run forpresident in the past.     As Nigeria attempts to establish a foreign exchange market,crucial to the operation of the import-dependent economy, andprepares for the start of a two-week international soccertournament in March, it is important that the government put thiscrisis behind it as soon as possible.  Gen. Diya in his statementannouncing the dissolution of the cabinet said that outgoingministers who were not politicians could be considered forreappointment. This indicates that Abacha will most likely notuse the cabinet reshuffle to stack the cabinet with proteges, whichwould reveal an intention to abandon his promise to turn overpower to a civilian government.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLDWIDE GOVERNMENT REPORT via NewsNetMARCH 1995NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER APPOINTED IN SOUTH AFRICA     President Nelson Mandela announced the appointment of Gen.George Fivaz as the new national commissioner of the SouthAfrican Police Services (SAP) on January 29.

On January26, Dini survived a no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies bya margin of 302 in favor, 270 abstentions and 39 against.  The newgovernment bears all the indications of instability: it iscomposed entirely of non-parliamentarians, had defined itself as atransitional government and enjoys uncertain support.     Ironically, Dini was endorsed by the enemies of the previousrightwing government (in which Dini was finance minister) andopposed by Dini's erstwhile Forza Italia  allies.

His government's popularity has fallenprey to economic recession, projected loss of parliamentary majority,and a scandal stemming from a state corporation's breach of theembargo on Indonesia.     The government drew a wave of anger when it was revealed onJanuary 22 that General Aeronautical Workshop's (OGMA) hadaccepted a contract to repair Indonesian Air Force helicopter engines.The contract violates 1992 trade sanctions against Indonesia forabuses of the population of East Timor.  This is the second such case inas many months, the first involving illegal OGMA cooperation withAngolan government armed forces.     Opposition Communist party chairman Carlos Carvalhas calledfor the government to resign and petitioned President MarioAlberto Soares to call for early elections, while the more moderateSocialists encouraged avoiding hasty dismissals and appeared towait for the October election.  Defense Minister Fernando Nogeirawas called upon to resign but refused, and denied that repairingthe engines either harmed the East Timorese or affected theircause.  The prime minister defended OGMA and his government,declaring that no government had fought as hard as the Portuguesein favor of the East Timorese cause.  Opinion polls indicate hisPSD is unlikely to win a majority in the next election.

Theshakeup, which removed two vice presidents and appointed six newministers, was designed to give fresh momentum to the economicreforms being carried out by President Fidel Castro's government.     Osvaldo Marinez, a 51-year old economist, replaces AntonioRodriguez Maurell as minister of economy and planning.  As headof the economic commission of the National Assembly, Martinez hadplayed a prominent role in implementing recent reforms todecentralize and revitalize the country's recession-hit economy.Maurell, who also lost his vice president post, had previouslyheaded the now-abolished central planning board that ran Cuba'seconomy while the country was still a member of the Soviet blocComecon.

SAYS WORKER'S TRANSFER WAS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on July 13 affirmed atrial court's ruling which denied the U.S. Postal Service's motionfor summary judgment in a suit over its refusal to allow an HIV-positive worker to transfer from Mississippi to California so hecould obtain better health care services  (Buckingham v. UnitedStates of America et al., 9th Cir., No. 91-56236).     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document AccessService.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     Appellant Melvin Buckingham worked for several months in theColumbus, MS, post office when in 1988 he applied for a transfer toLos Angeles so that he could avail himself of better medical carefor persons with HIV conditions there.  Although his request wasgranted by his Mississippi superiors, he discovered upon arrivingin California that the Los Angeles Post Office would not agree towaive a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with its employees'unions requiring one year of seniority before workers could seek atransfer.     Buckingham appealed the decision to the Equal OpportunityEmployment Commission (EEOC), where an administrative law judgesaid the transfer was a reasonable accommodation under theRehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) and that the Postal Service'sone year seniority requirement conflicts with its obligations underthe act.  After the Postal Service rejected the ALJ'srecommendation, Buckingham filed suit in U.S. District Court forCalifornia's Central District.     U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter rejected the PostalService's arguments that transfers for medical treatment are notrequired as a matter of law and that catering to Buckingham wouldviolate the rights of other employees who met seniorityrequirements and were seeking transfers.  Ruling sua sponte, thejudge ordered that Buckingham be reinstated and awarded back pay.     "Buckingham is not asking for a different job.  Nor is heasking for a job that is not reasonably available under the PostalService's existing policies," said the Ninth Circuit inaffirmation.  "He is asking for the same job at a differentlocation.  It is not unreasonable under the Rehabilitation Act totransfer Buckingham to a location where he can obtain bettermedical treatment for his handicap."     The panel's opinion by Senior U.S. Circuit Court Judge WarrenJ. Ferguson said although qualified handicapped employees may beable to perform the essential functions of their job, they are notprecluded from a reasonable accommodation to allow them to "(a)enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment equal to thoseenjoyed by non-handicapped employees or (b) pursue therapy ortreatment for their handicaps.  In other words, an employer isobligated not to interfere, either through action or inaction, witha handicapped employee's efforts to pursue a normal life."     Although affirming the trial court's reasonable accommodationruling, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to allow the governmentto challenge the assumptions that Buckingham could get bettermedical care in Los Angeles and that he was or would be able toperform the essential functions of his job.  The panel said JudgeHatter erred in issuing his sua sponte ruling without allowing thePostal Service to present opposing arguments on factual disputes"which must be resolved in Buckingham's favor in order for him toprevail."  The Ninth Circuit said the government did not receivesufficient notice of Judge Hatter's potential entrance of summaryjudgment.

DENIES REVIEW OF RULING IN FAVOR OF IRWIN     The California Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision issuedJuly 15, denied a request to review an appeals court ruling whichsaid Irwin Memorial Blood Bank (Irwin) met the industry's standardof care by not using surrogate test procedures to screen blood inNovember 1983  (Wilson v. Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, CA Sup. Ct.,No. S032902).     (The opposing briefs are available from Andrews DocumentAccess Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 fromPennsylvania.)     On appeal to the high court, attorneys for plaintiff CynthiaWatson maintained that the courts below wrongly refused to judgethe actions of Irwin based on those of other blood banks in"similar circumstances."  Judging the defendant on the basis ofactions by blood banks not confronted with the high level of riskIrwin faced during that period, they claimed, was inappropriate.     Watson's appeal brief, filed May 19, argued that the trialcourt jury which decided against her was incorrectly told toconsider her claims based on a jury instruction designed only foruse in cases of misdiagnosis or improper treatment choice by amedical professional.  It also asked the high court to decide ifthe exclusion of certain testimony by dermatologist Marcus Conant,M.D., and biostatistician Byron Brown, M.D., was appropriate simplybecause neither was a "blood banker and was therefore not qualifiedto testify as to the standard of care for blood banks."     Watson maintained that the underlying decision by the state'sFirst District Court of Appeal was in conflict with other stateappellate decisions by declaring that the "standard of practice isconclusive proof of the standard of care."  Watson said thereplacement of her "same or similar circumstances" standard of caretheory "with a weighing of what the majority of blood banks acrossthe nation were doing, results in a comparison of Irwin with bloodbanks which were not at any risk of AIDS through their blood."     Watson cited the Colorado Supreme Court's 1992 ruling inUnited Blood Services v. Quintana, in which it said a trial courterred in excluding the testimony of Dr. Conant on behalf of asimilarly situated plaintiff.  Said the Quintana court, "If thestandard adopted by a practicing profession were to be deemedconclusive proof of due care, the profession itself would bepermitted to set the measure of its own legal liability, eventhough that measure might be far below a level of care readilyattainable through the adoption of practices and proceduressubstantially more effective in protecting others against harm thanself-decreed standards of the profession."     Holding that the appellant offered no proof that it "failed todo something that...other blood bankers would have done in similarcircumstances," Irwin argued against review of the appellateruling, saying it posed no conflict with other California courts.      The partial exclusion of testimony from Dr. Conant "was notbased on the fact that Dr. Conant had not run a blood bank,"responds Irwin, but due to the fact that "he was not shown to befamiliar with the standard of care for blood banks in November 1983or at any other time."     "While petitioner's outside experts opined that Irwin shouldhave been doing 'more' about AIDS and doing it sooner, there was noevidence that at that time any blood bank except Stanford was, infact, doing what they testified 'should' have been done by Irwin,and not even Stanford was running the T-cell test on all the bloodused there," replied Irwin on June 8.  "One blood bank is not a'great minority' of blood banks as urged by the petitioner...it isjust one blood bank."     Allowing "ad hoc judgments by lay jurors aided by hindsight"in professional malpractice cases, argued Irwin, would "thwart"California public policy and "elevate the standards required ofmedical professionals beyond the reasonable expectations of theprofession to strict liability regardless of fault."

Barr Laboratories Inc., BurroughsWellcome Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. NovopharmInc., ED NC, Nos. 91-41-CIV-4-H, 92-134-CIV-4-H, 92-156-CIV-4-H).     Judge Malcom J. Howard's decision is expected to be appealedto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by defendantsBarr Laboratories Inc. and Novopharm Ltd., each of whom were suedby North Carolina-based Burroughs Wellcome when they announcedplans to begin selling generic versions of the drug based on thepremise that Burroughs Wellcome was not AZT's rightful patentholder.     "The court has felt for some time that United States law, asapplied in this case, dictates that Burroughs Wellcome scientistswere the sole inventors of AZT," stated Judge Howard from thebench.  Burroughs and Barr sought a ruling from the judge afteronly a handful of the more than 200 witnesses were called.  Barrsought the ruling so that it could appeal Judge Howard's definitionof inventorship without having to pursue the costly trial.     The defendants maintain that former National Institutes ofHealth physicians Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya completed thekey research which later allowed Burroughs Wellcome to apply AZT,known generically as zidovudine and sold by Burroughs Wellcome asRetrovir, for use in the fight against AIDS.     While patients using AZT pay some $2,000 annually for thedrug, the New York-based Barr and Canadian Novopharm say they wouldsell the drug for a fraction of that amount.  Burroughs Wellcomeholds that its researchers developed the drug and that it isentitled to maintain the patent, which runs through 2005.     Burroughs Wellcome is represented by Thomas F.

AFFIRMS DISMISSAL OF HEALTH BENEFITS BIAS SUIT     The Indiana Court of Appeals on July 6 unanimously affirmed atrial court decision which said the state's Civil Rights Commission(ICRC) erred in ruling an employer had violated state law bycutting health benefits available to an AIDS victim because thelocal law is preempted by federal statutes, which then did notprohibit such discrimination (Westhoven v. Lincoln FoodserviceProducts, Inc., IN Ct. of Apps., 2nd Dist., No. 35A02-9206-CV-260).     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document AccessService.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     An attorney for the estate of Kenneth Westhoven says no appealis planned in the case, noting that such a claim would now beprohibited by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which wasnot in effect when defendant Lincoln Foodservice Products reducedthe maximum benefits allowed for AIDS-related illnesses under itsself-funded employee insurance program.  Westhoven, an industrialengineer, filed an ICRC action against the firm in 1990 based onthe changes it made to the plan in 1988 which capped lifetimebenefits for AIDS at $50,000, while other employees were provideda $1 million limit.     The commission found Lincoln to be in violation of Indiana'sCivil Rights Law (ICRL).  Lincoln appealed the decision to a statetrial court, which reversed the ruling on the grounds that thestate law is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct (ERISA).     "Pursuant to the ADA, and Indiana's companion legislation,Lincoln is presently prohibited from discriminating upon the basisof a handicap, i.e., against a 'qualified individual with adisability,' in a wide range of employment practices," said theappellate decision.  "At the time of the alleged discrimination,however, Lincoln was not bound by the ADA.  This is truenotwithstanding the fact that the ICRL pre-dated parallelprovisions of federal law which now control."     Because ERISA preempts the state's civil rights laws,concluded the appeals court, "the Commission was withoutjurisdiction to proceed upon Westhoven's complaint allegingdiscrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges ofemployment."

SAYS BLOOD SHIELD LAW BARS PRODUCT-LIABILITY SUIT     Ruling that the supply of blood coagulant is considered aservice and not the sale of a product in the state, an Alabamacircuit court on June 8 granted defense motions to dismiss productliability-based claims filed against two pharmaceutical firms by aman who says their factorate products infected him with the AIDSvirus (Watkins v. Armour Pharmaceutical Co. et al., AL Cir. Ct.,Calhoun Cty., No. CV-92-452).     (The order is available from Andrews Document Access Service.Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     Plaintiff Richard D. Watkins, who now has AIDS, received bloodproducts manufactured by defendants Armour Pharmaceutical Co. andMiles, Inc. while hospitalized at Northeast Alabama RegionalMedical Center in 1982, 1983, and 1984.  His suit charged thepharmaceutical firms with strict liability in tort on the groundsthat the blood products they processed and provided him wereunreasonably dangerous and defective because they were contaminatedwith the AIDS virus.     The defendants suggested, and Circuit Court Judge Malcom B.Street Jr. agreed, that such a suit is barred by Alabama's BloodShield Statute (Code Sec. 7-2-314[4]), which says that despiteremuneration to the provider, the supply of "human whole blood,plasma, blood products, blood derivatives...is declared not to bea sale...."     Ruled the court, "this 'blood shield statute' clearly statesthat the actions of defendants Armour, Miles and Northeast AlabamaRegional Medical Center in furnishing and distributing Factor VIIIblood products to the plaintiff were a service provided to theplaintiff, Watkins.  The transaction of which the plaintiffscomplain is expressly declared by the statute 'not to be a sale',thus, the plaintiff cannot maintain an action based on the theoriesof express or implied warranties, or theories under the AlabamaExtended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine."     The judge also rejected the plaintiff's claim that theproducts provided him were not blood derivatives, but insteaddrugs, which are excluded from the application of the blood shieldlaw.  "The only source of Factor VIII is human blood," he wrote."The processing methods and the additions of additives does noteliminate the core component of Factor VIII -- blood."

Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     U.S. District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa ruled againstplaintiff "John Doe" on the grounds that while the August 1992conciliation agreement he reached with Delta may have barred thedisclosure of his identity, the negotiations which led to theagreement were public record proceedings of the Commission.     In early 1992, Doe filed a commission complaint against Delta,claiming the company refused to hire him because of his sexualorientation and because he was HIV-positive.  The agreement underwhich he was hired by Delta with back pay was executed with theassistance of the commission's Law Enforcement Bureau.  Although acommission press release on the agreement did not mention Doe byname, Doe says it included enough detail to allow his co-workers todiscover that he was the subject of the settlement.     "Whatever right of confidentiality plaintiff had came from thecontract he entered into with Delta and the Commission, and stemsfrom the contract not the Constitution," wrote Judge Griesa, whoalso dismissed state-based claims for lack of jurisdiction."Plaintiff's proceeding before the Commission and the resultingconciliation agreement would have been a matter of public recordbut for the non-disclosure provision of the agreement."     The judge noted a "difference of view among the parties as tothe proper interpretation of the contract," and said "what needs tobe litigated here is the issue of contract interpretation."     Doe is represented by Thomas J. Hall and Marla Hassner ofChadbourne & Parke.  The defendant is represented by AssistantCorporation Counsel Neil Corwin.

SAYS SUIT OVER '85 TRANSFUSION WAS FILED LATE     The Louisiana Court of Appeals on June 16 rejected theassertions of an HIV-positive woman who said her infection liabiltysuit against a hospital was based on strict liability, not medicalmalpractice laws, and affirmed the dismissal of her suit asuntimely (In re: LeBlanc v. Meza, LA Ct. of App., 3rd Cir., No. 92-1040).     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document AccessService.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     The panel, in a 3-2 decision, said it would not "carve anexception" out of state law to accept Murley LeBlanc's strictliability claim against Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Centerfor the "distribution of defective blood."  It also said that therecord did not support her claim that because the hospital and twodefendant physicians failed to tell her that she had received atransfusion during a March 5, 1985, operation there, they acted todelay her suit against them.     The plaintiff, who was transfused 15 days before Lourdesreceived a newly-released test for detecting HIV-tainted blood,learned she was HIV-positive in August 1989.     While the majority rejected LeBlanc's argument against theconstitutionality of the state's medical malpractice limitationsstatute (La. R.S. 9 Sec. 5628), a dissenting justice said the rulediscriminates against plaintiffs unaware of an injury until afterthe expiration of an applicable three year period.  "Malpracticeclaims have long been recognized in this state," said the dissent."A cause of action for malpractice was vested and existed themoment the first drop of tainted blood entered the plaintiff'sbody.  The distinction is that it had not accrued prior to thelapse of a three year period.  The statute does not operate as abar to a cause of action before it existed, but operated to limitthe cause of action.  Therefore, the LeBlancs had a cause of actionthat was a vested property right."     The majority noted that recent judicial rulings in the stateindicate that a Louisiana Supreme Court ruling on the legality ofSec. 5628 "is imminent."   It said, however, that it would "awaita decision" and declined to declare the statute unconstitutional"based on the statistical evidence presented by the LeBlancs."Concluded the panel, "while it may be true that the statuteoperates to discriminate against Mrs. LeBlanc and members of herclass, we cannot say that this discrimination overrides the state'sinterest in limiting the time period for bringing medicalmalpractice actions."Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetAugust 10, 1993CONNECTICUT COURT DENIES DOCTOR'S MOTION FOR NONSUIT     A Connecticut Superior Court Judge rejected on June 10 adefendant physician's motion for nonsuit in an AIDS confidentialitycase pending an in camera review of the plaintiff's social servicesfiles (Doe v.

Berger Jr. sealed the case file afterissuing his memorandum ordering plaintiff "Jane Doe" to presentnotes from her social worker's file which she says are unrelated toher claims against defendant Dionisio Flores, M.D.  The physicianrequested the information as part of the discovery process in thesuit in which Doe accuses Flores of improperly releasingconfidential information on her HIV status.     Dr. Flores moved for nonsuit in September 1992 after receivingredacted versions of the documents in question.  While Doemaintains the files on her conversations with the social worker arenot related to the claims asserted in the suit, the physicianinsists they are directly tied to Doe's accusations that thedisclosure of her HIV status caused damage to her reputation,severe mental distress and physical manifestations of thatdistress.     Judge Berger ordered that the documents be presented for hisreview, noting that their disclosure could be allowed under statelaw in cases in which a plaintiff "introduces his mental conditionas an element of his claim or defense."  Concluded the court, "if,as the plaintiff asserts, the redacted portions of the notes areunrelated to the injuries in the complaint, the interests ofjustice may not require disclosure."

(The ruling is available from Andrews Document Access Service.Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     Commissioner Margarita Rosa found that Richard Coloni,operator of the Coloni Funeral Home, violated New York State HumanRights Law in April 1989 when he persuaded complainants FrankAgresti, Greg Agresti, and Ramilda Newell not to follow decedentAlfred Agresti's instructions that he be embalmed and viewed in anopen casket.  The record indicates that Coloni told the family thatone "could catch the AIDS virus from a deceased person much likeone could catch the common cold."     Frank Agresti, who flew from California for his brother'sburial, was allowed to view the body only after agreeing toColoni's condition that he wear a mask.  Complainant Greg Agresti'swife never viewed the body upon Coloni's insistence that suchexposure could cause her harm since she was then pregnant.     Ruling that the funeral home violated state publicaccommodation laws, Commissioner Rosa said the "complainants gaveup their desire to have an open casket as a result of respondentRichard Coloni's underlying attitude, explanations andmisrepresentations, which exhibited prejudice towards HIV'infected' clients."  She awarded compensatory damages based oneach sibling's mental anguish, frustration and public humiliation,suffered, she said, as the result of Coloni's "unlawfuldiscrimination."Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetAugust 10, 1993CA CT. AFFIRMS ENHANCED SENTENCE FOR HIV SEX CRIME     A California appellate court on June 1 affirmed a trialcourt's 'enhancement' of a sexual offender's 72-year prisonsentence based on aggravating circumstances, including his claimthat he knew he was HIV-positive before committing his crime(People v. Shoemake,  CA Ct. of Apps., 5th Dist., No. F017527).     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document AccessService.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     Appellant Samuel Lee Shoemake opposed the handling of his KernCounty Superior Court case on a number of issues, claiming JudgeGerald K. Davis violated the principle of corpus delicti becauseprosecutors failed to independently prove that Shoemake was HIV-positive prior to his July 1991 rape of a woman.  He said the caseagainst him and later the enhancement of his sentence wereinsufficiently based solely on his own statements that he was HIV-positive.     The appeals court ruled that the corpus delicti claim did notapply to such charges.  It said that the "proof utilized by thestate is the words of the defendant" and that "no constitutional orstatutory principle diminishes their force as evidence of thetruth."  The appeals court also rejected Shoemake's accompanyingclaim that Judge Davis erred by allowing the removal of the onlyAfrican-American juror under the prosecution's exercise of aperemptory challenge.     The panel said much of Shoemake's appeal was void because hefailed to exercise a multiple hearsay objection at the trial levelon his claim that the AIDS-related allegations against him lackedproof.  "For the first time on appeal, appellant challenges theintroduction of his statements, made prior to the commission of thepresent offenses, that he had AIDS or was the carrier of HIV," saidthe three-member appeals court in Fresno, CA.  "While he hasphrased his arguments avoiding the issue of waiver, the factremains that the position he advances on appeal comes down towhether the statements were improperly admitted into evidence.  Weneed not decide this question because appellant did not preservethe issue for appeal by a timely and specific objection in thetrial court."     The appeals court said the evidence presented before JudgeDavis was "legally sufficient" to support the enhancement of hissentence.  His statements to two persons acknowledging that heeither had AIDS or was HIV positive, concluded the panel, "wereadmitted into evidence without objection or limitation.  Noevidence was presented in rebuttal."     Shoemake is represented by attorney Kyle Gee, who wasappointed by the appeals court.  The state is represented by stateattorneys Robert R.

Abbott Laboratories, SD NY, No. 93 CIV.2656-LBS).     (The petition is available from Andrews Document AccessService.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)     Although the summary of the case in the most recent AIDS LRcorrectly reported that CCBC opposed the injunction, it did notindicate that the brief was submitted without comment on the meritsof either party's position.  In the brief, CCBC told U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Leonard B. Sand that granting Ortho Disgnostic System's(Ortho) request to halt the agreement between CCBC and AbbottLaboratories would impose hardships on CCBC's member blood banksand the general public.     CCBC said a preliminary injunction would raise "uncertaintiesthat may have adverse consequences to recipients of bloodtransfusions," because of confusion it would cause at blood bankswhich have already switched from one blood test technology toanother.  "Every time a new test -- especially one with a new ordifferent technology -- is introduced into a blood center, standardoperating procedures must be written, equipment and reagents mustbe ordered, technicians must be trained, software must be developedand the entire complex system must be integrated and validated.Each of these steps takes significant time and resources to assurean error-free transition."     Emphasizing that the amicus brief was filed only on behalf of"CCBC, its members and the patients they serve," CCBC ExecutiveDirector James MacPherson says his organization remains "absolutelyneutral with respect to Ortho's claims against Abbott and Abbott'sdefense against those claims."

COMPILED BY KENNETH KIMSEY (1865 words) CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Conference Coverage (ACTG)"New" ACTG Moves ForwardCan the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaurtoo large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - Universityof Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization hasaccomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the TwentiethAIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,D.C.The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs inadults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and formoving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDStherapies.DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of theACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since thechanges took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms werevalid, but also stressed the group's many achievements."We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said."But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is thepreeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together atremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for thetreatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTGefforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way."This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugswork," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combinationtherapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the newprotease inhibitor saquinavir.He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings"to tell us what we need to do."The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  Butmost importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by whichit generates clinical trial protocols."One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving likecivil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processesthat prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult sectionhas only three committees making research decisions.  These three ResearchAgenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and theOpportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - thePharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient CareCommittee - will now be established as standing resource committees withineach of the three main RACs.There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will becentralized control of both resources and laboratories.Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing theACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised ofthe various committee chairs.Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,receiving their funds directly from DAIDS."Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "Ithink this will work very well."But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue tochange."Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," hesaid.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."He called for the active participation of each investigator."Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executivecommittee members," Schooley said. - by Daniel J.

He wasauthor or co-author of numerous publications.The award was given to Carey's mother."The one thing John should be remembered for is that he urged us to treatpatients as people, to allay their fears and to give them hope," she said.The presentation was met with a prolonged standing ovation by the assembledresearchers.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Conference Coverage (ACTG)Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTGMany institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find andkeep study participants.A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsoredclinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet theirpatient accrual goals.The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert andcolleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient CareCommittee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed thestudy."Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successfulclinical trials," Klebert said.Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in thestudy.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size orpatient demographics from participating institutions.Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies usedby a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment andretention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision ofpeer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision ofsupport groups was negatively correlated with success.More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier torecruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successfulrecruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combineprimary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minoritypatients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was notassociated with poor recruitment or retention.The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too manydrugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability ofalternative drugs.Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improvepatient recruitment and retention:*  Combine primary care and research visits.*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.*  Provide transportation to the study site.*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.*  Design studies to address retention problems.*  Study identified problem sites in detail. - by Daniel J.

The cell surface glycoprotein serves as acellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide withlipopolysaccharide-binding protein.Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased inserum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonarysarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum andin bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheiseland colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 arealso found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels inBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December1995;108:1614-1616).Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreatedpulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologiccharacteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwichenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis wasincreased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote."No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavagesupernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar topatients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found inpatients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing togranuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cellsurface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determinethe significance and clinical relevance of this finding."The corresponding author for this study is Gerhard Hoheisel, Department ofPneumology, Ruhrlandklink, Tuschener Weg 40, D-45239. - by Salynn Boyles, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Drug Development (Antiviral)Virus-Neutralizing RNAs Offer Potential as Antiviral TherapiesAn in vitro selection process of RNA analogs derived from infectious viralparticles turns up elements with antiviral activity.Current drug development techniques are dependent on the discovery of usefulagents.  Compounds with antibacterial or antiviral activity are often foundthrough the empirical screening of synthetic and natural compounds or thelogical design of a drug based on structures of viral and cellular proteins.Unfortunately, empirical screening is tedious and inefficient, and logicaldrug design, although promising, has not produced an abundance of successfulcompounds.Weihua Pan et al.  extended a selection-amplification procedure, previouslyused to isolate RNA and DNA molecules, to target an intact virus in hopes ofdiscovering RNA analogs that could be developed as antiviral drugs ("Isolationof Virus-Neutralizing RNAs from a Large Pool of Random Sequences," Proceedingsof the National Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11509-13)."The isolation of RNAs and RNA analogs that are effective against diverseviral strains will be particularly necessary for inhibiting viruses such asHIV, which has a high mutation rate and readily develops drug-resistantstrains," stated Pan et al.  "Such selection is possible and practical becausea very large structurally diverse library is used and the selection is a rapidprocess."The authors noted that there is great potential to select for molecules thatbind defined targets with high affinity and specificity due to the structuralcomplexity of a combinatorial sequence library of single-stranded RNAoligonucleotides.  Due to technological advances, selected RNA molecules canbe amplified and subjected to further selection.  Multiple cycles of selectionand amplification can lead to the isolation of the best target-binding RNAmolecules from the library.Among the family of Retroviradae (which includes HIV), the rous sarcoma virus(RSV) has been extensively studied.  All Retroviridae viruses are envelopeviruses which use surface glycoproteins to bind to a specific receptor on asusceptible cell and for fusion with the cellular membrane of the host.As a model, the authors chose to target intact RSV in order to isolate the RNAmolecules and the nuclease-resistant RNA analogs that specifically bind andneutralize this virus.RSV was used to demonstrate that antiviral RNA and RNA analogs could besystematically and effectively isolated from a large pool of random sequenceswithout prior knowledge of the structures of the viral proteins.  First, theyused intact viral particles to select from the sequence pool the RNAs and RNAanalogs that bind specifically to the virus.  Then they screened the selectedmolecules for the ability to neutralize the virus."We reason that by binding to virus, some of the selected RNAs and RNA analogsmay change the structures of viral surface proteins so that these proteins canno longer function in steps critical for viral infection, such as viralattachment and virus-cell membrane fusion," stated Pan et al.  "Alternatively,some of the structural changes may trigger pathways to inhibit the steps whichnormally occur after virus internalization, such as the uncoating and theexpression of the virus genome."J.A.  Levy et al.  (Am.  Soc.  Microbiol., 1994;153-158) and N.J.  Dimmock etal.  (Curr.  Top.  Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992;183:1-149) suggested thepossibilities in both of these avenues in some of their earlier work.Using infectious viral particles, RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RAN analogsthat bound and neutralized RSV were isolated from a large pool of randomsequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection.  Because RSV imposespermeation problems, the selected RNAs were targeted to inhibit RSV infectionby binding to the virus surface, and not by entering the virus itself.The sequences chosen completely neutralized the virus at concentrations of0.16 (micro)M.  Of the 19 selected sequences isolated to be concentrated, fiveof them inhibited RSV infection after cloning.  These five RNA and RNA analogsneutralized the RSV by interacting with the virus itself.  They did notadversely affect the host cells used in the in vitro experiments.A potential problem with developing RNA as a therapeutic agent is the rapiddegradation of unmodified RNA by ribonucleases in vivo, noted the authors.They suggested solving this problem by incorporating modified nucleotides intothe RNA chain.The strain of RSV used during the experiments was the Prague A.  After testingthe selected RNAs against a different strain, the Prague C, the authors foundthat the RNA analogs inhibited infection of this strain also, although atconcentrations 15-20 times higher.Future methods of RNA selection could be performed by alternating betweenseveral strains of virus during the different cycles of selection tospecifically isolate the RNAs and RNA analogs that could bind to severaldiverse strains of the virus.  This could be particularly helpful when itcomes to treating viruses with a history of multiple mutations such as HIV,noted the authors.Several advantages were noted by the authors for the use of intact biologicalentities (infectious virus particles) instead of viral proteins:* Selection by intact viral particles does not require the full understandingof all the ways that a virus can infect its host.  If selection is made by anisolated viral protein, the selection is limited to only the cases in whichproteins responsible for viral infection have been identified and isolated.* It avoids the problem of structural differences in purified proteins.Proteins in their purified form may not interact with the protein complexed ona virion.* Selection using intact virus particles may lead to the identification ofviral components previously unknown."The success of isolating numerous anti-RSV RNAs and RNA analogs from a largepool of random sequences immediately suggests the potential application ofthis approach to isolate RNA and nuclease-resistant RNA analogs against otherviruses such as HIV," concluded Pan et al.This research was supported by Pennsylvania State University Start-up funds;National Institutes of Health grant CA47482; American Cancer Society grantFRA427; and funds from the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.The corresponding author for this study is Jin-Feng Wang, Department ofBiochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University College ofMedicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA. - by Michelle MarbleBack to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Education and PreventionAvailability of Condoms in Quebec Secondary Schools a PriorityThe health and welfare policy of the Quebec Health and Social ServicesMinistry, Canada, stipulates that preventive measures must be strengthened inorder to reduce the incidence of HIV and other STDs.According to the policy, one priority activity for the health and socialservices network is to make condoms accessible to young people in schools.In order to assess the effectiveness of measures taken to make condomsaccessible in schools, a survey was carried out in May 1994 in 164 Quebechealth centers (CLSCs).  The CLSC survey showed that of 478 Quebec secondaryschools, 192 (40.2 percent) did not make condoms available; 20 schools (4.4percent) were in the process of doing so and 265 (55.4 percent) did providethem.These figures paint a rather positive picture, compared to the United States,where in 1992 only 8 percent of schools were reported to have adopted a condomdistribution program.  However, the program's effectiveness is still somewhatlimited because of the main method used to distribute the condoms.The results show that of the 265 schools distributing condoms, 237 (89.4percent) did so mainly through their health services.  Automatic distributorswere used in 88 (33.2 percent) schools; 12 schools made them available throughteaching staff; and 13 (4.9 percent) used peer-group projects.Access to health services has certain limits:  the lack of anonymity andrestricted opening hours.  In addition, some health services do distributecondoms, but only unofficially.  Ensuring access to condoms through the healthservices has the advantage of creating a link between students and healthcareworkers, and encourages educational activity.  However, health services staffare not always present in many schools; they may only be there a few days aweek.  Moreover, some students say they are intimidated and prefer a moreimpersonal approach.Strides have been taken towards making condoms more accessible in schools thanwas the case just a few years ago:  88 schools now provide condom distributorscompared to about 40 in 1992.  This method provides real accessibility, sincehours of access are unlimited and it is far more anonymous than the healthservices approach.  Some data collected indicate that provision of condommachines results from a conscious decision by the school authorities, whereasdistribution by health services may be done without official approval.The CLSC survey shows that in 192 Quebec schools, the main sources ofreluctance to make condoms available were school principals (90 CLSCs),followed by parents (86 CLSCs), teaching staff (75 CLSCs), school boards (67CLSCs) and guidance counselors (62 CLSCs).  Pupils are much less frequentlymentioned as being reluctant (30 CLSCs).As in an American study, school principals also perceive parents to be anobstacle to introducing sex education.  However, that perception by CLSCs orschool principals is contradicted by several surveys which have shown a highrate of acceptance for making condoms available to young people.In April 1991 the central parents' committee of the Montreal Catholic SchoolBoard, Quebec, Canada, carried out a survey of their school committees.  Itshowed that 68.8 percent of respondents were in favor of installing condomdistribution machines in secondary schools.  The survey also revealed that32.5 percent of parents felt that they were the ones who should decide whetheror not the condom distributors should be installed.When one seeks to understand why there is reluctance to making condomsavailable, the factor most often mentioned by CLSCs (40 percent of cases) isthe fear of encouraging young people to have sexual relations.  Next is thefailure to see any need to make condoms available (30.2 percent); then othermeans of access because of proximity to a convenience store, pharmacy or CLSC(27.6 percent) and, finally, a fear of vandalism against distribution machines(13.6 percent).The preliminary results of a study conducted by Joanne Otis of the Universitedu Quebec a Montreal indicate that the number of young people who have sexualrelations is no higher in schools which have distributors than in those whichdo not.  These results seem to contradict the hypothesis that the presence ofcondom distributors would encourage sexual activity.A recent Swiss study shows that advertising campaigns to promote condom usehave not increased the number of young people having sexual relations nor thenumber of partners they have, but rather have increased the use of condoms byadolescent boys and girls.  These results were recently corroborated by theWorld Health Organization (WHO), which analyzed 90 studies to determine theimpact of sex education on school children.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Education and PreventionYouth Reaching Out to YouthThe following press release was received from Africans in Partnership AgainstAIDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Africans in Partnership Against AIDS (APAA) is a community-based organizationformed by members of the African community.  APAA provides HIV/AIDS educationin a culturally appropriate manner and supportive environment for peopleliving with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), their partners, lovers, families and friends.We believe in the health and dignity of people living with HIV/AIDS andrecognize the difficulties people face when they are infected with HIV.A Youth Committee, composed entirely of youth between the ages of 14 and 24,was set up in September 1994.  Adults are not invited to their meetings, butcan be consulted on issues which need clarification or advice.  The youthswant their own space within the agency to address their issues withoutinterference.The Youth Outreach Coordinator initiates her outreach to youth with a letterto parents, requesting the participation of their children.  The coordinatorattends activities at youth groups, cultural gatherings, churches and mosquesto promote the program.The Youth Committee works closely with other youth agencies and AIDS serviceorganizations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, drawing on a wealth of experienceand expertise on HIV/AIDS and African youth.The youth have found that in order to address HIV/AIDS effectively, otherfactors must be considered.  The most frequently discussed topics include:* Parent/youth relationships - youth want parents to acknowledge that theirchildren live in Canadian society and to be open towards them;* Health issues - including sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, safersex, pregnancy and drugs;* Employment counselling - youths want skills to make wise choices for theirfuture employment;* Networking - to meet youth from other communities to learn how they copewith HIV/AIDS;* People living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) - youth want to relate compassionately toPHAs, families and friends.On August 5, 1995, eight of APAA's youths participated in the Caribana Paradeto promote safer sex messages.  They designed envelopes containing condoms,condom manuals, referral lists for youth in Toronto, and matchboxes containingcondoms and safer sex messages drawn from current rap music.  Over 10,000condoms were distributed at that time.These are some of the safer sex slogans used in the outreach work:* Using a condom makes a man last longer!!* Sex ain't nothin' to die for ...* Enter a storm without a raincoat, you're bound to get wet!* When a man uses a condom, it shows he respects me as a woman.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Epidemiology (HIV)Study Reveals Alarming Prevalence of HIV in Young PeopleOne in every 92 men in the age group of 27 through 39 may be infected withHIV, according to the most precise estimates yet of the pandemic's toll.Minorities are far and away the hardest hit, with one of every 33 youngAfrican American men estimated to be infected in 1993.  The latest and mostaccurate data available is from 1993 and was published in a report in theDecember 8, 1995, issue of the journal Science.Study author, Philip Rosenberg, of the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI)forecasts a bleak future if this trend continues, suggesting that "the threatof AIDS may become a rite of passage" for young people.  This latest reportreaffirms the government's warning that AIDS is threatening more and moreyoung people.In January 1995, the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)announced that AIDS in 1993 became the number one killer for people in the agegroup from 25 through 44.Rosenberg's study counters the optimism expressed in the government's recentannouncement that AIDS appears to have leveled off, with 40,000 new infectionsevery year balanced by 40,000 new deaths.  This apparent plateau is really adisguise for the increased risk facing young Americans.It is a fact that only young Caucasian men have seen a drop in new infectionsin recent years, while the risk has dramatically increased for youngminorities and women.Cornelius Baker of the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA)underscored the meaning of the most recent report on prevalence of HIV, whenhe stated that, "I don't think most people really get it, that (infection) isa potential for them.  ...  We have to be clear:  Right now ...  if you getHIV in your twenties, you will die by around forty years old."Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Epidemiology (HIV)WHO Reports 18.5 Million Have HIVAn estimated 18.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV - a sharplyhigher number attributed to better reporting rather a surge in the epidemic,the United Nations (U.N.)  health agency said.About six million people are thought to have developed AIDS since the start ofthe epidemic in the late 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Ofthese, 4.5 million have died.An estimated 6,000 people are infected each day with HIV; of the 18.5 millionalready infected, 1.5 million are children, the agency said.WHO previously estimated that 1 million children and between 13 million and 15million adults are infected with HIV and a total of 4.5 million people haddeveloped the disease.The agency said the new figures reflected an improvement in estimatingtechniques, better HIV prevalence studies and other research, rather than asudden jump in new infections.Two-thirds of the estimated HIV cases and three-quarters of advanced AIDScases, are in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said.India has the most HIV carriers - an estimated 1.75 million of its one billionpeople.  Thailand - another country where experts fear an explosion in cases -has 700,000 HIV carriers.The highest proportional HIV rate was in Botswana, with about 18 percent ofsexually active adults infected.  An estimated 17 percent of adults aged 15-49had the virus in Zambia and Zimbabwe and 15 percent in Uganda.In the Americas, Haiti had the highest proportion of HIV carriers, at 4.4percent.  The Bahamas followed at 3.9 percent, with Barbados at 2.8 percent.In the United States, where an estimated 700,000 people were HIV positive atthe end of 1994, the infection rate was 0.5 percent.In Europe, Spain had the highest rate of HIV infections, with 0.58 percent ofsexually active adults, followed by Switzerland with 0.2 percent, WHO said.WHO is forced to rely on estimates to gauge the spread of HIV and AIDS becauseactual cases reported by governments give little idea of the true picture,especially in Africa.North Korea reports no cases of HIV.Although WHO estimated the true number of AIDS cases at six million, theactual number reported by governments was 1.3 million.  The United Statesaccounted for 39 percent of all the reported cases but only 7 percent of theestimated cases.The figures for HIV infections are for the end of 1994, while the AIDS figuresinclude cases that developed in 1995.  A WHO official said there was a slightoverlap in the two categories.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Blood Substitutes)Hemolink Phase II Trials to Begin in 1996A red blood cell substitute will go into Phase II clinical trials early in1996 and, if all goes well, could be available on the market by 1999.The announcement was made at the 1995 International Chemical Congress ofPacific Basin Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995.The blood substitute, Hemolink, manufactured by Hemosol, is made of chemicallymodified hemoglobin, says Dr.  Gord Adamson, a company scientist.  Hemolink isderived from screened and tested blood that is outdated because it has beenstored for more than six weeks.Hemosol takes the expired blood, separates out the red blood cells andextracts the hemoglobin.  That's more complicated than it sounds.  "A red cellis not just a package of clean hemoglobin," Adamson says.  "It contains about90 different proteins."  The company heat-treats the hemoglobin to destroy anycontaminating viruses that may have eluded the screening process conducted bycollection agencies.  Other remaining proteins are then removed by a noveldisplacement chromatographic process.The process strips away blood-group antigens and other proteins, so Hemolinkcan be used by all patients regardless of blood type.  And the purificationsteps make the likelihood of transmission of diseases such as HIV andhepatitis "virtually" nil, according to Adamson."The reason we say 'virtually,"' he notes, "is because scientifically it isimpossible to prove total absence of a virus," but he is very confident thatHemolink would pose no threat to users in terms of blood-borne diseases.  Inaddition, the blood from which Hemolink is derived is already approved foruse; the company does not accept contaminated units.After purification, the free hemoglobin is cross-linked with oxidizedraffinose, a sugar molecule.  This "improves the ability of the freehemoglobin to deliver oxygen to tissue, stabilizes each hemoglobin moleculeand links together several such molecules so that they are large enough tocirculate for extended periods," Adamson says.Human trials with Hemolink show the blood substitute circulates for a coupleof days in the blood stream - compared with a month or more for transfused redcells - and is then excreted, says Adamson.  But animal trials show this islong enough to counteract oxygen shortages during acute blood loss, say, in anaccident or an operation.  In fact, these trials showed that animals treatedwith Hemolink did just as well as those treated with transfusions of theanimals' own blood.Hemosol is currently working with two versions of Hemolink, one a fluid storedin a refrigerator and one frozen.  Either formulation would be suitable forsurgical applications.  A long-term goal is to develop a freeze-driedformulation.  It would be light enough to ship to remote depots - for use indisasters or military conflicts, for example - and it could be reconstitutedwith sterile water on-site.Adamson believes the cost for Hemolink would be competitive, noting that thereare significant administrative costs associated with the existing bloodcollection and distribution system.  These include the storage, transport,disposal and other labor and record-keeping activities that a successful bloodsubstitute would significantly reduce.  Also, since no cross-matching would berequired, these costs would be saved.Hemolink also would avoid some of the costly problems associated with bloodtransfusions - such as transmission of disease (ranging from HIV or hepatitisto a bacterial infection), or mismatched blood (where the patient might have areaction to antigens in the donor's blood that could be mild, such as a fever,or severe, resulting in death), or the delays in surgery brought about byblood shortages.Hemosol will not rely just on Hemolink to launch itself in this market.  Thecompany is collaborating with Ronald Kluger, a chemistry professor with theUniversity of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to further extend cross-linkingtechnologies for second-generation products.Adamson says the work also is aimed at chemically modifying hemoglobin so itcan serve as a carrier for drug molecules.  Tissues that can accumulate andmetabolize protein-drug conjugates are potential targets.  An example is asolid tumor.  Adamson says this would reduce many of the side-effects ofanti-tumor agents.A large-scale conversion from red cells to blood substitutes is unrealistic,particularly in the short term, Adamson says.  But assuming they win approval,blood substitutes could ultimately bring in big money.  Industry estimates ofthe potential market for blood substitutes (and newer applications where redcells can't be used) by the year 2002 are around 1.5 million units (worthUS$500 million) in North America, and over three million units worldwide,Hemosol says.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Clinical Studies) HGP-30 Study AnnouncedCel-Sci Corporation, Alexandria, Virginia, announced the start of a clinicalstudy with the HGP-30 HIV immunogen.

(PDTI), Santa Barbara, California, announced preliminary Phase I/IIclinical results for its first drug, tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2), for thetreatment of certain skin cancers and AIDS related Kaposi sarcoma (KS).At a financial conference in New York, New York, Gary S.  Kledzik, Ph.D.,chairman and chief executive officer, stated:  "In the Phase I/II clinicaltrials, photodynamic therapy with SnET2 eliminated or reduced a substantialnumber of tumors and demonstrated an excellent safety profile."These preliminary results indicate SnET2 is a promising drug for treatingsolid tumors, although Phase III studies are needed to provide definitivedata.  Final preparations are under way with our corporate partner, Pharmacia& Upjohn, for Phase III trials in the U.S.  and Europe."Photodynamic therapy uses drugs which are activated by light to selectivelydestroy diseased cells, such as cancer, with minimal effects on normaltissues.  The company's first clinical studies with SnET2 involved a combinedPhase I/II study for treatment of certain skin cancers, and a second combinedstudy for treatment of AIDS related KS.  These studies assessed the safety ofthe drug and evaluated the drug and light doses needed to achieve tumorresponses.The Phase I/II skin cancer study included basal cell carcinomas (skin cancerscaused primarily by sun exposure), basal cell nevus syndrome (a geneticdisease which causes multiple, recurrent basal cell carcinomas), andmetastatic adenocarcinomas (cancers which originate in glands, such as breastcancer, and in this study have metastasized or spread to the skin).This skin-cancer study included a total of 46 patients and 418 tumors.  InPhase I, combinations of drug and light doses were investigated.  The Phase IIportion was conducted at the anticipated optimal drug/light dose.Evaluable tumor responses were as follows:  100 percent of the basal cellcarcinomas had complete responses (no visible or palpable evidence of tumorremained).  In basal cell nevus syndrome patients, 95 percent of tumorsresponded.  Of the responding tumors, 86 percent were complete responses and14 percent were partial responses (reduced by 50 percent or more in size).In metastatic adenocarcinoma patients, 100 percent of tumors responded; 96percent were complete responses and 4 percent were partial.  This Phase I/IIKS study involved an additional 45 patients with a total of 404 tumors.Phase I of this study investigated drug and light combinations.  Phase IIstudies were conducted using the anticipated optimal drug dose and twoselected light doses.  At the higher light dose, 63 percent of the evaluabletumors responded.  60 percent of the responding tumors were complete responsesand 40 percent were partial.The safety of SnET2 was also investigated during these clinical trials.  Sideeffects were minimal.  The most common side effect was mild, transient skinsun sensitivity, which occurred in a small percentage of patients and did notrequire treatment.  No clinically significant abnormal trends were noted inthe laboratory parameters.The company emphasized that these data are interim and that final analyseshave not been concluded.  The primary goal of Phase I/II clinical trials is toassess safety and dosing parameters.  Phase III studies are required todetermine efficacy.Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Joint Venture) Phase I/II Clinical Trials with Protease Inhibitor for HIV Begins Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that itspartner Glaxo Wellcome has started Phase I/II clinical trials with VX-478(141W94), a orally administered protease inhibitor designed for the treatmentof HIV and AIDS.The multi-center study is being conducted at sites in the United States andEurope.  This study is part of an international clinical development programfor VX-478 being undertaken by Glaxo Wellcome, Kissei Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd., Matsumoto-City, Japan, and Vertex.The Phase I/II trial announced is a dose-ranging study designed to test theantiviral efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VX-478 during fourweeks of drug administration in HIV positive individuals.  The trial willinitially investigate three dose levels:  300 mg twice daily; 300 mg threetimes daily and 450 mg twice daily.Higher doses may be explored based on the tolerability of VX-478 at theinitial doses.  VX-478 has been shown to be well-tolerated in Phase I clinicalstudies which evaluated single doses up to 1200 mg.  To assess the anti-HIVactivity of VX-478 at each dose level, the study will monitor CD4 counts andthe viral load of the study participants.The data from this trial will be used by Glaxo Wellcome and Kissei to designadvanced trials to assess the safety and anti-HIV efficacy of VX-478 alone andin combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors."This Phase I/II trial builds on the strong tolerability, pharmacokinetics andbioavailability data generated for VX-478 in the Phase I trial completedearlier [in 1995]," commented Dr.  Joshua Boger, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer of Vertex.  "This trial marks the beginning of an accelerated effortto move VX-478 through clinical development."In July 1995, Glaxo Wellcome reported data from a Phase I trial of VX-478.  Inthis study, VX-478 was well-tolerated and displayed excellent pharmacokineticsat the single doses tested, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg and 1200 mg.The amount of VX-478 detected in the blood was directly proportional to thedoses administered.  At eight hours following administration, the level ofVX-478 detected in the bloodstream for each of the doses was well above theIC[90], the concentration of drug that eliminates 90 percent of HIVreplication in vitro.  The half-life of the compound ranged from approximatelyseven to ten hours, and oral bioavailability was calculated at greater than 70percent.HIV protease, a viral enzyme required by the virus for replication, is widelyrecognized as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of HIV infectionand AIDS.  The HIV protease is an alternative target to reverse transcriptase,the viral enzyme targeted by drugs such as Retrovir (AZT), Videx (ddI), Hivid(ddC) and Epivir (3TC).Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Patents and Technology)Notice of Allowance of Russian Patent on HIV Technology GrantedThe Immune Response Corporation, Carlsbad, California, announced that it hasreceived a notice of allowance from the European Patent Office and a patentfrom the Russian Patent Office regarding its core HIV technology.These patents, issued to inventors Jonas Salk, M.D.  and Dennis J.

Both FDA actions are considered unusual for anexperimental compound still in clinical trials.Celgene said it has begun sending official documents to the first of hundredsof physicians who have expressed interest in entering patients in the openlabel compassionate use protocol.Under provisions agreed to with the FDA, interested physicians must receivepermission from their affiliated hospitals to enroll patients in the study.Celgene will then dispense the drug to the physicians.  It is estimated thatroughly 100,000 US AIDS patients suffer from severe weight loss.Celgene said the cost of Synovir will be about $550 for a 12-week supply.  Bycomparison, recombinant human growth hormone, which is available to AIDSpatients under a treatment investigational new drug (IND), is currently pricedat approximately $11,000 for a 12-week supply, according to industry sources.Synovir's price was established under FDA guidelines and enables Celgene torecover costs of manufacture, R&D and handling of the expanded access program.A portion of the Synovir distributed will be provided free of charge toeconomically-disenfranchised patients.The protocol for the expanded access trial of Synovir is complementary toCelgene's placebo-controlled HIV wasting trial and provides patients who failto meet admission criteria of that study access to the drug.The broad entry criteria, coupled with greater physician access, substantiallyincreases the availability of Synovir to patients who may benefit from thetherapy, Celgene said.The expanded access program is open to patients suffering from AIDS relatedweight loss including those with coincident opportunistic infections ormalignancies and also to those who have previously failed to respond to othertherapies aimed at treating HIV wasting.  More severely ill patients mayreceive Synovir via a salvage arm of the trial.Weight gain is the primary endpoint.  Patients can continue the therapy afterthe initial 12-week treatment period, although informed consent will berequired every six months.For additional information contact:  Richard G.

Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less thancompatible, because they target different groups."Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIVprevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted."Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,attempts to combine them are difficult."Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conferenceon Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is thesame - to prevent infections - the focus must be different."In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of casemanagement in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventingtransmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstractpresented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit theinfection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infectedperson who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection."Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on generalhealth education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point ofimplementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point ofimplementation must be the general population of subsets of it."R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Programcountered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs isessential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficientlyimplement."Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Briennoted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient careand help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling isnot widely available."O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patientswith TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TBprograms and prevent further TB transmission in households.O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosisto be lacking."AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which togethercan address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLDmeeting."Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for workingseparately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is nowrecognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death inHIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer bepermitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care andpreventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programsfor people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis indeveloping areas."Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home careprograms for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomedrapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLDconference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affectedfamilies, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals canscarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families haveseriously deteriorated, due to AIDS."More than half of the people with HIV related illness will developtuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to completetreatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various healthcare programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses andreduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist withinhome care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in closecontact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB diseaseamong HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could providedrugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TBprevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa havealready implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.

Sarasin and colleagues wrote("Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Sequelae:  WhichPatients Up to Which Age?"  Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:394-400)."Nonetheless, whether the benefit of isoniazid outweighs it potentiallylife-threatening side effects (isoniazid-induced hepatitis) in all age groups,and in patients with coexisting diseases that limit life expectancy such assevere chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), a frequent clinical situation, remains unstudied."Earlier studies have focused on recommendations for prophylactic isoniazidamong patients with positive tuberculin skin test reactions only.  None,however, has specifically addressed recommendations regarding persons withfibrotic lesions discovered on chest X-ray.In this study Sarasin et al.  conducted a Markov-based decision analysis modelwhich balances the risk of recurrent TB against TB-related mortality,incidence of isoniazid-related hepatitis, and isoniazid-related death.They also sought to determine the optimal strategy between a six- to 12-monthcourse of prophylactic isoniazid and therapeutic abstention in different agegroups and in patients with severe coexisting diseases that limit lifeexpectancy such as CHF or COPD."The core of our decision tree was a model representing the natural history ofuntreated patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae," Sarasin et al.wrote.  "Over time, they may die from different age- or gender-related causes,or develop early or late TB and die from it.  Whether these patients maybenefit from prophylactic isoniazid involves weighing the trade-offs betweenthe short term risks of isoniazid-related complications and avoidance of TBreactivation, a benefit that may be accrued over the short or the long term,depending on when TB occurs."The Markov decision analysis found that in all groups of patients,prophylactic isoniazid clearly reduced the number of deaths from tuberculosis,whereas very few cases died from isoniazid-related toxicity.  However, becauseisoniazid-related deaths occur early, and TB-related deaths can occur early orlate, the gain in life expectancy was small."Particularly for patients with short survival such as those older than 80years and those with CHF or COPD, the average gain in life expectancy providedby prophylactic isoniazid did not exceed on week," Sarasin et al.  wrote."When the gains in life expectancy provided by prophylactic isoniazid aresmall and may not be considered clinically relevant, the optimal therapeuticdecision becomes a toss-up.  In clinical practice, toss-ups will undoubted beinterpreted differently by the physicians, the patients, and the health careplanners.  While physicians will focus on the patient's attitude toward risk(risk-aversion versus risk-seeking profile) and on therapeutic observance,patients will pay much more attention to the quality of life associated withisoniazid therapy, and specifically the inconvenience of taking medication,office visits, and laboratory tests.  On the other hand, from the healthplanners' vantage point, the potential epidemiologic benefit of preventingseveral future TB cases by treating one patient preventively will be the mostimportant determinant of decision making."The authors conclude that the usually recommended six- to 12-month course ofprophylactic isoniazid is beneficial to all cohort age groups.  They added,however, that recommendations should be modulated for the very elderly andthose with severe disease that limits life expectancy."For this subgroup of patients, frequently encountered in daily clinicalpractice, the decision whether and for how long to give prophylactic therapymight reasonably be left to the judgement of the individual patient and thephysician," they wrote.The corresponding author for this study is F.P.

Saito andcolleagues wrote ("In Vitro Antimycobacterial Activity of a New Quinolone,Levofloxacin," Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:377-380).Levofloxacin, the optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin, exhibits significantbactericidal activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase and has a strong antimicrobialactivity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.The antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin has been found to be eight to 128times greater than that of the corresponding D-isomer and approximately twiceas potent as that of ofloxacin.In earlier studies Saito et al.  reported that some new quinolones includingofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin and sparfloxacin possessed appreciable invitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activity, especially against Mycobacteriumtuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  fortuitum, and M.  leprae.In this study Saito et al.  examined in vitro antimicrobial activity oflevofloxacin against various pathogenic mycobacteria, in particular M.tuberculosis and M.  avium complex (MAC).Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin for variousmycobacterial species were determined by the agar dilution method using 7H11medium and compared with those of ofloxacin.  Antimicrobial activity oflevofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis and M.  intracellulare phagocytosed inmurine peritoneal macrophages was measured in terms of reducingcell-associated bacterial colony forming units (CFUs).MICs of levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  marinum, M.scrofulaceum, M.  avium, M.  intracellulare, M.  fortuitum, and M.  chelonaewere two to four times lower than those of ofloxacin.  Levofloxacin exhibitedhigher efficacy in reducing bacterial CFUs in macrophages than ofloxacin."The present results showed that in vitro antimicrobial activity oflevofloxacin against various mycobacteria was two to four times greater thanthat of ofloxacin, in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration values," Saitoet al.  wrote.Previous investigators have reported that the antimicrobial activity oflevofloxacin against various bacteria other than mycobacteria is generallytwice that of ofloxacin (Hayakawa et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemother1986;29:163-164; Imamura et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemo 1987;31:325-327and Tanka et al., J Antimicrob Chemother 1990;26:659-666)."The difference in in vitro activity of levofloxacin from ofloxacin in thesereports is therefore consistent with that in the present study," Saito et al.wrote.  "In the case of M.  intracellulare, significant delay of bacterialgrowth was caused by levofloxacin added at 1 mg/L, but such efficacy was notobserved for ofloxacin at the same concentration.  Levofloxacin and ofloxacinat doses of 10 mg/L prevented the bacterial growth during the whole incubationperiod.  There were significant differences between these two quinolones inthe efficacy in reducing the intra-macrophage growth of M.  intracellulare."The corresponding author for this study is H.

(SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBIsponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon toan AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive anexperimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on theexperiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneeringAIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University ofPittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division ofCellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadtdiscovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates therisk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfullyfights transplant rejection.Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that theuninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow torestore the patient's immune function.The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change thepractice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanentacceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver aswell as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matchingor prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmunediseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and mayultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-speciestransplantation).Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Diagnostics"Accuracy of Chest Radiograph Interpretation in the Diagnosis of Pneumocystiscarinii Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Tuberculosis in HIVPositive Patients."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Theadmitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratoryproved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIVpositive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively andindependently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinicalpresentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and finaldiagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followedby an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis wasmade in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the medianaccuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and noactive disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderateinterobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked otherinfections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis byall 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretationallows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIVpositive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Esophageallymphoma or possible esophageal lymphoma was diagnosed in 8 AIDS patients overa 4-year period.  Six patients underwent esophagography, in addition toendoscopy and biopsy.  Four patients underwent repeated biopsies.  No patientsunderwent immunologic marker studies.  RESULTS:  Only 1 patient had a polypoidmass in the distal esophagus typical of neoplasm.  The other 7 patients hadesophageal ulcers that radiologically and at gross inspection endoscopicallywere considered of viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] or idiopathic) origin.Pathologic examination initially suggested lymphoma in all 7 patients withconcomitant CMV in 5.  Follow-up biopsies revealed that the 'lymphomatous'infiltrate was actually inflammatory reaction in 3.  In 1 patient, an isolatedCMV inclusion was discovered on the 2nd biopsy, and the esophageal ulcerresolved with ganciclovir despite continued pathologic evidence of lymphoma.CONCLUSION:  Esophageal lymphoma and viral infection coexist such that therecan be considerable diagnostic and thereby therapeutic confusion in regard tothese patients.

J.J.Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'TheChallenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemicimmune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayedtype hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, andin vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chieflytransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-typehypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion ofMycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression ofcytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) functionin autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) fromvirulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increasedspontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulatedproduction of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gammaexpression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppressionand energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restoresPPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too mayreflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding ofimmunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions forimmunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes andmonocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serumand cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosispatients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infectedmacrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutuallyenhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for asubunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role forextracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominanceof certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine orDTH skin test."Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Infection Control (TB)"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."

Relevant Behavioral and social factorsconcern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatmentoutcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, andhealth care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patientsand for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIVinfected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality oftreatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the coreBehavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observedtherapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; wheresuccessful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social andBehavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographicresearch has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals abouttuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associatetuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about theappropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed aboutthe cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show theeffectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, andcomprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinicpractices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research isemerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk topatients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studiesof treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, withimplications for the education and supervision of physicians who treattuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development oflocally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral researchmust focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existingdescriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory andresearch methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues willbe identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types ofpatients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infectionseek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."Back to Headline List CopyrightAIDS WEEKLY PLUS via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Therapy (Kaposi Sarcoma)"Radiation Therapy of the Oral Cavity and Oropharynx In Patients with AIDSRelated Kaposi Sarcoma."

We studied 25 patients with both humanimmunodeficiency virus infection and cutaneous presentations of lymphoma,using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus.RESULTS:  Two groups of patients were discerned:  (1) those with conditionssimilar to mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome with an indolent course (n=8)and (2) those with nodules or papules, greater immunosuppression, a rapidclinical course, and large cell lymphoma seen on biopsy specimens (n=17).  Theepidermotropic lymphomas were of T-cell lineage and CD30(-).  Thirteen of thelarge cell lymphomas were also of the T-cell type, and 71% were CD30(+).Epstein-Barr virus was absent in the epidermotropic lymphomas, but it waspresent in 73% of the nonepidermotropic cases.  CONCLUSIONS:  Two forms ofhuman immunodeficiency virus-associated cutaneous lymphoma were found:indolent disease resembling mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome and largecell lymphomas with a poor prognosis, whose cells often had a CD30(+) T-cellphenotype and harbored the Epstein-Barr virus."

By using the Japanese consensus sequence ofHIV-1, we successfully constructed chimeric protein secretion vectors byselecting an appropriate insertion site of a carrier protein and establishedthe principal neutralizing determinant (PND)-peptide secretion system in BCG.The recombinant BCG (rBCG)-inoculated guinea pigs were initially screened bydelayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions to the PND peptide,followed by passive transfer of the DTH by the systemic route.  Further,immunization of mice with the rBCG resulted in induction of cytotoxic Tlymphocytes.  The guinea pig immune antisera showed elevated titers to the PNDpeptide and neutralized HIVMN, and administration of serum IgG from thevaccinated guinea pigs was effective in completely blocking the HIV infectionin thymus/liver transplanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/hu orSCID/PBL mice.  In addition, the immune serum IgG was shown to neutralizeprimary field isolates of HIV that match the neutralizing sequence motif by aperipheral blood mononuclear fell-based virus neutralization assay.

"Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Hodgkin's DiseaseContains Latent, Not Replicative, Epstein-Barr Virus."  Human Pathology,November 1995;26(11):1191-1195.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Human Pathology,"Severe immunodeficiency is associated with reactivation of latentEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) that is manifested by virus replication.  It isunknown whether EBV replication also occurs in the Hodgkin's disease (HD)tissue of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Therefore, we studied paraffin-embedded lymph nodes from 13 cases ofHIV-associated HD to determine the latent or replicative state of EBVinfection.  All patients were seropositive HIV-infected men; additionalclinical information was available for 12 patients.  The risk factor(s) forHIV infection were homosexuality (n=7), intravenous drug abuse (n=2),homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse (n=1), sexual promiscuity (n=1), orhemophilia (n=1).  Advanced clinical stage and B symptoms were common at thetime of initial diagnosis of HD.  The histological subtype of Hodgkin'sdisease was universally mixed cellularity, except for a single case classifiedas nodular sclerosis.  Seven cases exhibited foci of relative lymphoiddepletion.  Five cases contained foci of necrosis.  Reed-Sternberg (RS) cellsand RS cell variants were positive for CD30/BerH2 and negative for CD45/LCACD45RO/UCHL1, and CD20/L26 in all cases.  Tumor cells were positive forCD15/LeuM1 in seven cases.  In all 13 cases, RS cells and RS cell variantswere infected by latent EBV as shown by in situ hybridization to EBV-encodedribonucleic acid (EBER1).  In 12 of 13 cases neoplastic cells coexpressed EBVlatent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).  EBV replication was examined by twodifferent methods:  immunohistochemistry to identify EBV-encoded BZLF1 proteinand in situ hybridization to detect EBV BHLF1 transcripts.  No positivity inRS or RS cell variants was detected with either assay of EBV replication (95%confidence interval [CI]=0% to 23%).  The findings confirm that EBV isdetected more frequently in HIV-associated HD when compared withimmunocompetent patients with HD.  The findings also suggest that EBV istightly latent within RS and RS cell variants of HIV-associated HD.  Itappears that factors other than host immune status are important inmaintaining EBV latency in HIV-associated HD."

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ofthe United States of America, November 7, 1995;92(23):10492-10495.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Administration of virus-specific antibodies is known to be an effective earlytreatment for some viral infections.  Such immunotherapy probably acts byantibody-mediated neutralization of viral infectivity and is often thought tofunction independently of T-cell-mediated immune responses.  In the presentexperiments, we studied passive antibody therapy using Friend murine leukemiavirus complex as a model for an immunosuppressive retroviral disease in adultmice.  The results showed that antibody therapy could induce recovery from awell-established retroviral infection.  However, the success of therapy wasdependent on the presence of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes.  Thus,cell-mediated responses were required for recovery from infection even in thepresence of therapeutic levels of antibody.  The major histocompatibility typeof the mice was also an important factor determining the relative success ofantibody therapy in this system, but it was less critical for low-dose thanfor high-dose infections.  Our results imply that limited T-cellresponsiveness as dictated by major histocompatibility genes and/or stage ofdisease may have contributed to previous immunotherapy failures in AIDSpatients.  Possible strategies to improve the efficacy of future therapies arediscussed."

Journal of AdvancedNursing, November 1995;22(5):879-887.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal ofAdvanced Nursing, "The literature reports an ongoing debate amongst nursesregarding the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) throughroutine nursing care.  An emotionally charged dilemma appears to exist formany nurses regarding what they perceive as conflict between professionalobligation and personal risk.  This study investigates nurses' beliefs,knowledge and perceptions of risk of contracting HIV while implementing theirnursing care.  The study focuses on qualified nurses in the hospice, hospitaland community settings.  No other similar comparative study that also focuseson hospice nurses has been identified.  This quantitative study wasimplemented within Northern Ireland, by way of a respondent-administeredquestionnaire.  The study's sample consisted of 45 qualified nurses and aresponse rate of 93% (42 respondents) was achieved.  Analysis of the datainvolved the use of descriptive and correlational statistics.  Overallfindings indicated that many nurses, but particularly those who work in thehospital and community settings, hold negative and biased beliefs, and haveinadequate knowledge and misguided perceptions regarding their risk ofcontracting HIV through the implementation of routine nursing care of clients.Many of those nurses readily admit their lack of knowledge.  On the whole,hospice nurses appear more knowledgeable and exhibit a more positive approachto AIDS clients, and appear less fearful than do nurses in the other twosettings.  Implications for hospital management, for nurse education, fornurses themselves and for clients are discussed.

DESIGN:  Aprospective study of the mothers of children enrolled in the EuropeanCollaborative Study on children born to HIV-infected women.  SETTING:Twenty-one European centres in seven countries.  SUBJECTS:  One thousand sixhundred and ninety HIV-infected women and their 1754 deliveries.  RESULTS:The proportion of women in whom HIV infection had been diagnosed beforepregnancy increased significantly over time, from 7% in 1984-1985 to 65% in1994 (P<0.001).  The prevalence of breastfeeding, which was related to thetiming of diagnosis, significantly declined over the study period.  The meanCD4 count was 510 cells/mm(3), and there was a significant decline in averageCD4 count over the study period.  Black women had a significantly lower CD4count than white women.  From survival analysis it is estimated that fiveyears after delivery, 14% of women will have died and 24% will have developedCDC stage IV disease.  CONCLUSIONS:  Timing of diagnosis is of criticalimportance if mother-to-child transmission is to be reduced through avoidanceof breastfeeding and zidovudine therapy and effective antenatal screeningpolicies have become increasingly important.

DESIGN:  A prospective observationalstudy.  SETTING:  Community and university-based ophthalmology clinics.PATIENTS:  Three hundred fifty patients with HIV infection, who had 407 eyeswith retinal detachments secondary to necrotizing retinitis.  INTERVENTION:Vitrectomy surgery for retinal detachment with 1000- or 5000-centistokesilicone oil as the retinal tamponade.  OUTCOME MEASURES:  Efficacy wasmeasured both by anatomic success (defined as complete retinal attachment ormacular attachment) and by visual acuity success (defined as preservation ofvisual acuity or ambulatory vision).  Safety was determined by the rate ofcomplications, including abnormal intraocular pressure and corneal and lensopacification.  RESULTS:  At the last follow-up examination, the retina wascompletely attached in 287 (73%) of 393 eyes, the macula was attached in 370eyes (94%), 268 eyes (68%) had ambulatory vision, and visual acuity waspreserved in 219 (56%) of 388 eyes.  Corneal opacification, hypotony, andsilicone oil emulsification were present in 4%, 2%, and 1% of eyes,respectively.  One eye had elevated intraocular pressure.  Of the 57 patientswho had both eyes treated, 35 died, of whom four (11%) had nonambulatoryvision in both eyes.  Of the 293 patients who had one eye treated, 122 died,of whom 44 (36%) died with nonambulatory vision in the treated eye.  Themedian time to cataract was 192 days; to nonambulatory vision, 474 days; andto death, 204 days.

Biochemical and Biophysical ResearchCommunications, November 2, 1995;216(1):399-405.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Biochemical andBiophysical Research Communications, "We have hijacked a process of thereceptor-mediated endocytosis to transport peptide antigens into antigenpresenting cells (APCs) for the purpose of increasing the level of antigenpresentation (named Receptor-Linked Antigen Delivery System (R-LADS)).  Bycoupling an endogenous plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) to a synthetic peptide having a partial sequence of HIV-1 envelopeprotein, alpha 2M was made to carry the peptide into APCs as a part of thenormal alpha 2M cycle, which resulted in an increased production of specificantibodies against the peptide (Mitsuda, S., Nakagawa, T., Osada, T.,Shimamoto, T., Nakazato, H.  and Ikai, A.  (1993) Biochem.  Biophys.  Res.Commun.  194, 1155-1160).  We demonstrate here that this procedure becomes amore efficient tool for antibody production when autologous transporterprotein was used.  By using murine alpha 2M (m alpha 2M) instead ofheterologous human alpha 2M (h alpha 2M) when mice were experimental animals,we were able to dramatically enhance the production level of anti-HIV-1peptide antibodies and shorten the period which is needed for antibodyproduction.  We aim to develop effective peptide vaccines by further improvingthis system."

"Cost Effectiveness of Antituberculosis Interventions."Pharmacoeconomics, November 1995;8(5):385-399.According to the authors' abstract of an article published inPharmacoeconomics, "The treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is ranked as the mostcost effective of all therapeutic programmes in terms of cost per year of lifesaved.  Nevertheless, TB kills or debilitates more adults aged between 15 and59 years than any other disease in the world; furthermore, about 2 to 4% ofthe burden of disease, 7% of all deaths and 26% of all preventable deaths aredirectly attributable to TB.  About one-third of the world's population isinfected with the TB bacillus.  In the developing world, more women ofchildbearing age die from TB than from causes directly associated withpregnancy and childbirth.  The death of adults in their prime, who areparents, community leaders and producers in most societies, causes aparticularly onerous burden besides being a serious public health problem.  Inthe poorest countries, where the magnitude of the TB problem is greatest,those TB control strategies that are economically feasible tend to be lesseffective.  Therefore, in low and middle income countries, cost-effectivenessconsiderations aimed at prioritizing resource allocation in the health sectorin general, and in TB control programmes in particular, are of paramountimportance.  Operationally, the main components of a TB control programme are:(i) detection and treatment of TB; and (ii) prevention of TB through BCGvaccination and chemoprophylaxis.  Priority should be given to ensuring thatTB patients complete their prescribed course of chemotherapy.  Adequatetreatment is the most effective way of preventing the spread of TB and theemergence of drug resistance.  This article reviews evidence of theeffectiveness and cost effectiveness of different approaches to TB can,particularly those that are applicable to low income countries, in bothHIV-infected and noninfected patients.  Financial implications and ways toimplement directly observed therapy for TB in large urban areas are discussed,and the need to address some relevant operational issues is highlighted.

"Relationship Between Procedures and Health Insurance forCritically III Patients with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia."  AmericanJournal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November1995;152(5):1435-1442.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journalof Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "The objective of the present studywas to assess the association between type of health insurance coverage anduse of diagnostic tests and therapies among patients with AIDS-relatedPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).  Fifty-six private, public, andcommunity hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami were selected for thestudy, and the charts of 890 patients with empirically treated orcytologically confirmed PCP, hospitalized during 1987 to 1990 wereretrospectively reviewed.  Patients were classified by insurance status:self-pay (n=56), Medicaid (n=254), or private insurance, including healthmaintenance organizations and Medicare (n=580).  Primary outcomes were the useand timing of bronchoscopy, the type and timing of PCP therapy, andin-hospital mortality.  The results indicate that Medicaid patients were lesslikely than privately insured patients to undergo bronchoscopy (relative odds= 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.93; P=0.02) or to have their diagnosis of PCPconfirmed (relative odds = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.77), after adjusting forpatient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.  Medicaid patientswere approximately three-fourths more likely than privately insured patients(relative odds = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.96; P=0.04) to die in-hospital, afteradjusting for patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.However, with further adjustment for confirmation of PCP, Medicaid patients nolonger had a significantly higher likelihood of dying in-hospital.  Weconclude that Medicaid patients are less likely to receive diagnosticbronchoscopy than privately insured or self-insured patients, more likely tobe empirically treated for PCP, and more likely to die in-hospital.  Highermortality among Medicaid patients may result from failure to diagnose andtreat alternative pathogens, a consequence of worse access to invasivediagnostic tests."

DESIGN:  Anonymous unlinked seroprevalence study.  SETTING:Pregnancy termination unit in a teaching hospital in Montreal.  PARTICIPANTS:Women presenting for abortion from July 1989 to June 1993 who resided inQuebec and were not known to have HIV infection, 12017 (99.6%) of 12068eligible women were included in the study.  INTERVENTION:  HIV antibodytesting of serum left over from samples obtained for routine Rh typing, thesame algorithm as for serodiagnostic testing, namely enzyme immunoassay (EIA)followed by confirmatory testing of repeatedly EIA-reactive samples, was used.OUTCOME MEASURES:  HIV serostatus by age, marital status, region of residence(metropolitan Montreal Versus other), country of birth and number of livingchildren.  RESULTS:  Most (84.7%) of the subjects resided in metropolitanMontreal.  The median age was 27.0 (range 13 to 50) years.  The serum samplesof 22 women were confirmed to be HIV positive, for an overall seroprevalencerate of 1.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8).  The seroprevalencerate did not vary significantly by age, marital status, region of residence orstudy year.  However, it was strongly correlated with country of birth:Canada 0.16, Haiti 23.5, HIV-endemic countries other than Haiti 5.3 andnon-HIV-endemic countries other than Canada 0.0 per 1000.  The seroprevalencerate among women born in Haiti was 147 times higher than that among women bornin Canada (P<0.0001).  Of the women born in Haiti the rate was 3.0 timesgreater among those who immigrated to Canada in 1985 or later than among thosewho immigrated earlier (P=0.047).  CONCLUSIONS:  The results of this studyindicate that the HIV seroprevalence rate among women in Montreal is stronglyassociated with country of birth, women born in HIV-endemic countries,especially Haiti, having the highest rate.

We analyzed the data of 131 patientstreated in the period 1980-1985 of whom 64 (49%) were at least 60 yr of age.Subsequent increases of transaminases (measured weekly for as long as 4 wkafter the start of treatment and later on when symptoms suggestive ofhepatotoxicity occurred) above baseline values were found more frequently inthe elderly (38 versus 18%, P<0.05) and were also more pronounced in them(P<0.01).  The ratio of the highest transaminase value over the baseline valuewas called the transaminase index (TI).  A TI of at least 5 was found in 22%of elderly and 8% of younger patients (P=NS), but ratios as high as 10 weremostly asymptomatic and always normalized progressively without treatmentadjustment.  Only symptomatic patients with a TI greater than or equal to 10(five elderly and three younger) required temporary or definitive treatmentadjustment.

"IL-7 Stimulates Protective Immunityin Mice Against the Intracellular Pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii."  Journal ofImmunology, November 15, 1995;155(10):4798-4804.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal ofImmunology, "Cytokines, in particular IFN-gamma and IL-12, are important inhost protection against infection with Toxoplasma gondii.  This parasite is amajor cause of congenital infection and morbidity in immunosuppressed persons,especially those with AIDS.  IL-7, a monomeric protein produced by bone marrowstromal cells and fetal thymus, is able to induce the proliferation of pro-Bcells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and to enhance cytotoxicity of CTL and NKcells, Inbred mice were infected with a lethal dose of T.  gondii and givenIL-7 twice daily.  Mice treated with IL-7 beginning at the time of infectionsurvived, whereas mice either treated after infection or not treated died.Phenotypic analysis of splenocytes identified an expansion of NK (asialoGM1(+)) cells and CD8(+) T-cell populations.  In vivo depletion of NK (asialoGM1(+)) and CD8(+) T cells showed that cells expressing these phenotypes wereimportant for maintaining protection against the parasite.  IFN-gammadepletion resulted in complete reversal of the protective effect of IL-7administration.  In vivo depletion of endogenous IL-7 enhanced susceptibilityto infection.  Cytokine analysis by semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCRshowed that IL-7 enhances the IFN-gamma response and furthermore reverses theparasite-mediated down-regulatory response on IL-2.  These observationsindicate that exogenous administration of human rIL-7 is able to protect miceagainst acute parasite challenge by stimulating IFN-gamma production andaugmenting the CD8(+) T cell-mediated CTL response."

"Biological Characterization of Nef inLong-Term Survivors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infection."Journal of Virology, December 1995;69(12):8142-8146.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal ofVirology, "We have previously shown that there were no gross deletions orobvious sequence abnormalities within nef of human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) in the 10 long-term survivors studied (Y.  Huang, L.  Zhang, andD.D, Ho, J, Virol, 69:93-100, 1995).  Here we extend our study to examinethese nef alleles in a functional context.  Using a new technique, termedsite-directed gene replacement, we have precisely replaced the nef of aninfectious molecular clone, HIV-1(HXB2), with nef alleles derived from 10long-term survivors as well as from a patient with AIDS.  The replicationproperties of these chimeric viruses demonstrated that the nef alleles derivedfrom long-term survivors neither significantly increased nor decreased viralreplication, compared with the nef allele of Nef(+) HIV-1(HXB2) and thatderived from a patient with AIDS.  However, Nef(+) viruses always replicatedfaster than virus lacking nef.  Moreover, single-cell infection analysis bythe MAGI assay showed that these chimeric viruses, as well as Nef(+)HIV-1(HXB2), were more infectious than Nef(-) HIV-1(HXB2) was, Therefore, weconclude that the genotypic and phenotypic features of nef are not likely toaccount for the nonprogression of HIV-1 infection in the 10 cases studied,unless the function of the nef gene in vivo is not accurately reflected by thein vitro assays we used."

Leiby, TransmissibleDiseases Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues("Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma Cruzi-Antibodies in a Subpopulation ofAmerican Red Cross Blood Donors," abstract 387, American Journal of TropicalMedicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):215)."Despite the absence of demonstrated T.  cruzi transmission by transfusion,the finding of seroreactive donors suggests that a significant public healthproblem may exist," Leiby et al.  wrote in their presentation abstract.  Theypresented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society ofTropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas, November 17-21, 1995.The study was performed with the Southern California and the South FloridaRegions of the American Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories.All volunteer blood donors in the Los Angeles and Miami Red Cross bloodcenters were asked a question about their place of birth or amount of timespent in regions endemic for T.  cruzi.  Those donors who answered "yes" and acontrol group were tested for the presence of T.  cruzi antibodies by EIA(manufactured by Abbott Laboratories).The researchers confirmed by RIPA those samples that were repeatedly reactiveby EIA.  They then entered into case-control and look-back investigationsthose donors who were confirmed T.  cruzi seroreactive.Of the donors questioned about risk, 7.4 percent (14,480/196,832) in LosAngeles and 11 percent (1,868/17,043) in Miami responded yes.  Of these whoanswered affirmatively, 20 were confirmed by RIPA (17 donors in Los Angeles;three in Miami).  Among these 20 individuals, the risk factor they all sharedwas birth in and extended residence in a country endemic for T.  cruzi.A look-back investigation of eight patients who previously had received bloodfrom the infected donors showed that none of the blood recipients hadtransfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi.While none of the blood recipients in this particular study hadtransfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi infection, there are documented reports ofthree cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States andone case in Canada (according to a report by Ira A.  Schulman, M.D., Directorof Transfusion Medicine, LA County/USC Medical Center, delivered at the BloodSafety & Screening Conference, October 23-25, 1995, Washington, D.C.).Within the past 25 years, millions of immigrants have come to the UnitedStates from countries where T.  cruzi is endemic.Since 1991, an estimated 100,000 individuals infected with T.  cruzi reside inNorth America. - by Cathy ClarkBack to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Blood Banking (Donors)January 1996 "National Volunteer Blood Donor Month"The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), along with the American RedCross (ARC) and the Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC), announced thatPresident Bill Clinton has proclaimed January 1996 as "National VolunteerBlood Donor Month."Each year, approximately eight million volunteer donors give about 14 millionunits of blood to those in need.  These units are transfused to as many asfour million patients annually."Society depends upon healthy blood donors who choose to graciously give ofthemselves each day to help others.  The AABB applauds these civic-minded menand women as 'heroes.' What greater gift can mankind share than that oflife-saving blood," said Roger K.  Svoboda, president, AABB.In his proclamation, President Clinton declared, "Perhaps the most noble formof charity is the gift we give anonymously to a stranger in need.  Donatingblood offers us this opportunity.  In a fast, safe, and simple procedure, wecan literally give life to someone in our community who is suffering fromillness or injury.  During this special month, I strongly encourage all myfellow Americans who are able to do so to take an hour from their day todonate blood."For 1996, the AABB has chosen "Be a Hero.  Be a Blood Donor!"  as its campaigntheme.  The association will again have celebrity spokesperson, Carol Burnett,encourage regular blood donations from healthy first-time and repeat donors.Insurance giant MetLife, winner of the AABB 1994 Outstanding Achievement Awardfor its promotion and support of blood donation on a nationwide basis, hasjoined forces with AABB to promote "National Volunteer Blood Donor Month."During January 1996, a MetLife print campaign will appear in nationallysyndicated newspapers of the Peanuts cartoon character Snoopy hoarding cookieswith the slogan, "Give Blood.  Get Cookies."FACTS ABOUT BLOOD AND BLOOD BANKINGHOW MUCH BLOOD IS DONATED EACH YEAR?  HOW MUCH BLOOD IS TRANSFUSED EACH YEAR?About 14 million units (including approximately one million autologousdonations) of blood are donated each year by approximately eight millionvolunteer blood donors.  These units are transfused to as many as four millionpatients per year.A unit of whole blood is roughly equivalent to a pint.  Adult males have about12 pints of blood in their circulatory systems, and adult females haveapproximately nine pints.  Each unit is usually separated into multiplecomponents, which may be transfused to a number of different individuals.  Upto four components can be derived from one unit of blood.The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 40,000 units ofred blood cells are needed.  Accident cases, people undergoing surgery, andpatients receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or other diseases, such assickle cell disease and thalassemia, all utilize blood.  More than 23 millionunits of blood components are transfused every year.WHO DONATES BLOOD?  Less than 5 percent of healthy Americans eligible todonate blood actually donate each year.According to studies, the average donor is a college-educated white male,between the ages of 30 and 50, who is married and has an above-average income.However, these statistics are changing, and women and minority groups arevolunteering to donate in increasing numbers.While persons 65 years and older compose 13 percent of the population, theyuse 25 percent of all blood units transfused.  Using current screening anddonation procedures, a growing number of blood banks have found blood donationby the elderly to be safe and practical.WHERE IS BLOOD DONATED?  There are many places where blood donations can bemade.  Bloodmobiles travel to high schools, colleges, churches, and communityorganizations.  People can also donate at community blood centers andhospital-based donor centers.Many people donate at blood drives at their place of work.  Community bloodcenters collect approximately 88 percent of the nation's blood, andhospital-based donor centers account for the other 12 percent.  Consult theyellow pages to locate a nearby blood center or hospital to donate.WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR BLOOD DONATION?  To be eligible to donate blood, aperson must generally be at least 17 years of age (although some states permityounger people to donate with parental consent); be in good health; and weighat least 110 pounds.  Most blood banks have no upper age limit.  All donorsmust pass the physical and health history examinations given prior todonation.Nearly all blood used for transfusion in the United States is drawn fromvolunteer donors.  The donor's body replenishes the fluid lost from donationin 24 hours.  It may take up to two months to replace the lost red bloodcells.  Whole blood can be donated every eight weeks.An increasingly common procedure is apheresis, or the process of removing aspecific component of the blood and returning the red blood cells to thedonor.  This process allows more of a particular component - platelets, forinstance - to be drawn in one sitting than could be separated from a unit ofwhole blood.  Apheresis is also performed to collect plasma and granulocytes.WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON BLOOD TYPE?  The approximate distribution of bloodtypes in the U.S.  population is as follows.  Distribution may be differentfor specific racial and ethnic groups:*  O    Rh-positive    38 percent*  O    Rh-negative    7 percent*  A    Rh-positive    34 percent*  A    Rh-negative    6 percent*  B    Rh-positive    9 percent*  B    Rh-negative    2 percent*  AB    Rh-positive    3 percent*  AB    Rh-negative    1 percentIn an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells, and type ABindividuals can receive red blood cells of any ABO group.  Therefore, peoplewith type O blood are known as "universal donors" and those with AB blood asuniversal recipients."WHAT TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON DONATED BLOOD?  After blood is drawn, it is testedfor ABO group and Rh type, as well as for any unexpected antibodies that maycause problems in the recipient.  Screening tests are also performed forhepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)and the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and for antibodies to HIV (anti-HIV-1and HIV-2), the human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and syphilis.HOW IS BLOOD STORED AND USED?  Each unit of blood is normally separated intoseveral components.  Red blood cells may be stored under refrigeration for amaximum of 42 days, or they may be frozen for up to ten years.  Red cellscarry oxygen and are commonly used to treat anemia.Platelets are important in the control of bleeding and are used in patientswith leukemia and other forms of cancer.  Platelets may be kept for a maximumof five days.  Granulocytes established.  They must be transfused within 24hours of donation.  Plasma, used to control bleeding, is usually kept in thefrozen state for up to one year.  Cryoprecipitated AHF, which containsclotting factors, is made from fresh-frozen plasma and may be stored frozenfor one year.Other products manufactured from blood include albumin, immune globulin,specific immune globulins and clotting factor concentrates.  These bloodproducts are commonly made by commercial manufacturers.HOW MUCH DOES BLOOD COST?  While donated blood is free, and most bloodcollecting organizations (blood centers as well as collecting hospitals) arenot-for-profit, there are significant costs associated with collecting,storing, testing, and transfusing blood.  As a result, processing fees arecharged to recover costs.  Processing fees for red blood cells vary and may bemore than $100 per unit in certain parts of the country.  The national averageis between $65 and $75.  Other components may be more expensive.Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Transplantation (BMT)HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors Are Good Option for CML PatientsBone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donors(VUDs) can cure a significant number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia(CML).For patients with CML, allogeneic BMT is established as an effective means torestore normal hematopoiesis.  However, the lack of a suitable HLA-identicalsibling has led to more frequent use of VUDs.  Compared with HLA-identicalsibling donor BMT, VUD BMT has been associated with greater morbidity andmortality, especially because of greater rates of graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) and graft failure.Andrew Spencer, Leukemia Research Fund Center for Adult Leukemia, RoyalPostgraduate Medical School, London, England, and colleagues performed ananalysis of the outcome of VUD BMT in 115 patients with CML at theirinstitution ("Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia withVolunteer Unrelated Donors Using Ex Vivo or In Vivo T-Cell Depletion:  MajorPrognostic Impact of HLA Class I Identity between Donor and Recipient," Blood,1995;86(9):3590-3597).Their aim was to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from VUDBMT."We have demonstrated that VUD BMT can cure a significant number ofappropriately selected patients with CML," wrote Spencer et al.  They addedthat the availability of high-resolution tissue typing techniques enables moreaccurate predictions of outcome after VUD BMT.  The use of such methods shouldallow the more appropriate use of VUD BMT in managing CML."In young, chronic phase patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling, a search foran unrelated donor should be commenced immediately," wrote Spencer et al.  "Ifa potential donor, matched using high-resolution typing techniques, isidentified, BMT should be considered as soon as possible."Spencer et al.  performed 115 VUD BMT for first chronic phase or advancedphase CML between August 1985 and July 1994.  They supplemented standardserologic HLA typing of recipients and potential donors with one-dimensionalisoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQalleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis andthe measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC)cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay).The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at three years was 37 percent.  Theprobabilities of survival and LFS for patients under the age of 40 years whowere transplanted in the first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73percent and 50 percent, respectively."We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; whenusing ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved inpatients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors withoutdemonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency," wrote Spencer etal.The current study showed an association between graft failure and increasingdonor age that has not been recognized before.  The graft failure rate of 16percent reported by Spender et al.  corresponds to that reported by otherresearchers (McGlave et al., Blood, 1990;75:1728; McGlave et al., Blood,1993;81:543).Researchers have indicated that about two-thirds of patients, otherwiseeligible for BMT, lack a matched sibling donor (Beatty et al.,Transplantation, 1988;45:714).The corresponding author for this study is Andrew Spencer, LRF Centre forAdult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Du Cane Road, London W12ONN, United Kingdom. - by Cathy ClarkBack to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Transplantation (Cord Blood)Improved Methods Address Storage and Cell Viability ChallengesRecent processing improvements should make frozen placental/umbilical cordblood (PCB) a more useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrowreconstitution.Pablo Rubinstein and colleagues, Lindsley F.  Kimball Research Institute ofthe New York Blood Center, New York, New York, addressed two key requirementsfor moving unrelated-donor PCB transplantation forward as a practicalalternative for clinical use ("Processing and Cryopreservation ofPlacental/Umbilical Cord Blood for Unrelated Bone Marrow Reconstitution,"Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1995;92(22):10119-10122).First, they developed a method that maximizes freezer storage space byconcentrating the hematopoietic cells of PCB units into units of smallervolume.  Second, they developed a method to overcome loss of viabilityassociated with cryopreservation and thawing.In the unrelated donor/recipient setting, human leukocyte antigen(HLA)-matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients.  This requiresthe establishment of large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units, notedRubinstein et al.  This effort typically involves a large volume ofunprocessed PCB units consisting primarily of red blood cells, plasma andcryopreservation medium, which take up limited, expensive frozen storage spacein liquid nitrogen.Rubinstein et al.  designed a closed-system procedure, compatible with routineblood bank processing, that concentrates almost all the leukocytes andprogenitor cells in PCB units.  The procedure is based on a hydroxyethylstarch (HES)-induced rouleaux formation and mild centrifugation to separate aleukocyte-rich supernatant from sedimented red blood cells."Since the probability of finding an HLA-matched unit depends on the number ofunits available and since the number of units that can be stored in a givenspace is determined by the average unit volume, smaller PCB units areessential for PCB to become a practical source of tissue for unrelatedtransplantation," wrote Rubinstein et al.Decreasing the volume of PCB units by removing the bulk of red blood cells andplasma offers practical advantages such as convenience, cost and efficiency,compared with current options.The second issue - reduced cell viability after the cryopreserved PCB unitsare thawed - was diminished by adding one volume of isotonic diluent to thecell suspension in 10 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).Dilution of the freshly thawed cryopreserved unit with an equal volume ofisotonic solution allows the product to be thawed and prepared for infusionunder controlled laboratory conditions instead of at the patient's bedside,noted the researchers."Removal of the cryoprotective medium can be performed there [the laboratorysetting], without harm to the units:  clonogenic activity and viability remainessentially unchanged, even if removal of diluted DMSO is delayed for severalhours," wrote Rubinstein et al.Removing DMSO eliminates its unfavorable side effects on the recipient(Stroncek et al., Transfusion, 1991;31:521-526; Davis et al., Blood,1990;75:781-786)."These improvements make frozen PCB a more effective source of stem cells forunrelated marrow reconstitution in the treatment of inherited disease andhematologic malignancy and, potentially, for recombinant DNA-based genetherapy," wrote Rubinstein et al.The same procedure to minimize loss of viability might be used in thecryopreservation process for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem andprogenitor cells.  It also may be possible to remove malignant cells or tointroduce chemical or genetic labels into cells before infusion.Numerous advantages in using PCB as donor tissue for unrelated bone marrowrestoration have been reported, including timely availability of PCB topatients and lower frequency of certain infections, as described in an earlierpublished review (Rubinstein et al., Blood, 1993;7:1679-1690).Another significant advantage of PCB grafts is their remarkably lowerincidence of associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause ofmorbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (Sullivan,in Bone Marrow Transplantation, eds.  Forman, Blume & Thomas, 1994, Blackwell,Boston, pp.  339-362).In February 1993 the New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Project startedcollecting PCB units to study the clinical usefulness of this source of stemcells (Rubinstein, Blood Cells, 1994;20:587-600).  Of the 24 patients whoreceived PCB grafts before February 26, 1995, 12 still were alive and doingwell as of March 30, 1995.  None of the recipients developed clinically severeGVHD within follow-up periods of 2 to 18 months.This work was supported in part by Grant HL 48031 from the National Heart,Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and by grantsfrom Baxter Health Care and Citibank.The corresponding author for this study is Pablo Rubinstein, Laboratory ofImmunogenetics, Lindsley F.

The ACTG Patient CareCommittee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed thestudy."Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successfulclinical trials," Klebert said.Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in thestudy.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size orpatient demographics from participating institutions.Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies usedby a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment andretention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision ofpeer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision ofsupport groups was negatively correlated with success.More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier torecruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successfulrecruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combineprimary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minoritypatients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was notassociated with poor recruitment or retention.The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too manydrugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability ofalternative drugs.Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improvepatient recruitment and retention:*  Combine primary care and research visits.*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.*  Provide transportation to the study site.*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.*  Design studies to address retention problems.*  Study identified problem sites in detail. - by Daniel J. DeNoon, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Emerging DiseasesCould Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animalsare imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) researchers warn.Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only oneor two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domesticanimals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recentprograms to vaccinate wild animals.This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention programcosts an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expensesper year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recentpublication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public HealthConcern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidentalor intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise theanimal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from variousspecies of bats."Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccinefailures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter ofpotentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequentlyestablished in susceptible bat populations."Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically relatednegative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are therhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and someisolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was firstisolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outsideIbadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, CentralAfrican Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented humaninfections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, inNigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, andEthiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginalprotection.* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but issuspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, SouthAfrica who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by abat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is aEuropean insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human casewas documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus hasbeen found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have beenidentified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again aEuropean insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus wasfirst identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of arabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domesticanimals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection."The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New Worldmitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy batswithout human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, severalrecent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer ofrabies-infected bats."These events include:* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in researchfacilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosedwith rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild bigbrown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died ofrabies.* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on acontainer ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permitsin 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptiantomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or theiroffspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions orzoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normallysubjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported batsto prevent contact with humans."Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the areathat extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in awide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction withother Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolonhelvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of thesespecies have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa."The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern becauseof the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,particularly in the southern United States."Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to theUnited States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior toEuropean colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxesfor the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillancerevealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 humandeaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but theywere then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infectedanimals from southern states.Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies haschanged.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after aknown exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in peoplewho had no history of an animal bite."Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that wasunrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has alsochanged:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involvedrabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after theepizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state."The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probabilityof rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote."What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account thepsychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequenteuthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the UnitedStates, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue stronglyagainst population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programsfor wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC."Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is anintegral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabiesincidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for humanrabies."However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required anextensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective forfoxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes."In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine wasdeveloped that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons andvarious other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improvedthermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote."When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact withthem by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate speciesexamined."An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, NewJersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baitslaced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and byhelicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantlyreduced.Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there aremany questions yet to be answered:* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabiescontrol in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?* Who will fund these programs over time?* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue ofextending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing worldwill be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.The following CDC researchers contributed to this report:  Charles E.Rupprecht, V.M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Rabies Section; Jean S.

DeNoon, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1EncephalitisMicrosphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis VaccineMouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against adeadly form of viral encephalitis.Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the familyTogaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infectionsduring epizootics among horses.The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidaddonkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans andanimals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidencesuggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuatedvaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEEvirus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported theirresults in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses toVenezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20)."The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responseswhich were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virusvaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was moreeffective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective againstsystemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as ameans of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to seethe potential benefits of this technology."Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number ofinoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oralvaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieveimmune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center forImmunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,January 1994;12(1):5-11).Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams haveshown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effectivevehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered eithermucosally or systemically.Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe inhumans.Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEEvirus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that offree virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yieldedanti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received asecond booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stablethroughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane onlyin mice boosted with free virus."At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared witheither methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducingspecific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondaryimmunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processedmicrospheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary andsecondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced theimmunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during themicroencapsulation procedure."In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better thannon-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres."Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior tomicroencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhancedthe immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhancedconformational stability," they wrote.In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survivedchallenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received thefree virus vaccine survived challenge."At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccinesafforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigenresulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival ina second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote."These results, taken together with the protection results after secondaryimmunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicatethat a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could affordprotection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the freevirus vaccine."The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulatedVEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosolchallenge with virulent VEE virus.The corresponding author for this study is Suzanne M.

They used sera collectedfrom an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia and comparedserologic results with established DNA markers of cervical HPV-16 infection.Serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator ofpersisting cervical HPV-16 infection, based on data from the study.The study included 688 individuals with continued normal cytology (controlgroup) and 152 patients with confirmed incident squamous intraepitheliallesions.  The patients were tested for DNA of a broad spectrum of HPV types atthe beginning of the study and at follow-up."Of controls, 16.6 percent were seropositive compared with 30.8 percent and52.4 percent of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively," wroteWideroff et al.  "Seropositivity increased from 22.2 percent in subjects whowere HPV-16 DNA positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment orfollow-up) to 83.3 percent in those who were HPV-16 DNA positive at both timepoints."Because the potential validity of any HPV serologic marker depends on howvalid an indicator it is of exposure to viral antigens, it is essential to payclose attention to establishing the marker's validity before it is used as aclinical or research tool, the authors noted.HPV of differing genotypes encode a range of capsid and nonstructural proteinsthat are immunogenic in the infected individual, and efforts to characterizethe host immune response to the antigens have targeted, in part, onestablishing in human sera the prevalence of anti-HPV antibodies.Challenges associated with culturing HPV to obtain viral antigens bytraditional methods have lead to the development of alternative antigensources in order to perform host immune response studies.  Wideroff et al.noted that such sources include recombinant bacterial fusion proteins,synthetic peptides and virions produced in xenograft and raft systems.  Emptycapsids, referred to as VLPs, serve as another source of antigen.  VLPsself-assemble in eukaryotic cells that are infected with HPV expressionvectors, such as baculovirus (Kirnbauer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,1992;89:12180-12184; Rose et al., J Virol, 1993;67:1936-1944; Hagensee et al.,J Virol, 1993;67:315-322; Kirnbauer et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6929-6936).Previously reported research studies have demonstrated that self-assembledHPV-16 L1 plus L2 VLPs, expressed in insect cells via baculovirus vectors, arecapable of detecting anti-HPV-16 IgG antibody in serum by ELISA (Kirnbauer etal., J Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-499; Galloway, J Natl Cancer Inst,1994;86:474-475)."In epidemiologic applications, serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs could be auseful end point biomarker in studies to determine risk factors for HPVtransmission," wrote Wideroff et al.  "It could also be considered an exposurebiomarker to assess immunologic risk factors for HPV-associated disease or asa surrogate for viral infection itself when biologic samples are unavailablefor DNA testing."The HPV serologic marker also could be beneficial as a surveillance tool forestimating the population prevalence of HPV-16 exposure and to inspectgeographic variation and time trends in HPV associated infection, they added.The HPV-16 serologic assay has been patented by contributing authors J.Schiller, R.

Hemolink isderived from screened and tested blood that is outdated because it has beenstored for more than six weeks.Hemosol takes the expired blood, separates out the red blood cells andextracts the hemoglobin.  That's more complicated than it sounds.  "A red cellis not just a package of clean hemoglobin," Adamson says.  "It contains about90 different proteins."  The company heat-treats the hemoglobin to destroy anycontaminating viruses that may have eluded the screening process conducted bycollection agencies.  Other remaining proteins are then removed by a noveldisplacement chromatographic process.The process strips away blood-group antigens and other proteins, so Hemolinkcan be used by all patients regardless of blood type.  And the purificationsteps make the likelihood of transmission of diseases such as HIV andhepatitis "virtually" nil, according to Adamson."The reason we say 'virtually,"' he notes, "is because scientifically it isimpossible to prove total absence of a virus," but he is very confident thatHemolink would pose no threat to users in terms of blood-borne diseases.  Inaddition, the blood from which Hemolink is derived is already approved foruse; the company does not accept contaminated units.After purification, the free hemoglobin is cross-linked with oxidizedraffinose, a sugar molecule.  This "improves the ability of the freehemoglobin to deliver oxygen to tissue, stabilizes each hemoglobin moleculeand links together several such molecules so that they are large enough tocirculate for extended periods," Adamson says.Human trials with Hemolink show the blood substitute circulates for a coupleof days in the blood stream - compared with a month or more for transfused redcells - and is then excreted, says Adamson.  But animal trials show this islong enough to counteract oxygen shortages during acute blood loss, say, in anaccident or an operation.  In fact, these trials showed that animals treatedwith Hemolink did just as well as those treated with transfusions of theanimals' own blood.Hemosol is currently working with two versions of Hemolink, one a fluid storedin a refrigerator and one frozen.  Either formulation would be suitable forsurgical applications.  A long-term goal is to develop a freeze-driedformulation.  It would be light enough to ship to remote depots - for use indisasters or military conflicts, for example - and it could be reconstitutedwith sterile water on-site.Adamson believes the cost for Hemolink would be competitive, noting that thereare significant administrative costs associated with the existing bloodcollection and distribution system.  These include the storage, transport,disposal and other labor and record-keeping activities that a successful bloodsubstitute would significantly reduce.  Also, since no cross-matching would berequired, these costs would be saved.Hemolink also would avoid some of the costly problems associated with bloodtransfusions - such as transmission of disease (ranging from HIV or hepatitisto a bacterial infection), or mismatched blood (where the patient might have areaction to antigens in the donor's blood that could be mild, such as a fever,or severe, resulting in death), or the delays in surgery brought about byblood shortages.Hemosol will not rely just on Hemolink to launch itself in this market.  Thecompany is collaborating with Ronald Kluger, a chemistry professor with theUniversity of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to further extend cross-linkingtechnologies for second-generation products.Adamson says the work also is aimed at chemically modifying hemoglobin so itcan serve as a carrier for drug molecules.  Tissues that can accumulate andmetabolize protein-drug conjugates are potential targets.  An example is asolid tumor.  Adamson says this would reduce many of the side-effects ofanti-tumor agents.A large-scale conversion from red cells to blood substitutes is unrealistic,particularly in the short term, Adamson says.  But assuming they win approval,blood substitutes could ultimately bring in big money.  Industry estimates ofthe potential market for blood substitutes (and newer applications where redcells can't be used) by the year 2002 are around 1.5 million units (worthUS$500 million) in North America, and over three million units worldwide,Hemosol says.Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Blood Substitutes) PEG-Hemoglobin Cleared for Multi-Dose/Multi-Center Trial in Cancer Patients Enzon, Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey, announced that it has received clearancefrom the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin a multi-dose,multi-center clinical trial of its hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier,PEG-hemoglobin, in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.The study, in patients with various advanced solid tumors, will primarilyevaluate safety related to multiple doses of PEG-hemoglobin and, secondarily,tumor response to the combination therapy of radiation and PEG-hemoglobin.There are two million cases of cancer diagnosed annually, according to theAmerican Cancer Society.  Approximately 800,000 of these cases involve solidtumors which are now treated with radiation.  By delivering oxygen,PEG-hemoglobin should sensitize solid tumors which may enhance response toradiation therapy.  This process, termed "radiosensitization", may provide acombination treatment of solid tumors, which is more effective than radiationtherapy alone.The FDA, in a "Points to Consider" bulletin, suggested that the oxygenation ofsolid tumors would be important supportive evidence for clinical efficacy ofhemoglobin-based oxygen carriers.  In response to that bulletin, Enzonscientists have developed a clinical program focused on radiosensitization.The company believes that PEG-hemoglobin is the only hemoglobin-based oxygencarrier in clinical development for this indication.Pre-clinical studies conducted at Enzon, Harvard University's Dana FarberCancer Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the University of Wisconsin,Veterinary School of Medicine, demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin enhanced theeffectiveness of radiation therapy and significantly reduced tumors in bothimplanted animal models, as well as animal patients exhibiting spontaneoustumors.In February 1995, Enzon initiated a safety study with PEG-hemoglobin in 28healthy volunteers.  The maximum dose administered was equivalent to 1.5 unitsof whole blood.  The study, which was completed in September 1995,demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin in its active form, circulates in the bloodfor approximately eleven days.Patients will receive a once-a-week dose of PEG-hemoglobin for each five daysof radiation treatment during a three-week therapy program.  The dose levelwill be dependent on body weight, but will be significantly less than thehighest dose used in the previous safety study.  The company also believesthat a sufficient amount of PEG-hemoglobin remains in the blood to properlyoxygenate tumors and optimize radiation therapy during the five day course oftreatment."This approval represents a significant advancement in our PEG-hemoglobinprogram," stated Peter G.  Tombros, Enzon's president and chief executiveofficer.  "We have worked closely with the FDA to develop this protocol."At this time, Enzon will dedicate its manufacturing capability exclusively tothe production of PEG-hemoglobin to produce additional clinical materials andcomplete commercial process development.  The existing facility at the presentscale is adequate to supply all PEG-hemoglobin needed for clinical trials upto FDA approval.Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Joint Venture)Anticancer Drug Licensing/Research Agreement SignedBristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, and EntreMed, Inc.,Rockville, Maryland, announced an agreement in which Bristol-Myers Squibb willobtain exclusive worldwide licensing rights to antiangiogenic compounds now indevelopment by EntreMed, Inc.Antiangiogenic therapies, which have been shown in preclinical studies toprevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels, have the potential to blockthe growth of primary and metastatic cancers by eliminating a tumor's bloodsupply.Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has made an equityinvestment in EntreMed and will fund a five-year research collaboration in thearea of angiogenesis and its application in the treatment of cancer.  Inreturn, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain worldwide licensing rights to therecently discovered antiangiogenic applications of the drugs thalidomide,thalidomide analogs and Angiostatin protein, which have generated considerableinterest in the medical community.Angiostatin is a novel protein which may suppress malignant tumor formation byinhibiting the growth of blood vessels.  In preclinical trials, it hassuccessfully caused the regression of primary human breast, prostate, andcolon tumors in animal models.Thalidomide, developed as a sedative, has not been approved in the U.S., andit was originally associated with birth defects.  However, if it is shown tobe an effective antiangiogenic therapy in humans, it has the potential tobecome a significant anticancer agent.  There are currently no antiangiogenicproducts approved for the treatment of cancer.Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, M.D., director of theSurgical Research Laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,and professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Folkman was thefirst to observe that cancerous tissues are fed by newly-grown blood vesselssprouting from existing arteries.He theorized that if doctors could prevent these blood vessels from growing,then the tumor would starve.  Since Children's Hospital has a sponsoredresearch agreement with EntreMed, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain firstrefusal rights on any antiangiogenic technologies developed in Folkman'slaboratory and licensed by EntreMed.It is expected that the first clinical trials to test the antiangiogenicproperties of these compounds in cancer will begin in 1996.  EntreMed hasalready initiated clinical trials with thalidomide in the treatment ofblindness due to age-related macular degeneration, another angiogenicdisorder.Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Joint Venture)Marketing Agreement Announced for Cancer TestBiomira Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and Immunex Corporation, Seattle,Washington, announced a co-promotion agreement for Truquant BR RIA, Biomira'sblood test for the detection of recurrent breast cancer.As part of this co-promotion plan, Polymedco Inc., Cortlandt Manor, New York,will continue as Biomira's exclusive distributor for this product in the U.S.Biomira's Truquant BR in vitro test kit has recently received an approvableletter and is awaiting marketing clearance from the U.S.  Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), which is expected during the first quarter of 1996.The Truquant BR kit is the first and only blood test clinically proven to be asignificant and independent predictor of recurrence of breast cancer in womenwith Stage II and Stage III disease.

Other changes reflect a more critical look atthe balance of harms and benefits of screening tests now in wide use.  Thereport also reaffirms many of the disease and injury prevention practicesrecommended in 1989.In accepting the report from the Task Force, Philip R.  Lee, M.D., AssistantSecretary for Health, noted that "Effective disease and injury prevention isour most efficient tool for improving our health status as individuals and asa nation.  This report, like its predecessor, moves us further towardprevention that works."The ten-member Task Force rejected the traditional emphasis on a standardizedannual physical examination as an effective tool for improving the health ofpatients.  Instead, they emphasized that the content and the frequency of theperiodic health exam need to be tailored to the age, health risks andpreferences of each patient.The panel recognized the proven benefits of specific measures such as periodicscreening for high blood pressure and cervical cancer, scheduled vaccinations,and counseling about tobacco, alcohol and other lifestyle issues.  Incontrast, the Task Force found little evidence of important benefits fromother tests often included in routine check-ups, such as blood tests fordiabetes, thyroid diseases or anemia, chest X- rays, electrocardiograms andurine tests.According to Task Force Chair, Dr.  Harold C.  Sox, Jr., Chair of Medicine atDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, "Our review affirms the effectiveness of avariety of preventive interventions, many of which are underutilized inroutine practice.  At the same time, other widely used preventive practices,many of which are costly and some of which are even dangerous, show little orno evidence that they improve health.  We based our recommendations on thescientific evidence.  All too often, the evidence was too weak for us to makea strong recommendation.  We need to strengthen the evidence on which ourprevention practices rest."Although none of the recommendations depended on cost, the Task Force notedthe considerable cost of the widespread use of many unproven tests andprocedures, such as routine electrocardiograms in healthy adults andultrasound scans in low-risk pregnancies.The Task Force included specialists in family medicine, internal medicine,obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and preventive medicine.  Over 30outside experts in medicine, nursing, public health, epidemiology, and healthpromotion and education also contributed to the project.The Task Force assessed more than 6,000 studies of over 200 differentinterventions for more than 70 diseases and conditions.  These included 53screening tests (for cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic and nutritionaldiseases, infectious diseases, vision and hearing disorders, prenataldisorders, congenital disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, mental disordersand substance abuse); 11 counseling topics ranging from promoting seat beltuse to preventing tobacco use; immunization against 12 common childhood andadult diseases; and the use of aspirin and postmenopausal hormones to preventdisease.The report draws several broad conclusions about effective preventive care:* Counseling patients about personal health practices (smoking, diet, physicalactivity, drinking, and injury prevention and sexual practices) remains one ofthe most underused, but important, parts of the health visit.* Preventive services offered by the clinician should be tailored to thespecific behaviors and risk factors of individual patients, not offered as astandard "routine checkup" given to all patients.* Patients should share in decisions about preventive services.  Theirpersonal preferences are important in determining an approach to preventionthat is optimal for them as individuals.  This is especially true when theevidence of benefit is weak.* Doctors and nurses should try to deliver prevention messages and servicesduring every encounter with their patients, especially for high- risk patientswho are often the least likely to see clinicians for routine checkups.The following are examples of new or revised recommendations:* In favor of flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or annual fecal occult blood testingto screen for colorectal cancer.* In favor of targeting routine screening for high cholesterol and other lipiddisorders to men aged 35 to 65 and women 45 to 65, and others at increasedrisk for heart disease.* Against routine screening for prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen(PSA) or digital rectal examination.* Against routine urine tests for early detection of bladder cancer orasymptomatic urinary tract infection.* In favor of daily multivitamins with folic acid for all women who can becomepregnant (to prevent neural tube defects).* In favor of routinely vaccinating all newborns, children, adolescents andyoung adults against hepatitis B.* In favor of routine vaccination of children against chickenpox.* In favor of counseling parents of young children on measures to reduce therisk of household and recreational injuries.* In favor of discussing the use of estrogen therapy with all postmenopausalwomen.To order a printed copy of the "Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 2ndEdition," contact the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.  Government PrintingOffice, at 202-512-1800; the Stock No.  is 017-001-00525-8 and the single copyprice is $35 (shipping included).Questions relating to the scientific content of the "Guide to ClinicalPreventive Services, 2nd Edition" should be addressed to Carolyn DiGuiseppi,M.D., M.P.H.  or David Atkins, M.D., M.P.H.  at 301-594-4015.Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Tissue BankingStorage of Tissues Leads to Ethical DilemmasIf you've ever had a biopsy, do you know what happened to that sample of yourown tissue after the tests were completed?  There is a possibility that, evenwithout your knowledge, it ended up in a "bank" where human tissue and fluidsare collected for future use.As Dr.  Eike-Henner Kluge of the University of Victoria in British Columbia,Canada, told the 1995 International Chemical Congress of Pacific BasinSocieties, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995, "If I get hold ofyour DNA, I know a lot about you, and in fact, I can identify you.  Is it aninvasion of privacy?  Kluge answers that laws regarding the protection ofprivacy never looked at this area, because it didn't exist at the time thelaws were enacted."Yet from a healthcare perspective, the establishment of a human tissue bankcan be very beneficial.  Kluge asserts that with a proper collection policyfor a tissue bank, "observations at the cellular level over a period of time,starting with base-line studies, will allow you to identify health issuesbefore they reach an acute stage of toxicity.  We're beginning to seeecological changes that reflect themselves in the tissue changes in humanbeings."Although tissue banks have existed in several countries for several decades,the collection policy is quite haphazard.  "There is no organized way ofgetting this data," Kluge contends, "or integrating the data and then doingsomething with it.  We really don't have a handle on it at the human level atall."Getting a handle on the commercial impact may be even more difficult.  Klugepoints to one case where "cancerous liver cells were used to develop a strainof biological products where the profit after expenses runs into the billionsof dollars."  When a state court was asked to settle the cell ownershipquestion, it ruled in favor of the physicians who had developed the commercialventure rather than the individual who had been the source of the cells.To Kluge, the problem "is very simple.  We have no international law dealingwith the collection, disposition, and use of human tissue and fluids in thesebanks.  And no country has any law that really nails down who may have accessto it, who may use it for what uses, who has ownership and who has right ofdisposition."As a medical ethicist and former Director of Ethics and Legal Affairs of theCanadian Medical Association, Kluge contends that "one has to look at theethics to try and develop some guidelines which are not only national, butalso international, because once the banks are established, the transfer oftissue and fluids is international.  One then has to deal with differentcultures, different legal systems, and different kinds of perspectives of whatis appropriate and what is not appropriate."According to Kluge, there are two possible approaches.  One of them is at theUnited Nations level, "which gives rise to international conventions wheresubscribers are bound by the regulations of the convention."  Another is a"professional code of ethics, where violators would be subject to professionalsanctions."Kluge's approach is not to look at existing law, but to look at the ethics ofthe situation, especially in terms of who owns the tissue.  In a sense it is afoundational approach which might be used as a model independent of the legaltradition."  One option that Kluge intends to explore is to "work the relevantethical considerations into trade agreements, as was done with medicalinformatics requirements in the European Economic Community.

Collaborators on theexperiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneeringAIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University ofPittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division ofCellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadtdiscovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates therisk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfullyfights transplant rejection.Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that theuninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow torestore the patient's immune function.The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change thepractice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanentacceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver aswell as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matchingor prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmunediseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and mayultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-speciestransplantation).Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Diagnostics"Complications of Anticoagulant Therapy:  CT Findings."

The mean (+/-SD) age ofthe patient population was 43.5 +/- 10.8 years of which 60% were male.  Theroute of transmission was considered to be parenteral drugs in 56%, previousblood transfusions in 32% and various non-parenteral routes in 13%.  RESULTS:The mean histologic activity score of the group as described by Desmet et al.was 3.5 +/- 0.8 and fibrosis score 1.5 +/- 0.4.  The extent of inflammationcorrelated with fibrosis (r=0.72).  By multivariate stepwise regressionanalyses, the AST emerged as the most important predictor variable ofhistologic activity (P<0.00001).  When overall histologic activity wasseparated into-portal inflammation, piecemeal necrosis and lobular activity,significant correlations existed between AST values and portal inflammation(P<0.0001) and piecemeal necrosis (P<0.005) but not lobular activity (P=0.9).A strong correlation was also observed between AST values and the extent ofhepatic fibrosis (P<0.0001).  On the other hand, ALT values did not correlatewith histologic activity but did correlate with the extent of hepatic fibrosis(P<0.01).  There were no significant correlations between age, gender, routeof transmission, steatosis or alcohol consumption with the extent ofhistologic activity or fibrosis.  In conclusion, AST values correlatewell-with two of three features of hepatic inflammation and with the extent ofhepatic fibrosis.  These findings suggest that AST values should be consideredin decisions regarding the need for liver biopsy and treatment in patientswith chronic hepatitis C viral infections."Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Diagnostics"What Serologic Tests are Necessary Before a Liver Biopsy in Patients withHepatitis C (HCV)?."  P.G.  Quinn, D.E.  Wheeler, M.M.  Jamal and A.Sonnenberg.  Departments of Medicine and Pathology, University of New Mexico(UNM), Albuquerque, New Mexico.According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meetingof the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "Before undergoing interferon therapy forinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), patients usually undergo a liverbiopsy and multiple serologic tests to rule out other liver diseases.  In 93HCV patients, the clinical and economic implications of omitting the serologictests in HCV were examined.  METHODS:  Over a period of two years, 93consecutive patients entered the study.  Entry criteria were elevated serumtransaminases (ALT and AST), positive serum test for HCV by ELISA or RIBA, anda liver biopsy.  Special stains assessed iron overload and alpha-1 antitrypsin(AI AT) deficiency.  All patients had serum tests for ferritin, iron (Fe),iron binding capacity (TIBC), A1AT, ceruloplasmin, and/or anti-nuclearantibodies.  The costs of each test were based on the current UNM feeschedule.  RESULTS:  None of the patients showed an abnormal test forceruloplasmin or A1AT.  Five patients had a ferritin value >800 ng/ml, butonly two patients also had elevated iron saturation (Fe/TIBC >65%).  The twobiopsies, however, did not contain increased iron and so were not consistentwith hemochromatosis (HC).  None of the other liver biopsies showedhistopathologic changes consistent with HC, Wilson's disease, orMAT-deficiency.  Testing costs were:  Fe/TIBC $39.25, ferritin $61.50,ceruloplasmin $33.50, and A1AT $30.50.  The expense for these tests totalled$164.75 per person.  Therefore, $15,321.75 represents the potential savings inthis population of 93 patients.  CONCLUSION:  If a pre-treatment liver biopsyis deemed necessary to assess liver pathology in an HCV patient, serologictesting for HC, Wilson's disease and A1AT deficiency seems redundant and notindicated, since the presence of any of these diagnoses is readily assessed byliver biopsy with special stains.  The minor downside to this suggestedstrategy is the need send fixed tissue for iron quantitation if the iron stainis suggestive of hemochromatosis."Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Diagnostics (HCV)"HCV-Viremia in Serum and Liver Tissue of Anti-HCV Positive Subjects:Correlation with ALT and Liver Histology."

All the subjects were comparable for age (47 yrs, range 32-63)and sex (F/M:  6/9 and 7/8).  HCV-viremia was assessed on serum and livertissue according to the following method.  The most conserved region (5') ofHCV-RNA retrotranscribed and amplified with outer primers and cloned.  To thisproduct the middle 70 bp of exogenous DNA were added and different dilutionsof this longer product were used for competitive PCR.  Liver tissue HCV-RNAwas significantly correlated to serum HCV-RNA in 'symptomatic' patients(M:10(6) copies of genome/ml, range 10(3)-10(9) vs.  M:10(5) copies ofgenome/ml,range 10(2)-10(8); r=0.627 P<0.01).  No significantly correlationwas rather found in 'Asymptomatic' subjects.  No difference in HCV-RNA tissuelevels was detected between the two groups whereas serum HCV-RNA levels weresignificantly different (M:10(2), range 750-10(7) copies of genome/ml vs.M:10(5), range 10(2)-10(8) copies of genome/ml P<0.01).  Liver histology wascomparable in the two groups and ALT serum levels significantly related toHCV-Viremia.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  We analyzed HCV genotype and RNAtiter in 33 volunteer blood donors, 19 with persistently normal and 14 withraised ALT levels.  Seventeen donors with normal ALT and all donors withraised ALT underwent liver biopsy and evaluation of the histological activityindex (HAI).  RESULTS:  Genotype 2 was detected in most donors with normalALT, whereas genotype 1 was more frequent among donors with raised ALT(P<0.01).  HCV RNA titer, determined by competitive PCR, was higher in donorswith raised ALT than in those with normal ALT (median 8.2 log copies/ml, range6.1-8.85, vs median 7.4, range 4.95-8.6, P=0.01).  The scores for portalinflammation and for fibrosis in the HAI were higher in donors with increasedALT (P<0.05 and P<0.01).  HCV genotype had no statistical relationship withRNA titer; or with liver histology.  The score for periportal necrosis wascorrelated with the viral titer (P<0.01).  CONCLUSION:  Both the infectinggenotype and the levels of hepatitis C virus replication were independentlyassociated with the ALT profile.  The severity of portal inflammation andfibrosis was higher in donors with raised ALT, and the rate of viralreplication was correlated with the degree of periportal necrosis."Back to Headline List CopyrightBLOOD WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Epidemiology"Liver Biopsy Discloses Occult Chronic Viral Hepatitis 'C' (HCV) in YoungAsymptomatic Blood Donors in Southern Brazil."

B.V.  Skryabin and C.  Schmauss.Department Psychiatry and Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Mt.  SinaiSchool of Medicine, New York, New York.According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meetingof the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,California, "Successful gene targeting by homologous recombination is largelydetermined by the relative frequency of homologous vs.  nonhomologousrecombination events.  A widely used selection method for homologouslyrecombinant ES cells is a positive-negative selection (PNS) which typicallyinvolves the placement of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene outside of thetargeted homology and the addition of antiviral drugs to the ES cell-selectionmedia.  However, the toxicity of such drugs (ganciclovir or FIAU) is thoughtto impair the ability of ES cells to colonize the germ line.  An alternativeto the use of antiviral agents in conjunction with G-418 for PNS is todestabilize only that portion of the neomycin phosphotransferase II mRNA thatderives from random integration sites (positive selection).  We have targetedthe dopamine D3-receptor gene locus in mouse ES cells with 5 differentreplacement targeting vectors.  Four vectors contained one of the followingsequence elements that are thought to destabilize the neomycin-resitance-gene(neor) transcript:  1) a poly (A(+)) less neorcassette; 2) a neor ribozymewith proven catalytic activity; 3) a mutant ribozyme placed outside of thetargeted homology (control); and 4) an antisense neor sequence.  A controlvector contained the TK gene placed outside of the targeted homology.  Ourinitial results indicate that these strategies are effective alternatives tothe selection with antiviral agents.

We prospectively monitored the histological progression ofchronic HCV infection in untreated asymptomatic patients using serial twoyearly liver biopsies.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Sixty five asymptomatic HCVRIBA positive blood donors (48 male, 17 female, median age 37 years) referredfrom the Blood Transfusion Service were investigated.  Forty had an overtparenteral risk factor for HCV exposure - 36 IVDU, 4 prior transfusion.  Allwere HCV RNA+ve.  Seventeen patients (26%) had normal initial transaminases.Median ALT was 48iu (range 9-440, normal <30), AST 48iu (range 14-200, normal30iu).  Liver biopsy was recommended for all patients, and histology wasscored (without reference to clinical details) according to a modified Knodellhistological activity index (HAI, maximum possible score 13).  63 patients hadan initial biopsy:  median HAI=2, mean HAI=2.8, range 08, none cirrhotic.When HAI>=6 (9 patients), treatment with alpha interferon was recommended.When HAI<6 (54 patients), interferon was not used but 2 yearly follow-upbiopsies were recommended.  To date, 29 biopsies have been repeated inuntreated patients - 16 deteriorated, 4 improved, 9 unchanged.  In re-biopsiedpatients median HAI increased from 2 to 3.

There are potentialadvantages in replacing some of this plasma with a synthetic medium.  In thisstudy, our major goals were to define the optimal ingredients and theirconcentrations in such a medium and to gain insight into the mechanism bywhich each ingredient confers benefit.  In addition, we wished to validate anew polyvinyl chloride container plasticized with di-n-decyl phthalate (DnDP)for PC storage.  PC derived from donations of whole blood were stored for 7days in autologous plasma or a basic synthetic medium (BSM) containing 15mmol/L glucose, 21 mmol/L citrate, and physiologic concentrations of saltsother than bicarbonate within either the DnDP container or a licensedpolyolefin container, PL-732.  Metabolic events were characterized and a panelof in vitro tests were used to monitor platelet quality as systematic changesin the BSM were made.  Platelet quality was at least as good, if not better,after storage in DnDP in comparison to PL-732.  pH consistently decreased toless than 6.0 because of inadequate buffering of lactic acid in BSM alone.However, pH and the in vitro tests were well maintained by either the serialaddition of bicarbonate (BSM + B) or the addition of at least 15 mmol/Lacetate and 10 mmol/L phosphate (BSM + AP).  The benefits of BSM + AP weretraced to a decrease in lactic acid production by 33% and 19% relative toplasma and BSM + B, respectively, and the vigorous oxidation of acetate (0.66+/- 0.09 mmol/d/10(12) platelets).  The rates of lactate production andacetate consumption were similar and the pH during storage correlated with thedifference between the two rates, suggesting that acetate oxidation has analkalinizing effect equivalent on a molar basis to the acidifying effect ofproduction of lactate and a hydrogen ion.  When pyruvate replaced acetate, itwas also metabolized vigorously (0.52 +/- 0.06 mmol/d/10(12) platelets), Itspresence suppressed lactic acid production by 44% relative to BSM + B andallowed maintenance of pH and platelet quality similar to what is achievedwith acetate.  The results strongly suggest that the benefit from acetate (orpyruvate) is derived from its oxidation and the use of a hydrogen ion duringthat oxidation.  For reasons that are not yet clear, the omission of phosphateresulted in pH decrease to less than 6.0 in 3 of 9 PC even with acetatepresent.  The results allow for a more complete definition of the minimalessential ingredients of an optimal medium relative to the amount of plasmacarried over into the PC.  With less than 20% plasma carry-over, 15 mmol/Lacetate, 14 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L phosphate, and 5 mmol/L citrate produceexcellent results.  After 7 days of storage in such a medium, the results ofin vitro tests reflecting platelet quality were at least as good as, if notbetter than, results after storage in plasma."

We performed a retrospectivereview of the eye bank charts of 2,382 corneas evaluated by the MinnesotaLions' Eye Bank between December 1, 1992 and November 30, 1993.

Six hundred and sixty of the corneas whichwere excluded from transplantation (40%) were excluded for a donor aged over75 years.  Three hundred and ninety-one corneas (24%) were rejected because ofa contraindication in the donor's past ocular or medical history.  Another 395corneas (24%) were excluded for poor tissue quality.  The most common reasonfor exclusion of tissue based on tissue quality was abnormalities seen onspecular microscopic examination (200 corneas).  Of interest, only 14 corneaswere rejected for low endothelial cell counts.  This review of our tissueevaluation process has led us to reevaluate and change our policy regardingexclusion of corneas for epithelial defects and arcus senilis.  These datasuggest that further evaluation of the abnormalities seen on specularmicroscopic examination and their validity as exclusion criteria should beundertaken.  Other areas for further evaluation are how to improve thetimeliness of tissue procurement and whether excluding all tissues over age 75years and all postsurgical eyes is valid."

Peripheralblood samples were collected in the recovery room and at 6 hourspostoperatively for all 13 patients.  A standard enzyme-linked immunosorbencyassay was done to quantify tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha,interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 levels in the samples.  At 6 hourspostoperatively, the levels of cytokines were elevated significantly in theperipheral and drainage blood serum.  In particular, the drainage blood serumhad the most dramatic increase for all cytokines, which was significant.Reinfusion of unwashed filtered postoperative wound drainage blood has beenshown not to be entirely benign; pyrogenic transfusion reaction is the mostcommonly reported adverse effect, but hemodynamic instability with hypotensionand even myocardial infarction have been reported.  The cause of these adverseevents has not been defined clearly, but may be secondary to the infusion ofcytokines.  The present study showed the presence and significant elevation ofthe cytokine levels in the wound drainage blood.  A comprehensive review ofthe literature revealed that unwashed drainage blood is a relatively diluteblood product lacking normal clotting factors and having numerous otherundesirable components that may mitigate against its routine use in lieu ofpredeposited autologous or homologous blood.  This is of interest becausethere is evidence indicating that wound drainage blood reinfusion may beunnecessary in total joint arthroplasty when autologous blood is available.Use of drains in this surgery also may be unnecessary and has been shown toincrease the amount of blood loss and the need for transfusion."

PointerJr.'s Dec. 22 order approving the revised global settlement ofbreast implant claims.  In re Silicone Gel Breast ImplantsProducts Liability Litigation, No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S (ND AL); Lindsey et al. v. Dow Corning Corp. et al.,No. CV 94-P-11558-S; see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter,Nov. 28, 1995.     The plaintiffs contend that Order No. 27 is void onprocedural grounds and violates the plaintiffs' substantive legalrights.     The original $4.2 billion global settlement, approved byJudge Pointer in 1994, collapsed when many more women thanexpected sought benefits.  The new settlement, which includesdefendants Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter Healthcare, MinnesotaMining & Manufacturing, McGhan Medical Corp. and Union Carbide,calls for lower payments and includes more restrictive criteriathat claimants must meet to qualify for benefits.  However, thepayment levels set forth in the new settlement will not beaffected by the number of women who seek benefits.     Under the new agreement, eligible participants are domesticclass members who have had at least one implant manufactured ordistributed by one of the settling defendants or theirpredecessors or subsidiaries.  There are no provisions forforeign claimants under the settlement, nor are children ofimplant recipients eligible to participate with regard to theirown personal injury claims.  Claimants who previously opted outof the original settlement have until Dec. 16, 1996, to withdrawtheir exclusion and to register with the Claims Office.     In his order, Judge Pointer said, "The Court concludes that,for eligible participants, this revised settlement programreduces the amount of 'ratcheting' that would otherwise occurunder terms of the Settlement and that, for persons not eligibleto participate, it preserves their rights under the Settlement toopt out and, indeed, by providing some options to continue andextend the suspension of statutes of limitation and repose, itpartially enhances those rights."     In a separate order also issued Dec. 22, Judge Pointerapproved a question-and-answer booklet and list of implant brandnames that will be distributed as part of the notice program toall claimants who have given their names and addresses to thecourt, whether they are currently members of the Lindsey class orhave opted out of the original settlement.     The five plaintiffs seeking to overturn the order areChristina Johanna Adelaar, Johanna Maria Jagt-Hamerslag, KathyLambert, Maria Engelhart-Nelissen and Nancy Pulcini.  Accordingto the motion, four are citizens of foreign countries and are noteligible for benefits under the revised settlement, and the fifthis a member of the Lindsey class who claims she will be preventedfrom obtaining a prompt settlement of her claims if she opts out.     The plaintiffs object that Judge Pointer issued the ordersua sponte, without a motion by any party, contrary to Rule 60(b)of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Further, the plaintiffsassert, they are entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the1994 order approving the global settlement is revised or vacated.Finally, they argue, Order No. 27 is void because appeals fromthe 1994 order are before the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,which must grant leave for the order to be modified.     Order No. 27 violates the Fifth Amendment and equalprotection rights of the foreign plaintiffs, who were eligiblefor benefits under the original settlement and who have reliedupon the 1994 order, the plaintiffs say.     The motion was filed by Sybil Shainwald of the Law Officesof Sybil Shainwald in New York City.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996DOW CHEMICAL'S MOTIONFOR RECONSIDERATION ISDENIED BY JUDGE POINTER     Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr.'s order denying Dow Chemical'smotion for summary judgment on claims that it should be heldliable for alleged illnesses caused by Dow Corning's manufactureof silicone gel breast implants will stand, the judge ruled in aDec. 26 order denying Dow's motion for reconsideration.  In reSilicone Gel Breast Implants Products Liability Litigation,No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S (ND AL); see BreastImplant Litigation Reporter, Aug. 8, 1995.     Judge Pointer originally granted Dow Chemical's motion,saying that the company had no special knowledge of allegedhazards of Dow Corning's implants that would obligate DowChemical to warn end users of the implants.  Dow Chemical andCorning, Inc. are the sole shareholders of Dow Corning.     However, Judge Pointer later vacated that order, finding newevidence of Dow Chemical's involvement in the testing ofsilicones that Dow Corning used in implant products.  DowChemical sought reconsideration, contending that it performedonly two tests on a silicone compound for Dow Corning, and thatneither test involved suitability for medical implants.     In his order, Judge Pointer said his ruling should standbecause there is no new evidence or change in the law that wouldwarrant vacating it.  He rejected Dow Chemical's claims that theissue should be whether Dow Chemical specifically tested breastimplants, not just raw silicone, and that holding Dow Chemicalliable would violate public policy.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996COURT DISMISSES SEVENCANADIAN SUITS FORFORUM NON CONVENIENS     Seven suits filed in the United States by Canadian women whoreceived breast implants in Canada were dismissed Dec. 26 fromthe multidistrict litigation in Alabama on the basis of forum nonconveniens.  In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants ProductsLiability Litigation, No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S(ND AL).     U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. cited the reasonsgiven in his April 25, 1995, order dismissing nearly all casesfiled by foreign plaintiffs, including two suits filed byCanadian citizens (see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter,April 28, 1995).     The seven suits are: Ellis et al. v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.et al., No. CV 93-P-14114-S; Pollyck et al. v. Baxter HealthcareCorp. et al., No. CV 94-P-14115-S; Davis et al. v.

McGhanMedical Corp et al., No. CV 94-P-11335-S; and two plaintiffs fromMcIver et al. v. Dow Corning Corp. et al., No. CV 94-P-14600-S.The suits were initially filed in Texas state court, removed tofederal court and ultimately transferred to the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of Alabama, which is overseeingall federal breast implant litigation.     In his April 25 order, Judge Pointer found that foreignclaimants from Canada, Australia and England have adequateremedies available to them in their own court systems, andtherefore may not file suit in the United States.     Judge Pointer's most recent order contains the sameconditions as the April 25 order with respect to the defendants,namely that:     " Each defendant will submit to jurisdiction in Canada andaccept service of process there;     " Each defendant will be bound to pay any final judgmentagainst it;     " If raising a statute of limitations defense, thedefendants will not include the period the suit was pending inthe United States; and     " The defendants will not object to offered evidence thatwould be admissible in a U.S. court.     Judge Pointer also said his order is without prejudice toplaintiffs filing proofs of claim in the Dow Corning bankruptcy.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996DOW DEFENDANTS, 3MFILE REPLY BRIEFSWITH SIXTH CIRCUIT     Transfer of cases against Dow Corning's shareholders, DowChemical and Corning Inc., to the Eastern District of Michiganwill not bring breast implant litigation against the shareholdersto a grinding halt as breast implant plaintiffs claim, DowCorning and the shareholders told the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals in a Dec. 11 reply brief.  In re Dow Corning Corp.;Lindsey v. O'Brien, Tanski, Tanser and Young et al., Nos. 95-2034, 95-2106, 95-2082, 95-2084, and 95-2107 (6th Cir.); seeBreast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.     In a separate brief, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.contended that the appellees are raising "red herring" issues toconfuse the court into ignoring the substantive issues.     Earlier, the law firm of O'Quinn, Kerensky, McAninch &Laminack, representing some 2,000 women who have opted out of theglobal settlement of breast implant claims, argued that DowCorning Corp. is using a ruse to get cases against its non-bankrupt parents transferred to the Eastern District ofMichigan.     In a separate brief, the firm argues that 3M, Bristol-MyersSquibb Co. and Baxter Healthcare Corp. are not entitled to havetheir cases transferred.     Dow Corning Corp., one of the numerous defendants named inbreast implant lawsuits, filed for bankruptcy protection last Mayin the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michiganand sought transfer of the cases against it to the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Co-defendants namedin lawsuits with Dow Corning also sought transfer, arguing thattheir cases are "related to" the Dow Corning bankruptcy.  U.S.District Judge Denise Page Hood ruled on Sept. 12 that her courtdoes not have jurisdiction over breast implant claims againstnondebtor defendants.  The manufacturers appealed to the SixthCircuit.     "Dow Chemical and Corning, Inc., not being in bankruptcy,had no right to the benefits of the bankruptcy procedures," theplaintiffs argue.  "Their lawyers, knowing this, filed no motionto transfer because as non-bankrupt companies they had nostanding to file such a motion.  Thus, they got their subsidiary,Dow Corning, to do it for them.  This ruse should not work.These efforts to smuggle a transfer order for Dow Chemical andCorning, Inc., should be rejected for the same reasons that themotions to transfer filed by Bristol, Baxter and 3M should berejected."     Responding to the arguments of 3M, Bristol-Myers Squibb andBaxter, the plaintiffs contend that these companies are seekingunprecedented court action that has never been allowed in anymass tort bankruptcy case, including the asbestos-relatedbankruptcies and the bankruptcy of intrauterine device maker A.H.Robins.     In addition, the plaintiffs contend, the companies' appealscan be interpreted as seeking relief they never requested fromJudge Hood " the transfer of all breast implant cases againstthem, not only cases in which Dow Corning is a co-defendant.     Finally, the plaintiffs contend the manufacturers areimproperly seeking de novo review of Judge Hood's decision,ignoring their burden of showing that Judge Hood's factualfindings were clearly erroneous.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996SIXTH CIRCUIT BRIEFS, PART II     Dow Corning, Dow Chemical and Corning Inc., in their replybrief, reiterate their argument that transfer is necessary sothat claims against Dow Corning and the shareholders can be kepttogether and pretrial proceedings can take place in an organizedand efficient manner.  Transfer is not an attempt to shield DowChemical and Corning from tort liability, they argue.     Responding to arguments raised by a group of Californiaplaintiffs, the Dow defendants argued that Judge Hood did not "as the plaintiffs claim " remand the cases to state courtherself, but she merely advised the various federal courts to doso when the cases returned to them.  For that reason, they alsofound fault with the California plaintiffs' argument that theappeals court lacks jurisdiction because orders remanding casesto state courts are not appealable.     Finally, Dow Chemical and Corning contend that, contrary toappellees' arguments, they have standing to appeal.     3M, in its reply brief, contends that the appellees areattempting to divert the court's attention from the real issueswith arguments that transfer is a ruse to thwart breast implantclaims.  It is the plaintiffs' bar, not the nondebtor defendants,who are trying to take "improper tactical advantage " of the DowCorning bankruptcy, 3M asserts.     "Appellees' arguments on this appeal are further belied byone inescapable fact " it was the plaintiffs' bar that filedactions naming the Nondebtor Manufacturers and DCC as jointtortfeasors in the breast implant lawsuits," 3M states.  "It wasthe plaintiffs' bar that pursued the tactic of suing all of theManufacturers jointly and severally, asserting in many cases thatwomen had received implants from multiple manufacturers and thatthe Manufacturers had allegedly conspired to withhold from womeninformation concerning the alleged health risks of such implants.It is thus remarkable that Appellees now argue that the breastimplant claims they chose to assert against the NondebtorManufacturers and DCC on a theory of joint and several liabilityhave somehow become unrelated cases that should be triedseparately now that DCC is in reorganization."

In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.);see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.     Hearings on the insurance settlements were conducted onseveral dates in early December, but were continued pendingapproval of the settlement with HMR and Dow Chemical.     Dow Corning is seeking court approval of settlementagreements with Zurich Insurance Co. and Zurich InternationalLtd.; TIG Insurance Co. and certain other insurers; the LondonMarket Insurers; National Casualty Co.; Arab Insurance Co.;Federal Insurance Co.; North River Insurance Co., United StatesFire Insurance Co. and International Surplus Lines Insurance Co.(the North River Insurers); Algemene Verzekering MaatschappijDiligentia N.V. Te Amsterdam; and Ludgate Insurance Co.     HMR and Dow Chemical are named co-insureds on some of thepolicies issued by these companies.  They objected to theproposed settlements, arguing that any disbursements to DowCorning would reduce the amount of coverage available to them andthat the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to approvesuch a settlement.     Dow Corning says it has reached a settlement that willresolve the objections of HMR and Dow Chemical.  According to theDec. 27 motion, HMR will relinquish any claims to the insurancepolicies that compete with Dow Corning's breast implant claims,in exchange for payments of 2% to 2-1/2% of funds recovered byDow Corning or Dow Chemical under the policies.  HMR will alsodrop its objections to the pending insurance settlements, as wellas the previously approved Hartford and Royal settlements, whichare now on appeal.     The settlement between Dow Corning and Dow Chemical callsfor establishment of an escrow fund that will contain theproceeds of cash settlements between Dow Corning and the insurersfor policies in which Dow Chemical is a co-insured.  Theagreement calls for limits on disbursement of the funds ordetermination of rights to the funds until after Dow Corning'sChapter 11 plan of reorganization is confirmed, and sets theconditions under which Dow Corning and Dow Chemical can accessthe funds to pay claims.     Dow Corning's motion was filed by Barbara J. Houser, CraigJ. Litherland and David P. McClain of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay inDallas.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996TORT COMMITTEE SEEKS TODISQUALIFY KIRKLAND &ELLIS AS DCC COUNSEL     Kirkland & Ellis must be disqualified from representingdebtor Dow Corning Corp. because the firm's simultaneousrepresentation of Dow Chemical Co., one of Dow Corning's parents,poses a "significant and unacceptable" conflict of interest, theOfficial Committee of Tort Claimants argued Dec. 27 in a motionfiled with the bankruptcy court in Bay City, MI.  In re DowCorning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.).     The committee says Kirkland & Ellis (K&E) was approved bythe bankruptcy court as special counsel to the debtor under 11U.S.C. Section 327(e), based in part on its assurance that itssimultaneous representation of Dow Chemical would not be aconflict of interest.  Now, however, the committee claims,"recent developments have illustrated that K&E's representationsare no longer correct."     First, the committee argues, K&E is representing both DowCorning and Dow Chemical in the insurance coverage litigation inthe bankruptcy court and in Michigan state court.  The twocompanies are attempting to access the same policies, under whichthey are co-insureds " Dow Chemical for claims relating to itsSarabond building material and Dow Corning for breast implantclaims, the committee says.  Allowing one company's claims willnecessarily deplete assets available to the other, the committeestates.     The committee also notes that the two companies are takingconflicting positions on liability for breast implant claims: DowCorning argues that Dow Chemical should share any liability,while Dow Chemical contends that Dow Corning alone isresponsible.     Most recently, the committee states, K&E, in its role as DowChemical's counsel, is preparing to depose Dow Corning employeeswhose depositions the firm defended in the breast implantlitigation.     "The Debtor appears remarkably sanguine about the prospectof its own principal defense counsel in effect litigating againstit on issues with a potential billion-dollar impact on theestate," the committee says.  "...Since the Debtor seemsincapable of policing such conflicts, it is appropriate for theCommittee, as fiduciary for significant interests in the estate,to bring the issue before the Court."     The Tort Claimants Committee is represented by Alfred S.Lurey and Dennis S. Meir of Kilpatrick & Cody in Atlanta; MarvinE. Frankel, Kenneth H. Eckstein and Jeffrey S. Trachtman ofKramer, Levin, Naftalis, Nessen, Kamin & Frankel in New YorkCity; and Lenard M. Parkins and Patrick L. Hughes of Verner,Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand in Houston.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996OBJECTIONS FILEDTO PROPOSED MAY 1BAR DATE     The Official Committee of Tort Claimants, the OfficialCommittee of Unsecured Creditors, Minnesota Mining andManufacturing Co., Medical Engineering Corp. and Bristol-MyersSquibb Co. (the MEC defendants), Baxter Healthcare Corp. andBaxter International, and several Blue Cross/Blue Shield healthplans all filed responses in the Bay City, MI, bankruptcy courtDec. 19 and 20 to Dow Corning's proposed bar date of May 1, 1996.In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.); see BreastImplant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 12, 1995.     Dow Corning on Dec. 1 filed a motion seeking a deadline ofMay 1, 1996, for filing proofs of claim against its bankruptcyestate, and seeking court permission to use claim forms thatdiffer from the official forms.  In addition, the company filedits proposed plan to notify all potential creditors and personalinjury claimants of the deadline.Tort Claimants Committee     The Tort Claimants Committee contends that a bar date forbreast implant claims will waste assets of Dow Corning's estatewhile providing no new or useful information.     "A bar date for these claims would be expensive, costingalmost $7 million for the Debtor's proposed notice program andundoubtedly many millions more for the processing and review offiled claims, and would delay this case for many months," thecommittee states.  "A breast implant bar date would improvidentlycut off the claims of many thousands of Breast Implant Recipientswho could far more effectively be reached by notice at a laterand more appropriate stage in the reorganization."     The value of breast implant claims can be calculated usingcurrently available information, the committee says.     Setting a bar date for non-breast implant product liabilityclaims is also "unwarranted and prejudicial," the committee says.     "[I]t appears that the principal effect of such a bar datewould be to bar prematurely the great majority of as-yet-unmatured Other Product Claims, whose holders would have littleincentive in the circumstances to file proofs of claim.  Theproblem is compounded by the onerous and intrusive evidentiaryrequirements that the Debtor seeks to impose on Other ProductClaimants at the proof of claim stage " the effect of which wouldbe to deter most claimants from filing."     Such a scheme violates Bankruptcy Rules 3001(a) and (c),which require that the official form be used by all creditors,the committee states.     The committee also argues that the May 1 date will coincidewith the notice to breast implant claimants regarding therecently approved revised global settlement, which will result inconfusion and deter women from filing proofs of claim.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BAR DATE OBJECTIONS, PART II     The committee also objects that:     " no provisions are made for notice to foreign claimants;     " there are no provisions for maintaining the     confidentiality of information required to be disclosed on     the Breast Implant and Other Product claim forms;     " the Breast Implant claim form does not advise women with     non-Dow Corning implants that they may have a claim against     Dow Corning as a supplier of the silicone gel used in the     implant; and     " the definition of "Other Products" is vague.Unsecured Creditors Committee     Although the committee said it does not object to the ideaof a bar date being set at some point, it said a bar date is notnecessary now and will substantially delay the bankruptcyproceedings.     A bar order is neither required for either discharge underSection 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code nor for an estimationproceeding under Section 157(b), the committee argues.     The committee also objects that the proposed legalnotification program is "totally unwarranted" because othernotice will have to be given in the case " specifically, noticeof the confirmation hearing.  In addition, the committee contendsthat Dow Corning has not submitted the actual content of thenotification program for court approval, leaving the court unableto judge whether the program meets legal standards.     With respect to the Canadian notification program, thecommittee notes that the bankruptcy court does not have power toenforce the automatic stay outside the borders of the UnitedStates.  The committee, therefore, says the notification toCanadian claimants should specify that Canadians who file proofsof claim in the bankruptcy are precluded from pursuing suits inthe Canadian court system, and conversely that pursuing a lawsuitwill prevent participation in the bankruptcy.     Finally, the committee objected to certain aspects of DowCorning's proposed claim forms.The MEC Defendants     The MEC defendants complained that although they expect tofile claims against Dow Corning for contribution for cases inwhich they are found to be jointly and severally liable, it isunclear which claim form they are required to file " the BreastImplant Claim Form or the Commercial Claim Form.     The MEC defendants also noted the absence of any referenceto potential claims against Dow Corning as a supplier of gel.     "The MEC Defendants respectfully submit that additionalcategories must be added to the Breast Implant Claim Form toaddress the Debtor's liabilities arising from the supply of gel,"they stated.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BAR DATE OBJECTIONS, PART III     Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing     3M also objected to Dow Corning's proposed claim formsystem, because the proposed forms "do not appropriately orsufficiently provide for the type and nature of the claims that3M intends to assert," the company said.     In addition, 3M argued that the definition of "breastimplant" should be expanded to include all breast implants,whether manufactured by Dow Corning or another company.  Such amove is necessary, 3M explained, "in order to address theuniverse of claims that have been asserted jointly against DCCand 3M, including, for example, multiple implant claims andconspiracy claims."     3M said it takes no position at this time on theestablishment of the May 1 bar date or on Dow Corning's proposednotice program.Baxter Healthcare     Baxter also seeks modification of the breast implant claimform to include reference to women who may have claims againstDow Corning as a gel supplier.     The form "cannot be fairly completed, much less verifiedunder penalty of perjury, by (a) a claimant who is unaware of theidentity of her implant manufacturer, (b) a claimant who isunaware of the identity of the gel supplier or even (c) aclaimant who knows that DCC manufactured the silicone gelcontained in an implant manufactured by another company."     Baxter also says the notice program should inform women thatnon-Dow Corning implants may contain Dow Corning gel.Blue Cross/Blue Shield Health Plans     Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, Blue Cross and BlueShield of Alabama, Blue Shield of California, and Blue Cross andBlue Shield of Minnesota said they agree with the Tort ClaimantsCommittee that setting a bar date for breast implant claims ispremature.     The health plans also contend that Dow Corning has made noprovision for their filing proofs of claim.  They say they have aright to be reimbursed for payments made to each of their memberswho has received breast implant-related services, regardless ofwhether the member files a proof of claim against Dow Corning.

In reDow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.).     The plaintiffs argue that they are only seeking to liquidatetheir claims, not execute on them.  Once the claims areliquidated, they say, the claims will become subject tobankruptcy court jurisdiction as core proceedings.     The plaintiffs are those whose cases were originally filedin the New York Supreme Court or the U.S. District Court for theSouthern District of New York and consolidated before the Hon.Joan B. Lobis for pretrial coordination and discovery.     The plaintiffs' suits are currently unliquidated claims overwhich the bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction, the plaintiffsstate.  After the claims are reduced to judgment, they will beconsidered liquidated claims and will fall under bankruptcyjurisdiction as core proceedings, they say.     The plaintiffs argue that they are now "burdened with acontinuing 'stay' of all litigation unless plaintiffs agree todismiss Dow Corning with prejudice from all their actions.  SinceJudge [Sam C.] Pointer [overseeing the multidistrict litigationproceedings] will not allow plaintiffs to proceed with anylitigation unless they agree to forfeit their rights against theDow Corning bankruptcy estate, plaintiffs have no recourse but toseek relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay so their lawsuitscan move forward."

Inre Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.)     Dow Corning states that, in 1992, a "leading Americanuniversity" began a study of the structural integrity and rupturerate of breast implants.  The study's methodology includescomparing Dow Corning implants that have been explanted fromtheir recipients with new, unused samples of DCC implants thatwere manufactured in the same lots as the explants.     Dow Corning had no role in initiating or establishing thestudy's protocol and has no rights with respect to the results,Dow Corning states.  The company also says that donating theimplants to the study would be consistent with pre-bankruptcydiscovery orders issued by various courts relating topreservation/non-destruction of evidence.

In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.);see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.               On Nov. 21, Dow Corning filed a motion relating to a classaction pending in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,Harrington v. Dow Corning Corp. et al., No. C954330.  All of theapproximately 15 other defendants have agreed to extend thelimitations period from Dec. 31, 1995, the date provided for inthe British Columbia Class Proceedings Act, until April 30, 1996.However, Dow Corning said, its bankruptcy filing and theassociated automatic stay raised a question as to whether thecompany could unilaterally enter into such a stipulation.     The Canadian court had planned to hold a hearing Dec. 13 oncertifying the class with respect to Dow Corning; that hearingwas continued until next year.  All of the other defendants,citing the need for more time to prepare for the certificationhearing, stipulated to the extension.

Judge Spector found the relief requested was appropriate.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996CANADIAN SUPREME COURTUPHOLDS DCC'S LIABILITYIN BREAST IMPLANT SUIT     Dow Corning is liable for failing to warn a patient of thepossibility that her breast implant could rupture as a result ofnormal, everyday activities, a 5-2 majority of the CanadianSupreme Court ruled Dec. 21.  Dow Corning Corp. v. Hollis,No. 23776 (Canadian Sup. Ct.).     The majority said Dow Corning could have met that duty bywarning the surgeon who performed the implantation, but failed towarn the doctor.  The dissenting opinion said the patient shouldbe required to prove that the doctor, had he been properly warnedby Dow Corning, would have passed the information on to her.     In 1983, Susan Hollis had two gel-filled, low profile, roundSilastic implants, manufactured by Dow Corning, implanted by Dr.John R. Birch to correct breast abnormalities.  At a later date,another surgeon removed the implants and found that one of themhad ruptured but there was no evidence of the silicone envelopethat had surrounded the ruptured implant.  Subsequently, Hollisunderwent bilateral subcutaneous mastectomies and immediatereplacement with saline implants.     Hollis filed suit, claiming that Dow Corning was negligentin the manufacture or design of the implant that ruptured andnegligent in failing to give adequate warnings to the medicalprofession or the public of the possibility that the implantscould rupture.  She claimed that Birch had been negligent infailing to warn her of the risks of implant rupture and that thesecond doctor had been negligent in failing to exercise adequatecare to prevent implant rupture during explantation.               Following an 18-day trial, the trial judge found that DowCorning was negligent in the manufacture of the implant; that itwas unnecessary to decide whether Dow Corning was negligent infailing to warn adequately; that neither doctor had beennegligent; that Birch was under no duty to warn Hollis of thepossibility of implant rupture; and that there was no contract ofsale and purchase between Birch and Hollis with respect to theimplants.     Hollis was awarded C$95,000 for non-pecuniary damages, pastloss of income and for future loss of income.     On appeal, the Court of Appeal found lack of evidence forthe conclusion that the implant rupture was caused by DowCorning's negligence.  However, it found that Dow Corningpossessed relevant information with respect to the risk ofrupture that it did not make available to the medical community.The court reversed the dismissal of the negligence action againstBirch, ordered a new trial and dismissed Hollis' cross-appealthat the damages award was inordinately low.     On appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, the sole issue waswhether Dow Corning is liable to Hollis because it failed to warnBirch.     The majority first found that Dow Corning was under a dutyto warn of the risks of unexplained ruptures at the time Hollisreceived her implants.  It noted that Dow Corning had at thatpoint received between 48 and 61 reports of unexplained ruptures,but that it did not begin warning doctors of this phenomenon foranother two years.     Next, the majority said Dow Corning could have escapedliability, if it had adequately warned Birch, under the learnedintermediary doctrine.  Dow Corning contended that it should notbe liable unless Hollis could prove that Birch, had he beenproperly informed of the rupture risk, would have passed theinformation on to Hollis.  However, the majority rejected thiscontention, finding that it would require the plaintiff to provea hypothetical situation.     "It is clear from the record that Ms. Hollis' right toinformed consent was not respected in this case," the majoritysaid.  "We know that Dow's failure to warn was a cause of herinjury; whether Dr. Birch's actions in the hypothetical situationposited by Dow might also have been a cause is not a matter forMs. Hollis to prove."     The appropriate test, the majority said, is a subjectivetest: would Hollis have gone ahead with the implant surgery ifshe had been adequately warned, not the objective test of what a"reasonable woman" would have done.  The majority found thatHollis proved she would not have had the surgery if she had beenwarned.Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996HOLLIS, PART II     "Simply put," the majority stated, "I do not think amanufacturer should be able to escape liability for failing togive a warning it was under a duty to give, by simply presentingevidence tending to establish that even if the doctor had beengiven the warning, he or she would not have passed it on to thepatient, let alone putting an onus on the plaintiff to do so.Adopting such a rule would, in some cases, run the risk ofleaving the plaintiff with no compensation for her injuries.  Shewould not be able to recover against a doctor who had not beennegligent with respect to the information he or she did have; yetshe also would not be able to recover against a manufacturer who,despite having failed in its duty to warn, could escape liabilityon the basis that, had the doctor been appropriately warned, heor she would not have passed the information on to the plaintiff.Our tort law should not be held to contemplate such an anomalousresult."     The dissent first said that use of the subjective test isimproper because it fails to account for the "inherentunreliability of the plaintiff's self-serving assertion."     "It is not simply a question as to whether the plaintiff isbelieved," the dissent said.  "The plaintiff may be perfectlysincere in stating that in hindsight she believed that she wouldnot have consented to the operation.  This is not a statement offact that, if accepted, concludes the matter.  It is an opinionabout what the plaintiff would have done in respect of asituation that did not occur....  In evaluating the opinion, thetrier of fact must discount its probity not only by reason of itsself-serving nature, but also by reason of the fact that it islikely to be colored by the trauma occasioned by the failedprocedure.  For this reason, the most reliable approach indetermining what would in fact have occurred is to test theplaintiff's assertion by reference to objective evidence as towhat a reasonable person would have done."     Next, the dissent said that "well established tortprinciples" require Hollis to prove that her injuries would nothave occurred had Dow Corning properly warned Birch.     "In other words," the dissent said, "Ms. Hollis must showthat her doctor would have warned her of any dangers that hadbeen brought to his attention and that if warned she would haverefused the operation.  Absent this form of proof, it cannot besaid with any degree of certainly that the failure of Dow to warnphysicians was the cause of the unfortunate injuries suffered byMs. Hollis."

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. v. Thies et al.,No. 95-1075-JE (D OR).     Magistrate Judge John Jelderks of the U.S. District Courtfor the District of Oregon granted a motion by defendant attorneyMichael L. Williams and his firm, Williams & Troutwine, P.C., todismiss 3M's claims for declaratory relief, negligence andintentional interference with the company's economic advantageand business relations.     Judge Jelderks, however, denied the defendants' motion todismiss 3M's claim alleging that the defendants breached theircontractual agreement not to disclose the amount of a proposedsettlement.     The present litigation involves a settlement reached between3M and defendant Marjorie A. Thies over injuries Thies allegedlysuffered from her 3M breast implants.  Williams served as herattorney in that action, which was settled in June 1995.  Underthe terms of the agreement, Thies was to receive a certain sum ofmoney by July 11, 1995.  Thies and her attorneys allegedly agreednot to disclose the amount of the settlement.     3M filed the present action on July 25, 1995, alleging thatThies and her attorneys breached the confidentiality provision ofthe settlement by disclosing the amount of the agreement.  Thecompany also claimed that Williams & Troutwine intentionallyinterfered with 3M's prospective economic advantage and businessrelations in connection with the silicone gel implant productsliability litigation by disclosing the amount of the settlement.     Williams & Troutwine moved to dismiss the suit, arguing thatdismissal was appropriate pursuant to the abstention doctrine inYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  The firm also said thesuit should be stayed under the abstention doctrine in ColoradoRiver Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800(1976).  3M's claims for failure to state a claim upon whichrelief can be granted should also be dismissed, the firm argued.     In his opinion, Judge Jelderks concluded that the courtshould abstain from considering 3M's claim for declaratoryjudgment, but should not abstain from considering the remainderof the company's claims.     "The most important element of this claim " the assertionthat 3M is not obligated to pay the Thieses in accordance withthe settlement agreement " was necessarily considered, andrejected, in state court proceedings," the judge said.  "Reviewof that conclusion is now pending in the Oregon appellatesystem."     Under these circumstances, Judge Jelderks said, theprinciples of comity and federalism underlying in the Youngerdecision favor abstention from consideration of 3M's first claim.     "Oregon has an important interest in providing a forum forthe final resolution of issues raised, and decided, in the firstinstance in its judicial system," the judge said.  "The state hasan important interest in providing that forum without concernthat duplicative litigation in a federal court might yield adifferent result or otherwise put in question the finality ofstate court judgments."Back to Headline List CopyrightBREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996THIES, PART II     In concluding that abstention from consideration of 3M'sfirst claim is appropriate, Judge Jelderks said the state has animportant interest in determining whether parties haveconclusively resolved the issues giving rise to litigation in itscourts, and in providing the appellate forum in which theconclusions of its trial courts are tested.     However, the judge said that Younger abstention is notappropriate as to the balance of 3M's claims because these claimsraise issues that the state court was not required to reach indeciding whether to grant the Thieses' motion for summaryjudgment on the supplemental complaint.     "There is neither an action pending in state court involvingall of the parties involved in this federal action, nor a pendingstate proceeding in which 3M can pursue those claims notinevitably addressed by the state court's conclusion that 3M wasnot excused from performing its obligations under the settlementagreement," Judge Jelderks said.     The judge also held that Colorado River abstention isinapplicable to the present litigation because no concurrentstate court action joins all the parties in the presentlitigation.  In Colorado River, the court concluded that federalcourts should sometimes abstain from exercising jurisdiction whenconcurrent state proceedings are pending.     Judge Jelderks accepted the defendants' contention that 3M'snegligence claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claimupon which relief may be granted.  Citing Hale v. Groce, 304 Or.281, 284, 744 P.2d 1289 (1987), the judge said a party is notordinarily liable for negligently causing strictly economic harmto another.     "Oregon cases simply cannot be read as imposing upon counselor their clients some special duty to further the economicinterests of the adverse party," Judge Jelderks said.  "Hale doesnot support 3M's position."     The judge accepted the defendants' argument that 3M failedto state an actionable intentional interference claim because itcannot plead the requisite business relationship, and because itcannot plead or prove that any alleged interference stemmed froman improper motive.     "Having reviewed Oregon cases discussing this tort, as wellas the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) and relevanttreatises, I am convinced that 3M does not have the kind ofbusiness or professional relationship with those allegedlyinjured by its products that is protected by an intentionalinterference cause of action," Judge Jelderks said.     Representing 3M was William B. Crow and Jeffrey D. Austin ofMiller, Nash, Wiener, Hager & Carlsen of Portland, OR.Representing Thies was William A. Gaylord of Gaylord & Eyerman,P.C. in Portland.

These findingssuggest that RAS peptide vaccination of cancer patients with a verified rasmutation might be used as a specific immunotherapy.Marianne K.  Gjertsen et al.  vaccinated pancreatic cancer patients exhibitinga ras mutation with a synthetic RAS peptide in an effort to influence theclinical course of the disease ("Vaccination with Mutant RAS Peptides andInduction of T-Cell Responsiveness in Pancreatic Carcinoma Patients Carryingthe Corresponding ras Mutation," The Lancet, November 25,1995;346(8987):1399-1400)."Results indicate that specific T-cell responses against mutations uniquelyharbored in tumor cells can be induced in cancer patients by vaccination,"stated Gjertsen et al.Five patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreaswith ras mutations were enrolled in this clinical trial.  Peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (1-4x10(9)) were collected by leukapheresis and loaded witha synthetic RAS peptide encompassing residues 5-21 of p21 RAS andcorresponding to the mutation in the patients tumor tissue.Patients were vaccinated on day 0 and boosted on days 14 and 35.  Additionalboosters were given every 4-6 weeks.  None of the patients exhibited any toxicreactions or side-effects after vaccination.None of the patients exhibited T-cell responsiveness to any of the RASpeptides tested before the protocol started, although they showed normalT-cell responses against other test antigens.  Two of the five patientsexhibited T-cell response to RAS peptides in their peripheral bloodmononuclear cells around day 40 after the onset of the vaccination protocol,noted the authors.The T-cell response was transient, and disappeared during the following weeks.Repeated vaccinations did not result in a reappearance of detectableresponding T cells in the peripheral blood.Although puzzled at first by the lack of detectable T-cell response, theauthors determined that the tumor-specific T cells elicited by RAS peptidevaccination were homing to the tumor and being selectively removed fromcirculation.No major therapeutic response was observed in the any of the patients,including the two who exhibited brief T-cell responses.  The authors felt thatthis was due to the terminal stage of the disease in the patients.  All thepatients had large tumor burdens and progressively deteriorating immunesystems, with life expectancies of only three to four months.Tumor tissue taken from the two responding patients after they died showedthat lymphocyte infiltration was prominent and was mainly constituted by Tcells.  This finding was compatible with the explanation that the RAS-specificT cells elicited by the vaccination may have homed in to the tumors of thesepatients, noted the authors.They also noted that vaccination by a single tumor-specific epitope may not besufficient in these circumstances as the therapeutic vaccine may have been toolittle, too late.  Ongoing studies in patients with minimal residual diseasecould provide a clinical setting allowing for more careful evaluation ofimmune responses and the potential for clinical benefits of RAS peptidevaccine, noted the authors."Our method for vaccination is novel," concluded Gjertsen et al.  "We injectedlarge amounts of peptide-pulsed mononuclear cells.  The rational is that afraction of these cells (i.e., pulsed dendritic cells and monocytes) will endup in lymphoid organs, where the actual T-cell stimulation will take place.Two and three rounds of vaccination seemed to be sufficient to break the stateof unresponsiveness to the mutant RAS peptides in [the two] patients [whoresponded]."This study was an extension of preliminary research done by these same authorswhich was presented at the International Symposium on Cancer Vaccines, heldOctober 3-5, 1994.  At that time, they stated "Our results indicate thatimmunotherapy targeted against neoplastic cells carrying ras mutations ispossible, and a protocol based on loading professional antigen presentingcells with synthetic RAS peptides is currently being tested in a clinicalsetting."This research was supported by the Norwegian Cancer Society, the NorwegianResearch Council for Science and the Humanities, and Pronova, Norway.The corresponding author for this study is Dr.  Gustave Gaudernack, Sectionfor Immunotherapy, Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Immunology,Montebello, N-0310 Oslo, Norway. - by Michelle MarbleBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Cancer Gene TherapyAdenovirus-Mediated Cytokine Gene Therapy Successful in Murine ModelA murine breast cancer model has exhibited effective tumor suppression withadenovirus-mediated cytokine gene therapy.Separate studies presented at the 4th International Conference on Gene Therapyof Cancer, held November 9-11, 1995, showed effective cancer immunotherapycould be obtained by using of adenoviral vectors to administer the cytokinesinterleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, or IL-12.C.L.  Addison et al.  and J.  Bramson et al.  coauthored separate, but relatedstudies, using a murine mammary carcinoma model to show the effectiveness ofcytokines in cancer immunotherapy."Intratumoral (i.t.)  injection of adenoviral vectors expressing cytokines maybe an effective immunotherapy of cancer resulting in protection frommetastatic disease," noted Addison et al.Polyoma middle T transgenic mice were inoculated with mammary carcinoma cells.Adenovirus vectors were created that expressed either IL-2 (AdCAIL-2), IL-4(AdCAIL-4) or IL-12 (AdmIL.12.1).  After the mammary tumors were palpable, themice were injected i.t.  with the cytokine expressing vectors (one vector perset of mice).Of the animals that received AdCAIL-2, 54 percent underwent complete tumorregression; 53 percent of the mice receiving AdCAIL-4 underwent complete tumorregression; and 29 percent of the mice receiving AdmIL.12.1 underwent completeregression.Although the response rates were similar for the AdCAIL-2 and AdCAIL-4vectors, the kinetics for the regression were markedly different.  Regressioninduced by AdCAIL-2 occurred within four weeks whereas regression followingAdCAIL-4 required eight to 10 weeks, noted the authors.In contrast, animals treated with AdmIL.12.1 exhibited a reduced rate ofcomplete tumor regression in spite of the observation that 100 percent showedsome type of response to the IL-12 cytokine.When the animals that experienced total cure were rechallenged with freshinoculations of tumor, the IL-2 and IL-4 treated animals had a 100 percentresistance rate.  In contrast, the IL-12 treated animals only experience a 66percent resistance rate.The authors suggested reason for IL-12 having a lower response rate was thatalthough it produces potent enhancement of CTL activity, it is a weakstimulator of T cell proliferation.  The reemergence of tumors afterAdmIL.12.1 could have been due to inadequate numbers of responder cells withinthe tumor at the time of rechallenge.Combination of treatment with cytokines that stimulate T cells (i.e., IL-2)could allow for increased and prolonged regression rates, suggested theauthors."Our studies indicate that intratumoral (i.t.)  administration of adenovirusvectors expressing IL-12 alone or in combination with other cytokines will beextremely useful in the treatment of cancer and management of metastaticdisease," concluded Bramson et al.Work by Bramson et al.  on IL-12 was supported by grants from the MRC and NCICanada and London Life Insurance.The authors for both studies can be reached at the Departments of Biology andPathology, McMaster University, Hamilton Ontario, Canada.See the September 25, 1995, issue of Vaccine Weekly for a synopsis of relatedearlier research by Addison et al.  that was published in the August 29, 1995issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 92(18):8522-26. - by Michelle MarbleBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Conference Coverage (ACTG)"New" ACTG Moves ForwardCan the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaurtoo large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - Universityof Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization hasaccomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the TwentiethAIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,D.C.The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs inadults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and formoving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDStherapies.DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of theACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since thechanges took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms werevalid, but also stressed the group's many achievements."We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said."But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is thepreeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together atremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for thetreatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTGefforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way."This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugswork," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combinationtherapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the newprotease inhibitor saquinavir.He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings"to tell us what we need to do."The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  Butmost importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by whichit generates clinical trial protocols."One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving likecivil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processesthat prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult sectionhas only three committees making research decisions.  These three ResearchAgenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and theOpportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - thePharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient CareCommittee - will now be established as standing resource committees withineach of the three main RACs.There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will becentralized control of both resources and laboratories.Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing theACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised ofthe various committee chairs.Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,receiving their funds directly from DAIDS."Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "Ithink this will work very well."But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue tochange."Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," hesaid.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."He called for the active participation of each investigator."Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executivecommittee members," Schooley said. - by Daniel J. DeNoon, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Conference Coverage (ACTG)Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTGMany institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find andkeep study participants.A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsoredclinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet theirpatient accrual goals.The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert andcolleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient CareCommittee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed thestudy."Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successfulclinical trials," Klebert said.Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in thestudy.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size orpatient demographics from participating institutions.Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies usedby a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment andretention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision ofpeer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision ofsupport groups was negatively correlated with success.More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier torecruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successfulrecruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combineprimary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minoritypatients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was notassociated with poor recruitment or retention.The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too manydrugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability ofalternative drugs.Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improvepatient recruitment and retention:*  Combine primary care and research visits.*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.*  Provide transportation to the study site.*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.*  Design studies to address retention problems.*  Study identified problem sites in detail. - by Daniel J. DeNoon, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Drug Development (Antiviral)Virus-Neutralizing RNAs Offer Potential as Antiviral TherapiesAn in vitro selection process of RNA analogs derived from infectious viralparticles turns up elements with antiviral activity.Current drug development techniques are dependent on the discovery of usefulagents.  Compounds with antibacterial or antiviral activity are often foundthrough the empirical screening of synthetic and natural compounds or thelogical design of a drug based on structures of viral and cellular proteins.Unfortunately, empirical screening is tedious and inefficient, and logicaldrug design, although promising, has not produced an abundance of successfulcompounds.Weihua Pan et al.  extended a selection-amplification procedure, previouslyused to isolate RNA and DNA molecules, to target an intact virus in hopes ofdiscovering RNA analogs that could be developed as antiviral drugs ("Isolationof Virus-Neutralizing RNAs from a Large Pool of Random Sequences," Proceedingsof the National Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11509-13)."The isolation of RNAs and RNA analogs that are effective against diverseviral strains will be particularly necessary for inhibiting viruses such asHIV, which has a high mutation rate and readily develops drug-resistantstrains," stated Pan et al.  "Such selection is possible and practical becausea very large structurally diverse library is used and the selection is a rapidprocess."The authors noted that there is great potential to select for molecules thatbind defined targets with high affinity and specificity due to the structuralcomplexity of a combinatorial sequence library of single-stranded RNAoligonucleotides.  Due to technological advances, selected RNA molecules canbe amplified and subjected to further selection.  Multiple cycles of selectionand amplification can lead to the isolation of the best target-binding RNAmolecules from the library.Among the family of Retroviradae (which includes HIV), the rous sarcoma virus(RSV) has been extensively studied.  All Retroviridae viruses are envelopeviruses which use surface glycoproteins to bind to a specific receptor on asusceptible cell and for fusion with the cellular membrane of the host.As a model, the authors chose to target intact RSV in order to isolate the RNAmolecules and the nuclease-resistant RNA analogs that specifically bind andneutralize this virus.RSV was used to demonstrate that antiviral RNA and RNA analogs could besystematically and effectively isolated from a large pool of random sequenceswithout prior knowledge of the structures of the viral proteins.  First, theyused intact viral particles to select from the sequence pool the RNAs and RNAanalogs that bind specifically to the virus.  Then they screened the selectedmolecules for the ability to neutralize the virus."We reason that by binding to virus, some of the selected RNAs and RNA analogsmay change the structures of viral surface proteins so that these proteins canno longer function in steps critical for viral infection, such as viralattachment and virus-cell membrane fusion," stated Pan et al.  "Alternatively,some of the structural changes may trigger pathways to inhibit the steps whichnormally occur after virus internalization, such as the uncoating and theexpression of the virus genome."J.A.  Levy et al.  (Am.  Soc.  Microbiol., 1994;153-158) and N.J.  Dimmock etal.  (Curr.  Top.  Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992;183:1-149) suggested thepossibilities in both of these avenues in some of their earlier work.Using infectious viral particles, RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RAN analogsthat bound and neutralized RSV were isolated from a large pool of randomsequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection.  Because RSV imposespermeation problems, the selected RNAs were targeted to inhibit RSV infectionby binding to the virus surface, and not by entering the virus itself.The sequences chosen completely neutralized the virus at concentrations of0.16 (micro)M.  Of the 19 selected sequences isolated to be concentrated, fiveof them inhibited RSV infection after cloning.  These five RNA and RNA analogsneutralized the RSV by interacting with the virus itself.  They did notadversely affect the host cells used in the in vitro experiments.A potential problem with developing RNA as a therapeutic agent is the rapiddegradation of unmodified RNA by ribonucleases in vivo, noted the authors.They suggested solving this problem by incorporating modified nucleotides intothe RNA chain.The strain of RSV used during the experiments was the Prague A.  After testingthe selected RNAs against a different strain, the Prague C, the authors foundthat the RNA analogs inhibited infection of this strain also, although atconcentrations 15-20 times higher.Future methods of RNA selection could be performed by alternating betweenseveral strains of virus during the different cycles of selection tospecifically isolate the RNAs and RNA analogs that could bind to severaldiverse strains of the virus.  This could be particularly helpful when itcomes to treating viruses with a history of multiple mutations such as HIV,noted the authors.Several advantages were noted by the authors for the use of intact biologicalentities (infectious virus particles) instead of viral proteins:* Selection by intact viral particles does not require the full understandingof all the ways that a virus can infect its host.  If selection is made by anisolated viral protein, the selection is limited to only the cases in whichproteins responsible for viral infection have been identified and isolated.* It avoids the problem of structural differences in purified proteins.Proteins in their purified form may not interact with the protein complexed ona virion.* Selection using intact virus particles may lead to the identification ofviral components previously unknown."The success of isolating numerous anti-RSV RNAs and RNA analogs from a largepool of random sequences immediately suggests the potential application ofthis approach to isolate RNA and nuclease-resistant RNA analogs against otherviruses such as HIV," concluded Pan et al.This research was supported by Pennsylvania State University Start-up funds;National Institutes of Health grant CA47482; American Cancer Society grantFRA427; and funds from the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.The corresponding author for this study is Jin-Feng Wang, Department ofBiochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University College ofMedicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA. - by Michelle MarbleBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Gene DiscoveryScientists One Step Closer To Understanding CancerIn a paper published in the October 1995 issue of Nature Genetics, a team ledby University of Houston (UH), Texas, associate professor Dan Wells announcedthat it had identified a gene associated with multiple exostoses (spurs orbony outgrowths) and associated chondrosarcomas (malignant growths in thecartilage), a form of bone cancer.The gene, located on chromosome eight, causes a loss of control of bonegrowth, and bone spurs begin to grow in unusual places.  Normally these bonespurs are benign, but sometimes they turn malignant and spread rapidly throughthe body, leading to death.  Currently there is no known treatment for thistype of bone cancer."This is the first step in the long journey to finding a cure for multipleexostoses and chondrosarcomas," said Wells.  "Next we have to study the geneand learn why it malfunctions and the exostoses start to grow.  Only then canscientists begin to find a cure and ultimately a way to prevent the unwantedgrowth from occurring."Scientists already know that the defective gene is hereditary and that it is atumor suppressor gene, a type of gene that prevents tumor growth.  In thiscase, it prevents the bones from over growing.The speed with which the gene was discovered was aided by the Human GenomeProject.  Now in its sixth year, this is a 15-year study sponsored by theNational Science Foundation to map all 23 pairs of chromosomes.  Wells and histeam are working on chromosome eight.  In addition, the European Union and theJapanese government are funding similar research.The goal of the Human Genome Project is to determine the complete nucleotide(the basic structural unit of RNA and DNA) sequence of human DNA.  Thissequence of four nucleotides (referred to as A, C, G and T) is the blueprintfor the human organism.  This blueprint will aid in understanding geneticdiseases and in developing treatments and cures.Wells' research is being sponsored by the U.S.  National Institutes of Health(NIH) and the IMB.  The IMB is an interdisciplinary organization of thirteenUH faculty members from the Departments of Biochemical and BiophysicalSciences, Biology, and Chemical Engineering that relies extensively onmolecular biology in individual research programs.For more information on Wells' research, contact him at (713) 743-2671 or theIMB (713) 743-8363.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Genetics (Risk Assessment)Graphs Enable Easy, Accurate Assessment of Breast Cancer RiskA series of graphs can now provide genetic counselors an accurate, easy methodof predicting a woman's absolute risk of developing breast cancer.The graphs are published in the December 1995 issue of the Journal of ClinicalOncology, by University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, researcher John J.Mulvihill, M.D., and Jacques Benichou, M.D., Ph.D., and Mitchell Gail, M.D.,Ph.D., both of the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).The graphs are based on data from the Breast Cancer Detection DemonstrationProject, a large national study that monitored 280,000 women from 1973 to 1980to determine risk factors associated with breast cancer.  The findingsresulted in what is called the Gail model, which predicts breast cancer riskfor Caucasian women being screened for breast cancer based on five factors -age at onset of menstruation, age at first live birth, age at risk evaluation,number of breast biopsies and number of first-degree relatives with breastcancer."Although the Gail model has proven extremely important for research, it isdifficult to use without complex computer calculations.  We wanted to providegenetic counselors a more convenient way to assist women in determining theirabsolute risk of developing breast cancer," said Mulvihill, professor of humangenetics and co-director of the Pittsburgh Genetics Institute at theUniversity of Pittsburgh.  "With proper counseling, these graphs should beinvaluable in helping many concerned women understand their breast cancerrisk."The graphs resulted from the multiplication of three variables that take intoaccount the Gail model risks, together with a term which depends on whetherany breast biopsy has or has not revealed atypical hyperplasia (apre-cancerous condition).  The graphs convert this calculated relative riskinto an absolute risk for a woman of a specific age over a given period oftime.The graphs do not circumvent the need to collect important information fromwomen under evaluation and the need to rule out genetic traits that greatlyalter the risk of breast cancer, according to Mulvihill.  Such traits includerare inherited syndromes that predispose families to cancer and mutations inthe BRCA1 (breast cancer 1) gene.Mulvihill also cautioned that such graphs need to be used in an ongoingprocess of breast cancer screening, counseling and education.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Human Papillomavirus (Diagnostics)Serum Antibody to HPV-16 VLPs Indicates Cervical HPV-16 InfectionSerum antibody to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) virus-like particles(VLPs) could be useful in epidemiology studies and for surveillance.Louise Wideroff, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, and colleaguesevaluated an ELISA to detect serum IgG antibody response to HPV-16 VLPs("Evaluation of Seroreactivity to Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Virus-likeParticles in an Incident Case-Control Study of Cervical Neoplasia," Journal ofInfectious Diseases, December 1995;172:1425-1430).  They used sera collectedfrom an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia and comparedserologic results with established DNA markers of cervical HPV-16 infection.Serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator ofpersisting cervical HPV-16 infection, based on data from the study.The study included 688 individuals with continued normal cytology (controlgroup) and 152 patients with confirmed incident squamous intraepitheliallesions.  The patients were tested for DNA of a broad spectrum of HPV types atthe beginning of the study and at follow-up."Of controls, 16.6 percent were seropositive compared with 30.8 percent and52.4 percent of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively," wroteWideroff et al.  "Seropositivity increased from 22.2 percent in subjects whowere HPV-16 DNA positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment orfollow-up) to 83.3 percent in those who were HPV-16 DNA positive at both timepoints."Because the potential validity of any HPV serologic marker depends on howvalid an indicator it is of exposure to viral antigens, it is essential to payclose attention to establishing the marker's validity before it is used as aclinical or research tool, the authors noted.HPV of differing genotypes encode a range of capsid and nonstructural proteinsthat are immunogenic in the infected individual, and efforts to characterizethe host immune response to the antigens have targeted, in part, onestablishing in human sera the prevalence of anti-HPV antibodies.Challenges associated with culturing HPV to obtain viral antigens bytraditional methods have lead to the development of alternative antigensources in order to perform host immune response studies.  Wideroff et al.noted that such sources include recombinant bacterial fusion proteins,synthetic peptides and virions produced in xenograft and raft systems.  Emptycapsids, referred to as VLPs, serve as another source of antigen.  VLPsself-assemble in eukaryotic cells that are infected with HPV expressionvectors, such as baculovirus (Kirnbauer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,1992;89:12180-12184; Rose et al., J Virol, 1993;67:1936-1944; Hagensee et al.,J Virol, 1993;67:315-322; Kirnbauer et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6929-6936).Previously reported research studies have demonstrated that self-assembledHPV-16 L1 plus L2 VLPs, expressed in insect cells via baculovirus vectors, arecapable of detecting anti-HPV-16 IgG antibody in serum by ELISA (Kirnbauer etal., J Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-499; Galloway, J Natl Cancer Inst,1994;86:474-475)."In epidemiologic applications, serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs could be auseful end point biomarker in studies to determine risk factors for HPVtransmission," wrote Wideroff et al.  "It could also be considered an exposurebiomarker to assess immunologic risk factors for HPV-associated disease or asa surrogate for viral infection itself when biologic samples are unavailablefor DNA testing."The HPV serologic marker also could be beneficial as a surveillance tool forestimating the population prevalence of HPV-16 exposure and to inspectgeographic variation and time trends in HPV associated infection, they added.The HPV-16 serologic assay has been patented by contributing authors J.Schiller, R.

Z-1194 was isolated in Zaire from awoman with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and who also was positive forHIV."We have found that among the 220 women whose sera were tested, almost all whohad a serologic response to one HPV-16 L1 variant also responded to theother," wrote Cheng et al.  "Therefore we conclude that strains 114K andZ-1194 are serologically cross-reactive and likely belong to the sameserotype.  This is the case despite a relatively large number of amino aciddifferences in the major capsid proteins of the two strains."The L1s differed in seven amino acids.  In only one serum sample did theresearchers see evidence for a specific reaction to only one, and not theother VLP variant.If data from future research studies, which apply other L1 variants and othersets of sera, substantiate the current findings, this would have severalimplications.The first such implication would be that the lack of serotypic divergencewould suggest individual genital HPV types have not undergone the type ofantigenic drift (such as that seen in influenza viruses) that changesseroreactivity to virons."This implies either that changes in the major seroreactive virion epitopescannot be tolerated or that neutralizing antibodies do not play a dominantrole in controlling genital HPV infection under natural conditions," wroteCheng et al.The results also suggest that an ELISA which is based on a single VLP variantcould be applied for evaluating HPV-16 infection in different populations."Finally, these results are encouraging from the point of view of developing agenital HPV vaccine, since they suggest that VLPs from a single HPV-16 variantmight be effective worldwide in preventing HPV-16 infection," Cheng et al.wrote.Many of the nucleotide sequence variants of HPV-16 that have been identifiedhave been isolated in separate geographic areas (Chan et al., J Virol,1992;66:2057-2066 and 5714-5725; Ho et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6413-6423).Reinhard Kirnbauer, a co-author of the current report, and colleagues haveperformed numerous VLP-based ELISA studies to investigate HPV-16 infection(Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1992;89:12180-12184; J Virol, 1993;67:6923-6936; JNatl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-504).The corresponding author for this study is Dr.  John T.

In spite of extensiveefforts to identify tumor antigens in human neoplasms at the molecular level,too few have actually been pinpointed.Ugur Sahin et al.  modified the strategy of autologous typing to allow for anunbiased search, in addition to the direct molecular definition of,immunogenic tumor proteins based on their reaction with autologous patientsera ("Human Neoplasms Elicit Multiple Specific Immune Responses in theAutologous Host," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5,1995;92(25):11810-13)."By applying this strategy of SEREX to four unselected human tumors ofdifferent origin, we discovered an unexpected frequency of tumor antigens thatelicit specific immune responses in the autologous host," stated Sahin et al."Since the molecular definition of tumor antigens by SEREX of tumor cDNA isfast and has a high yield, it may make sense to first define tumor antigens bySEREX and then to analyze their role in T-cell immunity.  Such a strategycould provide a rapidly expanding basis for additional approaches to theimmunotherapy and gene therapy of human neoplasms."The cDNA libraries from diagnostic biopsies of four patients with malignantmelanoma, brain tumor, renal cancer, and Hodgkin disease, were expressed in E.coli.  In order to test for clones expressing antigens against which theautologous patient had specific antibodies, 1x10(6) recombinant clones fromeach tumor cDNA were screened.  An ELISA modified for the exclusive detectionof human IgG antibodies was used.Of the 5x10(6) clones tested, 109 were found to be reactive with IgGantibodies in the serum sample of the autologous patient.  Cross-hybridizationexperiments determined that the 109 positive clones contained 24 differentinserts.  From four patients, 24 different antigens were discovered, noted theauthors.The autologous typing strategy that was modified by the authors was firstdeveloped by L.J.  Old and reported in the 1981 issue of Cancer Research,41:361-75.In order to determine the occurrence of antibodies against these newly definedtumor antigens, different tumor patients and healthy controls donated bloodfor testing against these antigens.  Antibodies against the tumor antigenswere detected at varying rates only in patients with the same type of tumor.The authors noted that the definition of 24 antigens in four tumors ofdifferent origin suggests that the analysis of B-cell responses against othertumors of the same or new types may identify an unexpected abundance of humantumor antigens.  Their results suggested that tumor immunogenicity in theautologous host is a common phenomenon and not restricted to malignantmelanomas.In addition, the immunogenicity of human tumors seems not to be due to theexpression of a single antigen, but is conferred by multiple antigens.  Theirobservation that antibodies against the new antigens could only be found inthe sera of patients bearing the same type of tumor suggested that tumorgrowth is essential for the development of a humoral immune response againstthe respective tumor antigens, and that antibody production is not anautoimmune effect elicited by tumor-independent mechanisms.The authors noted that their study was different from other studies which usedsera to detect antibodies.  Other studies have relied on low-titer serumantibodies or human monoclonal antibodies generated in vitro from patients'lymphocytes.  Theirs, on the other hand, uses a stringent serologicaldetection system which is limited to antigens that elicit high-titer IgGresponses in the patient in vivo."According to our data, overexpression of antigens in the tumor compared tonormal tissues seems to be the most common reason for immunogenicity,"concluded Sahin et al.  "Our observation that tumor antigens defined by T-cellresponses such as MAGE-1 and tyrosinase can also be detected by theserological approach suggest that an integrated immune response against tumorantigens may exist that involves both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as well as Bcells."The corresponding author for this study is Michael Pfreundschuh, MedizinischeKlinik and Poliklinik, Innere Medizin I, Universitat des Saarlandes, D-66421Homburg, Germany. - by Michelle MarbleBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Joint Venture)Agreement Signed To Develop Anti-Cancer TherapeuticsMitotix Incorporated, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and DuPont Merck, Wilmington,Delaware, announced a collaborative agreement to develop and commercializenovel anti-cancer therapeutics that act on a group of enzymes calledcyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), that are essential for regulating the celldivision cycle.Through the agreement, DuPont Merck could invest up to $55 million in Mitotixin the form of equity, research, development and clinical milestone payments.The collaboration is initially focusing on three of Mitotix's proprietarymolecular targets.  Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont Merck receivesexclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Cdk-based therapeuticsand radiopharmaceutical diagnostics.Mitotix retains worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain Cdktargets for non-cancer indications, as well as all rights to develop andcommercialize gene therapy and antisense approaches utilizing the Cdk targets.Mitotix also retains rights to certain diagnostic applications and has anoption to co-promote in the U.S.  any therapeutic products that arise from thecollaboration with DuPont Merck.The agreement provides Mitotix with an up-front equity investment and Cdkresearch funding over four years totaling $17 million.  The agreement involvesup to an additional $38 million in Cdk research funding extensions and productdevelopment related milestone payments to Mitotix, as drugs are successfullydeveloped and approved.  Mitotix will also receive royalties on net worldwidesales of all Cdk products.  DuPont Merck will fund all preclinical researchand development activities.  In connection with the agreement, Mitotix'scurrent venture investors will make an additional $3 million equity investmentin the company.The cyclin targets covered in the collaboration represent all regulatorymolecules that drive the critical cell cycle transitions from growth throughDNA replication.  The collaboration initially seeks to develop therapeuticproducts for the treatment of cancer through inhibition of these essential Cdkmolecules.  Specifically, Mitotix and DuPont Merck will work to identifyinhibitors of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and mimetics of the tumor suppressorgene, p16, to control the inappropriate cell division that is the hallmark ofcancer."A key focus of the research program with DuPont Merck is on the molecularpathway that includes Cyclin D1 and p16," said Dr.  David Beach, a HowardHughes Medical Institute Investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and ascientific co-founder of Mitotix.  "In most cancers one or more of thecomponents of this pathway, which controls the cell's entry into the processof DNA replication, are deregulated."Cyclin D1 and p16 act as molecular "on" and "off" switches in driving theprocess of DNA replication.  Research has shown that cyclin D1 is expressed athigh levels in a variety of tumors, including breast, colon, esophagealcancers, and lymphomas.  Additionally, a large body of recent research hasdemonstrated that in 20 to 50 percent of tumors, including breast, bladder,esophageal and skin cancers, the natural cell cycle inhibitor p16 is missingor mutated, thus allowing uncontrolled cell growth.Cyclin E acts at a similar regulatory point in the cell cycle to cyclin D1,but through a distinct biochemical pathway.  Recently published research hasshown that elevated levels of cyclin E appear to increase the rate at whichcells divide.  Mitotix holds exclusive worldwide rights to cyclin D1 and p16from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, based on discoveries made by Beach.Mitotix also has exclusive worldwide rights to cyclin D1 patent applicationsfrom the Massachusetts General Hospital, and exclusive therapeutic rights toan issued U.S.  patent covering cyclin E from the Fred Hutchinson CancerResearch Center.Separately, the partners have agreed to conduct initial research to assess thedevelopment of anti-cancer therapeutics that act by inhibitingubiquitin-mediated degradation.  The specific terms of this separate researcheffort were not disclosed.  The collaboration, which builds on previous workby Mitotix scientists, is designed to inhibit the ubiquitin-mediateddegradation of p53, thereby increasing levels of the protein and driving tumorcells into apoptosis (programmed cell death).  The p53 protein normally actsas a tumor suppressor gene that functions to halt the cell division cycle toallow for DNA repair.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Joint Venture)Anticancer Drug Licensing/Research Agreement SignedBristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, and EntreMed, Inc.,Rockville, Maryland, announced an agreement in which Bristol-Myers Squibb willobtain exclusive worldwide licensing rights to antiangiogenic compounds now indevelopment by EntreMed, Inc.Antiangiogenic therapies, which have been shown in preclinical studies toprevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels, have the potential to blockthe growth of primary and metastatic cancers by eliminating a tumor's bloodsupply.Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has made an equityinvestment in EntreMed and will fund a five-year research collaboration in thearea of angiogenesis and its application in the treatment of cancer.  Inreturn, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain worldwide licensing rights to therecently discovered antiangiogenic applications of the drugs thalidomide,thalidomide analogs and Angiostatin protein, which have generated considerableinterest in the medical community.Angiostatin is a novel protein which may suppress malignant tumor formation byinhibiting the growth of blood vessels.  In preclinical trials, it hassuccessfully caused the regression of primary human breast, prostate, andcolon tumors in animal models.Thalidomide, developed as a sedative, has not been approved in the U.S., andit was originally associated with birth defects.  However, if it is shown tobe an effective antiangiogenic therapy in humans, it has the potential tobecome a significant anticancer agent.  There are currently no antiangiogenicproducts approved for the treatment of cancer.Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, M.D., director of theSurgical Research Laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,and professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Folkman was thefirst to observe that cancerous tissues are fed by newly-grown blood vesselssprouting from existing arteries.He theorized that if doctors could prevent these blood vessels from growing,then the tumor would starve.  Since Children's Hospital has a sponsoredresearch agreement with EntreMed, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain firstrefusal rights on any antiangiogenic technologies developed in Folkman'slaboratory and licensed by EntreMed.It is expected that the first clinical trials to test the antiangiogenicproperties of these compounds in cancer will begin in 1996.  EntreMed hasalready initiated clinical trials with thalidomide in the treatment ofblindness due to age-related macular degeneration, another angiogenicdisorder.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Therapy)DaunoXome Shows Promise as TreatmentModerate-dose DaunoXome, a liposomal formulation of the anticancer agentdaunorubicin, is well-tolerated and has promising efficacy in treatingadvanced breast cancer.The data was presented by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals', Boulder, Colorado, at the18th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, held December 10-13, 1995 inSan Antonio, Texas.Moreover, the limited toxicity observed in this trial, particularly theabsence of cardiotoxicity, suggests that DaunoXome may be useful inameliorating the side-effects that now accompany high-dose anthracycline-basedchemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.  The data, generated in a Phase IIstudy funded by NeXstar, were presented by P.S.  Hupperets, M.D., of theAkademisch Ziekenhuis, in Maastricht, the Netherlands.Eleven women with previously untreated, newly diagnosed metastatic breastcancer received DaunoXome at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) every three weeks for aslong as 24 weeks.  Even at this moderate dose, three patients (27 percent)developed a partial response, seven (63 percent) had stable disease, and onepatient (10 percent) experienced no therapeutic benefit.Toxicity was minimal:  no patients lost hair, and only two patients reportedmild nausea.  Six patients showed evidence of bone marrow suppression, whichdid not limit treatment and which recovered without supporting therapy.  Nopatients demonstrated signs of cardiotoxicity."These data demonstrate that moderate-dose DaunoXome therapy produces the samekind of response rates as conventional single-agent doxorubicin therapy, butwith a much improved side-effects profile," said Michael E.  Ross, NeXstar'svice president for medical and regulatory affairs."We believe that these results bode well not only for the expanded trialswe're conducting in breast cancer, but for the other solid tumor indicationsin which DaunoXome is being tested.  We also believe that the absence ofcardiotoxicity suggests that DaunoXome may play an important role in replacingconventional anthracyclines in high-dose, multiple-agent chemotherapyregimens."  Such studies are currently in progress.DaunoXome has already been approved in the United Kingdom (U.K.)  and Swedenas a primary therapy for the treatment of advanced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) inHIV positive patients, and is awaiting final approval in the United States forthe same indication.In addition to the Phase II study in breast cancer, the company is conductingPhase II trials with DaunoXome in small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lungcancer, hepatocellular cancer, adult and childhood leukemia, brain tumor,bladder cancer and lymphoma.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Therapy)Ethyol Approved for Marketing by FDA To Treat Ovarian CancerU.S.  Bioscience, Inc., West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, announced that Ethyol(amifostine, WR-2721), a selective cytoprotective agent, was cleared formarketing by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Ethyol is indicated to reduce the cumulative renal (kidney) toxicityassociated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advancedovarian cancer.  Ethyol represents a class of selective systemiccytoprotective agents which, when administered prior to treatment, can protecthealthy cells from the damaging effects of chemotherapy.Ethyol is expected to be available to physicians and patients in early 1996.U.S.  Bioscience is currently in the advanced stage of negotiation with apotential marketing partner.U.S.  Bioscience had previously secured a recommendation for marketingapproval for Ethyol by the European Committee for Propriety Medicinal Products(CPMP) for reduction of neutropenia related risk of infection (e.g.neutropenic fever) from cyclophosphamide and cisplatin in patients withadvanced ovarian cancer.U.S.  Bioscience recently submitted a dossier to the CPMP requesting anexpansion of the CPMP indication for Ethyol to include protection againstrenal toxicity resulting from repeated courses of cisplatin.  Ethyol hasrecently been launched by Schering-Plough in a number of major Europeanmarkets.  Ethyol is currently under review in Canada where Eli Lilly willmarket the product under an alliance reached with U.S.  Bioscience earlier in1995.Ethyol has a unique history representing an unanticipated benefit of the ColdWar era.  It originated in a previously classified United States Army nuclearwarfare research project, where the drug, known as WT-2721, was selected asthe best of over 4,000 chemicals tested for development as a compound whichmight protect soldiers from radiation exposure.  Once the project becamedeclassified, oncologists began exploring the potential role of Ethyol inmedicine as a means of selectively reducing the serious toxicities associatedwith radiation therapy used to treat cancer patients, as well as chemotherapy.U.S.  Bioscience will continue to investigate Ethyol in other cancersutilizing different chemotherapeutic combinations as well as radiationtherapy.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Industry News (Vaccines)Survival Improvement Shown in Breast Cancer Trial with TheratopeDr.  Grant MacLean, Medical Oncologist and principal investigator forBiomira's clinical study at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta,Canada, presented results of Biomira's Phase II clinical trials of Theratopetherapeutic vaccine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.The meeting "Novel Vaccine Strategies:  Immunotherapeutic Strategies forCancer" Conference was held in San Diego, California.  Theratope is anon-toxic therapy designed to stimulate the immune system of cancer patientsto respond against the cancer.  The study was conducted over a 2-1/2 yearperiod at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton and Guy's Hospital in London,United Kingdom (U.K.).Among 48 women in a randomized clinical trial, MacLean reported that 24 whoreceived Theratope in its standard investigational program had a statisticallysignificant increase in survival over 24 women in the other study group whodid not receive the standard immunomodulation prior to Theratope treatment.The women on the standard Theratope program have a projected median survivalof 19.7 months versus 12.6 months for the other study group, with statisticalsignificant at P=0.018.In addition to increased survival, the women on the standard Theratope programhad statistically significant higher levels of antibodies against a specificmolecule, Sialyl-Tn (STn), found on the surface of breast cancer cells, thanwas observed with those who received the alternate Theratope program.Since receiving the analysis of the data, Biomira has been consulting withclinical investigators and scientists about these results and will becontacting regulatory officials in the U.S., Canada and Europe to discusstheir recommendations for the next steps to take Theratope therapeutic vaccineto commercialization for women who suffer from metastatic breast cancer.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Preventive MedicineOrganization Criticizes Task Force RecommendationsThe American College of Radiology (ACR) strongly disagrees with statementsmade by the U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force regarding mammographyscreening and screening and treatment for prostate cancer.The college is particularly concerned about suggestions that breast cancerscreening is not warranted for women under the age of 50 and over the age of70.  The ACR also believes that colorectal screening should include allappropriate strategies, including the double contrast barium enema.  Inaddition, the College contests the Task Force's suggestion that prostatecancer patients over the age of 70 should not be treated for their disease.The American College of Radiology reaffirms its support for mammographyscreening beginning by the age of 40.  Mammography screening provides forearly detection, and early detection increases a woman's chance for survival.When a woman has her breast cancer detected early she has more treatmentoptions.Beginning by the age of 40 a woman should have an annual clinical breastexamination and a mammogram every one to two years.  Beginning at age 50, sheshould have an annual clinical breast examination and a mammogram every year.The Task Force says that there is no strong evidence for or againstmammography screening in the younger age group.  On the contrary, evidence outof Kopparberg, Sweden, British Columbia, Edinburgh and in the 14-yearfollow-up of the Breast Cancer Demonstration Project in the United Statesstrongly suggest a benefit.  In addition, preliminary reports out ofGothenburg, Sweden show a strong survival benefit for screening younger women.Mammography screening should not be discontinued in women 70 and older, assuggested by the Task Force.  More than one-third of breast cancer cases arein this age group.  Further, the fastest growing segment of the population arethose who are 100 years and older.  Most are in good health.  Women in all agegroups have the right to have their breast cancer detected early and treatedproperly.The U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI) recently reported a decline in thenumber of breast cancer deaths, which has been attributed, at least in part,to the increase in the number of women who are undergoing regular screening.There was an 8.1 percent decrease in deaths in Caucasian women ages 40-49 anda 3.4 percent decrease in deaths in women 70-79.Research indicates that the double contrast barium enema, long an acceptedmethod for imaging high risk patients for colorectal cancer, is also a viablescreening examination for low-risk patients.  The Office of TechnologyAssessment (OTA) recently found the double contrast barium enema and flexiblesigmoidoscopy to be the most cost-effective colorectal cancer strategies.Prostate cancer survival rates are 94 percent if the disease is caught early.While no screening test is perfect, the digital rectal examination and theprostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test have proven to be effective indiagnosing the disease.  The American Cancer Society recommends that every man40 and older should have a digital rectal examination each year.  Beginning atage 50, men should have an annual PSA blood test.  The American College ofRadiology endorses these guidelines, noting that studies which show noadvantage to screening are out-of-date and controversial in theirinterpretation.The Task Force again targets the older American in its suggestion that therisks outweigh the benefits of treatment for prostate cancer.  The risks ofradiation therapy are minimal.  A patient and his doctor need to determinewhat, if any treatment is appropriate.Every patient has a right to know, as soon as possible, if he or she hascancer.  Each cancer patient has a right to discuss their treatment optionswith their physician and make a personal decision as to the appropriatetreatment.  These rights should not be overshadowed by any recommendations orsuggestions of the Task Force.Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Transplantation (BMT)HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors Are Good Option for CML PatientsBone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donors(VUDs) can cure a significant number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia(CML).For patients with CML, allogeneic BMT is established as an effective means torestore normal hematopoiesis.  However, the lack of a suitable HLA-identicalsibling has led to more frequent use of VUDs.  Compared with HLA-identicalsibling donor BMT, VUD BMT has been associated with greater morbidity andmortality, especially because of greater rates of graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) and graft failure.Andrew Spencer, Leukemia Research Fund Center for Adult Leukemia, RoyalPostgraduate Medical School, London, England, and colleagues performed ananalysis of the outcome of VUD BMT in 115 patients with CML at theirinstitution ("Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia withVolunteer Unrelated Donors Using Ex Vivo or In Vivo T-Cell Depletion:  MajorPrognostic Impact of HLA Class I Identity between Donor and Recipient," Blood,1995;86(9):3590-3597).Their aim was to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from VUDBMT."We have demonstrated that VUD BMT can cure a significant number ofappropriately selected patients with CML," wrote Spencer et al.  They addedthat the availability of high-resolution tissue typing techniques enables moreaccurate predictions of outcome after VUD BMT.  The use of such methods shouldallow the more appropriate use of VUD BMT in managing CML."In young, chronic phase patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling, a search foran unrelated donor should be commenced immediately," wrote Spencer et al.  "Ifa potential donor, matched using high-resolution typing techniques, isidentified, BMT should be considered as soon as possible."Spencer et al.  performed 115 VUD BMT for first chronic phase or advancedphase CML between August 1985 and July 1994.  They supplemented standardserologic HLA typing of recipients and potential donors with one-dimensionalisoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQalleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis andthe measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC)cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay).The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at three years was 37 percent.  Theprobabilities of survival and LFS for patients under the age of 40 years whowere transplanted in the first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73percent and 50 percent, respectively."We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; whenusing ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved inpatients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors withoutdemonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency," wrote Spencer etal.The current study showed an association between graft failure and increasingdonor age that has not been recognized before.  The graft failure rate of 16percent reported by Spender et al.  corresponds to that reported by otherresearchers (McGlave et al., Blood, 1990;75:1728; McGlave et al., Blood,1993;81:543).Researchers have indicated that about two-thirds of patients, otherwiseeligible for BMT, lack a matched sibling donor (Beatty et al.,Transplantation, 1988;45:714).The corresponding author for this study is Andrew Spencer, LRF Centre forAdult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Du Cane Road, London W12ONN, United Kingdom. - by Cathy ClarkBack to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Transplantation (Cord Blood)Improved Methods Address Storage and Cell Viability ChallengesRecent processing improvements should make frozen placental/umbilical cordblood (PCB) a more useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrowreconstitution.Pablo Rubinstein and colleagues, Lindsley F.  Kimball Research Institute ofthe New York Blood Center, New York, New York, addressed two key requirementsfor moving unrelated-donor PCB transplantation forward as a practicalalternative for clinical use ("Processing and Cryopreservation ofPlacental/Umbilical Cord Blood for Unrelated Bone Marrow Reconstitution,"Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1995;92(22):10119-10122).First, they developed a method that maximizes freezer storage space byconcentrating the hematopoietic cells of PCB units into units of smallervolume.  Second, they developed a method to overcome loss of viabilityassociated with cryopreservation and thawing.In the unrelated donor/recipient setting, human leukocyte antigen(HLA)-matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients.  This requiresthe establishment of large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units, notedRubinstein et al.  This effort typically involves a large volume ofunprocessed PCB units consisting primarily of red blood cells, plasma andcryopreservation medium, which take up limited, expensive frozen storage spacein liquid nitrogen.Rubinstein et al.  designed a closed-system procedure, compatible with routineblood bank processing, that concentrates almost all the leukocytes andprogenitor cells in PCB units.  The procedure is based on a hydroxyethylstarch (HES)-induced rouleaux formation and mild centrifugation to separate aleukocyte-rich supernatant from sedimented red blood cells."Since the probability of finding an HLA-matched unit depends on the number ofunits available and since the number of units that can be stored in a givenspace is determined by the average unit volume, smaller PCB units areessential for PCB to become a practical source of tissue for unrelatedtransplantation," wrote Rubinstein et al.Decreasing the volume of PCB units by removing the bulk of red blood cells andplasma offers practical advantages such as convenience, cost and efficiency,compared with current options.The second issue - reduced cell viability after the cryopreserved PCB unitsare thawed - was diminished by adding one volume of isotonic diluent to thecell suspension in 10 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).Dilution of the freshly thawed cryopreserved unit with an equal volume ofisotonic solution allows the product to be thawed and prepared for infusionunder controlled laboratory conditions instead of at the patient's bedside,noted the researchers."Removal of the cryoprotective medium can be performed there [the laboratorysetting], without harm to the units:  clonogenic activity and viability remainessentially unchanged, even if removal of diluted DMSO is delayed for severalhours," wrote Rubinstein et al.Removing DMSO eliminates its unfavorable side effects on the recipient(Stroncek et al., Transfusion, 1991;31:521-526; Davis et al., Blood,1990;75:781-786)."These improvements make frozen PCB a more effective source of stem cells forunrelated marrow reconstitution in the treatment of inherited disease andhematologic malignancy and, potentially, for recombinant DNA-based genetherapy," wrote Rubinstein et al.The same procedure to minimize loss of viability might be used in thecryopreservation process for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem andprogenitor cells.  It also may be possible to remove malignant cells or tointroduce chemical or genetic labels into cells before infusion.Numerous advantages in using PCB as donor tissue for unrelated bone marrowrestoration have been reported, including timely availability of PCB topatients and lower frequency of certain infections, as described in an earlierpublished review (Rubinstein et al., Blood, 1993;7:1679-1690).Another significant advantage of PCB grafts is their remarkably lowerincidence of associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause ofmorbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (Sullivan,in Bone Marrow Transplantation, eds.  Forman, Blume & Thomas, 1994, Blackwell,Boston, pp.  339-362).In February 1993 the New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Project startedcollecting PCB units to study the clinical usefulness of this source of stemcells (Rubinstein, Blood Cells, 1994;20:587-600).  Of the 24 patients whoreceived PCB grafts before February 26, 1995, 12 still were alive and doingwell as of March 30, 1995.  None of the recipients developed clinically severeGVHD within follow-up periods of 2 to 18 months.This work was supported in part by Grant HL 48031 from the National Heart,Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and by grantsfrom Baxter Health Care and Citibank.The corresponding author for this study is Pablo Rubinstein, Laboratory ofImmunogenetics, Lindsley F.

Hall.Departments of Neurosurgery and Physiology, and Program in Neuroscience,University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meetingof the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,California, "c-myb is a proto-oncogene which encodes a nuclear proteininvolved in the regulation of the cell cycle.  This oncogene is typically overexpressed in various types of cancer.  Previous studies in our laboratoriesdemonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides to the c-myb oncogene cansuppress the proliferation of human medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cellsgrown in vitro.  In the present study, we have examined the effects ofantisense administration in vivo using nude mice as tumor transplantrecipients.  Human glioblastoma of the U87 cell line were injected into theflank of nude mice (5x10(6) cells).  Ten days after the injection of the tumorcells, animals received injections of either c-myb antisense or nonsense (100(micro)M), or Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) in 50 (micro)l volumesdirectly into the tumor.  Antisense oligos were designed for codons 182-188 ofthe c-myb oncogene.  Antisense injections were given at days 10, 12, 14, and16 after the transplantation of the tumor cells.  Tumor volume (mm(3)) wasmeasured daily for each animal over a period of 17 days.  Animals giveninjections of HBSS exhibited tumors at day 17 which significantly increased insize to 217% (P<0.05) of the volume prior to HBSS administration.  Animalsgiven nonsense oligonucleotides also exhibited tumors which significantlyincreased in size by 210% (P<0.05).  In contrast, animals receiving c-mybantisense exhibited no significant increase in tumor size with tumors only128% of their pre-antisense treatment size.  These results suggest that theadministration of antisense to codons 182-188 of the c-myb oncogene cansuppress U87 tumor growth in vivo, and may thus be an effective form oftherapy in treating human brain tumors.

This study evaluates specific imaging criteria for differentiatingtuberculosis from malignant lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes on contrastenhanced CT.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The enhanced CT features of 125 sites in50 patients, including tuberculosis (20 patients) and malignant lymphoma (30patients) in abdominal lymph nodes, were retrospectively evaluated in a blindreview for the enhancement criteria of morphology, density, and location.RESULTS:  Approximately 94% of sites of tuberculosis showed a ringlikeenhancement of enlarged lymph nodes, as compared with 4% of the sites ofmalignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Approximately 55% of the patients withtuberculosis had a mass of multilocular appearance compared with 4% of thepatients with malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Tuberculosis frequently involvedthe mesenteric, omental, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, while malignantlymphoma frequently involved the retroperitoneal space.  But, theretroperitoneal lymph nodes under L-2 were involved with tuberculosis in only8% of the patients, whereas malignant lymphoma involved about 20% (P<.01).Combining all criteria, reviewers diagnosed tuberculosis correctly in 94%,with 93% specificity and 95% sensitivity.  CONCLUSION:  The differentiation oftuberculosis from malignant lymphoma can be made with contrast-enhanced CT onthe basis of characteristic enhancement and sites of involvedlymphadenopathy."Back to Headline List CopyrightCANCER BIOTECHNOLOGY WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Diagnostics"Esophageal Lymphoma and Viral 'Pseudolymphoma' in Patients with AIDS."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Esophageallymphoma or possible esophageal lymphoma was diagnosed in 8 AIDS patients overa 4-year period.  Six patients underwent esophagography, in addition toendoscopy and biopsy.  Four patients underwent repeated biopsies.  No patientsunderwent immunologic marker studies.  RESULTS:  Only 1 patient had a polypoidmass in the distal esophagus typical of neoplasm.  The other 7 patients hadesophageal ulcers that radiologically and at gross inspection endoscopicallywere considered of viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] or idiopathic) origin.Pathologic examination initially suggested lymphoma in all 7 patients withconcomitant CMV in 5.  Follow-up biopsies revealed that the 'lymphomatous'infiltrate was actually inflammatory reaction in 3.  In 1 patient, an isolatedCMV inclusion was discovered on the 2nd biopsy, and the esophageal ulcerresolved with ganciclovir despite continued pathologic evidence of lymphoma.CONCLUSION:  Esophageal lymphoma and viral infection coexist such that therecan be considerable diagnostic and thereby therapeutic confusion in regard tothese patients.

The herpes vector hrR3 was used because highest genetransfer efficiency was achieved after intratumoral application in ourlaboratory with this vector, as compared to retrovirus or adenovirus vectors.hrR3 bears the HSV-TK and the E.  coli lacZ reporter gene and has a deletionin the ribonucleotide reductase gene, which allows selective virus replicationin dividing cells.  Two different models of disseminated 9L brain tumors wereestablished 5-7 days before intraarterial or intraventricular injections ofhrR3.  For intraarterial application bradykinin was injected prior to thevector to disrupt selectively the blood-tumor-barrier.  Transfer efficiency ofthe HSV-TK and lacZ genes was investigated in multiple tumor foci throughoutboth hemispheres.  Intraventricular delivery of hrR3 was achieved viastereotactical injections into the cisterna magna, and distribution of theHSV-TK and lacZ genes was evaluated in a model with a right frontal lobe tumorand extensive leptomeningeal tumor spread throughout the CSF pathways.  HSV-TKand lacZ gene delivery was assessed in tumor masses and in normal brain atdifferent time points by immunohistochemical and histochemical detection ofthe gene products.  With intraarterial application of hrR3 following selectivedisruption of the blood-tumor barrier by bradykinin, transfer of the HSV-TKand lacZ genes was found almost exclusively in the periphery of alldisseminated tumor foci.  Normal brain was not affected, and no toxicity wasobserved.  Intraventricular delivery of the vector resulted in expression ofthe HSV-TK and lacZ genes in the intracerebral and the leptomeningeal tumormasses.  Some toxicity was observed with intensive leptomeningeal inflammationand temporary infection of periventricular areas of the brain.  IntratumoralHSV-TK and lacZ expression was strongest within the first 2 days afterintraarterial or intrathecal herpes injection, but was still detectable up toat least 16 days after virus application, consistent with vector replicationin the tumors.  Both application strategies provide a marked extension of TKgene transfer efficiency, as compared to intratumoral delivery.  Studysupported by NINDS grant NS24279.

To study if HSV-TK by itself might contribute to the anti-tumorimmunogenicity, the growth of non-immunogenic D74 tumors, wild type (D74-w.t.)and TK-modified D74 (D74-TK) brain tumor cells, were studied in naive rats andrats previously treated and cured of 9L, tumors by HSV-TK and GCV treatments.Formation of the D74-TK tumors were significantly reduced in both naive andpretreated rats, even though the in vitro growth rate of these tumors wassimilar.  Analysis of immune cells infiltrating the tumors revealed asignificant increase in the CD4 positive cells in TK-modified tumor cells inthe previously treated rats.  Furthermore the regression of the D74-TK tumorswas greater in the previously treated rats.  These findings suggest that evenin non immunogenic tumors, the expression of HSV-TK slows the tumor formation,that can be associated with the immune response.  This immunity could beexploited by vaccination strategies to increase tumor regression seen withHSV-TK and GCV treatments.

Various control ODNs were used to understand the mechanismof the observed antiproliferative effect.  Not only the antisense ODNs butalso several control ODNs inhibit the proliferation of the leukemic celllines.  All the ODNs that inhibit the cell proliferation share a TAT consensussequence at their 3' end, A 1-base mismatch within this consensus sequenceabolishes the antiproliferative effect.  Mismatches of several bases at anyother position within the sequence of the active ODNs do not suppress theobserved effect.  Similar experiments on normal or CML CD34(+) cell fractionled to the same observations.  We conclude that the antiproliferative effectof the phosphodiester BCR/ABL antisense ODNs cannot be attributed to anantisense mechanism but rather to a nonelucidated effect of a 3' terminal TATsequence.  This effect is not CML specific."

"Adenovirus-Mediated Gene Therapyof Hepatocellular Carcinoma using Cancer Specific Gene Expression."  CancerResearch, November 15, 1995;55(22):5283-5287.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cancer Research,"Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have an elevatedalpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level.  This high level of AFP expression istranscriptionally controlled by the 5'-flanking sequence of the AFP gene.Using the 5'-flanking sequence as a promoter for the herpes simplex virusthymidine kinase (RSV-TK) gene in an adenoviral vector (Av1AFPTK1), thetherapeutic efficacy of adenovirus-mediated HSV-TK gene transduction, followedby ganciclovir (GCV) administration, was studied in tumors in athymic nudemice.  Av1AFPTK1 transduction of two cell lines demonstrated HSV-TK enzymeactivity only in the AFP-producing cells (HuH7) and not in the AFPnonproducing cells (SR-Hep-l).  As expected, only transduced HuH7 cells werekilled by GCV treatment.  Transduction by an adenoviral vector harboring aRous sarcoma virus promoter and HSV-TK gene (Av1TK1) showed enzymatic activityand GCV killing in both cell lines.  All HuH7 tumors that were transduced witheither Av1AFPTK1 or Av1TK1 completely regressed after GCV treatment.  On theother hand, there was complete regression of SK-Hep-l tumors only when treatedwith Av1TK1 and GCV and not when treated with Av1AFPTK1 and GCV.  Thus,cell-specific killing was achieved by adenoviral vector containing AFPpromoter for the HSV-TR gene and GCV treatment."

CancerResearch, November 15, 1995;55(22):5151-5155.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cancer Research,"We introduced the gene for wild-type human p53 or p21, a critical downstreammediator of p53-induced growth suppression, into a p53-deficient mouseprostate cancer cell Line using a recombinant adenoviral vector (Ad5CMV-p53 orAd5CMV-p21).  Elevated levels of endogenous mouse p21 mRNA provided evidencefor the functional activity of virally transduced p53.  Functional activity ofviral-transduced p21 was demonstrated through immunoprecipitation of cellularprotein extracts, which showed that the viral-transduced p21 associates withcyclin-dependent kinase 2 and was sufficient to down-regulate the activity ofthe cyclin-dependent kinase by approximately 65%.  In vitro growth assaysrevealed significantly higher growth suppression after Ad5CMV-p21 infectioncompared to Ad5CMV-p53.  In vivo studies in syngeneic male mice withestablished s.c.  prostate tumors demonstrated that the rate of growth andfinal tumor volume were reduced to a much greater extent in mice that receivedintratumor injection of Ad5CMV-p21 compared to Ad5CMV-p53.  In addition, thesurvival of host animals bearing tumors that were infected with Ad5CMV-p21,but not Ad5CMV-p53, was significantly extended.  These data suggest thatAd5CMV-p21 may be effective as a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer."

"Recombinant BCG TherapySuppresses Melanoma Tumor Growth."  Annals of Surgical Oncology, November1995;2(6):542-549.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals ofSurgical Oncology, "BACKGROUND:  Melanoma is the fastest rising cancer in theUnited States.  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been genetically engineeredto actively express and secrete the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).  Both BCGand IL-2 have known potent antitumor and immunomodulatory properties.METHODS:  This recombinant BCG (rBCG 3A) has been tested as an intratumoralinjection and a vaccine therapy in conjunction with irradiated tumor cellsagainst melanoma in the murine B16 melanoma model.  RESULTS:  The transfectionprocess did not adversely alter the function of the wild-type (WT) BCG.  rBCG3A and WT BCG are equally effective intratumoral and vaccine therapies againstmelanoma when compared with normal saline control groups.  Tumor burdens weresignificantly smaller (P less than or equal to 0.01 and 0.05) for thetreatment groups for both intratumoral and vaccine administration of therapy.Immunization with rBCG 3A and WT BCG 14 days before a B16 challenge resultedin an similar to 45% smaller tumor burden when compared with controls.CONCLUSIONS:  Novel therapies based on the immunogenic properties of melanomacombined with molecular technologies may offer promise for an effective andsafe treatment of melanoma."

"Recent Advances in the Application of Gene Therapy to HumanDisease."  American Journal of Medicine, November 1995;99(5):537-552.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journalof Medicine, "PURPOSE:  To review the recent advances in the application ofgenetic modification strategies to the therapy of human diseases for which amolecular defect is known.  METHODS:  A computerized data bank search, theminutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee published in the Federal Record, and reports of human clinicaltrials were used as data sources for this review.  Clinical trials included inthis review were published in the literature or approved by the NIHRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee.  STUDY SELECTION:  Evaluations of theefficacy of genetic modification strategies in clinical trials in human and inanimal models are summarized.  The design and outcome of the geneticmodification strategies employed are reviewed for 16 marking trials, 16 genereplacement trials for molecular deficiency diseases, 3 chemoprotection and 4chemotherapy sensitization trials, 11 cancer vaccine trials, 2 antisenseoligonucleotide trials, and 3 molecular immunotherapy trials.  DATA SYNTHESIS:The marking trials have shown that residual leukemia cells in the infusedautologous marrow can contribute to relapse following autologous bone marrowtransplants.  The use of genetic modification for the replacement of missingor deficient genes in severe combined immunodeficiency, familialhypercholesterolemia, and cystic fibrosis has been associated with encouragingresults so far.  Clinical genetic therapy trials involving cancer vaccines,antisense oligonucleotides, adoptive immunotherapy with genetically modified Tcells, delivery vectors containing interleukin-1 receptor inhibitor forarthritis, replacement strategies for storage diseases, and geneticsuppression of human immunodeficiency viral replication are just commencing.CONCLUSIONS:  The clinical application of genetic modification techniques hasthus far been successful in the beginning phases of this field.  These earlyresults suggest that continuation of gene therapy trials designed to correctthe molecular changes that lead to disease states in humans is warranted.Evaluation of such clinical trials in the future may be based on the analysisof assays for short-term surrogate endpoints, as well as on the therapeuticoutcomes of the trial, such as survival or remission."

"Monoclonal Antibody Po66 Uptake by Human Lung Tumours Implantedin Nude Mice:  Effect of Co-Administration with Doxorubicin."  British Journalof Cancer, November 1995;72(5):1076-1082.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journalof Cancer, "The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy of tumours with radiolabelledmonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) depends on the amount of antibody taken up by thetumour and on its intratumoral distribution.  In the case of MAbs directedagainst intracellular antigens, increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmicmembrane may augment the bioavailability of the antigen for the antibody.This raises the question whether the induction of tumour necrosis bychemotherapy can enhance the tumour uptake of radiolabelled monoclonalantibodies.  In this work, the effect of doxorubicin on the biodistribution ofPo66, an MAb directed against an intracellular antigen, was studied in nudemice grafted with the human non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1.After injection on day 0 of I-125-labelled Po66, tumour radioactivityincreased up to days 3-5, and then remained unchanged to day 14.  The combinedadministration of I-125-labelled Po66 with 8 mg kg(-1) doxorubicin, in twodoses separated by 7 days, doubled the radioactivity retained by the tumour.Histological and historadiographic analysis showed, however, that the druginduced cellular damage.  In the absence of doxorubicin, the accumulation ofPo66 was restricted to some necrotic areas, whereas with doxorubicin thenecrosis was more extensive and the antibody more evenly distributed.  Theseresults suggest that chemotherapy and immunoradiotherapy combined wouldenhance tumour uptake of radioisotope and promote more homogenous distributionof the radiolabelled MAb.  This would promote eradication of the remainingdrug-resistant cells in tumours."  The corresponding author for this study is:B Desrues, Ctr Hosp Reg & Univ, Serv Pneumol, F-35033 Rennes, France.

North of New York's Trudeau Institute earlier reportedthat intravenous inoculation of mice with M.  tuberculosis results in a slowlyprogressive infection in the lungs, despite the acquisition of systemic hostimmunity capable of resolving infection in the liver, spleen and kidneys."The present study was undertaken to determine whether the peculiarsusceptibility of the lungs to M.  tuberculosis infection is even more obviousin mice infected via the respiratory route," North wrote ("M.  tuberculosis isStrikingly More Virulent for Mice When Given via the Respiratory than via theIntravenous Route," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December1995;172:1550-1553).North found that fewer M.  tuberculosis colony-forming units (cfu) given byaerosol were substantially more virulent for mice than much larger numbersinoculated intravenously, as shown by a faster rate of bacillary growth in thelungs and much shorter survival of the host."Earlier death of mice infected by aerosol was associated with fasterdevelopment of lung pathology, even though the number of M.  tuberculosisgiven intravenously resulted in the same number of bacilli initiallyimplanting in the lungs as the number given by aerosol," North wrote.  "Micedepleted of CD4 T cells died of infection much sooner than immunocompetentmice but at about the same time after being infected via either route."North noted that mice infected by aerosol, in contrast with those given M.tuberculosis intravenously were incapable of resolving infection in theirlivers, indicating that they generated and expressed a lower level of systemicimmunity."This interpretation is in keeping with the finding that mice depleted of CD4T cells died at about the same time after infection was initiated via eitherroute and much earlier than immunocompetent controls," North wrote.  "Inaddition, the survival time of mice infected via the respiratory route wasgreatly extended if they were also infected intravenously with a larger numberof M.  tuberculosis.  Thus, a larger number of M.  tuberculosis cfu givenintravenously induces a higher level of systemic immunity than does a smallernumber given by aerosol.  This likely occurs because a larger intravenousinoculum represents a larger quantity of replicating antigen capable ofengaging larger amounts of lymphoid tissue, including that in the spleen."North concludes that bacilli that reach the lungs via the respiratory routehave a growth advantage over those that enter from blood during the initialstage of infection."This may be because microorganisms that enter the lung via the respiratoryroute are ingested by resident alveolar macrophages, whereas those that enterfrom the blood need to be carried into the organ after being ingested bymonocytes, neutrophils, or pulmonary intravascular macrophages."Given that resident alveolar macrophages tend to be less capable than othermacrophages of killing microbial pathogens in general, it is possible thatthis enables M.  tuberculosis to grow more rapidly during the initial stage ofinfection.  Results of the present study support this concept in that M.tuberculosis that entered the lung directly grew faster during the first 20days of infection than did M.  tuberculosis that entered from blood."The corresponding author for this study is Robert J.

Leiby, TransmissibleDiseases Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues("Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma Cruzi-Antibodies in a Subpopulation ofAmerican Red Cross Blood Donors," abstract 387, American Journal of TropicalMedicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):215)."Despite the absence of demonstrated T.  cruzi transmission by transfusion,the finding of seroreactive donors suggests that a significant public healthproblem may exist," Leiby et al.  wrote in their presentation abstract.  Theypresented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society ofTropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas, November 17-21, 1995.The study was performed with the Southern California and the South FloridaRegions of the American Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories.All volunteer blood donors in the Los Angeles and Miami Red Cross bloodcenters were asked a question about their place of birth or amount of timespent in regions endemic for T.  cruzi.  Those donors who answered "yes" and acontrol group were tested for the presence of T.  cruzi antibodies by EIA(manufactured by Abbott Laboratories).The researchers confirmed by RIPA those samples that were repeatedly reactiveby EIA.  They then entered into case-control and look-back investigationsthose donors who were confirmed T.  cruzi seroreactive.Of the donors questioned about risk, 7.4 percent (14,480/196,832) in LosAngeles and 11 percent (1,868/17,043) in Miami responded yes.  Of these whoanswered affirmatively, 20 were confirmed by RIPA (17 donors in Los Angeles;three in Miami).  Among these 20 individuals, the risk factor they all sharedwas birth in and extended residence in a country endemic for T.  cruzi.A look-back investigation of eight patients who previously had received bloodfrom the infected donors showed that none of the blood recipients hadtransfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi.While none of the blood recipients in this particular study hadtransfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi infection, there are documented reports ofthree cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States andone case in Canada (according to a report by Ira A.  Schulman, M.D., Directorof Transfusion Medicine, LA County/USC Medical Center, delivered at the BloodSafety & Screening Conference, October 23-25, 1995, Washington, D.C.).Within the past 25 years, millions of immigrants have come to the UnitedStates from countries where T.  cruzi is endemic.Since 1991, an estimated 100,000 individuals infected with T.  cruzi reside inNorth America. - by Cathy ClarkBack to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Conference Coverage (ACTG)"New" ACTG Moves ForwardCan the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaurtoo large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - Universityof Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization hasaccomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the TwentiethAIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,D.C.The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  NationalInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs inadults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and formoving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDStherapies.DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of theACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since thechanges took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms werevalid, but also stressed the group's many achievements."We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said."But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is thepreeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together atremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for thetreatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTGefforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way."This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugswork," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combinationtherapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the newprotease inhibitor saquinavir.He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings"to tell us what we need to do."The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  Butmost importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by whichit generates clinical trial protocols."One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving likecivil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processesthat prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult sectionhas only three committees making research decisions.  These three ResearchAgenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and theOpportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - thePharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient CareCommittee - will now be established as standing resource committees withineach of the three main RACs.There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will becentralized control of both resources and laboratories.Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing theACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised ofthe various committee chairs.Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,receiving their funds directly from DAIDS."Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "Ithink this will work very well."But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue tochange."Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," hesaid.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."He called for the active participation of each investigator."Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executivecommittee members," Schooley said. - by Daniel J. DeNoon, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Conference Coverage (ACTG)Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTGMany institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find andkeep study participants.A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsoredclinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet theirpatient accrual goals.The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert andcolleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient CareCommittee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed thestudy."Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successfulclinical trials," Klebert said.Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in thestudy.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size orpatient demographics from participating institutions.Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies usedby a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment andretention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision ofpeer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision ofsupport groups was negatively correlated with success.More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier torecruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successfulrecruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combineprimary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minoritypatients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was notassociated with poor recruitment or retention.The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too manydrugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability ofalternative drugs.Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improvepatient recruitment and retention:*  Combine primary care and research visits.*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.*  Provide transportation to the study site.*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.*  Design studies to address retention problems.*  Study identified problem sites in detail. - by Daniel J.

The cell surface glycoprotein serves as acellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide withlipopolysaccharide-binding protein.Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased inserum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonarysarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum andin bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheiseland colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 arealso found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels inBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December1995;108:1614-1616).Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreatedpulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologiccharacteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwichenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis wasincreased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote."No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavagesupernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar topatients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found inpatients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing togranuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cellsurface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determinethe significance and clinical relevance of this finding."The corresponding author for this study is Gerhard Hoheisel, Department ofPneumology, Ruhrlandklink, Tuschener Weg 40, D-45239. - by Salynn Boyles, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Drug ResistanceWhen the Antibiotic Cupboard Is BareAntibiotic treatment options are very scarce when vancomycin does not workagainst life-threatening Gram-positive infections, according to a scientificpresentation given at the midyear clinical meeting of the American Society ofHealth-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP), held in Las Vegas, Nevada."For patients with life-threatening infections that are resistant to currentlyavailable antibiotics, the situation can be as bad as it was 54 years ago whenthe United States entered World War II, and there were no antibiotics on themedical supply shelves," said Chuck Ballow, Pharm.  D., Associate ClinicalProfessor at the State University of New York in Buffalo and Director ofTherapeutic Drug Monitoring at Millard Fillmore Hospital.  "The firstpenicillins were so scarce they were delivered to field hospitals inbriefcases chained to couriers' wrists."Over the past few years, Enterococcus faecium (E.  faecium) has developed theability to survive and grow in the presence of vancomycin.  This bacterium isrelatively benign in healthy patients, but in those with multiple underlyingdiseases, who are often hospitalized for extended periods, this pathogen canbe deadly.The U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report an overallincidence of 14 percent for vancomycin-resistant E.  faecium (VREF) in U.S.intensive care units.The death rate for VREF infections exceeds 30 percent in the studies reportedto date, compared to less than 17 percent in patients infected with lessresistant bacteria.One reason for the increased incidence in resistance is that the Enterococcusresides in the digestive tract, where resistant strains survive.  Ordinarily,E.  faecium is relatively harmless, but, as patients are hospitalized due tochronic illness or additional surgeries and they become increasinglydebilitated, even harmless bacteria overpower their diminishing host defenses.E.  faecium has outsmarted vancomycin by changing the structure of its cellwall through a complex interplay of genetic material that has become the mostcomplicated mechanism of resistance observed to date.Today, after the introduction of many bigger, better and broader spectrumantibiotics and the administration of literally millions of doses, the waragainst bacteria wages on.  On an increasing number of fronts, the bugs haveoutsmarted the drugs.Ballow said this has happened because of a lack of appreciation for theincredible adaptability of bacteria and the availability of hundreds ofantibiotic options.  Most pharmaceutical companies turned their attention todeveloping new drugs for such diseases as heart attacks, cancer and diabetes,instead of focusing on antibiotics.In addition, many infectious disease experts felt confident that thelife-threatening Gram-positive resistance problems they faced in hospitalscould be handled by vancomycin, an antibiotic used for multiresistantorganisms unresponsive to the most sophisticated combinations of agents."Of course, this was naive in retrospect," Ballow told fellow pharmacists."Today we have a major problem, especially in intensive-care units."The first agent in a class of antibiotics known as streptogramins may providehope against VREF.  Synercid (quinupristin-dalfopristin), an injectableantibiotic shown to be effective against VREF, is in Phase III clinical trialsworldwide, and is currently available in the United States and Europe throughan emergency use program sponsored and administered by its developer,Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc.  (RPR), Collegeville, Pennsylvania.Ballow reported on preliminary results of this program, which showed, overall,70 percent of 95 evaluable patients treated with Synercid responded favorablyto the agent, meaning their symptoms improved or resolved.Sixty-seven percent of patients with bacteremia (the most severe andlife-threatening infections) showed improvement and eradication of thebacteria.Ballow believes that these results are significant and promising because thesepatients had serious underlying medical conditions, and each had beenpreviously and unsuccessfully treated with up to 11 antibiotics.The new antibiotic is made of two individually active molecules, each of whichalone mildly halt reproduction of the bacteria, but combined have the power tokill bacteria through inhibition of protein synthesis.The agent has also been shown to be highly effective in laboratory testsagainst the major Gram-positive strains of E.  faecium, Staphylococcus aureus,pneumococci, and Streptococcus, including multidrug-resistant strains.Some older drugs, which have been rarely used, if at all, for many years, mayalso provide some hope, but additional studies are necessary to establish theeffectiveness of these agents in the treatment of VREF.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Emerging DiseasesCould Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animalsare imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) researchers warn.Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only oneor two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domesticanimals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recentprograms to vaccinate wild animals.This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention programcosts an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expensesper year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recentpublication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public HealthConcern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidentalor intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise theanimal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from variousspecies of bats."Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccinefailures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter ofpotentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequentlyestablished in susceptible bat populations."Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically relatednegative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are therhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and someisolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was firstisolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outsideIbadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, CentralAfrican Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented humaninfections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, inNigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, andEthiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginalprotection.* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but issuspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, SouthAfrica who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by abat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is aEuropean insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human casewas documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus hasbeen found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have beenidentified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again aEuropean insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus wasfirst identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of arabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domesticanimals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection."The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New Worldmitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy batswithout human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, severalrecent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer ofrabies-infected bats."These events include:* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in researchfacilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosedwith rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild bigbrown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died ofrabies.* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on acontainer ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permitsin 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptiantomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or theiroffspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions orzoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normallysubjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported batsto prevent contact with humans."Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the areathat extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in awide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction withother Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolonhelvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of thesespecies have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa."The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern becauseof the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,particularly in the southern United States."Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to theUnited States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior toEuropean colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxesfor the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillancerevealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 humandeaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but theywere then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infectedanimals from southern states.Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies haschanged.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after aknown exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in peoplewho had no history of an animal bite."Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that wasunrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has alsochanged:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involvedrabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after theepizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state."The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probabilityof rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote."What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account thepsychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequenteuthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the UnitedStates, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue stronglyagainst population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programsfor wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC."Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is anintegral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabiesincidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for humanrabies."However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required anextensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective forfoxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes."In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine wasdeveloped that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons andvarious other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improvedthermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote."When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact withthem by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate speciesexamined."An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, NewJersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baitslaced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and byhelicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantlyreduced.Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there aremany questions yet to be answered:* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabiescontrol in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?* Who will fund these programs over time?* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue ofextending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing worldwill be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.The following CDC researchers contributed to this report:  Charles E.Rupprecht, V.M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Rabies Section; Jean S.

DeNoon, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1EncephalitisMicrosphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis VaccineMouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against adeadly form of viral encephalitis.Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the familyTogaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infectionsduring epizootics among horses.The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidaddonkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans andanimals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidencesuggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuatedvaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEEvirus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported theirresults in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses toVenezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20)."The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responseswhich were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virusvaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was moreeffective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective againstsystemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as ameans of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to seethe potential benefits of this technology."Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number ofinoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oralvaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieveimmune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center forImmunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,January 1994;12(1):5-11).Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams haveshown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effectivevehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered eithermucosally or systemically.Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe inhumans.Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEEvirus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that offree virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yieldedanti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received asecond booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stablethroughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane onlyin mice boosted with free virus."At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared witheither methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducingspecific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondaryimmunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processedmicrospheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary andsecondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced theimmunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during themicroencapsulation procedure."In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better thannon-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres."Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior tomicroencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhancedthe immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhancedconformational stability," they wrote.In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survivedchallenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received thefree virus vaccine survived challenge."At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccinesafforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigenresulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival ina second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote."These results, taken together with the protection results after secondaryimmunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicatethat a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could affordprotection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the freevirus vaccine."The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulatedVEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosolchallenge with virulent VEE virus.The corresponding author for this study is Suzanne M.

The Ministryof Health report is the result of seven epidemiologic surveys conducted during1994 and 1995 by teams of experts including virologists and specialists inpublic health.  It was prepared by the National Public Health Network.Details of the report were published in the November 4, 1995, British Journalof Medicine (311:1187-1188).According to the survey, at least 60 percent of the infections weretransmitted by blood transfusions or by illicit injection drug use.  Theprevalence of infections among health staff is not known but was estimated ashigh as 3 percent.The surveys included one study of 20,000 pregnant women and another involving6,000 volunteers from the roles of people insured under the social securitysystem.  Results agreed with statistics gathered during routine screening ofblood donors.Additional studies will be conducted to look at the prevalence of infectionamong children and young people under the age of 20 and in people over 60.  Asurvey among 6,300 people who attended routine health checks showed thatone-third of those who were seropositive had received a blood transfusion andthat one-third of those infected were not aware of their seropositivity.It is estimated that 600 new cases of hepatitis C will be diagnosed each yearin France and that 3,500 to 5,000 patients should benefit from treatment withinterferon.According to the report many doctors were reluctant to use this treatment,even though studies have shown that the earlier it is started the moreeffective it is. - by Salynn Boyles, Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Epidemiology (HIV)WHO Reports 18.5 Million Have HIVAn estimated 18.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV - a sharplyhigher number attributed to better reporting rather a surge in the epidemic,the United Nations (U.N.)  health agency said.About six million people are thought to have developed AIDS since the start ofthe epidemic in the late 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Ofthese, 4.5 million have died.An estimated 6,000 people are infected each day with HIV; of the 18.5 millionalready infected, 1.5 million are children, the agency said.WHO previously estimated that 1 million children and between 13 million and 15million adults are infected with HIV and a total of 4.5 million people haddeveloped the disease.The agency said the new figures reflected an improvement in estimatingtechniques, better HIV prevalence studies and other research, rather than asudden jump in new infections.Two-thirds of the estimated HIV cases and three-quarters of advanced AIDScases, are in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said.India has the most HIV carriers - an estimated 1.75 million of its one billionpeople.  Thailand - another country where experts fear an explosion in cases -has 700,000 HIV carriers.The highest proportional HIV rate was in Botswana, with about 18 percent ofsexually active adults infected.  An estimated 17 percent of adults aged 15-49had the virus in Zambia and Zimbabwe and 15 percent in Uganda.In the Americas, Haiti had the highest proportion of HIV carriers, at 4.4percent.  The Bahamas followed at 3.9 percent, with Barbados at 2.8 percent.In the United States, where an estimated 700,000 people were HIV positive atthe end of 1994, the infection rate was 0.5 percent.In Europe, Spain had the highest rate of HIV infections, with 0.58 percent ofsexually active adults, followed by Switzerland with 0.2 percent, WHO said.WHO is forced to rely on estimates to gauge the spread of HIV and AIDS becauseactual cases reported by governments give little idea of the true picture,especially in Africa.North Korea reports no cases of HIV.Although WHO estimated the true number of AIDS cases at six million, theactual number reported by governments was 1.3 million.  The United Statesaccounted for 39 percent of all the reported cases but only 7 percent of theestimated cases.The figures for HIV infections are for the end of 1994, while the AIDS figuresinclude cases that developed in 1995.  A WHO official said there was a slightoverlap in the two categories.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Infection ControlTB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfullycombined?The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris withresearchers expressing differing views.D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less thancompatible, because they target different groups."Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIVprevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted."Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,attempts to combine them are difficult."Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conferenceon Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is thesame - to prevent infections - the focus must be different."In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of casemanagement in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventingtransmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstractpresented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit theinfection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infectedperson who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection."Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on generalhealth education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point ofimplementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point ofimplementation must be the general population of subsets of it."R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Programcountered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs isessential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficientlyimplement."Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Briennoted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient careand help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling isnot widely available."O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patientswith TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TBprograms and prevent further TB transmission in households.O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosisto be lacking."AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which togethercan address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLDmeeting."Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for workingseparately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is nowrecognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death inHIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer bepermitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care andpreventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programsfor people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis indeveloping areas."Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home careprograms for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomedrapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLDconference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affectedfamilies, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals canscarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families haveseriously deteriorated, due to AIDS."More than half of the people with HIV related illness will developtuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to completetreatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various healthcare programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses andreduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist withinhome care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in closecontact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB diseaseamong HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could providedrugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TBprevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa havealready implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.

"We anticipate wewill have another pandemic, but we don't know when," he said.Dr.  Dominick Iacuzio of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases (NIAID) said concern about another pandemic led to hisorganizing the conference.  "It has happened before, and it can happen again,"he said.The last major worldwide flu epidemic was in 1968, the so-called "Hong Kongflu."  New strains of the flu virus typically sweep through the internationalpopulation every ten to 40 years."Some experts say we are overdue," said Iacuzio.Alan Hansen of the World Health Organization (WHO) said modern transportationmakes it possible for new flu viruses to touch every continent within a matterof weeks - it once took many months.In 1918-1919, a new viral strain infected more than 2 billion people andkilled an estimated 20 million to 40 million.  The "Asian flu" in 1957 wasalso new and caused 750,000 deaths in the United States alone.Iacuzio said the Bethesda, Maryland, conference was called to helpinternational experts identify the gaps in what is known about the flu virusand its control.A formal report is being prepared, but these findings will be among theconclusions, he said:* Increased surveillance, particularly in remote Asian areas, is needed forearly detection of new flu viral strains.  If a potentially new form of theflu is found early enough, said Iacuzio, the pandemic could be blunted byrapidly producing a new vaccine.* Some experts believe the concentration of proteins used in the flu vaccinecould be reduced, thus making more doses available.  "We don't know theanswers to this," said Iacuzio, and that knowledge could be critical if thereis a sudden, worldwide need for vaccine.* Final work on vaccines that can be applied as nose spray or nose drops mustbe completed.  These so-called "cold-adapted vaccines" use modified live virusand have been shown to be effective in some studies.  Iacuzio said theiravailability in a pandemic could save many lives by protecting people againstthe disease.* Antivirals, drugs used to treat the flu infections, could provide physicianswith important new weapons in treating patients already infected.  Iacuziosaid candidate drugs are being tested, but are not available.  Such drugs needto be speedily developed, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Occupational Exposure (TB)Most TB in New York HCWs Due to Recent Infections A finding that most tuberculosis cases among health care workers in a New Yorkstudy were due to recent infections suggests that occupational transmission oftuberculosis routinely occurs in facilities without recognized tuberculosis(TB) outbreaks, according to Cornell University's Public Health ResearchInstitute.A number of nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred across the UnitedStates during 1990 and 1991, resulting in several deaths among personnel incontact with infected patients.  These outbreaks prompted the issuance of newguidelines for health care workers from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC)."Since (the implementation of the CDC guidelines) there have been relativelyfew reported outbreaks, which suggests that current control measures may beeffective," researcher Kent A Sepkowitz and colleagues wrote ("TB Among UrbanHealth Care Workers:  A Study Using Restriction Fragment Length PolymorphismTyping," Clinical Infectious Diseases, November 1995;21:1098-1102)."However, it is not known whether the apparently sporadic cases oftuberculosis in health care workers are due to occupationally acquiredinfections or, as a recent study suggested, are more likely due tocommunity-acquired infections.  In addition, the risk for HIV infectedpersonnel is not well defined, although some have suggested that HIV infectedhealth care workers should have the option of being assigned to an areaassociated with a low risk of exposure to tuberculosis."In this study Sepkowitz and colleagues at New York's Cornell UniversityMedical College analyzed cases of tuberculosis using laboratory-based activesurveillance system for TB at six hospitals in New York City (members of theTBNetwork).Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992 to 1994 were analyzed accordingto the occupational status of the patients.The researchers reviewed medical records and restriction fragment lengthpolymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates wasperformed."No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals inthe study period," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Occupational status was knownfor 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing.Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, asdetermined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease."RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65 percent) of 20 health careworkers and 50 (41 percent) of 122 non-health care workers had a clusteredRFLP pattern.Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational statusrevealed that HIV status and health care worker status were independent riskfactors for a clustered RFLP strain.The recent transmission rate of 65 percent outlined by Sepkowitz et al.  isgreater than that seen among health care workers with tuberculosis in Bern,Switzerland, San Francisco, California, or the Bronx, New York.Sepkowitz et al.  conclude that many apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosisamong health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupationaltransmission.The authors note, however, that the cases analyzed in their report probablyreflect transmissions that occurred prior to the time hospitals updatedinfection control procedures."Our data suggest that occupational transmission of tuberculosis occurs inhospitals without recognized outbreaks," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Healthcare workers with HIV infection appear to be at particular risk.  ProspectiveRFLP-based studies will be useful to confirm these findings and may helpdetermine the efficacy of current guidelines for preventing transmission oftuberculosis in health care settings."The corresponding author for this study is Kent A.

It is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality andlacks an approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy.  In addition to thelack of a good animal model (other than the chimpanzee), RSV does not growwell in culture.  Both of these problems have impeded research, making thedevelopment of a vaccine difficult.Peter L.  Collins et al.  produced infectious human RSV from cloned cDNAparticles in vitro paving the way for development of live attenuated vaccinestrains ("Production of Infectious Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus fromCloned cDNA Confirms an Essential Role for the Transcription Elongation Factorfrom the 5' Proximal Open Reading Frame of the M2 mRNA in Gene Expression andProvides a Capability for Vaccine Development," Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11563-67)."An exciting possibility is that RSV might be engineered in ways that enhanceits immunogenicity and induce a level of protection greater than that providedby natural infection," noted Collins et al.  In addition "RSV can be evaluatedas a possible vector for protective antigens of other respiratory tractpathogens.  An RSV vector also might have utility in transient gene therapy ofthe respiratory tract."The cloned RSV was produced by the intracellular coexpression of fiveplasmid-born cDNAs.  One encoded a complete positive-sense version of the RSVgenome, and each of the other four encode a separate RSV protein.  If any ofthese were deleted, RSV was not produced.  The cDNA segments were synthesizedby reverse transcription (RT)-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) from intracellular RSV mRNAor virion-derived genome RNA.They noted that the strategy for producing infections RSV from cDNA-expressantigenome involved its coexpression with those RSV proteins that werenecessary and sufficient to complete two important processes:  1) the abilityto produce an antigenomic nucleocapsid capable of RNA replication and 2) torender the progeny genomic nucleocapsid competent for both RNA replication andtranscription.  Transcription by the genomic nucleocapsid would then provideall of the other RSV proteins and initiate a productive infection.Recently, this approach was successfully accomplished with two rhabdoviruses,rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus, by M.J.  Schnell et al.  (EMBO J.,1994;13:4195-4203) and N.D.  Lawson et al.  (PNAS, 1995;92:4477-81).The possibility also exists that defined mutations can be introduced intothese infectious RSV clones.  This could have multiple applications toward theunderstanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of this particularlydifficult to study virus."It may be possible to insert foreign sequence into the RSV genome forcoexpression," concluded Collins et al.  "Genes of interest for evaluationinclude those encoding cytokines, antagonists thereof, or proteins rich inT-helper-cell epitopes.  This offers the possibility of modifying andimproving the immune response quantitatively and qualitatively."The corresponding author for this study is Peter L.

Keizer and colleagues from The Netherlands' HealthService wrote in an abstract presented at the IUATLD conference.Extensive testing was conducted and those with a skin induration of 10 mm ormore were considered infected.  A case of primary tuberculosis was defined asthe combination of a positive Mantoux test and compatible radiographicfindings."A teacher was identified as the source case," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "At thetime of detection he was without symptoms, yet his chest X-ray showed typicalinfiltration of the left upper lobe and his sputum was Ziehl-Neelsen positive.His medical history revealed that he had been suffering from severe hoarsenessfor three months until a benign growth was removed from his vocal cords duringthe summer-holidays.  The pathologist had reported the presence of epithelioidcell granuloma indicating tuberculosis, but this had not reached the attentionof the otorhinolaryngist."Nearly one-third of all 99 children at the school were found to be infectedwith tuberculosis."All 19 children who had been taught by our patient until the summer holidayswere infected," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "Among them were four cases of primarytuberculosis.  In the group (13 children) that had entered his class after thesummer-holidays only one infection was detected.  It is concluded that thisteacher was extremely infectious during the time he was hoarse from atuberculous laryngeal lesion.

(SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBIsponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon toan AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive anexperimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on theexperiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneeringAIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University ofPittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division ofCellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadtdiscovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates therisk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfullyfights transplant rejection.Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that theuninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow torestore the patient's immune function.The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change thepractice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanentacceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver aswell as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matchingor prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmunediseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and mayultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-speciestransplantation).Back to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Diagnostics"Accuracy of Chest Radiograph Interpretation in the Diagnosis of Pneumocystiscarinii Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Tuberculosis in HIVPositive Patients."

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Theadmitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratoryproved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIVpositive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively andindependently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinicalpresentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and finaldiagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followedby an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis wasmade in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the medianaccuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and noactive disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderateinterobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked otherinfections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis byall 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretationallows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIVpositive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.

Hepatology and ImmunologySections, Hospital General University, Valencia, Spain.According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meetingof the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The aim is to determine the clinical andhistological findings in patients with anti HCV RIBA 2 indeterminate andnormal ALT.  We studied 81 patients (39 men and 42 women, age 41.1, range19-64).  In each patient, the clinical and epidemiological data werecollected.  Liver function test, anti HIV, markers of hepatitis B, RNA-VHC (byPCR), anti HCV RIBA 3 and liver biopsy were performed in all the patients.  Wecompared histological findings according to the results of PCR-VHC (+/-), theantibody band positive in RIBA 2 and the RIBA 3 results (+/-/indeterminate).RESULTS:  Previous transfusion was present in 18.5% (15/81) and withoutparenteral antecedents in 72.8% (59/81).  ALT levels were persistently normalin all patients, and they were HIV and HBsAg negative.  Previous HBV infectionwas detected in 22.8%.  Histological diagnoses were:  Chronic hepatitis (CAHor CPH) in 49% (40/81), Fatty liver in 8.6%(7/81), Minimal changes in 31%(25/81) and normal liver in 11% (9/81).  RNA-VHC (PCR) was positive in 8patients:  2 CPH, 3 CAH, 3 MC.

J.J.Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'TheChallenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemicimmune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayedtype hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, andin vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chieflytransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-typehypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion ofMycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression ofcytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) functionin autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) fromvirulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increasedspontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulatedproduction of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gammaexpression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppressionand energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restoresPPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too mayreflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding ofimmunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions forimmunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes andmonocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serumand cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosispatients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infectedmacrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutuallyenhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for asubunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role forextracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominanceof certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine orDTH skin test."Back to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Infection Control (TB)"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division ofTuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Atlanta, Georgia.According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'TheChallenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients completetreatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factorsconcern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatmentoutcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, andhealth care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patientsand for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIVinfected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality oftreatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the coreBehavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observedtherapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; wheresuccessful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social andBehavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographicresearch has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals abouttuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associatetuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about theappropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed aboutthe cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show theeffectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, andcomprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinicpractices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research isemerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk topatients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studiesof treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, withimplications for the education and supervision of physicians who treattuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development oflocally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral researchmust focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existingdescriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory andresearch methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues willbe identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types ofpatients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infectionseek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."Back to Headline List CopyrightINFECTIOUS DISEASE WEEKLY via NewsNetDecember 25, 1995 & January 1Pathogenesis (HCV)"Histological Progression of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection inUntreated Asymptomatic Blood Donors."

We prospectively monitored the histological progression ofchronic HCV infection in untreated asymptomatic patients using serial twoyearly liver biopsies.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Sixty five asymptomatic HCVRIBA positive blood donors (48 male, 17 female, median age 37 years) referredfrom the Blood Transfusion Service were investigated.  Forty had an overtparenteral risk factor for HCV exposure - 36 IVDU, 4 prior transfusion.  Allwere HCV RNA+ve.  Seventeen patients (26%) had normal initial transaminases.Median ALT was 48iu (range 9-440, normal <30), AST 48iu (range 14-200, normal30iu).  Liver biopsy was recommended for all patients, and histology wasscored (without reference to clinical details) according to a modified Knodellhistological activity index (HAI, maximum possible score 13).  63 patients hadan initial biopsy:  median HAI=2, mean HAI=2.8, range 08, none cirrhotic.When HAI>=6 (9 patients), treatment with alpha interferon was recommended.When HAI<6 (54 patients), interferon was not used but 2 yearly follow-upbiopsies were recommended.  To date, 29 biopsies have been repeated inuntreated patients - 16 deteriorated, 4 improved, 9 unchanged.  In re-biopsiedpatients median HAI increased from 2 to 3.  Serum HCV RNA titre was notrelated to progression.  The median ALT at 2 years was unchanged in untreatedpatients.

As we previously reported, these primates develop hepatitis aftercontact with mice that are infected with variants of LCMV (LCMV(CH)), recentlydetermined to have 86% identity with GC-P gene of the Armstrong and Westernstrains of LCMV.  Here, we describe the histopathological lesions and tissuelocalization of viral antigens in confirmed cases of callitrichid hepatitisfrom recent outbreaks in two U.S.  zoos.  The liver in marmosets and tamarinswith fatal infections consistently showed degeneration, necrosis, andinflammation, with variable involvement of the spleen, lymph nodes, adrenalglands, intestine, pancreas, and central nervous system.  Lymphocyticchoriomeningitis virus antigens were identified immunohistochemically innecrotic foci in these organs as well as in nondegenerating areas in lungs,kidneys, urinary bladder, brain, and testes.  The multi-organ tropism andhistological pattern of LCMV infection in marmosets and tamarins are similarto those reported for the highly virulent arenavirus that causes lassa feverin humans.

In the study that is described, the comparativeefficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone orin combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model ofcolonization.  The model consisted of the modified Robbins device withantibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments.  Thesynergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficaciousin preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains ofStaphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces.  Asimilar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethanecatheters coated with minocycline and rifampin were compared with theinhibitory activities of catheters coated with other antimicrobial agents.The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampinagainst S.  epidermidis, S.  aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis strains, forexample, were significantly better than those of catheters coated withvancomycin (P<0.05).  The inhibitory activities of catheters coated withminocycline and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicanswere comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and amphotericinB, respectively.

Oral ciprofloxacin therapy proved to be effective.  CASE SUMMARY:An 80-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension developedprogressive renal insufficiency, was hospitalized because of uremia, andunderwent hemodialysis.  When the patient developed hematochezia, Duke's Csigmoid colon cancer was detected and successfully resected.  She receivedbroad-spectrum antibiotics in the perioperative period.  The patient thendeveloped profuse diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping, a low-gradefever, prostration, and headache.  The patient then started to receivevancomycin 500 mg po qid empirically.  Four days later, the diarrhea continuedunabated, the Clostridium difficile titer was negative, and the vancomycintherapy was stopped.  However, the stool culture was positive for heavy growthof P.  aeruginosa sensitive to ciprofloxacin.  The patient then began toreceive ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid.  Within 3 days the diarrhea stopped.Oral ciprofloxacin therapy was continued for 10 days and the patient remainedfree of symptoms with formed stools thereafter.  DISCUSSION:  Diarrheafollowing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics implicates pseudomembranouscolitis as the cause.  The patient did not respond to oral vancomycin therapyand had a negative stool assay for C.  difficile toxin.  This patient wasbelieved to have Pseudomonas enteritis, which was confirmed by 2 positivestool cultures.  The administration of oral ciprofloxacin therapy stopped herdiarrhea with a rapid resolution of symptoms.  CONCLUSIONS:  P.  aeruginosa asa cause of infectious diarrhea is unusual.  When it occurs, it usuallyrepresents a nosocomial infection in an immunocompromised host.  This reportillustrates that oral ciprofloxacin therapy is effective for Pseudomonasenteritis, with rapid resolution of symptoms."

American Journalof Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November 1995;152(5):1562-1569.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journalof Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "Heat and moisture exchangers (HME)(Dar-Hygrobac II, Peters) can safely be used every 24 h for longtermmechanical ventilation and provide a cost-saving alternative to heatedhumidifiers.  We have prospectively determined whether changing HMEs every 48h only affects their clinical and bacteriological efficiency in a series ofconsecutive nonselected ICU patients requiring long-term mechanicalventilation.  Two consecutive periods were compared.  During period 1, HMEswere replaced every day; during period 2, they were changed every 48 h.Patients from the two periods were similar in terms of age and indication forand overall duration of MV (10 +/- 8.6 versus 10 +/- 9 d, P=0.9).  Minuteventilation and maximum values for peak airway pressure were identical duringthe two periods.  These values were also identical after 1 and 2 d of HME useduring period 2, indicating that HME resistance was not increased by prolongeduse.  Obstruction of the tracheal tube occurred only once in a period 1patient.  The results of quantitative cultures indicate that the maximum andmean levels of bacterial colonization during the two periods were similar forthe pharynx, trachea, Y-connector, patient, and ventilator side of the HM 8.More importantly, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was similar during thetwo periods (6/61 versus 8/68, P=0.7).  Thus, prolonged HME use is safe andprovides a substantial reduction in the cost of mechanical ventilation."

"Hospitals' Responses toUniversal Infant Hepatitis B Vaccination Recommendations."  Pediatrics,November 1995;96(5 Part 1):875-879.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,"OBJECTIVE:  To assess the extent to which hospitals in a midwestern statewith low acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) morbidity offered hepatitis B (Hep B)vaccine to all infants, whether offering infants Hep B vaccine was associatedwith hospital geographic location or size, as measured by the number ofbirths, and how hospital staff resolved key programmatic issues.  METHODS:The managers of hospital newborn nurseries (n=110) were surveyed by mail.  Thewritten response rate was 72%; all of the nonresponders were interviewed bytelephone.  The outcome measured was the number of hospitals offering Hep Bvaccine to all infants by geographic region and hospital size.  RESULTS:Sixty-five percent of the hospitals routinely offered Hep B vaccine to allinfants; these hospitals accounted far 80% of reported Wisconsin births.  Inunivariate analysis, the decision to offer infants Hep B vaccine wasassociated with both hospital size and hospital location.  After controllingfor size, hospitals in the northeastern region were eight times more likely(relative risk, 8.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.30, 51.79) to offer infantsHep B vaccine than hospitals in the southeastern (referent) region.  Regionaldifferences in reported rates of acute HBV infection do not explain thisfinding, because morbidity in the northeastern region (1 per 100,000) is amongthe lowest in Wisconsin.  Although more than 80% of hospitals with Hep Bvaccination programs required written informed consent for vaccination, hadstanding orders for administering Hep B vaccine to infants whose mothers'hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test results were known, and hadmechanisms to notify the infants' physicians that the infants had beenvaccinated, only 38% had standing orders for testing mothers whose HBsAg testresults were unknown.  CONCLUSIONS:  Hospitals are not necessarily deterredfrom implementing infant Hep B vaccination programs by low community HBVmorbidity.  Hospitals should develop policies to assure that parturient womenwith unknown HBsAg status are screened and their infants are appropriatelytreated."

"Relationship Between Procedures and Health Insurance forCritically III Patients with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia."  AmericanJournal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November1995;152(5):1435-1442.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journalof Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "The objective of the present studywas to assess the association between type of health insurance coverage anduse of diagnostic tests and therapies among patients with AIDS-relatedPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).  Fifty-six private, public, andcommunity hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami were selected for thestudy, and the charts of 890 patients with empirically treated orcytologically confirmed PCP, hospitalized during 1987 to 1990 wereretrospectively reviewed.  Patients were classified by insurance status:self-pay (n=56), Medicaid (n=254), or private insurance, including healthmaintenance organizations and Medicare (n=580).  Primary outcomes were the useand timing of bronchoscopy, the type and timing of PCP therapy, andin-hospital mortality.  The results indicate that Medicaid patients were lesslikely than privately insured patients to undergo bronchoscopy (relative odds= 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.93; P=0.02) or to have their diagnosis of PCPconfirmed (relative odds = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.77), after adjusting forpatient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.  Medicaid patientswere approximately three-fourths more likely than privately insured patients(relative odds = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.96; P=0.04) to die in-hospital, afteradjusting for patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.However, with further adjustment for confirmation of PCP, Medicaid patients nolonger had a significantly higher likelihood of dying in-hospital.  Weconclude that Medicaid patients are less likely to receive diagnosticbronchoscopy than privately insured or self-insured patients, more likely tobe empirically treated for PCP, and more likely to die in-hospital.  Highermortality among Medicaid patients may result from failure to diagnose andtreat alternative pathogens, a consequence of worse access to invasivediagnostic tests."

"Oka/Merck Varicella Vaccine:  A Review of ItsImmunogenicity and Protective Efficacy Against Varicella."  ClinicalImmunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):396-416.According to the authors' abstract of an article published in ClinicalImmunotherapeutics, "Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccineproduced from the Oka strain of the herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV).The Oka strain of VZV is recognized as having low virulence while elicitinghumoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV.  In numerous studies, Oka/Merckvaricella vaccine achieved a seroconversion rate of >95% in healthy childrenand adolescents.  In immunocompromised children with leukaemia in remission,seroconversion was achieved in 80% of vaccinees 12 months after vaccination.Cell-mediated immune responses generally closely paralleled humoral immuneresponses.  The vaccine is also immunogenic in healthy adults.  In healthychildren, a high level of protection was conferred by Oka/Merck varicellavaccine, and in the only double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted todate the vaccine was 98% effective in protecting healthy children againstvaricella during 2 varicella seasons.  In children with leukaemia, Oka/Merckvaricella vaccine was 80% effective in protecting against mild varicella andconferred 100% protection against moderate and severe varicella.  In healthyadults, the rate of protection against varicella was reported to beapproximately 50%.  All observed cases of varicella in healthy andimmunocompromised vaccinees were mild and there were no reports of aydisease-related complications.  Interestingly in children and adolescents withleukaemia, the incidence of herpes tester was lower in children who receivedOka/Merck varicella vaccine than in similar children who had natural immunity.Mild varicelliform rash (occasionally accompanied by fever) has been observedin healthy children, adolescents and adults who have received Oka/Merckvaricella vaccine.  Pain at the injection site was the adverse effect mostfrequently reported in one large study of the vaccine in healthy children.  Inchildren with leukaemia, vaccine-associated rash has been reported in up to50% of vaccinees.  When Oka/Merck varicella vaccine was administered tohealthy children in combination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine therewas no increase in the incidence of skin rashes compared with that caused bymeasles, mumps and rubella vaccine in combination with placebo.  Thus,Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a highly immunogenic vaccine that confers ahigh level of protection against typical varicella in healthy children andadolescents, and in children and adolescents with leukaemia.  While results offurther long term studies investigating the persistence of protective immunityagainst varicella are awaited with interest, available darn indicate thatOka/Merck varicella vaccine is a major advance in the prevention of thiscommon and highly infectious disease."

Infections can range from relatively mildoropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis to severedebilitating mucocutaneous candidiasis including Candidaesophagitis.    "In our institution, during the past two yearsCandida esophagitis has been the AIDS-defining illness in7 percent of patients with HIV-1 infection," Miram L.Cameron and colleagues wrote in the article, "Correlationof In Vitro Fluconazole Resistance of Candida Isolates inRelation to Therapy and Symptoms of IndividualsSeropositive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1,"published in the November 1993 issue of AntimicrobialAgents and Chemotherapy.    "Fluconazole is used frequently for treatment andprophylaxis of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis.Recently we noted several patients who developed severeoropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis while receivingazole therapy.  This finding prompted us to look for invitro evidence of azole, specifically fluconazole,resistance."    Yeast strains isolated from the oropharynx of 87consecutive patients infected with HIV were examined forin vitro susceptibility to fluconazole.  Candida albicanswas isolated from 73 patients.    Fifty-one of the patients had received antifungaltherapy in the month preceding their yeast infection.Thirty-two patients had symptomatic oropharyngealcandidiasis.    The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) werecorrelated with azole use and with clinical symptoms andsigns.    "Although there is overlap between groups, in vitrotesting identified a large group of patients for whoseyeast isolates the fluconazole MICs were high and whoremained symptomatic while receiving azole therapy,"Cameron et al. wrote.    "In vitro susceptibility to fluconazole appears tocorrelate with clinical resistance.  Although there isoverlap between the groups in the study, the trend isapparent, and it is likely that in vitro testing willbecome a clinical tool in the management of these yeastinfections."    Cameron et al. call for further studies, with morepatients from other institutions, to confirm theirfindings.    "There are related questions to be answered," theynoted.  "First, does azole and/or polyene therapy selectfor changes in the mucosal mycoflora, such as for theinherently resistant organisms C. krusei and T. glabrata?Second, does azole therapy induce the development ofazole and/or polyene resistance in the mycoflora presentduring its use, or is azole therapy even necessary forresistant C. albicans to be present?    "Finally, what is the effect of drug dosage andlength of exposure to azoles in the development ofclinical resistance?  It is essential to answer thesequestions correctly to establish clinically useful invitro susceptibility testing for fungi and to help designappropriate strategies for antifungal therapy andprophylaxis."

In the article, "Characterization of Four DoxorubicinAdapted Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines with Respect toChemotherapeutic Drug Sensitivity, Drug ResistanceAssociated Membrane Proteins and GlutathioneTransferases," published in the September-October 1993issue of Anticancer Research, researcher M. Delatorre andcolleagues examined resistance to doxorubicin.    Four human breast cancer cell lines with or withoutestrogen and progesterone receptors were adapted togrowth in the continuous presence of doxorubicin at 10(Zr-75-1), 15 (HTB-122), or 50 (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T)ng/ml.  The sublines of Zr-75-1, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578Tshowed 5-10-fold doxorubicin resistance and also cross-resistance to vincristine (VCR) and etoposide (VP16).    "The sublines maintained or slightly increased theircisplatin sensitivity," the researchers wrote.  "Thesublines of HTB-122 showed resistance only to VP16combined with a paradoxorubicinical increased sensitivityto VCR.  The phenotypic alteration in the sublines withrespect to doxorubicin sensitivity was maintained for atleast two months in the absence of doxorubicin."    The glutathione depletor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)and the calcium channel blocker verapamil (Ver) increasedthe doxorubicin sensitivity slightly only in the MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T sublines, respectively.  Ver also tendedto protect some of the sublines from cisplatin.    The sublines of Zr-75-1 and Hs578T showed increasedexpression of the 170-kDa permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), whereas expression of a 85-kDa membrane proteindetermined by the MRK20 antibody was increased in thesublines of Zr-75-1, and HTB-122.    Class pi glutathione transferase (GST) levels variedgreatly between the cell lines but increased duringdoxorubicin selection only in the subline of Zr-75-1.Class mu GST was detectable in the MDA-MB-231, Hs578T andHTB-122 cell lines, whereas class alpha GST wasdetectable in these sublines but undetectable in theirparental cell lines.  The Zr-75-1 subline showed a 5-foldincrease in the class alpha concentration.    "Except for a correlation between increased P-gpexpression and resistance to doxorubicin, VCR and VP16,no obvious correlations between receptor status,increased P-gp expression, membrane proteins, GST levelsand acquired drug resistance were found," Delatorre etal. wrote.    "Thus, except for a possible role for P-gp inmultidrug-resistance, these findings indicate apronounced mechanistic heterogeneity responsible forcytotoxic drug sensitivity also in cells with a commonhistologic origin and exposed to the same drug."

"The coexistence of markedly elevated K(+) and C1(-)channels in the H69AR cells suggests that solute exportfrom these cells may differ significantly from theparental and revertant cell lines," researcher J. Jirschand colleagues wrote in the article, "Inwardly RectifyingK+ Channels and Volume-Regulated Anion Channels inMultidrug-resistant Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells,"published in the September 15, 1993, issue of CancerResearch.    "Experiments are in progress to determine whethermodulation of the activity of these channels has anybearing on the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in multidrug-resistant cells which overexpress multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)."    The multidrug-resistant SCLC cell line H69AR wasderived from its parental cell line, H69 by stepwiseselection in doxorubicin.  H69AR cells display a drugcross-resistance pattern very similar to that of cellsoverexpressing P-glycoprotein, but levels of P-glycoprotein in H69AR cells are extremely low andcomparable with those found in parental H69 cells.    "Multidrug resistance in H69AR cells has recentlybeen shown to be correlated with approximately a 100-foldincrease in the levels of mRNA encoding a novel member ofthe ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transportersuperfamily," Jirsch et al. wrote.  "The physiologicalfunction of this multidrug resistance-associated protein,MPR, and the mechanism by which it may contribute to drugresistance are currently unknown."    Studies of multidrug-resistant H69AR cells whichoverexpress the multidrug resistance-associated protein,compared with drug-sensitive parental H69 cells andreverant H69Pr cells, revealed an inwardly rectifyingK(+) channel current (conductance, 231 pS/pF) andincreased volume-regulated anion current (limitingconductance, 2 nS/pF).    "The anion current was selective for C1(-) ions andsensitive to 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonicacid (0.1-1 mM) but ATP was not required for initialcurrent activation even in excised patch experiments,"Jirsch et al. wrote.    "K(+) current reversal potential varied 52 mV/10-foldchange in the external K(+) concentration and current wasblocked by BaC1(2) (0.1-1mM).

Researchers from Chandigarh, India's PostgraduateInstitute of Medical Education and Research examined theeffect of nifedipine on the course of Plasmodium bergheiinfection.    "Recent reports point to a class of compounds, namelyCCBs, as being able to reverse such chloroquineresistance by decreasing drug efflux from the cells,"researcher Anju Kalra and colleagues wrote in thearticle, "Altered Course of Plasmodium-berghei Infectionby Nifedipine Treatment," published in the September 1993issue of APMIS.    "Circumvention of drug resistance by verapamil andnifedipine has also been reported in vivo in P.chalbaudi-infected mice," Kalra et al.. wrote.  "Theseworkers have shown that calcium antagonists by themselvesdo not have any inhibitory effect on the parasite and areeffective only when administered along with chloroquine,both in chloroquine-sensitive as well as chloroquine-resistant strains."    The effect of CCB on the course and severity ofplasmodial infection has not been studied extensively.    "This is necessary before considering the use of CCBin combination with chloroquine for chemotherapy orchemoprophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant malaria," theresearchers wrote.  "Keeping this in view, the presentstudy was undertaken to investigate different aspects ofthe course of P. berghei infection in Swiss Albino micefollowing nifedipine treatment."    The researchers observed that mice receiving a dailydose of 0.015 mg/kg of nifedipine had significantlyshorter prepatent, patent and survival periods comparedto untreated P. berghei-infected animals (P <0.001).    "This shows that the calcium channel blockers, inaddition to possessing the property of reversing drugresistance during combined therapy with chloroquine, mayalso alter the pathophysiology of malaria infection,"they wrote.    Kalra et al. note that long-term therapy withnifedipine, as shown in their study, is of interest withrespect to two epidemiological and chemotherapeuticaspects of malaria.    "Firstly, even though during short-term treatment ofan acute malaria attack the use of CCB drugs along withchloroquine may not noticeably alter the host response,it becomes important if CCB are used in prolongedprophylactic therapy," they wrote.    "Secondly, the calcium antagonist drugs are alreadybeing widely used in the treatment of cardiovasculardisorders.  The effect of CCB on the severity and courseof malaria infection in patients on long-term calciumantagonist drug therapy has not been studied.  Similarlythe long-term effects in patients receiving CCB forcirculatory disorders and chloroquine for malariaprophylaxis are not known.  If these CCB drugs are to beused in combination with prophylactic doses ofchloroquine in areas with a high incidence of chloroquineresistance, their possible action on the general immunestatus of the human host must be investigated beforeinitiating such a chemotherapeutic approach."

Resistance to quinoline containing drugs,particularly chloroquine (CQ), is a major impediment tothe successful chemotherapy and prophylaxis of malaria.CQ-resistant parasites fail to accumulate as much drug astheir sensitive counterparts, but the reason for thisphenomenon has not been determined.    "There are at least two principal forms of drugresistance in malaria," researchers Patrick Bray andStephen Ward wrote in the article, "Malaria Chemotherapy:Resistance to Quinoline Containing Drugs in Plasmodiumfalciparum," published in the October 1, 1993, issue ofFEMS Microbiology Letters.    "First, resistance to the inhibitors of parasitefolate metabolism, which results from specific singlepoint mutations of the active site (the dihydrofolatereductase molecule).  This form of resistance arose soonafter introduction of the antifolate drugs and spreadindependently from many different foci.  Second,resistance to chloroquine, which is thought likely toinvolve more than one gene, took much longer to developand spread from only two foci.  The chloroquineresistance mechanism, which forms the basis of thisreview, has been intensively investigated and whilst notfully elucidated, probably involves alterations in drugtransport rather than changes at the site of drugaction."    Bray et al. suggest that CQ-resistant parasites arebelieved to maintain lower intracellular drug levels bymeans of an active efflux system, similar to that foundin multidrug resistant cancer cells, despite majordifferences in both the genetic and biochemicalmanifestations of drug resistance in the two cell types.    Another theory suggests that CQ-resistance could belinked to a defective CQ uptake mechanism, possibly animpaired acidification process in the food vacuole of theresistant parasite.    "In our opinion, the rate of chloroquine efflux canno longer be considered to be a reliable phenotypicindicator of resistance, although the ability ofverapamil to increase steady-state chloroquineconcentrations (albeit at low extracellular chloroquineconcentrations) was found to be specific to resistantstrains," Bray et al. wrote.    "We believe that chloroquine resistance cannot beexplained simply in terms of enhanced chloroquine efflux(although efflux is certainly one of the factorsinvolved), and further, that the reversal of chloroquineresistance cannot be explained simply by the globalinhibition of drug efflux."    Despite the fact that the molecular basis ofchloroquine sensitization is poorly characterized in P.falciparum, the prospect remains that by carefulselection of chemosensitizer it may be possible toenhance chloroquine sensitivity in vivo, according toBray and Ward.    "Regrettably, because of the unacceptablepharmacological properties of known enhancers and theirloss of effect both in vitro and in vivo due to plasmaprotein binding, none of the currently identifiedenhancers is a suitable candidate," they wrote.    "Studies which provide an improved understanding ofthe resistance mechanism(s) evolved by the parasite couldhighlight the sites at which pharmacological interventionmay reverse drug resistance.  Such studies may alsoprovide information that can be applied to the rationaldesign and use of future antimalarials, so that drugresistance is less readily developed by the parasite."

The two cell lines were established from a patientwith multilineage CD7-positive acute leukemia.  The K051and K052 lines were taken from the patient's bone-marrowcells at diagnosis and at relapse, respectively.    "The K051 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigen(CD13 and CD33), a platelet-associated antigen (CD41),and an erythroid antigen (glycophorin A)," researcherJunko Abo and colleagues reported in the article, "p53and N-ras Mutations in Two New Leukemia Cell LinesEstablished from a Patient with Multilineage CD7-PositiveAcute Leukemia," published in the November 1, 1993, issueof Blood.    "The K052 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigens(CD13, CD14 and CD33), lymphoid markers (CD2, CD5 andCD7), and HLA-DR," Abo et al. wrote.  "Chromosomeanalysis of both cell lines showed a 17p-chromosome."    Both cell lines were investigated for aberrations ofthe p53 gene and the N-ras gene.  A p53 mutation detectedin both cell lines consisted of a C to T substitution incodon 248.  An N-ras mutation detected only in the K052cell consisted of a G to C substitution in codon 13.    Expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1)was also investigated by the semiquantitative reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  MDR1mRNA was more highly expressed by the K052 cell than theK051 cell, being equivalent to that in HEL cells.    The functional MDR1 protein against vincristine wasalso observed, and its function was inhibited byverapamil and cyclosporin A.    "The K052 cells were capable of phenotypic ormorphologic differentiation after being incubated withgranulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2,phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3," the researchers reported.  "In contrast,the K051 cells responded phenotypically to retinoic acid.    "Thus the K051 and K052 cell lines will be useful forinvestigating the cellular and molecular events inleukemogenesis and differentiation, and the mechanism ofexpression of the MDR1 gene."

GST enzymes are often over-expressed in tumor cellsmade resistant to cytotoxic drugs, but it has beenunclear whether GST over-expression is directly linked tothe resistance mechanism.    Researcher Clare J. Wareing and colleagues at aScottish research center developed a human lung tumorcell line resistant to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB)in an effort to establish whether selection forresistance with a model GST substrate results inselection of a cell line with higher GST levels.    "The GST are represented by several gene families,termed alpha, mu, pi, theta and microsomal, each of whichdetoxify harmful electrophiles by catalyzing theirconjugation with glutathione," Wareing et al. wrote inthe article, "Increased Levels of alpha-Class and pi-Class GST in Cell Lines Resistant to CDNB," published inthe October 1993 issue of European Journal ofBiochemistry.    "In addition to the increases in GST in drug-resistant cell lines, other evidence implicating theseenzymes in resistance includes the findings that GSTcatalyze the conjunction of anticancer drugs such aschlorambucil and melphalan with reduced glutathione, thatalpha class GST genes are amplified in a cell line maderesistant to chlorambucil and that the expression of GSTcDNAs in heterologous systems can lead to drugresistance."    Wareing et al. found that the resistant line of CDNB(CDNBr), although only twofold more resistant to thecompound, exhibited a significant (15-fold) increase inGST activity compared to the wild-type cell line.    "Resistance to CDNB was associated with a markedincrease in the level of both alpha-class and pi-classGST," the researchers wrote.    "The increased levels of alpha-class and pi-class GSTin the CDNBr cells was not due to either geneamplification or increased mRNA levels and appears toinvolve either altered mRNA utilization or proteinstabilization.  In addition to being resistant to CDNB,the CDNBr cell line also showed a 2.5-fold resistance tocumene hydroperoxide but was not cross-resistant to theanticancer drug chlorambucil."    "The fact that the CDNB-resistant cell line wascross-resistant to cumene hydroperoxide is consistentwith the ability of alpha-class GST to reduce organichydroperoxides," the researchers wrote.  "However, it wassurprising that the resistant line was sensitive tochlorambucil.  There is strong evidence from the study ofchlorambucil-resistant cell lines and from gene-transferexperiments that the GST have the capacity to protectagainst the toxic effects of this compound.    "The reason why no cross-resistance to chlorambucilwas observed in the CDNBr cell line is unclear andsuggests that a number of interacting factors are neededto generate the drug-resistance phenotype."

Researcher Mario Petrini and colleagues reportpreliminary results from a pilot study begun in 1986 onpatients with acute myeloblastic leukemia treated forseveral months with low-dose ARA-C and vitamin D(3).During treatment or at the time of relapse, a monoblasticcomponent was frequently found.  A high percentage ofpatients were P-170 positive.    In the two cases of drug-resistance presented indetail by Petrini et al. conversion of blasts from P-170negative before ARA-C/vitamin D(3) treatment to P-170positive after treatment was significant in failure ofclinical response to the agents.    "The reported cases raise several issues about therole of low doses of ARA-C, the monoblastic shift ofleukemias during vitamin D(3) administration, thedevelopment of MDR and a possible therapeutic role ofcalcium antagonists," Petrini et al. wrote in thearticle, "Vitamin D(3) Administration and MultidrugResistance in Acute Nonlymphoblastic Leukemia," publishedin the 1993 89(4) issue of Acta Haematologica.    "The addition of the revertant drug nicardipine tothe previously inactive treatment induced a partialresponse.

In previous studies Julie K. Horton and colleaguesreported the synthesis and partial characterization of 21N(10)-substituted phenoxazines in reversing resistance tothe Vinca alkaloids.    "To more fully understand the mechanisms formodulating multidrug resistance (MDR), we havesynthesized a series of phenoxazine derivatives, basedupon our initial observation that phenoxazine, where the5-position sulfur of phenothiazine is replaced by anoxygen atom, was a more effective modulator of Vincaalkaloid accumulation than was phenothiazine," Horton etal. wrote in the article, "PharmacologicalCharacterization of N-Substituted Phenoxazines Directedtoward Reversing Vinca Alkaloid Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Cancer Cells," published in the October 1993issue of Physiological Reviews.    The researchers compared the activity of the 21N(10)-substituted phenoxazines in increasing Vincaalkaloid accumulation and reversing drug resistance intwo human colon carcinoma cell lines.    Results demonstrated that N-substituted phenoxazinesincreased accumulation of vinblastine and that, withinthis series, there was little correlation between the twocell lines when Vinca alkaloid accumulation was comparedat equal concentrations of modulator.  It was also shownthat N-substituted phenoxazines demonstrated bothquantitative and qualitative differences, compared withverapamil.  The series included at least two compounds,10-[3'-[N-bis(hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxazine and10-(N-piperidinoacetyl)phenoxazine, which increase Vincaalkaloid accumulation but do not significantly inhibitefflux.    Several of the MDR modulators significantly enhancedthe accumulation (8-50-fold) of Vinca alkaloids in celllines with very low or undetectable P-glycoproteinlevels.    "The studies presented here suggest that within theseries there are compounds that inhibit efflux(verapamil-like activity), whereas others markedlyincrease Vinca alkaloid accumulation without havingsignificant detectable inhibitory activity on the effluxcomponent," Horton et al. wrote.  "Several of thephenoxazine modulators characterized enhance Vincaalkaloid accumulation in cell lines where verapamil hasno significant activity.  Data support the concept thatinflux of Vinca alkaloids may be enhanced in a P-glycoprotein-independent manner by several N-substitutedphenoxazines."    Corresponding author Julie K.

Forty one patients with AML, including 27 atpresentation and 14 relapsed or resistant cases, wereassessed for laboratory evidence of the MDR phenotype byresearcher A.B. Mehta and colleagues from London's RoyalFree Hospital.  The study was reported in the October1993 issue of Leukemia and Lymphoma.    Leukemic cells from all 41 cases were studied byimmunocytochemistry using the JSB-1 monoclonal antibodyand simultaneously by reverse transcription polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate expression of the MDR1 gene.  Cells from 32 of the 41 cases were also assessedfor daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation and retention by flowcytometry (FC).    Nineteen of the 41 (46 percent) patients werepositive for MDR by JSB-1 immunocytochemistry (11 of 27at presentation and eight of 14 relapsed or resistantcases).  Nine of the 19 (47 percent) P-gp positive, denovo patients achieved complete remission.    Twenty-two patients were negative by JSB-1immunocytochemistry (16 of 27 at presentation and six of14 of the relapsed or resistant cases) and 11 of 22 (50percent) P-gp negative patients achieved a completeremission.    Of the 32 patients assessed by FC, seven (22 percent)were positive for the MDR phenotype with increased DNRaccumulation and retention in the presence of the MDRreversing agent verapamil (VPM).  Six out of seven of theFC positive cases were also JSB-1 positive, and six hadadditional poor risk features.    Of the 25 FC negative patients, six had receivedprevious chemotherapy and 15 (60 percent) achievedcomplete remission.  MDR 1 mRNA levels were increased inall seven FC positive cases whereas only seven of 19 JSB-1 positive cases had raised MDR 1 mRNA levels.    "These results suggest that the assessment of MDRstatus by immunocytochemistry using JSB-1 is notpredictive of response to chemotherapy," the authorsconclude.    "Flow cytometric analysis of blast cells appears tocorrelate well with MDR 1 mRNA levels and may be a betterpredictor of treatment outcome."    Corresponding author A.B.

Rhodamine 123 is a mitochondrial dye that is retainedfor prolonged periods by carcinoma cells.  In previousstudies it was reported that many transformed epithelialcell lines and carcinoma-derived cell lines retain thedye much longer than do normal epithelial cells.    An important factor that decreases rhodamine 123retention in cells is the MDR pump.  It has been widelyreported that resistance to cancer chemotherapy may becaused by a pump that removes drugs from cells, and thateffective substrates for the pump are lipophilic andcationic.  Compounds with these characteristics, such asverapamil, directly interact with the pump to inhibittransport of other substrates.    "Rhodamine 123 is a good substrate for the pump, aswould be predicted by its structure; retention of thisdye has been suggested to be an assay for the presence ofthe MDR pump in resistant cancer cells," researcher ErikM. Jancis and colleagues wrote in the article, "RapidStimulation of Rhodamine 123 Efflux From Multidrug-Resistant KB Cells By Progesterone," published in theNovember 2, 1993, issue of Biochemical Pharmacology.    "In the course of analyzing the factors thatcontribute to prolonged rhodamine 123 retention incarcinoma cells, we found that progesterone did notalways inhibit efflux of rhodamine 123 from KB cellsselected for multidrug resistance," the researcherswrote.    "While investigating causes of retention of this dye,we found that 10 uM progesterone caused a rapidstimulation of efflux of rhodamine 123 within 15 minutesfrom KB V20C cells, which overexpress the multidrugresistance pump."    Progesterone did not stimulate efflux from KB cellsthat do not overexpress the pump, and verapamil blockedrhodamine 123 efflux in the presence or absence ofprogesterone, indicating that rhodamine 123 is removedfrom KB V20C cells by the MDR pump.    "Progesterone, however, is unlikely to stimulaterhodamine 123 efflux by simply increasing pump activityfor two reasons:  (1) progesterone inhibited the effluxof daunomycin from KB V20C cells, so it did not stimulateefflux of all drugs, and (2) progesterone inhibitedefflux of rhodamine 123 from L1210/VMDRC cells and hadlittle effect on Adr(R) MCF7 cells; both overexpress themultidrug resistance pump," Jancis et al. reported.    In the experiments with KB V20C cells, progesteronewas the most active steroid tested.  At 10 uM,progesterone caused a 70-fold stimulation,desoxycorticosterone, testosterone, promegestone andestradiol caused about 20-fold stimulation, and othershad little or no effect.    "Progesterone may act by a non-genomic mechanism todecrease intracellular binding of rhodamine 123, makingthe dye accessible to the multidrug resistance pump," theauthors concluded.    "The results of this paper demonstrate that retentionof rhodamine 123 is rapidly changed by factors other thanthe simple overall activity of the multidrug resistancepump and so the interpretation of retention is morecomplex that simply reflecting the amount of themultidrug resistance pump.  Determining how progesteroneinfluences rhodamine 123 retention will not only lead toa greater understanding of why this dye is retained sowell by carcinoma cells but also may lead to newknowledge of progesterone actions."

"The HEPT derivatives have not been analyzed fortheir resistance to HIV-1 mutant strains that wereselected for resistance to the other classes of HIV-1-specific inhibitors and contain a well defined aminoacid substitution in their reverse transcriptase (RT)genome," researcher Jan Balzarini and colleagues wrote inthe article, "HIV-1 Drug-Resistance Patterns withDifferent HEPT Derivatives," published in the October1993 issue of Molecular Pharmacology.    "Nor has the emergence of drug-resistant virus underHEPT therapy been investigated.  In the present study, wefound that HEPT derivates in general remain inhibitory toHIV-1 strains selected for resistance to various otherclasses of HIV-1-specific inhibitors."    The researchers also found that HIV-1 mutant strainsselected for resistance to various other classes of HEPTderivatives show cross-resistance to virtually all ofother HIV-1-specific inhibitors.  Different HEPTderivatives were also found to select for differentmutations in the HIV-1 RT gene.    "When directly selected for resistance to the HEPTderivates, the HIV-1 mutant strains are resistant notonly to the HEPT derivatives but also to the other HIV-1-specific RT inhibitors," Balzarini et al. wrote.    "From a clinical viewpoint, our observations suggestthat the HEPT derivatives may be beneficial in thetreatment of those HIV-1 infections that have becomeresistant to other HIV-1-specific inhibitors."

Teratocarcinoma is the most common form of cancer inyoung adult men, consisting of two histologicalcomponents, embryonal carcinoma (EC) and teratoma.  ECcells are the stem cells from which the teratomacomponent is derived.  EC is highly malignant with atendency to early metastatic spread, but also respondswell to therapy with cisplatin.    Resistance to cisplatin can be due to reduced drugaccumulation and increased detoxification of drug in thecellular cytoplasm, but mechanisms of resistance are notuniform and vary among different cell lines.    In this study researcher Hetty Timmer-Bosscha andcolleagues describe the Tera-CP subline, which enablesthe study of cisplatin-resistance in extremely sensitivecells and the effect of serial cisplatin incubations onthe EC phenotype of the cells.    "In the embryonal carcinoma cell line Tera and its3.7-fold cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin)-resistant subline, Tera-CP, parameters were studied thatmight have changed in relation to induction of cisplatinresistance," Timmer-Bosscha et al. wrote in the article,"cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) Resistance In Vitro andIn Vivo in Human Embryonal Carcinoma Cells," published inthe December 1, 1993, issue of Cancer Research.    "Phenotypes of both lines were embryonal carcinoma.Karyotypes were related with a decreased mean number ofchromosomes and fewer copies of the short arm ofchromosome 12 in Tera-CP."    Tera-CP showed cross-resistance for melphalan and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and had an 1.4-foldincreased glutathione (GSH) level, a 1.5-fold increasedglutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, and a 1.4-foldincreased GSTpi expression compared to Tera.    Tera-CP was cross-resistant to 5-fluorouracil, butthymidylate synthase activity was not increased.Topoisomerase I and II activities and c-myc RNA andprotein expression were the same in both lines.    Platinum accumulation was equal in both lines, andplatinum-DNA binding was lower in Tera-CP than in Tera.Both cell lines were xenografted into nude mice andtumors showed marked differentiation.    Tera-CP tumors were 2.8-fold more resistant tocisplatin than Tera tumors.  In new cell lines derivedfrom xenografts of Tera and Tera-CP cisplatinsensitivity, GST activity and GSH level corresponded withtheir sensitivity and resistant origin.    "Tera-CP is a model of in vitro and in vivo cisplatinresistance with the GSH/GST detoxifying system as animportant mechanism," the researchers wrote.  "Cisplatinresistance could be induced without a concomitantincrease in differentiation."

AERUGINOSA DUE TO ORFC-DEPENDENT DRUG EFFLUX    ORFC-dependent drug efflux contributes to multipleantibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,according to a report from Ontario, Canada's Queen'sUniversity.    P. aeruginosa is a clinically significant pathogencharacterized by intrinsic resistance to a number ofantimicrobial agents.    Recently researcher Keith Poole and colleaguesidentified an operon (ORFABC) in P. aeruginosa apparentlyinvolved in pyoverdine secretion.    "We report here the characterization of ORFC, whichencodes an outer membrane protein whose overproduction isassociated with multiple antibiotic resistance," Poole etal. wrote in the article, "Multiple Antibiotic Resistancein Pseudomonas-aeruginosa - Evidence for Involvement ofan Efflux Operon," published in the November 1993 issueof Journal of Bacteriology.    An outer membrane protein of 50 kDa (OprK) wasoverproduced in a siderophore-deficient mutant of P.aeruginosa capable of growth on iron-deficient minimalmedium containing 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.5 mM).    "The expression of OprK in the mutant (strain K385)was associated with enhanced resistance to a number ofantimicrobial agents, including ciprofloxacin, nalidixicacid, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptonigrin.OprK was inducible in the parent strain by growth undersevere iron limitation, as provided, for example, by theaddition of dipyridyl or ZnSO4 to the growth medium,"Poole et al. wrote.    "The gene encoding OprK (previously identified asORFC) forms part of an operon composed of three genes(ORFABC) implicated in the secretion of the siderophorepyoverdine.  Mutants defective in ORFA, ORFB or ORFCexhibited enhanced susceptibility to tetracycline,chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, streptonigrin anddipyridyl, consistent with a role for the ORFABC operonin multiple antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa."    Sequence analysis of ORFC revealed that its productis homologous to a class of outer membrane proteinsinvolved in export.  Similarly, the products of ORFA andORFB exhibit homology to previously described bacterialexport proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane.    "These data suggest that ORFA-ORFB-oprK (ORFC)-dependent drug efflux contributes to multiple antibioticresistance in P. aeruginosa," the authors noted.  "Wepropose, therefore, the designation mexAB (multipleefflux) for ORFAB."

Researcher G. Chen and colleagues examinedthaliblastine (TBL), a natural compound, in a murinestudy examining a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor cellline.    "TBL showed a twofold higher cytotoxicity in acisplatin-resistant rat ovarian tumor cell line (0-342/cisplatin) than in its parental sensitive line (0-342), as determined by an antiproliferation assay with24-hour continuous exposure," Chen et al. wrote in thearticle, "Collateral Sensitivity to Thaliblastine and/orHyperthermia Exhibited by a Rat Ovarian Tumor Cell LineSelected for Resistance to Cisplatin," published in theSeptember-October 1993 issue of Anticancer Research.    This phenomenon was also observed following two-hourpulse exposure if combined with heat treatment (40deg.C).Further escalation of the temperature to 43deg.C alonebrought about 74.7 +/- 17.0 percent growth inhibition inthe sensitive and 97.2 +/- 1.8 percent in the resistantline.    "Under this condition, the ID50 of TBL was again onlyhalf as much in 0-342/cisplatin cells as in the parentalcells (12 vs 24 mug/ml) when compared to the hyperthermictreatment alone," Chen et al. wrote.  "In a colonyformation assay with two-hour pulse exposure, thehypersensitivity of the resistant cells to cisplatinand/or heat was further confirmed."    Alkaline elution showed that 24-hour continuoustreatment with TBL induced DNA single-strand breaks (SSB)in a dose-dependent manner in 0-342/cisplatin cells,whereas there was almost no DNA-SSB production by TBL inthe sensitive line, possibly in part accounting for thehypersensitivity of the cisplatin resistant cells to TBL.    The heat treatment (40deg.C for two hours) inducedsingle strand breaks in both lines, which was furtherenhanced by combination with TBL.    This damage was repaired in part in 0-342 but almostcompletely in 0-342/cisplatin line after cells grew indrug-free medium for 48 hours following the exposure,indicating that resistant cells can more efficientlyrepair DNA damage by either TBL or hyperthermia.    "Altogether, these results suggest that TBL may havethe potential to be used clinically as an alternative inthe treatment of cisplatin-resistant malignancies withhyperthermia," the authors concluded.

Researcher H. Morimoto and colleagues described twopodophyllotoxin analogs in their article, "CytotoxicActivity Against Resistant Human Tumor Cell Lines by TwoSynthetic Demethylpodophyllotoxin Derivatives - A SingleStereoisomeric Change Prevents Cell Death by Apoptosis,"published in the December 1993 issue of the InternationalJournal of Oncology.    "The present study investigated the cytotoxicproperties of two synthetic podophyllotoxin derivativesnamely 4-o-butanoyl-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin (BEPT)and 4-o-butanoyl-4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin (BDPTN orBN58705)," Morimoto et al. wrote.    Both BEPT and BDPTN were shown to be cytotoxicagainst a battery of human tumor cell lines.    "In comparison to etoposide, the magnitude ofcytotoxic activity by BEPT and BDPTN was higher," theresearchers wrote.  "Furthermore, both compounds werecytotoxic to drug resistant lines and also were able toovercome the etoposide and cross-resistance of an MDRpositive cell line."    The mechanism of cytotoxicity was also examined.Like etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and inducerof apoptosis, BEPT was found to mediate its cytotoxicactivity by an apoptotic pathway.  BDPTN, however, didnot mediate apoptosis.    "These findings demonstrate that a simplemodification in the stereoisomeric structure results insignificant modification in both the cytotoxic patternsand the induction of apoptosis," Morimoto et al. wrote."Furthermore, the findings show that the podophyllotoxinanalogs can overcome drug resistance and suggest theirpossible application in the therapy of resistant tumors."

Researcher R.C. Spencer and colleagues examinedseveral beta-lactams in a multicenter in vitro studyinvolving 8,625 isolates from 13 countries, in an effortto determine both the current bacterial epidemiology inintensive care and hematology/oncology units and thecross-susceptibility of the organisms to cefpirome,ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and piperacillin.  Thespecimens were examined between May and November of 1992.    "Bacterial species with 20 or more isolates resistantto one of the six antibiotics were examined for theirsusceptibility to the beta-lactams," Spencer et al. wrotein the article, "Cross-Susceptibility of Cefpirome andFour Other beta-Lactams Against Isolates from HematologyOncology and Intensive Care Units," published in theSupplement 91, 1993 issue of Scandinavian Journal ofInfectious Diseases.    Cefpirome and imipenem had the smallest total numbersof isolates.  Bacteria resistant to ceftazidime orceftriaxone were often susceptible (>50 percent) tocefpirome.  Conversely, cefpirome resistant isolates werefrequently resistant (>90 percent) to ceftazidime andceftriaxone.  P. aeruginosa was an exception, exhibitingcross-resistance to all cephalosporins.    Beta-lactamase producing Enterobacter, Citrobacterand Klebsiella spp. were especially resistant topiperacillin and ceftazidime but not cefpirome orimipenem.  Two-thirds or more of coagulase-negativestaphylococci resistant to any single agent, includingimipenem, maintained their susceptibility to cefpirome.    Cross-class resistance was not exhibited by imipenemand cefpirome against ciprofloxacin resistant isolatesbut was more evident for piperacillin, ceftazidime andceftriaxone.  Cefpirome was more active than ceftazidimeagainst bacteria resistant to both piperacillin andgentamicin, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci(76 percent versus 6 percent) and Enterobacter spp. (56percent versus 21 percent).    Many coagulase-negative staphylococci andEnterobacter spp. resistant to two or three compounds(piperacillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime) remainedsusceptible to cefpirome (50-89 percent).    "These results suggest that cefpirome has a potentialclinical advantage against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria resistant to other beta-lactams,including imipenem," Spencer et al. conclude.

Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branchat Galveston found that enhancement by verapamil of theanti-trypansomal effects of ethidium were reflected inaccelerated clearing of the parasites from the blood, andby the increased production, in the treatment schedule,of dyskinetoplastic organisms.    K. Lemone Yielding and colleagues concomitantlyadministered verapamil during treatment for two differentstrains of the parasite with the anti-trypanosomiasisagents ethidium bromide or berenil.  This resulted inenhancement of the drug effect as shown by increasedformation of dyskinetoplastic organisms, increased ratesof clearing of the parasites from the blood, and byenhanced survival of infected mice.    Verapamil treatment was associated with increasedintracellular accumulation of drug, as shown byfluorescence of cells exposed to ethidium or DAPI, afluorescent surrogate for berenil.    "In keeping with the reported involvement ofverapamil in preventing efflux of drugs from cells,ethidium bromide accumulation in intact trypanosomes wasmonitored by fluorescence in the presence and absence ofverapamil, and was reflected by detectable fluorescencein treated cells at ethidium concentrations only 1/10 ofthose required for detection in the controls," Yieldinget al. wrote in the article, "Effect of Verapamil onAntitrypanosomal Activity of Drugs in Mice," published inthe October 1993 issue of Acta Tropica.    "These results suggest that verapamil can enhancedrug accumulation in trypanosomes as it does in drugresistant cancer cells and in chloroquine-resistantmalaria.  For trypanosomes the data do not permitassignment of the effect to either efflux or influx,however.  The findings in the present experiments suggestthat a verapamil sensitive gene product which caninfluence drug response is expressed constitutively intrypanosomes."    The authors conclude that if, as implied by theseresults, parasites express drug-resistance genesconstitutively, "the search for new drug strategies mustinclude manipulation of these resistance mechanisms inconcert with the application of new antiparasiticagents."

Verapamil, usually given as a racemic mixture,decreases in vivo and in vitro digoxin renal tubularsecretion, which is suggested to be mediated by P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent multidrug efflux pump.

"This renders it unlikely that resistant mutants willarise from changes in the enzyme structure," researcherC.S. Coleman and colleagues wrote in the article, "Effectof Mutations at Active Site Residues on the Activity ofOrnithine Decarboxylase and Its Inhibition by ActiveSite-Directed Irreversible Inhibitors," published in theNovember 25, 1993, issue of the Journal of BiologicalChemistry.    Mouse ODC and mutant changing residues thought to beinvolved at the active site were expressed in Escherichiacoli, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatographyon a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-agarose affinity column,and tested for their kinetic properties and theirinactivation by enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors.    "All of the mutant enzymes were expressed atcomparable levels to the wild type protein (2-4 percentof the total soluble protein), all bound to the affinitycolumn, and there were only small differences in theapparent K(m) values for L-ornithine, providing strongevidence that the mutations did not lead to any grosschanges in the protein structure," Coleman et al. wrote.    The mutation K69A led to a change in the spectrum ofthe enzyme and a 550-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m)(specificity constant) value.    "These results are consistent with lysine 69 beingthe residue that forms a Schiff base with the pyridoxal5'-phosphate co-factor," the researchers wrote."Mutation C70S did not greatly affect the activitydespite its proximity to this lysine but increased theK(m) about 2-fold.  In contrast, the mutation C360Agreatly reduced the specificity constant (by 26-fold)despite a 2-fold decrease in the K(m), suggesting thatthis cysteine residue is critically involved at theactive site."    Although cysteine 360 is known to be the major siteof binding of the inhibitor DFMO, the C360A mutant wasstill sensitive to inhibition by this drug.  However, thekinetics of inactivation were altered, the partitionratio was 10 times greater, and the labeled adduct formedby reaction with [5-C-14] DFMO was removed from theprotein under some denaturing conditions.  This adductwas found to occur at lysine 69.    The K69A mutant was also sensitive to DFMO with alower partition ratio than the wild type enzyme.    "These results indicate that inactivation of ODC byDFMO can occur via interaction with either of twoseparate residues that form essential parts of the activesite." Coleman et al. wrote.    "In contrast to the results with DFMO, the C360Amutant ODC was completely resistant to inactivation by(R,R)-delta-methyl-alpha-acetylenicputrescine and wasmuch less sensitive than the wild type enzyme to alpha-monofluoromethyldehydromethylornithine, showing that thereactive species formed from these inhibitors eithercannot be formed by this mutant or are unable to reactwith lysine 69.  Finally, the well known, extremereliance of mammalian ODC on the presence of thiol-reducing agents to maintain activity is probablyexplained by the critical role of cysteine 360, since theC360A mutant was much less sensitive to inactivation byincubation in the absence of dithiothreitol."

The other 15 casesincluded the following infections:  6 lower urinary tract(one with bacteremia), 6 line-related bacteremias, 2peritonitis, 1 wound, 1 CNS, 1 lower respiratory tract.14 (93%) were nosocomial with median of 22 days betweenadmission and infection.  9 patients (60%) requiredintensive care units during hospitalization.  Antibioticsreceived before infection included VAN (10 patients), GM(10), cephalosporins (12) and other beta-lactams (11).All isolates were sensitive to CHL (MIC <4 mcg/ml) and 11patients were treated with CHL:  9 (36%) treated patientsare alive without infection after median follow-up of28.5 days; 6 died, but in 9 there was sterilization ofcultures on CHL.  One patient who relapsed after initialtreatment is alive on CHL at the end of the observationperiod.  Conclusions:  CHL was used to treat resistant E.faecium infections, however, success was limited bysignificant co-morbidity.  In some patients CHL may beuseful for treatment of resistant Enterococcal infectionsand susceptibility testing for CHL should be considered."Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG RESISTANCE WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1994Combination Therapy with Zidovudine (AZT) and Didanosine(ddI) Selects for AZT Resistant HIV-1 (HIV) StrainsLacking a ddI-Resistance MutationAUTHORS:  R.W.

According to an abstract presented by the authors tothe 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Societyof America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,Louisiana, "Introduction:  Antiviral drug resistance,induced by specific pol gene mutations, has been linkedto clinical progression in HIV-infected patientsreceiving antiretroviral drug therapy.  Experiments withHIV constructs suggest that, in some cases, mutationsselected for by one antiretroviral drug may lessenresistance induced by another antiretroviral drug.  Forinstance, a ddI-resistance mutation at codon 74 of theHIV pol gene has been shown to suppress the effects of anAZT-resistance mutation at codon 215 of the HIV pol gene.Method:  We studied drug susceptibilities (using an invitro culture assay) and drug-resistance mutations (usinga nested PCR protocol) of HIV strains from pts with 200-500 CD4 cells/ul, treated for 1 year with either AZT andddI (24 pts) or ddI alone (26 pts).  Results:  HIV couldnot be cultured from 7.5-12.5 million peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMC) after 1 year in 10/24 (42%)combination therapy pts.  Among the 14 culture-positivepts on combination therapy, 8 (57%) had an IC(90) (uMZDV) >/=10-fold higher than the IC(90) of a pre-therapyisolate.  10/14 (79%) culture-positive combinationtherapy pts had a codon 215 mutation in PBMC (3 pts)and/or plasma (10 pts); in contrast, 10/10 culture-negative combination therapy pts had a wildtype sequenceat codon 215 in PBMC or plasma (P=0.002).  ddIsusceptibilities of the combination therapy patients andthe ddI monotherapy pts were similar.  However a ddI-resistance mutation at codon 74 was detected in 13/26patients on ddI monotherapy as opposed to 2/24 patientson combination therapy (P=0.004).  Conclusion:  To growin the presence of AZT and ddI, HIV strains acquired anAZT-resistance mutation but lacked a ddI-resistancemutation.  The drug-resistance mutations selected in theclinical setting of combination therapy may be explainedby previous in vitro findings."Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG RESISTANCE WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1994Relevance of Gentamicin-Mezlocillin Synergy at LGHAUTHORS:  R.O.

According to an abstract presented by the authors tothe 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Societyof America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,Louisiana, "Presently, at Lutheran General Hospital, a742 bed acute care teaching hospital, the drugacquisition cost for an average dose of gentamicin is$1.50; for tobramycin, $13; and for amikacin, $56.  With800 patient days per month of aminoglycoside therapyprescribed, the cost implications of routine use ofaminoglycoside antibiotics other than gentamicin would besignificant.  At many hospitals, antibiotic choice isbased on 'worst case scenarios' for presumedmicrobiologic etiology of clinical syndromes, and part ofthe decision equation is the antibiogram, whichsummarizes the antibiotic susceptibility data from themost recent available time period.  Based on data fromour Vitek system, only 73% of Pseudomonas isolates weresusceptible to gentamicin, whereas 98% were susceptibleto tobramycin (We do not routinely print out amikacinsusceptibility.)  Because of concern, that in the unknownclinical setting, there could be a Pseudomonas bacteremiathat would not be successfully treatable if theantibiotic program recommended were ineffective 27% ofthe time, we asked our epidemiology laboratory to look atthe 'resistant' Pseudomonas isolates more closely.  Wefound that 84% of 'gentamicin resistant' isolates, in thepresence of mezlocillin showed synergy with gentamicinmics of 2ug or less.  Since we always advise the usage of2 drug therapy for treatment of non-urinary potentialPseudomonas infections, we were able to recalculate theantibiotic profile to 95% gentamicin susceptible in thepresence of mezlocillin.  The actual number ofPseudomonas isolates identified each month averaged 32,representing 1 isolate for every 25 patient days ofaminoglycoside therapy.  Based on these observations, wehave continued to include gentamicin as part of ourtreatment of choice in our guidelines for empiricantibiotic therapy."Back to Headline List CopyrightDRUG RESISTANCE WEEKLY via NewsNetJanuary 17, 1994Penicillin Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniaeStrains:  Analysis and ImplicationsAUTHORS:  A.Z.

The Sulfonylurea Drug, Glimepiride,Stimulates Glucose Transport, Glucose TransporterTranslocation, and Dephosphorylation in Insulin-ResistantRat Adipocytes InvitroSOURCE:   Diabetes, December 1993;42(12):1852-1867.    According to the authors' abstract of an articlepublished in Diabetes, "Sulfonylurea drugs are widelyused in the therapy of NIDDM.  The improvement of glucosetolerance after long-term treatment of NIDDM patientswith the drug can be explained by stimulation of glucoseutilization in peripheral tissues that are characterizedby insulin resistance in these patients.  We studiedwhether the novel sulfonylurea drug, glimepiride,stimulates glucose transport into isolated insulin-resistant rat adipocytes.  After long-term incubation ofthe cells in primary culture with high concentrations ofglucose, glutamine, and insulin, stimulation of glucosetransport by insulin was significantly reduced both withrespect to maximal responsiveness (65% decrease ofV(max)) and sensitivity (2.6-fold increase of ED50)compared with adipocytes cultured in medium containing alow concentration of glucose and no insulin.  Thisreflects insulin resistance of glucose transport.  Incontrast, both responsiveness and sensitivity of glucosetransport toward stimulation by glimepiride were onlymarginally reduced in insulin-resistant adipocytes (15%decrease of V(max); 1.2-fold increase of ED(50)) versuscontrol cells.  Glimepiride, in combination with glucoseand glutamine during the primary culture, causeddesensitization of the glucose transport system towardstimulation by insulin, but to a lesser degree thaninsulin itself (50% reduction of V(max); ninefoldincrease of ED(50)).  Again, the maximal responsivenessand sensitivity of glucose transport toward stimulationby glimepiride were only slightly diminished.  Thepresence of glimepiride during primary culture did notantagonize the induction of insulin resistance of glucosetransport.  The stimulation of glucose transport ininsulin-resistant adipocytes by glimepiride is caused bytranslocation of glucose transporters from low-densitymicrosomes to plasma membranes as demonstrated bysubcellular fractionation and immunoblotting with anti-GLUT1 and anti-GLUt4 antibodies.  Immunoprecipitation ofGLUT4 from 32Pi-and [S-35]methionine-labeled adipocytesrevealed that the insulin resistance of GLUT4translocation is accompanied by increased (three- tofourfold) phosphorylation of GLUT4 in both low-densitymicrosomes and plasma membranes.  Short-term treatment ofdesensitized adipocytes with glimepiride or insulinreduced GLUT4 phosphorylation by approximately 70 and25%, respectively, in both fractions.  We conclude thatglimepiride activates glucose transport by stimulation ofGLUT1 and GLUT4 translocation in rat adipocytes viainterference at a site downstream of the putativemolecular defect in the signaling cascade between theinsulin receptor and the glucose transport system inducedby high concentrations of glucose and insulin.  Themolecular site of glimepiride action is related to GLUT4phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, which may regulateglucose transporter activity and translocation.  These invitro findings implicate an additional mode ofsulfonylurea action in the improvement of glucosetolerance of NIDDM patients."

ConstitutiveVariability in the Pharmacokinetics of the Natural Retinoid, All-Trans-Retinoic Acid, and Its Modulation by KetoconazoleSOURCE:   Journal of the National Cancer Institute,December 1, 1993;85(23):1921-1926.    According to the authors' abstract of an articlepublished in the Journal of the National CancerInstitute, "Background:  All-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans RA) induces complete remission in most patientswith acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  However,continuous oral dosing results in progressive decline inplasma drug concentrations, which is associated withrelapse and resistance to this retinoid.  We speculatedthat the decline in drug levels, indicating acquiredresistance, resulted partly from inducible cytochrome-P450 oxidative enzymes, which can catabolize all-transRA.  Purpose:  We studied the clinical pharmacology ofall-trans RA in cancer patients to determine possiblemechanisms of acquired resistance and evaluated thepotential for reversal by ketoconazole, an inhibitor ofcytochrome-P450 oxidative enzymes.  Methods:  Serialplasma samples were obtained from 54 patients with APL oradvanced lung cancer after a single oral dose of all-trans RA (45 mg/m(2)).  In the 34 patients with advancedlung cancer, all-trans RA (45 mg/m(2)) was administeredtwice daily for 4 weeks, and, on days 2, 28, and 29,serial plasma samples were again obtained after a single45-mg/m(2) dose.  One hour prior to drug administrationon days 2 and 29, a single oral dose (200-1200 mg) ofketoconazole was administered.  Endogenous plasmaconcentrations of all-trans RA and 13-cis-retinoic acidwere measured in a subset of these patients and in 11with early-stage lung cancer.  Results:  The mean areaunder the curve for plasma drug concentration times time(AUC) for all-trans RA on day 1 varied substantiallyamong patients.  Compared with patients with APL, the 28patients with advanced lung cancer who completed therapydemonstrated significantly lower AUC levels on day 1(P=.06); a subgroup with levels less than 300 ng/mL perhour on day 1 had lower endogenous plasma all-trans RAconcentrations than patients with APL or early-stage lungcancer or 14 normal subjects.  Following continuous oraltreatment, the mean day 28 AUC for all-trans RA wassignificantly lower than that on day 1 (213 ng/mL perhour versus 467 ng/mL per hour; P<.01), a declinesignificantly attenuated by ketoconazole, which increasedthe mean plasma all-trans RA AUC on day 29 to 375 ng/mLper hour (P<.01).  Conclusion:  Reported variability forthe pharmacokinetics of all-trans RA may result fromdisease-related or population-based differences in basalcatabolic rates influenced by genetic or environmentalfactors.  However, the pattern of inducible catabolism ofall-trans RA is not disease specific.  Ketoconazoleattenuates this accelerated catabolism, suggesting thatoxidation by cytochrome-P450 enzymes is an importantpathway for both constitutive and induced pathways ofall-trans RA metabolism."

Hippocampal Sclerosis in Epilepsy andChildhood Febrile SeizuresSOURCE:   Lancet, December 4, 1993;342(8884):1391-1394.    According to the authors' abstract of an articlepublished in the Lancet, "The connection betweenhippocampal sclerosis and childhood febrile seizures(CFS) is a contentious issue in the study of epilepsy.We investigated 107 patients with drug-resistant epilepsyby high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging(MRI).  20 had a history of CFS, 45 had focal (26) ordiffuse (19) hippocampal volume loss (HVL).  Thefrequency of CFS was significantly (P<0.001) higher inthe patients with HVL, especially of the diffuse pattern,compared to other epileptic patients without HVL and tothe general population.  Furthermore, the severity of HVLwas greatest in those with a history of CFS.  No otherclinical or demographic features were associated witheither a history of CFS or HVL.  The frequency of CFS inpatients with other structural congenital causes ofepilepsy did not differ from that in a generalpopulation.  Although these findings show thathippocampal sclerosis is strongly associated with ahistory of CFS, they do not indicate whether this is acausal relationship.  If CFS do cause some cases ofhippocampal sclerosis, this can not be the onlymechanism, as 64% of those with HVL gave no history ofCFS.  As diffuse HVL is more strongly associated with ahistory of CFS than focal HVL, it is also possible thatCFS convert pre-existing congenital focal abnormalitiesinto diffuse hippocampal sclerosis.  Given thepossibility that CFS may cause hippocampal damage andepilepsy, they require urgent medical intervention."

Activation of theMouse mdr3 Gene by Insertion of Retroviruses inMultidrug-Resistant P388 Tumor CellsSOURCE:   Molecular and Cellular Biology, December1993;13(12):7380-7392.    According to the authors' abstract of an articlepublished in Molecular and Cellular Biology, "Inmultidrug-resistant (MDR) derivatives of the mouselymphoid tumor P388, the emergence of MDR is associatedwith overexpression and transcriptional activation of themdr3 gene, either in the absence of (P388/VCR-10) orconcomitant with (P388/ADM-2) gene amplification.  Inboth instances, Northern (RNA) blotting analyses havesuggested the presence of altered mdr3 transcripts inthese cells, possibly originating from noveltranscription initiation sites.  The mechanismsunderlying mdr3 overexpression in these cells have beeninvestigated.  In P388/VCR-10 cells, Southern blottinganalyses together with genomic DNA cloning and nucleotidesequencing have demonstrated the presence of an intactmouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) within the boundaries ofintron 1 of mdr3.  cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencingindicated that this integration event results in thesynthesis and overexpression of a hybrid MMTV-mdr3 mRNAwhich initiates within the U3 region of the 5' longterminal repeat (LTR) of the provirus.  Consequently,this mRNA lacks the normal exon 1 of mdr3 but contains(i) MMTV LTR-derived sequences at its 5' end, (ii) anovel mdr3 exon, mapping within the boundaries of intron1 downstream of the MMTV integration site and generatedby alternative splicing, and (iii) an otherwise intact 3'portion of mdr3 starting at exon 2.  A similar type ofanalysis of P388/ADM-2 cells revealed that mdr3overexpression in these cells is associated with theintegration of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) withinan L1Md repetitive element, immediately upstream of mdr3.The IAP insertion results in the overexpression of hybridIAP-mdr3 mRNA transcripts that initiate within the 3' LTRof the IAP and which contain IAP LTR-derived sequences atthe 5' end spliced 14 nucleotides upstream of the normalexon 1 of mdr3.  Taken together, these results indicatethat independent retroviral insertions were the initialmutagenic event responsible for mdr3 overexpression andsurvival during drug selection of these cell lines.Amplification of the rearranged and activated mdr3 genecopy occurred during further selection for high-leveldrug resistance in P388/ADM-2 cells."

Stanley, named to fill the vacancycreated by the departure last year of Tom Elkin (HAA 5/12, p.  1), doesn't buythe complaint that the HMO rate reductions negotiated by her predecessor onbehalf of the million-person pool have sliced too close to the financial bone.Quite the contrary.  "I have reviewed the loss ratios and it struck me thatthere is some room" to cut, she says.Stanley, who served as administrator of the Washington Health Care Authorityfor the past seven years, has established herself as a price-maker rather thana price-taker.  In Washington, she negotiated rate cuts with 19 HMOs andpoint-of-service plans on behalf of a pool of 300,000 public employees andtheir families.  Rates for those employees dropped an average of 6 percent in1995 and will remain flat this year.  But Stanley, formerly an HMO executivewith Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska and Group Health Cooperative of PugetSound agreed to let HMOs in Washington raise rates 2.9 percent in 1997.In Washington, Stanley was also head of Washington's Basic Health Plan.Despite the widespread perception that the state gutted its health reform lawlast year, lawmakers kept funds to subsidize purchase of the plan by 330,000low-income uninsured residents and their children.

The $40 million comes from thesale last spring of AHA's liability reinsurance company, Health ProvidersInsurance Co.

The three largest pharmacy chainsin the state - chains that fill Medco prescriptions under other contracts andhad therefore been included in the network Medco used to win the statecontract - announced they would not fill prescriptions under the plan.  Theysaid the reimbursement rate was so low that they would lose money on eachtransaction.  In all, 600 outlets making up about 60 percent of the drugstores in the state nixed participation.Medco insisted that the rates it was planning to pay the stores, while belowwhat they had been getting, were in line with payments under similar plans inother states.  The firm scrambled to find enough other outlets to providestatewide coverage, but couldn't satisfy state officials in time.  "Medcopromised something it couldn't deliver," Brown complained; the attorneygeneral's office began looking into whether the PBM firm had mademisrepresentations about its delivery network in its September bid.  AfterMaryland canceled the Medco contracts, officials told workers to keep dealingwith PCS, and began planning to garner new bids in early spring.  In the newround, the state may demand that bidders show contracts at the bid price withthe outlets they claim are in their networks.But at the same time, state law enforcement officials began investigating thedecision by the big chains to reject the Medco business.  The question:  Werethe decisions arrived at individually, or were they the fruit of an unlawfulconspiracy among the chains?

For some, it's that buying is made easy.  But for the MinnesotaBusiness Coalition, the feature that makes its insurance plan a real winner isbudgetability.  The fact that a company that signs up now has a guaranteedrate cap through 1998 is what has allowed the program to almost double in sizein the year it has been in operation, say the top officials of the EmployersAssn.  (EA) and the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, its two sponsoringorganizations.  The coalition now supplies insurance to 18,000 persons at 275companies.Of course, it's important that the rate guarantee is an attractive one.  Whenthe coalition began at the start of 1995, it had a contract with Allina HealthSystem's Medica HMO calling for 1996 rates to go up no more than 6.5 percentand the hike in 1997 to be no more than 6 percent.  But when it emerged inDecember from negotiations with Allina, EA's James Mulrooney says, "there wasvery powerful news:  we had beat the cap."  In fact, rates are going up only4.9 percent this year.  And Allina promised that the 1998 rates will be nomore than 6 percent above 1997's.An employer doesn't get an immediate bargain when it joins the coalition.  Itsinitial rates are based on the demographic characteristics and claimsexperience of its workforce.  But in all subsequent years, all those coveredare treated as part of the same pool, and any year-to-year increases are auniform percentage from that initial rate.  A company must sign on for atleast three years, and promise to pick up for its workers at least half of thetotal cost.  Almost all of the coalition participants offered health coveragebefore, and a substantial number - close to 20 percent - have more than 100employees.The coalition was born when Prudential, which had long sold a health plan toEA members, in mid-1994 announced it would no longer offer a managed careproduct in the Twin Cities.  EA sifted through bids from other plans, andpicked Medica, but at the same time decided it would be in a strongerbargaining position if it teamed up with the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.Two Medica plans are available; one uses a broad 6,000-doctor network and nogatekeeper, the other has a much more limited choice of physicians andrequires that all referrals to specialists be from a primary care provider.To get into the coalition plan, a business must be a member of one of the twogroups.  The coalition itself imposes no fees; the work is done by staffers ofthe two business organizations.In addition to the three-year rate cap, the other demand from the coalitionwas that the winning HMO keep up a constant program of health educationefforts for enrollees.  Much of that effort last year was dedicated toprofiling workers to pinpoint just which topics would produce the biggestpayoff in holding down health care outlays.  That produced the priority listfor this year's program:  back pain, stress, heart disease, and smokingcessation.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996New Texas Regulations for HMOs Mandate Extensive ER Out-of-Network CoverageTexas is a fertile ground for the growth of managed care.  A new report byInterStudy (see below) rates Galveston as the small market with the greatestHMO growth potential, and spotlights Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Ft.  Worth,Lubbock, Amarillo, and Waco as other comers.  But as of Jan.  1, plans eyeingthose markets must cope with new insurance regulations from the state Dept.of Insurance.  The regulations were developed on orders from Gov.  George W.Bush (R) after he vetoed as "too much government regulation" HMO restrictionspassed by the legislature.The most controversial part of the new rules covers reimbursement foremergency services from out-of-network providers.  Not only is Texas requiringthat plans cover all medical examinations performed by emergency careproviders and all services to stabilize an emergency condition, but it is alsomandating HMOs okay coverage of post-stabilization services -thereby closingthe option of later denying coverage for doctor-approved treatment.  This,complains Geoff Wurzel, executive director of the Texas HMO Assn., undercutsthe goal of reducing unnecessary use of emergency rooms and "could pull theprimary care doctor out of the role of directing the care of his or herpatient."The new regulations also demand that plans provide enrollees policy outlines"in a readable and understandable format" that detail:* services covered, including limitations and exclusions, * how members canobtain treatment when they are away from their hometowns, * preauthorizationrequirements, and * appeals procedures.The new regulations also give bargaining muscle to doctors who want to sign upwith a reluctant HMO - although less than the advocates of an any willingprovider provision had hoped for.  The HMO does not have to accept anapplicant, but does have to explain in writing why it has said "no" and makeavailable any economic profiling data that played a part in that decision.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996THE 25 HOTTEST AREAS FOR HMO GROWTHRANK MARKET1 Galveston TX2 Springfield IL{3 Cedar Rapids IA{3 Lubbock TX{3 Ft.

But the longer the plans operate, the easier it is for analysts topinpoint the factors that make an area ripe for rapid HMO growth.  A new setof calculations from InterStudy, the Minneapolis-based group that has beenfollowing the industry since 1973, produces a list of the hot targets for HMOexpansion.  The list ranges from markets that already have a lot of patientsin managed care - such as Sacramento CA and Rochester NY, where penetration ismore than 50 percent - to cities where the concept now barely has a toehold.Everywhere, plans that are already successful in keeping down the days ofhospitalization per 1,000 enrollees are poised for zesty growth.  That's thesituation in Los Angeles, Albany, and Jersey City, for example.  Equallyimportant is the plan proving that it gives adequate care to those who do needto go to the hospital:  the higher the average length of stay, the higher thepotential for HMO growth (a factor deemed important in the healthy projectionsfor such markets as St.  Louis, Pittsburgh, and Newark).But perhaps the most significant InterStudy finding is that major growthstimulants are different in different sized markets:In big cities, the fact that HMOs have already garnered a big chunk of thepopulation is likely to lead to more growth.  HMOs that have ties to preferredprovider organizations (PPO) already established in the market are good betsfor growth, but it is actually a deterrent to HMO signups for the managed careplan to be affiliated with an indemnity insurer that is successful in themarket.In medium-sized cities, what counts is competition.  If there are more thantwo competing plans, it inhibits growth; it is especially inhibiting if therival already has a big market share.  And it is a deterrent if the HMO isaffiliated with a PPO.  But the presence of for-profit plans spurs further HMOgrowth.In smaller towns, the key issue is whether those enrolled in public programsare already in HMOs; if there's a popular Medicare managed care plan and if asignificant number of Medicaid participants are in HMOs, rapid growth can beexpected.  Here, it is the presence of not-for-profit plans that is anindicator that the market will take off.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996High Pay for HMO Execs Blasted in New StudyWhen doctors set out to set up their own managed care organizations, theyalways say that one advantage the plans will have is that they will not paythe kind of salaries that insurers pay the executives who run their HMOs.  Nowthe doctors have gotten some support from a survey of executive compensationthat finds that in fact those at the top of commercial health insurancecompanies do take home disproportionately high pay.  The report from Graef S.Crystal, a compensation specialist who has long complained that many publiccompanies pay their top brass too much, also spotlights pharmaceutical andbiotechnology firms as paying chief executives far more than other types ofcompanies of similar size and performance pay their counterparts.Crystal began with a three-year pay average - including salary, stock options,bonuses, and all other forms of compensation - of the CEOs of 896publicly-traded businesses.  About 40 percent of the differences he foundcould be attributed to company size or to rewards given brass who had boostedtheir corporation's dividends or stock prices.  The rest he attributed toindustry practices.  As a group, those running health insurance companies got80 percent above the average for all businesses of their size and trackrecords - a figure at least partially explained by the heavy use of stockoptions as compensation and the escalating stock prices since the beginning ofthe study in 1992.  The $6.1 million a year made by Foundation Health CEODaniel D.  Crowley was calculated by Crystal to be 277 percent above theaverage for its group.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996SC Blues See Big Profits Selling Network SoftwareFor tyro networks of hospitals and physicians to be truly integrated, theyneed ways to communicate treatment and financial information quickly andreliably.  And Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina is eyeing thatneed as a potential moneymaker.  Within months, the insurer expects to rollout, through its Companion Technologies subsidiary, software that willintegrate hospital computer systems and the practice management systems ofaffiliated doctors into an existing South Carolina Health Information Network.The next step:  licensing the software in North Carolina, Kentucky, Florida,and Texas, where Companion already has a major market presence.  Hookup andtransaction fees will be other sources of revenue.The existing network already links every hospital in South Carolina and 60percent of the doctors.  It allows providers to submit claims electronicallyto virtually any payer, and get answers to questions about patient eligibilityand the status of pending claims.  The next step is to add an automatedutilization review system that will give providers access to the Blues'treatment protocols and automatic okays for admissions and stay continuationsthat fit within those protocols.For integrated delivery networks, Companion promises additional services.  Forinstance, the plan will store information stripped from detailed billings,patient statements, and claim forms for use by customer servicerepresentatives at the providers' offices.  When a patient calls with abilling question, the representative can pull that information from the Blues'mainframe computer and have it presented on one screen.  "That's a big-timeproductivity enhancement," says Companion marketing vice-president David Ward.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996American Ambivalence:  For-profits Called Efficient But Not Community-mindedIn the first week of November 1995, Louis Harris & Associates conductedtelephone interviews with a randomly-selected representative 1,007 adultsacross the country to gauge their perceptions - not their knowledge - ofownership trends in the health care industry.  Respondents correctly spottedthe trend towards more and more hospitals and health plans being in the handsof for-profit corporations and decried the development, but admitted that itmade little difference in their own selection decisions.  Here is an excerptfrom the report on the results by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which fundedthe survey:Americans generally believe for-profit care organizations, whether hospitals,HMOs or other health insurance plans, are more efficient and provide a betterquality service than their not-for-profit counterparts, but they also thinkfor-profits are less community-oriented and more costly for the individualconsumer, according to new survey findings reported by the Kaiser FamilyFoundation.  The survey also finds that most Americans perceive a trendtowards for-profit health care to be underway in this country and a majority(54%) believe this to be a "bad thing" for health care.  A quarter (24%) thinkthe increase in for-profit health care doesn't matter very much and 19% say itis a "good thing" for health care in this country.When it comes to making decisions about their own health care, however, thelargest group - 46 percent of Americans - say an organization's profit statusdoesn't make much of a difference in who they "trust to provide [them] withhigh quality health care at a reasonable price."  Almost equal percentagesspecify a preference for not-for-profit (26%) as do for for-profit (25%)."This data illustrates the ambivalence that exists on the part of the publictoward for-profit and not-for-profit health care.  Americans want health careorganizations to be efficient and responsive, and in that way 'business-like,'but at the same time they don't want them to be 'like other businesses' forfear of higher costs and community interests being sacrificed," said Mark D.Smith, MD, MBA, executive vice-president, Kaiser Family Foundation.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996With a Quarter Million Persons To Cover, Colorado Coalition Starts with a Lotof CloutThe campaign begun last spring to lure Colorado's biggest employers back intoan affiliation with the Colorado Health Care Purchasing Alliance (HAA, 3/24,p.3) didn't work.  The big companies, after nine months of meetings, decidedthat they could benefit from being part of a coordinated attack on healthcoverage issues, but that they should have their own group with no formal tiesto the Alliance.That new organization, called the Colorado Business Group on Health (CBGH),includes the state, the Denver public school system, and 10 big companies,including Lockheed Martin, U.S.  West, Norwest Banks, and the one big firmthat had been a faithful backer of the Alliance:  Coors Brewing Co.  Togetherthey spend just over $400 million providing health care coverage to 250,000Coloradans.The 12 announced formation of the group last month, but have yet toincorporate or select officers.  CBGH ads for an executive director willappear in Denver newspapers next week.  "We'd like someone who has someknowledge of the local health plans and providers and a real goodunderstanding of the local markets," says U.S.  West Health Benefits ManagerPatricia Theno, whose invitation in March to Patricia Powers, head of thePacific Business Group on Health (PBGH), to speak to Colorado companies kickedoff the talks that led to the formation of the new group.  Some of thecompanies that showed up for the Powers presentation, such as Safeway and IBM,have not joined CBGH yet.  The current members say that they are welcome, butthat the present members are willing to put up enough money to make the newcoalition run:  they aren't going to spend any energy recruiting additionalmembers.CBGH has formed what it calls a "strategic partnership" with PBGH, where U.S.West and Lockheed are already active participants.  Initially, thatpartnership means that the Colorado group will borrow PBGH's structure andsome of its projects (for instance, on encouraging preventive care anddeveloping performance standards) and jointly participate with the West Coastgroup on its annual survey pinpointing the value of the health care deliveredby each participating health plan.  Eventually the Colorado group plans tonegotiate with insurers on behalf of its members, hammering out prices butleaving it up to each employer to decide which plan or plans to offer itsworkers.  But that's not likely to happen until the 1998 plan year.The state's biggest companies pulled out of the Alliance in the 1980s, when itdecided to operate as a purchasing cooperative.  The Alliance had hoped todevelop some sort of affiliate membership that would get the big boys back inits fold, but the CBGH members continued to look at the Alliance as a groupingof small businesses that didn't address what they saw as the very differentneeds of large firms.  "Many cities have more than one purchaser coalition -one for larger employers, another to represent small business," the groupexplained in a fact sheet issued with the announcement of its formation.  Butboth groups promise that they will work together on some projects, such asmember satisfaction surveys and lobbying in the state legislature.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Do Small Firms Have Sicker Workers?  Study Says 'No'One of the reasons behind the formation of health insurance purchasingcooperatives for small employers is the prohibitive rates quotes some suchfirms receive when they go out on their own to buy policies.  Those high ratesare based, in part, on the belief by insurers that even when all other factorsare equal workers in such firms are higher risks than those who work for bigemployers.  That's hooey, say the authors of a report published in the winterissue of Health Affairs.The study was conducted on a huge database:  20.5 million records on 1.4million persons covered by the Blues of western Pennsylvania over the threeyears ending Dec.  31, 1990.  Those enrollees got their coverage through firmsthat bought insurance for 1 to 18,730 persons; about 95 percent of theemployers had 50 or fewer persons enrolled.EEEEEEoEEEEEE- those with no more than 10 persons covered by the Blues - did havehigher than average medical costs:  $992 compared with an overall average of$916.  But employees of the very biggest companies (those with over 1,000subscribers) also had high costs:  an average of $987.  Those differencescould be entirely explained by differences in the insured populations at suchfirms - both had a higher proportion of workers over age 55.The authors of the study - a team led by Wanda Young, founder of theInternational Center for Health Services Research in Pittsburgh - do admitthat "small businesses do in fact post greater financial risks to insurers -that is, their health care costs are less stable and thus harder to predictwith sufficient accuracy for firm-specific experience rating."  But the answerto that, they argue, is a community rating approach which lumps large numbersof companies together.  Of the 28,990 employers in the database, 65 percentwould have paid more under community rating - but the amount of theirsubsidization would have been far less than the savings given the other 35percent.Even a small increase for firms with healthier employees is a problem however,warns Health Insurance Assn.  of America VP Edward Neuschler.  He says thatsince "so many small employers are right at the margin, 'Can I afford this ornot?' that's a prescription for driving healthy lives out of the market."Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Article Proposes New Standards for Paying For Experimental TechnologyHealth plans are being offered a compromise solution to the growingcontentious problem of when to rate an innovative medical technology no longerexperimental and therefore reimbursable.  A proposal to appear in aforthcoming issue of Health Affairs suggests that health plans write intotheir policies this bargain:  They will pay the costs of new technologies,although they are still experimental, if they are part of a well-designedtrial, but only if the manufacturers agree that the devices will not beavailable outside the trial.A new approach is necessary because with government limiting its support forassessment of medical technology, health plans are becoming the "controlvalves" determining which new ideas are accepted, says Sean Tunis, MD, formerdirector of the health program at the now-defunct federal Office of TechnologyAssessment and an author of the article.  Yet health insurance is "anincreasingly stressed, very competitive, over-stretched industry that doesn'thave the tools or capacity to make those kinds of decisions," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996HCFA Says Drop Certification As A HEDIS MeasurementThe widespread acceptance of the Health Care Employer Data & Information Set(HEDIS) of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) is not withoutits attendant problems.  NCQA is now under pressure to back off on at leastone key measure because managed care plans, eager for a good HEDIS rating, arebeing too diligent about responding to it.At least that is the view of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),which is working with NCQA to develop by January 1997 a third generation HEDISthat can be used by Medicare recipients as well as the business buyers ofhealth coverage that now constitute HEDIS's primary audience.  Under fire fromHCFA:  the use of board certification as a measure of the competence of thedoctors on an HMO panel.That criterion, HCFA persuaded the Medicare subcommittee of NCQA's Committeeon Performance Measure- ment, at least as applied to primary care physicians,is guilty of exacerbating the shortage of such gatekeepers available throughHMOs.  Many plans, says Jeffrey Kang, chief medical officer of HCFA's Officeof Managed Care, translated the HEDIS measure into an absolute requirementthat all doctors who sign up for participation in an HMO must have boardcertification.  That excludes many good doctors and makes it tougher forMedicare recipients to choose a plan with an easy-to-reach primary careprovider.The core problem:  While virtually everyone agrees that there are othermeasures of quality - such as getting continuing education and even havingdemonstrated competence - none of them are as easily determined as whether ornot a doctor is board certified.  And buyers of health coverage - thecompanies HEDIS was designed for - want to assure their workers that they arebeing sent to board-certified doctors, according to NCQA VP Cary Sennett.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Hearing Set Jan.  10 on Kentucky Rate Review AuthorityKentucky officials have a Jan.  10 hearing date on their motion to toss out ofcourt a suit filed by HMOs who fear state insurance regulators may order themto lower 1996 premiums.  The state insurance commissioner is reviewing thesharply higher rates insurers are charging following implementation of thestate's 1994 reform law, and needs dismissal of the suit to order any changesbased on that review.The commissioner ordered the review following complaints by some state workersabout rates they're paying through the Kentucky Health Purchasing Alliance.However, the review covers all rates in the state, both inside and outside thealliance.  Departing Gov.  Brereton Jones (D) charged late last year thatinsurer rates were far higher than they needed to be to cover added costsimposed by the 1994 reforms (HAA 12/8).  Jones ordered insurers to refilerates by Dec.  11, triggering the suit by the Kentucky Assn.  of HMOs.Robert Quirk, KAH President, tells HAA that although the state has authorityto review rates and reject unreasonable charges, it can't actually set rates.Quirk says the commissioner in effect is setting rates by specifying in theongoing review that they can't vary by more than 10 percent from a specifiedfigure.In addition to fighting for lower rates, state officials are bracing for anattempt in the legislature to exempt university and local government workersfrom a requirement that public sector workers purchase coverage through theAlliance.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996States Curb Health Care CostsFor the first time in 10 years, the increase in the cost of health benefitsprovided to state employees under indemnity plans was less than the medicalcare components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The annual survey by SegalCo., a benefits consulting firm, found that in 1995 the average total monthlycost for family coverage for state workers was $448.29 a month, up just 1.95percent from the 1994 average.  Just over half the states reported no increaseat all in the cost of the coverage.  Overall hikes for employee-only andretiree-only coverage were also low, although the rise in the cost of coveringretirees and their dependents was higher than the CPI.As in previous years, costs varied widely between the more generous states andthose with less lush benefits.  Michigan's costs, at $800.99 per month perfamily, were far higher than any other state's; Montana's $289, while $20 morethan its 1994 costs, was still the lowest in the nation.  There were alsodramatic regional variations in the percentage of the total cost absorbed bythe state.  In the Northeast and the West, many states pick up the entirecost, while in the South the burden falls heavily on employees.Nationwide, 35 percent of state employees are enrolled in health maintenanceorganizations, with the portion amounting to more than 80 percent of theworkers in Arizona and California, but fewer than 5 percent in North Dakota,Idaho, and Connecticut.In many jurisdictions, the state buys coverage for a lot of public sectoremployees not on its own payroll.  In Georgia, for instance, in addition toits 65,200 state government workers, the state buys coverage for 130,600public school teachers.  In North Carolina, only 28 percent of the workers inthe state pool are actually state employees.  Segal's Clark Yaggy and DanielW.  Jackson write, "We can see a continuation of the relatively new trend forstate health benefits plans to include other public employers.  State employeeplans have always been among the largest in their states, and the increasednegotiating clout produced by their representation of large numbers ofemployees has not escaped the notice of legislators and others seeking tosolve some of the cost pressures of smaller public entities."Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH ALLIANCE ALERT via NewsNetJANUARY 5, 1996Affiliates No More, Two Top Hospitals MergeCan hospitals realize the efficiency benefits of size through affiliationsthat let each keep its own separate identity?  Two of the premier institutionsin St.  Louis have decided the answer is no.  After three years of workingtogether under an umbrella health plan, Barnes Hospital and Jewish Hospitalhave agreed to a full-fledged merger.  At the beginning, the combined29-member board will have co-chairs.  The philanthropic foundations thatsupport the two hospitals will also be combined into one.Links between the two institutions are longstanding:  Barnes was founded as ateaching affiliate of the Washington University medical school in 1914 andJewish affiliated with Washington in 1964.  Since its creation in 1992, theirjointly-owned Barnes-Jewish Health System has rapidly expanded, merging withChristian Health Services and forging ties with Missouri Baptist and St.Louis Children's.  The health system includes 5,000 beds and provides close to30 percent of the inpatient care in the St.  Louis market.But the halfway house of affiliation wasn't enough, the brass at bothinstitutions decided.  There was still too much duplication.  With the merger,the medical staff will be fully integrated and clinical services can berealigned by dropping some services offered by both institutions.  The firstproject of the merged Barnes-Jewish Hospital will be to build new cancer careand outpatient centers.Also in St.  Louis, United HealthCare agreed to sell its 31,000-memberMetraHealth HMO to Principal Health Care.  United had to get rid of the HMO toget approval of its merger with MetraHealth.

Atthe same time, the company admitted that is larger-than-expected losses haveput in it default with its bank loan agreement.Summit Medical Systems, which sells clinical outcomes database software, hasgotten its hands on a valuable new compilation.  The company signed a jointventure agreement with Duke University to commercialize the information on500,000 cardiovascular procedures on 95,000 patients, which Duke has collectedover 26 years.  The first products, expected to be on the market late thisyear, are supposed to improve providers' ability to collect and analyzeclinical outcomes data.The Rocky Mountain Heart Consortium shut down at the end of December, unableto get the grants from Denver hospitals and other funding sources needed tokeep going.  In operation since 1991, the group's research projects focused onthe cost and outcomes of cardiovascular procedures in the state, sixth in thenation in number of open-heart surgery programs.Discounts negotiated by health insurers will be shared with enrollees under anew Missouri law that went into effect Jan.  1.  Passed in response to a statesurvey that showed many plans base the insured's copayment on usual andcustomary charges, the new law requires that the split be of the actualcharge.In markets with little managed care, hospitals are cutting costs just asvigorously as those under pressure from HMOs, according to a report from theCenter for Healthcare Industry Performance Studies (CHIPS).  While hospitalsin markets with high managed care penetration continue to have, on average,shorter lengths of stay and lower costs for most surgical procedures, the gapis narrowing, CHIPS found.  In fact, for some procedures, such as cardiaccatheterization and excision of intervertebral disc, the average is actuallylower at hospitals in markets where there's little use of HMOs.Back to Headline List WT03-B01-34IA086-000615-B039-32http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/hh61.html 205.156.212.5 19970122015015 text/html 35214HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:48:23 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:37 GMTContent-length: 35027Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/hh61.html Sample Issue Copyright HEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNet February 21, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES U.S. Attorney to Sue Some Hospitals In Metzinger Lab False Claims Case (443 words) Experimental Device Repayment Sought;At Least One Criminal Case Expected (549 words) Feds: Sutter Knew of Errors,Thought Policy Non-Binding (422 words) New Medicare Enrollment FormSeeks More Financial Data (363 words) Providers: Medicaid Contractor Owes Millions for Claims (697 words) Feds Target More HospitalsFor Attending MD Billing (358 words) Whistleblower: Providers BoldIn Device Fraud Practices (419 words) Hospitals Say Blues ContractFacilitates `Network Leasing' (420 words) FTC OKs Urology Network;Shows Antitrust Fears Persist (273 words) COMPLIANCE STRATEGIES Take These Steps to Avoid Medicare Payment Suspension (403 words) Try Team Method in Audits for Attending MD Billing Errors (416 words) CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996U.S. Attorney to Sue Some HospitalsIn Metzinger Lab False Claims CaseSome hospitals reportedly will face false claimscharges this week, as the government expands the scope of a case inwhich an outside consultant allegedly suggested questionablebilling practices. Experts say the feds will hit consultants hardif their goal is to up Medicare revenue, so make sure lab claimsare backed by documentation.The government this week is expected to sue up to 19 hospitals,adding them to a pending false claims lawsuit the feds filed lastyear against the Metzinger Associates billing consultants.The feds will claim the hospitals, on Metzinger Associates' advice,billed Medicare for clinical lab work that wasn't needed or wasn'tprovided as charged. Dozens of other hospitals that used MetzingerAssociates are expected to settle false claims allegations afterdoing self-audits at the government's request (HBLS 7/19/95, p. 1).According to sources, the U.S. attorney in Phildelphia says itchose which hospitals to sue based on: (1) their size; (2) theamount of evidence the feds have against the hospital; (3) thedegree of cooperation in the federal investigation; (4) how muchMetzinger earned based upon payments received from the hospital;and (5) the nature of voluntary disclosure of misconduct to thegovernment.The latest development in the case has implications for consultingfirms and the providers who use them, because the Metzinger lawsuitopened a Pandora's box of potential false claims cases oversqueezing revenue from Medicare."The Metzinger Associates case will prompt the government to reviewother consultants who are providing the same services, or othertypes of services, when the arrangements are structured for revenueenhancement instead of compliance with governmental regulations,"says one expert, who asked that his name not be used.The insider says consultants should:o       "Raise their internal qualitycontrol programs to a much higher level to assure theirrecommendations comply with third-party documentation and billingrequirements;"o       "Have documentation in their filesto support recommendations;" ando       Do more than interview hospitalpersonnel to determine compliance with third-party regulations.Review underlying documents to corroborate the information gatheredinthe interview process. "Talk is cheap," the expert notes."Looking at underlying documents to support what personnel says andkeeping a set of documents in the consultant's file are importantin the event the government challenges the consultant'srecommendations."For example, if the hospital bills for a five-part complete bloodcount with an automatic differential, verify that the laboratoryhas the capacity and the equipment to perform such tests, saysanother billing expert.The two executives who ran Metzinger Associates, Harry Metzingerand William Ritter, are slated for a trial this spring.

Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Experimental Device Repayment Sought;At Least OneCriminal Case ExpectedHospitals need to set up a system to make sure theydo not bill Medicare for non-reimburseable, breakthroughexperimental devices and related services. Meanwhile, the feds havetaken the first step to recoup pre-November 1995 payments for thedevices.Some hospitals are starting to get letters from the governmentrequesting records of Medicare claims for experimental devices andrelated medical care so the government can figure out how muchhospitals allegedly owe Medicare because HCFA says the devicesweren't covered before Nov. 1, 1995, sources say.The government's next step will be to actually demand a specificamount of money back, a source says.And in a new revelation, every hospital scrutinized by the feds forimproper Medicare claims for experimental medical devices allegedlysubmitted these claims, at least half knew the claims wereinappropriate, and almost 30 hospitals tried to cover it up, a topofficial from the HHS Inspector General's Office told a Senatepanel last week.Deputy IG Jack Hartwig, testifying at a Senate PermanentSubcommittee on Investigations hearing, outlined the government'sstrategy in dealing with alleged improper billing for experimentaldevices:(1) The IG and HCFA are calculating overpayments to providers andplan to seek repayment (HBLS 1/24/96, p. 1);(2) Evidence of alleged criminal conduct will be investigated;(3) Fraud that has been identified is being addressed by Justice(see story below); and(4) The feds are addressing weaknesses in accounting and trackingof investigational devices, in hospital oversight, and in obtaininginformed patient consent.Physicians also are being probed on the issue.To avoid further trouble over device billing, attorney Len Homeradvises hospitals to "have absolute controls so no billings aresubmitted to Medicare for services involving [breakthrough]investigational devices" not covered by Medicare. The FDA callsbreakthrough non-covered devices category A devices.But hospitals still must submit "no pay" bills so Medicare can keeptrack of care patients receive, even if it's not reimbursable, andto reflect statistical changes in the cost report, says Homer, whorepresents hospitals in the device case.Plus, hospitals should "work out with beneficiaries [gettingcategory A devices] whether they will look to the beneficiary forpayments," which Homer says is legal if the patient is told inadvance and gives consent.Also at the hearing, the Senate panel blasted HCFA and the IG fornot cracking down on Medicare payments for experimental devicesbefore HCFA began covering them. Subcommittee Chairman William Roth(R-Del) displayed internal hospital memos that purportedly showedsome hospitals' knowledge of improper Medicare billing forexperimental devices.In a memo on letterhead from Sutter Memorial Hospital inSacramento, an official wrote, "Clearly, by the letter of the lawwe are at risk. However, there is obviously no communicationbetween the FDA and HCFA, which would easily allow HCFA to identifythe devices, and given the number of exemptions currently occuring,I would think our overall risks are small."Testifying at the hearing, the administrator who wrote the memodenied he was admitting knowledge of wrongdoing.In their defense, hospital officials at the hearing said Medicarerules on this were fuzzy.A University of Washington Medical Center executive said his"belief was that HCFA's policy was not binding and was flexiblyenforced, and is amply supported by HCFA's own actions."Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Feds: Sutter Knew of Errors,Thought Policy Non-BindingA California hospital stays in Medicare, but pays morethan $1 million and agrees to a compliance plan to resolveallegations it knew it wrongly billed Medicare for experi-mentalcardiac devices.Sutter Memorial Hospital knew it wasn't entitled to Medicarepayments for experimental medical devices and was told this morethan once by its peer review organization, the prosecutor in thecase against Sutter told HBLS.The Sutter health system in California last week became the firsthospital in the country to settle false claims allegations that itbilled Medicare for devices that lacked FDA premarketing approvaland therefore were not covered by Medicare.In addition to paying the government $1.3 million, Sutter agreed toa compliance plan to prevent and detect fraud in its organization."I think the Medicare billing rules were clear and not confusing,"says Michael Hirst, chief of affirmative civil enforcement in theSacramento U.S. attorney's office and a prosecutor who worked onthe case.Los Angeles attorney Russell Hayman, Sutter's outside counsel,responded that "Sutter was unaware of manual provisions until aboutthe end of 1991. When they learned about the manual provisions,they concluded it was non-binding - it was policy and not law - andcontinued to bill. They regret that, and wish they had soughtclarification from the government prior to that time."@SUBHEAD = Sutter Dropped from Whistleblower LawsuitThe settlement notes that Sutter, as a Medicare provider, got atleast one copy of the Medicare manual provisions that saysprocedures involving investigational devices are not reasonable andnecessary, and therefore not covered by Medicare.Providers say the manual provisions are not official, that noregulations were ever finalized disallowing such payments, and thatMedicare contractors knowingly reimbursed providers for suchdevices for years.HCFA started officially covering next-generation experimentaldevices in November.In return for settling, Sutter will not be thrown out of Medicareand was dropped from the whistleblower-initiated false claimslawsuit pending against a number of hospitals for billing Medicarefor experimental devices and related medical care.But the settlement relates only to cardiac experimental devices,Hirst notes, and the settlement frees only the hospital, notphysicians, from further legal problems related to investigationaldevices.Among the elements of Sutter's compliance plan:(1) Hold training sessions on experimental device billing forrelevant fourth-year students, residents, staff physicians andclerical employees;(2) Include in new-employee orientations instruction on properbilling; and(3) Distribute written materials to all relevant physicians andclerical staff stating Sutter's commitment to accurate billing.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996New Medicare Enrollment FormSeeks More Financial DataMake room for Medicare's new enrollment form in yourbusiness plan because filling it out will take a lot of time - andyou must certify in writing that the information is true.HCFA will soon issue a new Medicare provider enrollment form thatasks providers for more detailed financial and other information toprove they are qualified to bill Medicare."It's very extensive and people should take extreme care in fillingout the form because" they must certify at the end that everythingreported in the form is true, says attorney Anne Branan, with Broadand Cassel.Branan, of Fort Lauderdale, also suggests upper management completethe form or review it - especially if your outside billing agencyfills it out for you.The new form is part of HCFA's push to stop paying improper claimson the front end, instead of paying wayward providers and gettinglaw enforcement to try to get the money back."The first step to ending pay-and-chase is to take a good look atwho comes into the system," says Judy Berek, special advisor onfraud to HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck.Manager, Subcontractor Data DemandedAmong other things, the form asks:o        Whether providers use a billingagency, and, if so, the agency's name, phone number, and employeeidentification number. "Get that information from reliable sourcesin the billing company," Branan advises.o       Who is managing the organization,and personal data on them, including Social Security numbers.o       For independent physiological labs,subcontractors' names and related information, such as theirMedicare numbers and, if they're doctors, what CPT codes they willperform.Completing the form "will be an overwhelming amount of work andcan't be approached in a haphazard manner," Branan says. "Countthis in your business plan."This is another reminder for providers to make sure billing systemschurn out accurate claims and to install a compliance plan toprevent and detect fraud, observes San Francisco attorney PaulDeMuro. Apparently, HCFA feels "if they can develop a better formor tracking system, they'll be able to use their statistical editsand other tools" to sniff out fraud, he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Providers: Medicaid Contractor Owes Millions forClaimsProviders say a company that has a risk-bearing contract for Massachusetts'Medicaid managed mental health program owes them millions of dollars, sothe providers may sue.  The state has pledged to make sure providers getany money they may be owed.Massachusetts mental health providers are prepared to sue thestate's Medicaid managed mental health contractor over $6 millionto $9 million in allegedly unpaid claims, and the state haspromised that providers will get any money if it's owed them.The providers, who may sue Mental Health Management of America forbreach of contract, say the contractor trapped them in a catch-22to avoid paying claims for mental health and substance abusetreatment. The contractor required that providers submit claimswithin 90 days of service and put preauthorization numbers onclaims, then the contractor allegedly didn't furnish thepreauthorization numbers promptly enough for the providers to meetthe deadline.Claims Processing `Not Their Strength'"Claims processing was not [Mental Health Management's] strength,"acknowledges Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the state Division forMedical Assistance, which oversees Medicaid. There was a problemwith a claims backlog."We'll work this through with providers," Bullen says. "We'll makesure [Mental Health Management] is responsible for complying withthe contract. But it doesn't mean we'll pay all claims."He noted that Mental Health Management "performed in a superiorfashion in some areas, like quality management."John Kahn, a lawyer representing Mental Health Corp. ofMassachusetts, an organization of 65 mental health agenciesallegedly owed money by Mental Health Management, agreed thatquality of care wasn't at issue. But he says providers worry whencontractors are rewarded, even indirectly, for keeping clinicalcosts down. "The arrangement under which service providers have afinancial incentive not to maximize service is at the heart of theconcern about managed care programs," Kahn says.Massachusetts did not renew Mental Health Management's Medicaidmanaged care contract past June. And about a year ago, MentalHealth Management's parent company lost a contract in New Mexico.In a letter to a Mental Health Management outside lawyer, Kahn asksthe contractor to process the providers' unpaid claims and suspendtroublesome edits related to prior approval, billing within 90days, a 365-day payment appeals process, and claims identificationnumbers.Kahn says Mental Health Management hasn't yet met the providers'demands, and, if necessary, they'll take the contractor to court.At press time, the contractor did not respond to a request for aninterview. But the two sides are scheduled to meet next week.State: Providers Will Get Money Owed ThemMental Health Management of America, owned by First FinancialManagement of Atlanta, got the Massachusetts managed care contractfor mental health and substance abuse treatment in 1992.Mental Health Management broke new ground in providingcomprehensive managed mental health care to Medicaid, so there weregrowing pains, says Ron Preston, HCFA associate regionaladministrator. But that's not why Mental Health Management'scontract wasn't renewed beyond June, he maintains."Other applicants had more solid applications," Preston says.Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partners won the bid.Meanwhile, Massachusetts' mental health providers claim MentalHealth Management owes them money. "There's a lot of anxiety thatevery bill is honored, and that's a reasonable concern. We want tomake sure [the contractor does] everything in compliance" as thecontract is closed out in June, Bullen says. He notes the stateagency is auditing the firm.In the state contract, Mental Health Management was paid $11.5million for administrative expenses under a risk-bearing contractthat allowed it to make up to $750,000 if they kept expenses inline or shell out up to $750,000 if the company went over budget.The first 92 cents of every dollar saved went to the state, and theremaining 8 cents to Mental Health Management, since renamed FirstMental Health.Because the firm's and providers' reimbursement pools were linked,the less paid out in medical costs, the more the firm made underthe contract, Kahn says.But Mental Health Management was "not unduly rewarded," Bullensays. "There's always limited risk and limited savings. It doesn'tprovide an incentive for overly restrictive clinical behavior."Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Feds Target More HospitalsFor Attending MD BillingYou don't have to be a major teaching hospital to facefalse claims problems over billing Medicare for attendingphysicians supervising residents' work, as more Pennsylvaniahospitals have found out.The feds have begun a broader false claims dragnet for attendingphysician billing improprieties by sending letters to teachinghospitals and faculty practice plans primarily in the Philadelphiaarea.The letters say the providers may have billed Medicare for workdone by residents, even though HCFA says it pays for that workunder hospital graduate medical education payments.Some hospitals without substantial teaching affiliations will betargeted, says John Foley, a Pennsylvania consultant who helpshospitals comply with Medicare billing regulations.The feds also reportedly want academic medical providers to hireexternal auditors to scour records to determine how much exposurethere is for attending physician billing, says Foley, with Parente,Randolph, Orlando, Carey & Associates (see Compliance Strategy).The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia would neither confirmnor deny the existence of the letters.Case May Be Ripe for Self-AuditBecause documenting false claims for attending physician billingwould be labor-intensive and time-consuming for the government,this case may be ripe for the type of self-audits for allegedbilling errors done at the government's behest in the MetzingerAssociates case.Providers in that case agreed to have an independent audit andsubmit the findings to the feds. In return, providers will refundless to the government than they would pay in damages under thefederal False Claims Act.Almost two months ago, the faculty practice plans at the Universityof Pennsylvania struck a deal to pay $30 million to resolveallegations of attending physician billing fraud lodged by the U.S.attorney in Philadelphia (HBLS 12/20/95, p. 1).HCFA says payment for work performed by residents is alreadyincluded in graduate medical education payments to hospitals andfaculty practice plans. Attending physicians can only bill Medicarefor work performed by residents when the attending physician isphysically present for "key portions" of the service.HCFA formalized its position, initially taken in IntermediaryLetter 372, in regulations published in the Dec. 8 FederalRegister.  Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Whistleblower: Providers BoldIn Device Fraud PracticesThe whistleblower in the experimental device false claimslawsuit said the feds urged him to file it, which may weaken hiscase. The feds deny doing so.The providers who allegedly billed Medicare for experimentaldevices knowing it was supposedly illegal were undaunted by thethreat of government retaliation, a former device industryexecutive said at a Senate hearing last week.The man, who is suing some providers on behalf of the governmentunder the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, told theSenate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations some providersallegedly risked patients' lives, tampered with files, and lied onclaims forms to make sure Medicare paid for their work - withlittle fear of getting punished. The lawsuit claims providersimproperly billed for experimental devices and related medicalcare. His identity remains shielded.He noted that AMA and AHA, arguing that their members believed HCFAhad no hard-and-fast rule on the experimental device issue,successfully pressured HHS to change coverage rules "and to get[the feds] to back off on the investigation." And that, he said,made some providers bold in the face of the government's warningsagainst billing for experimental devices.An AHA official said there was "a concerted effort on behalf of allsectors of the health care field to promptly examine the issuesraised by this investigation and try to address them."HCFA started officially paying for next-generation experimentalmedical devices Nov. 1.The whistleblower, who said he is "involved in the purchase andbilling loop for hospitals' use of experimental medical devices,"alleged some hospitals and physicians: (1) falsely billed Medicarefor experimental automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators asFDA-approved pacemakers; (2) billed Medicare for angioplasties whenthey really did experimental atherectomies. To cover their tracks,providers allegedly reinvaded patients' arteries, inserted a cheapballoon, took an X-ray and put it in the patient file in case aMedicare auditor checked; (3) removed patient consent forms fromfiles because they served as evidence the hospitals knew theprocedures were experimental; and (4) reused single-use-onlyablation and electrophysiology catheters.The whistleblower says he "was asked by the HHS IG and Departmentof Justice to come forward as a whistleblower and encouraged tofile a suit under the federal False Claims Act." Given that, thelawyers defending the hospitals named in the false claims lawsuitplan to contend the whistleblower is not the originator of theallegations - a key requirement for winning such cases.The feds denied asking the whistleblower to sue. Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Hospitals Say Blues ContractFacilitates `NetworkLeasing'A silent PPO-like practice is one of a hospital group'scomplaints about a new Blue Cross contract the state may review.The Massachusetts Hospital Assn. has complained to the state abouta Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts contract thatincludes something the hospital group says is akin to silentdiscounting.The Blues is offering a new provider contract for HMO, PPO,indemnity and Medicare risk products.The state attorney general has promised to look into the contractprovisions, and the state insurance division met with the Blues atleast once on the matter, says Andrew Dreyfus, hospital associationspokesman.The association questions the legality of certain aspects of thecontract, including alleged:o       Network leasing provisions thatallow Blue Cross to cut deals with other payers and requireproviders to give to other insurers the same terms they give BlueCross. Dreyfus says the provision is similar to silent discounting.In silent discounting, providers unwittingly give discounts toindemnity patients whose insurers bought a PPO's negotiateddiscounts with the providers.o       Full-line forcing, which meanshospitals allegedly have to participate in all Blue Cross lines."The insurer won't let a hospital contract only with indemnity orMediGap products," Dreyfus says.o       A termination option that lets theBlues kill a contract with a hospital if the hospital enters intoan arrangement with non-insurers, like employers.Despite the complaints, 48 out of 54 hospitals have signed thecontract, notes Bob Brooks, Massachusetts Blue Cross' director ofhealth services contracting.No network leasing is planned, and Blue Cross envisions renting itsnetwork only to union health plans that already have third-partyadministrative functions but need to rent a provider network, saysMaria Butler, counsel in the law department at the Blues.Brooks notes that Blue Cross informed hospitals that it reservesthe right to rent its network, with 90 days notice to the hospital.The hospital can opt out if Blue Cross doesn't live up to itscontractual terms.Brooks acknowledges the product lines are negotiated all-or-nothingwith hospitals, but notes that hospitals can opt out of any linewithout cause. He says the termination option merely lets theinsurer renegotiate rates if a hospital turns into a competitor.Susan Grakowski, another counsel in the insurer's law department,says Blue Cross is close to completing negotiations with the restof the hospitals. "We had an informational session with thedivision of insurance" about the contract, but "we've heard nothingfrom the AG's office," she says.

Uronet may add up to three more urologiststo the network if managed care plans want extra practice locationsor MDs with privileges at other hospitals. If that happens, thepercentage of urologists in Uronet would reach 26%, but the extraurologists wouldn't be owners.Uronet is non-exclusive, so its members could join other networksand contract with assorted payers. Most of the owners are invarious managed care plans.Uronet will use an agent, Physicians Health Corp., to negotiatecapitated contracts, which Uronet's medical director will approve.Each member will decide separately whether to participate in thecontract. Members don't have to participate in any contract.In a staff advisory opinion, Bob Leibenluft, assistant director ofthe FTC Bureau of Competition, told Uronet it appears to qualifyfor antitrust immunity under the FTC-Justice Department antitrustsafety zone for physician networks. The safety zone limitsnon-exclusive networks to 30% of the MDs in the market.Uronet also passed FTC antitrust muster because the MDs sharefinancial risk through capitation.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Take These Steps to Avoid Medicare Payment SuspensionLosing Medicare revenue even temporarily can be financiallydevastating, so it's worth taking the "ounce of prevention is wortha pound of cure" approach to preventing carriers and fiscalintermediaries from suspending payments.Medicare contractors may suspend provider or supplier payments torecover alleged overpayments or for suspected fraud (HBLS 12/20/95,p. 7).Washington lawyer Irv Cohen recommends taking these steps to helpavoid situations that may prompt Medicare contractors to suspendMedicare payments:(1) Have a sound in-house claims processing policy, includingwell-trained staff. "Most mistakes are made by staff who don'tunderstand the fine differences between what Medicare covers andwhat Medicare doesn't cover," says Cohen, with Fulbright &Jaworski.(2) Carefully monitor changes in policies and other announcementsfrom Medicare carriers.(3) Attend carrier training programs.(4) If you're very risk-averse, avoid product lines, such asincontinence supplies, that are under intense scrutiny for fraudand abuse. One way to keep up on the government's investigative hotbuttons: Read the HHS inspector general's annual workplan, whichdescribes what will be targeted.(5) Immediately respond to disallowances. Don't just write off aminor disallowance without checking it out. It could be a tipoff tofuture, larger disallowances. For example, a disallowance mightalert providers or suppliers to a coverage change that meansMedicare will pay for a medical supply only under one diagnosiscode.(6) Promptly comply with carrier requests for more informationabout a claim. "I've seen several suppliers not respond to thecarrier, [writing the disallowance off] as just one unpaid claim,"Cohen says. "The suppliers [faced] a major disallowance or aninvestigation because they failed to respond" to the carrier.(7) Check whether an inquiry comes from the carrier's utilizationreview or anti-fraud unit. If a fraud probe seems underway, notifyemployees of how they should respond to contacts by investigators,which may be made at their homes at night. Your lawyer can helpwith this issue.(8) Be on guard for unusual delays in Medicare reimbursement. "Itmay be a sign of a prepayment review or other kind of review,"Cohen says. "Early intervention gets the money flowing [again]sooner - before you're on the verge of bankruptcy."(9) Do internal audits to make sure billing practices are on the upand up.(10) Install a corporate compliance plan to prevent and detectfraud and abuse, preferably before it gets out of hand, Cohensuggests.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTHCARE BUSINESS & LEGAL STRATEGIES via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1996Try Team Method in Audits for Attending MD Billing ErrorsWith the feds ready to pounce on teaching hospitals or facultypractice plans for improper billing for attending physicianservices, academic providers should do a self-audit to get a handleon legal vulnerability - and forensic accountants may be theingredient that makes the audit process work.Millions of dollars are at stake, as evidenced by the $30 millionfalse-claims settlement the government struck with the facultypractice plans at the University of Pennsylvania. The governmentaccused the providers of billing Medicare for attending physicianservices when they were not physically present for work performedby their residents (HBLS 12/20/95, p. 1).Experts recommend you have outside counsel hire independentauditors to do the audit."When you start to self-audit, make sure you have the right teamassembled to do this work," says consultant John Foley, with theWilkes-Barre, Pa., offices of Parente, Randolph, Orlando, Carey &Associates.A major player on the team is the forensic accountant who analyzesfinancial data to help resolve disputes, such as alleged fraudulentbilling, business insurance claims and contract disputes."Everyone tends to send in nursing personnel or people familiarwith medical records or coding, but we don't believe that's thelargest part of the engagement. The largest part should be forensicaccountants," Foley contends.Forensic accountants will meet with university personnel to outlinethe work plan for the project. A proposed workplan should bereviewed by the HHS inspector general, Foley advises."The IG has to bless any workplan in advance. One would not wantthe firm"to do a lot of work and find out at the end of the day theworkplan was insufficient," he says.Sample Used to Figure Error RateThe forensic accountants will select a method for determining howmany errors were made in attending physician billing.Once a sample selection method is set, statisticians will selectthe claims that will be subject to the methodology.The sample is then returned to forensic accountants, who work withhospital staff on the whole review, Foley says.Then coders, nurses and medical records staff will "wade throughthe documentation to determine whether there's adequatedocumentation" to justify the claims submitted for attendingphysician services, he says.If not, the sample's error rate is extrapolated to the entirepopulation of claims to calculate an overall error rate anddetermine how much money must be refunded to Medicare. The finalreport is given to the hospital's counsel to negotiate a settlementwith the feds.Back to Headline List WT03-B01-35IA086-000615-B039-54http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/hh18.html 205.156.212.5 19970122015040 text/html 105733HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:48:35 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:39:45 GMTContent-length: 105545Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/hh18.html Sample Issue Copyright HEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES RISK-SHARED OUTSOURCING WILL SOAR AS BUILD-OR- BUY SOLUTION (2781 words) WHAT YOUR OUTSOURCE PROVIDER MUST HAVE: (75 words) PUBLISH CAPITATION RATES, HMO PREMIUMS (1226 words) ============= MOORE REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN GOLF-HISTORIC PINEHURST BREAKS SUCCESS RECORDS WITH ITS HEALTH AND FITNESS CENTER (502 words) CHICAGO SEVEN FORM ONE OF CITY'S LARGEST INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE NETWORKS (258 words) COLUMBIA-PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER OFFERS PLUSH GUEST ACCOMMODATIONS (290 words) HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS URGED TO ADOPT FIVE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES (328 words) THE REVOLT AGAINST THE ONE-DAY STAY (1388 words) WOMEN'S HEALTH MARKED BY THEIR OWN HIGH-RISK BEHAVIOR AND PROVIDER NEGLIGENCE (289 words) HALF OF AMERICANS NEVER COMPLETE ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY; BACTERIAL DRUG RESISTANCE MAY BE A CONSEQUENCE (173 words) CARE FOR DYING AMERICANS NEEDS SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT, SAY RESEARCHERS (128 words) A TRAGIC MISMATCH (324 words) SPECIAL HELP FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENT FAMILIES (221 words) GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR THE DYING (82 words) WASHINGTON STATE HOSPITALS SHOW TREND TOWARD SICKER PATIENTS, SHORTER STAYS (271 words) COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORDS SEEN AS BENEFICIAL TREND BY MAJORITY OF AMERICANS (269 words) EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN MEDICARE DEMANDS NEW DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, DIFFERENT MARKETING (726 words) NCQA LAUNCHES WORLD WIDE WEB SITE, ACCREDITATION-SEARCHABLE DATABASE (125 words) MEDSTAT AWARDED RESEARCH CONTRACTS, BUILDING NATIONAL DATABASE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES (120 words) TOP HOSPITALS NAMED, NEW INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS RELEASED (286 words) TOP 100 HOSPITALS (651 words) CAREDATA REPORTS PROVIDES INFORMATION ON CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH MANAGED CARE (606 words) MARKETING INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS (142 words) NEW MANAGED GEROPSYCHIATRIC CENTER HELPS MEDICAL CENTER REPOSITION SERVICES (126 words) HIT FEATURES THE SURGICAL LASER MARKET (58 words) NATIONAL HEALTH LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES LEGAL MANUAL ON HEALTH LAW (258 words) EXCLUSIVE SURVEY ON HOSPITAL AND GROUP CONTRACTING FOR NEEDLES AND SYRINGES (103 words) JOINT COMMISSION AND WESTCOTT COMMUNICATIONS FORM SATELLITE NETWORK (176 words) JOINT COMMISSION SATELLITE NETWORK, 1996 VIDEOCONFERENCE SCHEDULE (127 words) HOST HEALTH CARE CONSORTIUM LAUNCHES NEW INFORMATION PROGRAMS (133 words) AHCPR AWARDS 10 RESEARCH GRANTS TO STUDY CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE MARKETS (234 words) FRIENDLY HILLS OPENS COLLEGE FOR MANAGED CARE IN CALIFORNIA (114 words) FIFTY HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS IN 21 STATES WORKING TO RELIEVE PATIENTS' PAIN (356 words) MEDICAL SCHOOLS RECEIVE GRANTS FOR ADDING SPIRITUAL TRAINING TO CURRICULUM (182 words) LARGE MEDICAL GROUPS MAKE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS COMPETITIVE (537 words) PROVIDER SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CAPITATED, BACKED BY RICH COMPANIES (565 words) CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996RISK-SHARED OUTSOURCING WILL SOAR AS BUILD-OR-BUY SOLUTIONBy Sharon McEachernOutsourcing is becoming an increasingly viable alternative for moreand more hospitals and health care systems faced with the build-or-buy dilemma. And everyone is facing this dilemma with every healthcare delivery service they offer that is not a core competency.Caught in the squeeze between mandated state and federal reformsand the demands of insurance carriers, providers are analyzing alllikely areas for outsourcing opportunities--not just the traditionalhousekeeping and food service.The First Look At VHA Research Data On Outsourcing HospitalsAnd although the majority (61%) of hospitals currently outsourcinghave flat price contracts with their outsource providers, most say,now that they have some outsourcing experience, that they preferfuture contracts to be shared risk (39%) and performance-based(30%), according to VHA.The Irving, Texas-based hospital cooperative recently conducted anextensive research project on outsourcing, interviewing CEOs,COOs and CFOs from a cross section of its 1,200 hospitalmembers. Although VHA won't share this data with its membersformally until its first quarter '96 report, we have preliminary dataand can offer a preview of VHA's findings in this market memo.(Bar graphs illustrating this data appear throughout this article.)Extrapolating from its research survey, VHA found that a whopping75% of its hospital and system members are outsourcing somefunction. Most recent surveys indicate the number of outsourcinghospitals today is around 40%.Benefits Of OutsourcingAsked to identify the financial benefits of outsourcing for theirhospitals, 84% of respondents listed lower overall costs, 14%identified reduced required capitalization, 11% answered withimproved rate of returns and 5% said higher productivity.Hospital administrators revealed key nonfinancial benefits ofoutsourcing for their institutions as being access to or acquisition ofstaff expertise (63%), enhanced quality (24%), ability to better serveemployees/patients (23%) and new technology (14%).What are the disadvantages of outsourcing? Based on theirexperience, not expectations, those who were currently outsourcingsaid the disadvantages are poor performance/subcontractor (38%),lack of control (34%) and increased costs (34%).Some Unexpected ResultsIt is ironic that more than one-third cited increased costs as adisadvantage of outsourcing when the number one reason foroutsourcing, listed by 84% as an advantage, was lower cost. Thereis truth in both--the explanations for them and ways to protect yourinstitution from unwanted outsourcing surprises are soon to follow.Another unexpected finding from the VHA study involves adifference between independent hospitals vs. integrated systems.Forty percent of the systems indicated they had more problems withincreased costs when outsourcing than the nonsystem hospitals, ofwhich 29% cited increased costs. The reasons for this variable are,as yet, uncertain."Clearly, there is a focus to outsource whatever is considered not tobe a core capability," said Denise Rubin, VHA's director ofimprovement services, a new R&D unit, looking for risk-sharingpotentials for member hospitals. "They want to focus their resourcesbehind reducing costs and increasing quality in the clinical area,where outsourcing will be growing by leaps and bounds."Although it is very difficult to achieve, the successful outsourcerswill be those who are aggressive in tying the outsourcing charge to aper-member-per-month fee, said Rubin. Additionally, thoseoutsourcers who are adept at handling the emotional issues willposition themselves more successfully than those who continue toignore this challenge.Outsourcing Is Both Financial And Emotional"Outsourcing is a very good financial decision for an institution,which can achieve significant cost reductions," she said. "But it'snot merely financial. Outsourcing is a very emotional issue, we'vediscovered. There is a huge fear factor with outsourcing, specificallyfrom hospital employees."To respond to those fears, you need to develop a strong transitionplan with a special focus on the labor component and all of thoseramifications.BJC Health Gets Back Millions In Annualized SavingsIn St. Louis, the BJC Health System considers outsourcing a veryviable option if it adds value to the organization. As cost pressurescontinue to increase, BJC is taking an ever more critical look at whatoutsourcing can bring to its system, said Jim Francis, vice presidentof materiel management.To illustrate the savings BJC has accrued from outsourcing, its foodservice contract produced $5.8 million in annualized savings and itsmedical/surgical distribution contracts is on track to achieve $4million in annualized savings in its first year.Reasons To Outsource"We're looking for ways we can rapidly reduce operating costs andlabor costs, improve productivity, bring higher quality and serviceto the organization, address existing problems and bring newexpertise and resources--all potentials with outsourcers," saidFrancis.In the last two years, BJC has looked at eight areas for outsourcingopportunities. Those that have been outsourced include foodservice, waste management, transportation services around itsmetropolitan St. Louis campus and distribution services forpharmaceutical and dietary supplies. Currently it's studyingoutsourcing its linen and laundry services, forms, printing andcopying services and clinical and biomedical engineering. It decidedto consolidate and manage internally its housekeeping services.The most important issues that need to be addressed before you evenembark on an outsourcing analysis is identifying the need for changewithin your organization, recognizing that change is necessary toachieve your goals, building the commitment around thatrecognition, and communicating that thoroughly throughout yourorganization.It Shouldn't Be A Management-only Decision"I don't think outsourcing decisions can be made by seniormanagement exclusively," said Francis. "They must involve theend-users, the recipients of the service. It's important they beincluded in the process of evaluating outsourcers."G. Scott Dillon, chief development officer of Atlanta-basedoutsourcer Transcend Services, said outsourcing is a way to geteconomic benefits that you would typically get from reengineering,but quicker.Macro VS. Micro"Outsourcing in health care is increasing tremendously. It providesan opportunity for hospital CEOs to focus on the more macroissues, the strategic planning, and allows an outsourcing provider tofocus on the micro issues, the day-to-day issues, which they can dobetter," said Dillon, whose company contracts to manage accountsreceivables and medical records.The recent fast growth is particularly evident in both business andclinical outsourcing, including a 40% growth in informationtechnology outsourcing, 30% growth in data managementoutsourcing and 13% increase in clinical outsourcing, advisedDillon.Loss Of Control Fear Is A Key Barrier"A key barrier to outsourcing is the fear of loss of control," saidDillon. "There's always the misperception that the hospital can do itbetter than an outsider. Another misperception is that there may bean extra layer of cost, but obviously the outsourcer needs to make aprofit in there."From the hospital perspective, the way to overcome the fears andbarriers is to have a clear strategy, including realistically achievableexpectations, measurable conditions, and pricing and performancegoals based on responsibilities and risks of both parties. Selectingan outsourcing company as a partner, rather than a vendor, is vital ifyou want to shift or share in the risks, as is upfront discovery andanalysis of an outsourcer's technical, financial and managementcapabilities.The biggest stumbling block for hospitals that are consideringoutsourcing is "personal pride," according to Mike Hamilton, CostaMesa, Calif.-based national director of health care for KPMG PeatMarwick. "There seems to be a feeling of failure if you have to bringin someone from outside. Another stumbling block is that people arereluctant to let go and are anxious to hold on to how business hasalways been provided."What You Need To Know When Considering OutsourcingHamilton's top five list of things health care institutions need toknow when considering outsourcing include:+ Make sure you're comparing apples to apples--that the cost youthink you're giving up, eliminating, should be comparable in natureto the services you're going to be receiving.+ Have an open mind relative to others' ways of doing things.+ Be certain that the outsourcing vendor has tangible deliverablesand that performance can be easily assessed.+ Services delivered by your institution should be enhanced. A goodoutsourcing vendor should be able to become a seamless part of theproduct that is delivered to the public. What the public seesshouldn't be any different, whether you're doing it or someone elseis providing it.+ Treat your outsourcing provider as a partner and not a vendor.Partners tend to drive and create more value for each other than avendor relationship.Great Misconception"The greatest misconception that hospital folks have is thatoutsource folks will give away the store for a contract--that they willdo it for little or no profit," said Hamilton. "The true perspective isthat outsourcers may be able to do it for less than hospitals arecurrently paying and still make a handsome profit.""Another frequent misconception is that most hospital administratorstend to think they can get in and out relatively easily--if it doesn'twork out, we can go back to how it used to be. But to have apartnership relationship, you need to have a long-term contract, atleast three to five years. Because, as service becomes more blendedinto yours, to change it again makes it much more difficult."The often-mentioned 90-day just-cause provisions are validcontracting tools allowing escape. However, they should be usedonly in the extreme situation, where philosophies and operatingstyles can't be synchronized. The 90-day just-cause and year-to-yearcontract is indicative of the old vendor relationship. Remember--outsource providers will invest first in their longer contracts.Within the acute care hospital market, there are between 10,000 and11,000 outsourcing contracts in place, "and that number's growingevery day," said Keith Goding, executive vice president and chiefdevelopment officer for RehabCare Group. The St. Louis-basedoutsourcer of rehabilitation and physical therapy programs contractswith more than 100 hospitals in 24 states.An Outsourcer Lists Tactical Reasons To OutsourceThe tactical reasons for hospitals to outsource, as cited by Goding,are to:+ Control operating expenses--Across the board, in all industry, theaverage cost savings last year from outsourcing was 9% and a 15%increase in capacity and quality according to the OutsourcingInstitute.+ Make capital funds available--You reduce need to invest capitalfunds in non-core business functions.+ Cash infusion--Transfer of assets from customer to the provider.+ Gain access to resources that are not available internally.+ Quickly gain control or improve management of departments thatare essentially out of control--not performing well, difficulty withquality, staff turnover, financial performance that's gone down thetubes."If you've just lost key staff in an area, the most efficient thing to dois outsource it rather than the painful rebuilding internally," saidGoding. "It brings a new perspective to the table, new sources ofcreativity, and outsourcers are not in that operating mode that hasself-fulfilling prophecies--like 'this department never makesmoney.' It's tough to get a balanced perspective when you're soclose."Focus With Outsourcers Should Be Performance CriteriaFirst define your institution's goals and its competencies. What arethe core competencies that your institution does best? What areas arenot centers of excellence, where a third party, a contractmanagement company might be able to provide more focus, bringmore resources, more expertise to the table and in the end managethat function better?When you are talking to an outsourcing company, the focus shouldalways be on performance criteria. You need to quantify whatperformance you are looking for, what performance the outsourcingvendor will be judged by and how performance will affect theircompensation.Increasingly, the relationship between hospitals and outsourcers isperformance driven. It means the quality of services being providedare measured in several ways--outcomes measurement, the clinicaloutcome that is achieved for an individual patient or group ofpatients, and satisfaction measurement of both patients who havegone through the treatment and medical staff who've had interactionwith the outsourcing clinical vendor.And remember, performance related to cost is a two-sided coin--expense control and revenue generation.You Have To Partner To Share The Risk"The hospital and its outsourcing provider should be in the sameboat together," said Goding. "If risk is shared, both the up anddownside, that allows everyones' interest, intentions and motives tobe in alignment. It makes for partnerships. We think that thepartnership arrangement is the way to do business in today'senvironment--not the traditional vendor relationship, based on flatfees regardless of performance."Catholic Health Care West, a 23-hospital system based in SanFrancisco, outsources traditional services, including laundries, foodservice, biomed programs, equipment repair and distribution ofmaterials."With the way the cost environment is going today, you have toconsider more outsourcing," said Mike Bergdorf, corporate directorof materials. "Hospitals still have not been subject to the tremendouscost cutting that they will face in the future--from both insurancecarriers and the federal government. Outsourcing is one of theoptions that you need to explore."However, you must carefully assess the risks to outsourcing, too,cautioned Bergdorf. Its biggest risk, in his opinion, is that once yououtsource a service, it's very difficult to bring it back inside. Oftenthe people needed to run the operations have left the hospital andgone on to other jobs, and space might have been given up for otherprograms that would have to be uprooted, producing a raft of newproblems and costs.Spell Out Quality Specifications And Access To DataQuality must be contractually specified, and some action spelled out,if those quality standards are not maintained."You need to be careful that any outsource program fits in with theoverall focus and strategy of your hospital," said Bergdorf. "Andyou don't want to outsource something where you lose all yourdata. You must make a provision in any contract that you get accessto the information that comes from that outsourced function."A stumbling block that hospitals trip over is not creating anoutsource contract that stipulates all the expectations and protects thehospital, reiterated Marty Holzman, a Philadelphia-based managerwith Coopers & Lybrand.Stipulate All Expectations In Outsource ContractsAs a buyer of outsource services, you need to create a detaileddocument--not just accept the proposal that's given to you by theoutsource firm, but one that protects the interest of the hospital, hesaid. It also must provide for incentives for improvements andsavings that match the goals and objectives of the hospital."I've seen too many outsourcing agreements just be renewed yearafter year, without a rigorous evaluation of how the agreement nowcompares to either other outsource firms or what the hospital coulddo on its own," said Holzman.The renewal evaluations should be a team process including peoplefrom finance, patient care, materials management and others whomoutsourcing impacts, so that it's looked at from a variety ofperspectives.With the increasing capitation agreements, you must build intocontracts the right level of risk sharing and controls to ensure costsavings and quality of services. This is particularly importantbecause the outsourcing firm has an incentive to just cut costs and atendency to reduce quality. For example, if you have a pharmacyoutsource contract, it should include controls that ensure availabilityof services 24 hours a day and guarantee delivery of the first dose ofa drug within 30 minutes.Outsourcing possibilities have expanded quickly, and you, too, needto stretch in your consideration of them for the survival of yourhospital or system.(Tables omitted for online service.

JohnsonHospitals, integrated systems, large medical groups and managedcare organizations should publish their capitated rates and insurancepremiums and eliminate much of the contracting secrecy that isdistorting the health care market.A favorite ploy used by HMOs is to require subcontractors to keeptheir contract terms confidential. This is a mistake for providers.Secrecy favors health maintenance organizations and preferredprovider organizations and lets them give different deals tocompeting providers. Secrecy also allows providers to give differentdeals to competing HMOs, but HMOs know the market better thanproviders and are less likely to be taken advantage of by providers.HMOs Have Information AdvantageAt this point, a few powerful HMOs and PPOs have tremendousnegotiating advantages over providers, because there is anoversupply of specialists and hospital beds in most markets.In addition, because the chains are in many markets, they knowwhat they can get away with better than small medical groups andintegrated health care systems do.Also, hospitals already publish room rates and disclose their averagecharges per patient day. And their costs are widely available tomanaged care organizations and large employers from Medicare costreports, and HMO's costs and premiums already are publishedperiodically. So publishing capitation rates and average premiumswould be just the next step toward full disclosure and more uniformpricing in health care.In other commodity and financial markets, producers publish theirprices and give them to various publishers such as The Wall StreetJournal, which uses them in its cash markets table on thecommodities page and in various financial tables.Lehman Bros., Merrill Lynch and other industry leaders publishtheir prices, which are used as benchmarks for the industry.Contracts are written based on the banks' published prime lendingrates.Potential Leaders: Columbia, MayoColumbia/HCA, Mayo Clinic, Kaiser and Cigna, to mention a feworganizations, all have the potential of establishing themselves asnational and market leaders by publishing their prices, or "primerates." This would establish them as the market leaders and wouldallow them to test price changes quickly as their costs change.What published prices do for sellers is establish the market price.Then, competitors can offer discounts from the market price orcharge premiums. A bank, for example, may charge one point overprime plus a 1% transaction fee on a 36-month asset loan.When there are published prices, buyers' expectations are morerealistic and there is less price cutting and relatively littleovercharging by suppliers. Everyone knows the going auto loanrate, the 30-year mortgage rate and the price of soybean meal.Like it or not, employers and HMOs are treating health care servicesas commodities, and they should be priced accordingly.Thus, in local markets, large medical groups and integrated systemsshould establish themselves as market leaders by publishing theircapitated rates for primary care physicians, specialists,pharmaceuticals and other services. The insurers already are gettingsuch information from various database purveyors, includingMedirisk in Atlanta. The important challenge for providers is tomake sure that all providers and employers have the sameinformation as HMOs, PPOs and other insurers.Medicare Becoming Highest PayerPricing secrecy in managed care contracting is one reason thatMedicare is one of the highest--if not the highest payers--in somemarkets where managed care organizations are demanding andgetting 20% to 70% discounts from providers. Providers anddiagnostic centers that are desperate for business or out of touchwith their markets are giving their services away and dragging pricesdown not only for themselves but for all providers.This industry secret hit the cover of the influential political journal,The New Republic (December 11, pp. 20), and undoubtedlyinfluenced the negotiations between Congress and the president overthe Medicare Preservation Act of 1995.What the politicians probably concluded and will decide in 1996 isthat if Medicare can be the best payer in some markets, it probably ispaying too much. Their solution will be to cut Medicare payments toproviders instead of slowing the rate of growth of payments over thenext seven years.Medicare Payment Schemes Will ChangeThey also are likely to conclude that if HMOs can get such goodprices for commercial enrollees, they probably can do the same forMedicare enrollees. As a result, the politicians will change thepayment scheme for Medicare risk contractors so that they won't bepaid as much as they are under the current program.This will work to the advantage of the rich, established HMOs thathave billions in reserves and no debt. It will hurt new providerorganizations and provider sponsored organizations that are trying tobreak into the metropolitan Medicare risk contracting markets. POsand PSOs in more rural areas may not be hurt, because politiciansare inclined to protect them and their rural hospitals.How Providers Will React To Price PressureMeanwhile, deep discounting by hospitals, medical groups, solopractitioners and integrated systems will roil the commercialmanaged care markets. Hospitals and small multi-hospital systemswill protect themselves by:+ Joining larger multi-unit providers and provider sponsoredorganizations that can resist price pressures.+ Creating integrated health care systems anchored by large medicalgroups that are capitated.+ Buying and closing smaller competitors.+ Encouraging small physician groups to consolidate.+ Pushing physicians harder to reduce utilization and improveoutcomes.+ Publishing prices so competitors know the market.+ Restructuring access to reduce costs.+ Refusing to contract with the most price-conscious HMOs; beingwilling to lose a few contracts.+ Making greater use of nurse and physician extenders.+ Negotiating better deals with suppliers.+ Standardizing more medical and surgical supplies.+ Buying money-saving products and services regardless ofwhether they are covered by group purchasing contracts.+ Making a big public issue of HMOs' pricing demands and cuttingthe most visible and popular services in response to those demands.+ Selling quality.+ Pushing for full pricing disclosure legislation.Some HMOs Will Pay MoreSome HMOs will be smart enough to cut costs by recruiting the bestproviders instead of paying the lowest professional fees andcapitated rates.They'll look for well-managed hospitals and integrated systems thatminimize utilization, as large medical groups are doing on the WestCoast. And they'll hook up with large medical groups that willcontrol utilization on their own without requiring muchadministrative time or expenses from the HMO.Unfortunately, the largest HMOs, with 50% to 75% of all HMOenrollees, have the leverage to win big price concessions fromproviders, and they are exercising their power in many markets.Smaller HMOs and integrated systems don't have as much clout,which puts them at price disadvantages in markets where they arenot the largest players. But where they are the largest HMOs, smallHMOs can put a lot of pressure on providers' rates.This is why it will benefit even smaller integrated systems andmedical groups that are the largest providers in their market tobecome the price leaders by publishing their capitated rates as wellas their room rates and office visit fees.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996MOORE REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN GOLF-HISTORICPINEHURST BREAKS SUCCESS RECORDS WITH ITSHEALTH AND FITNESS CENTERThe 397-bed Moore Regional Hospital is based in Pinehurst, N.C.,a resort community whose citizens--60% of whom are retired--calltheir town "the home of golf in America." As one of its first visiblesigns that it is converting from a "sick care" institution to anintegrated "health care" system, Moore Regional Hospitalestablished a comprehensive health and fitness center. The $6.7million facility was designed to integrate health promotion, wellnessand fitness activities with cardiac and physical rehabilitation andcommunity health."Strategically, the hospital entered this business to begin managingthe health status of its population, to create a new revenue sourceand to create a new image for the health system," said RobertBoone, vice president of professional services.With unprecedented success in its opening membership, the new52,000-square foot facility opened its doors in January, with 3,600members. Membership has grown to a current 4,200--with morethan 900 on its waiting list. Some 27% of Pinehurst's population aremembers, and they pay an average of $38 per month formembership. Where the average age of members in most hospital-based wellness centers is mid-30s, Pinehurst's older retired citizenryhas produced an average member age of 53 years. The center's year-to-date turnover rate is less than 11%. And although it is still tooearly to predict with certainty financial performance, it appears thefacility will break even within the first 15 months of operation.Programming is offered for all ages ranging from six monthsthrough geriatrics, with specific activities for arthritics, pre- andpostnatal fitness, diabetics, cardiac and physical rehabilitation,medically directed weight loss and personalized intervention basedon an individual's current fitness status or medical diagnosis. Thehealth and fitness center also offers free community health lecturesmonthly, with an average attendance of 70 people.Information obtained from health risk appraisals and fitnessevaluations, offered to every member upon joining the facility, arestored in a database. Additionally, the hospital is beginning toaggressively pursue obtaining health risk appraisals, through thecorporate members, the occupational health program, communityhealth outreach program and community health fairs, on as manypeople as possible within the service area."By obtaining and constantly updating the database, we will have astatistically valid measure of the health status of the population itserves and a tool to measure the societal impact of programs it mayoffer," said Boone.For corporate customers, who comprise 30% of membership,periodic reports are run that show the health risk reduction for theiremployees participating in wellness and fitness programs. Theseresults can be translated into reduced sick time, reduced time lost atwork to illness and injury, increased productivity and dollars saved.The product is customized for each client by looking at the mostfrequently encountered work site injuries and specifically designingclasses or interventions designed to reduce the number and severityof workplace injuries.(Table omitted for online service.

Thefee was a nominal $25 per night, subsidized by outsidecontributions. They started with seven rooms and thought they'd fillmaybe four per night. But, they ended up using 11 rooms per nightand often times had waiting lists."We knew when we opened the facility that we'd be meeting a need,but honestly had very little idea how extensive that need was andwere overwhelmed by the response," said Karyn Schwab, executivedirector of the babies' and children's hospital.In response to a continuing need of family members, under stressand often traveling from around the world for care at the quaternarycare center, Columbia-Presbyterian decided to offer rooms withadditional amenities and pamper the patient and family."The marketplace has gotten much more competitive in New York,and everyone is looking for creative ways of meeting needs andattracting patients," said Schwab.

Bourque, senior vice president, VHAinformation and research.In their 1996 environmental assessment, VHA and Deloitte &Touche recommend five actions for health care organizations toprevent an escalating medical crisis. According to the report, the1996 Environmental Assessment of the Health Care System in theUnited States, organizations must:+ Broaden their vision to service multiple customers with varyingneeds;+ Insist on vibrant, integrated delivery systems;+ Improve financial performance and operating results;+ Define and monitor quality outcomes throughout the continuum ofcare;+ Focus on improving core processes to offer better services atlower costs.The report analyzes a large body of primary research that addressesall facets of the U.S. health care system and its participants: patients,clinicians, providers, managed care organizations, insurers andgovernment. The assessment offers both short- and long-termcritical action recommendations and is a benchmark used annuallyby strategic planners.VHA urges providers to move toward the "accountable care phase"of integration, where providers' incentives are aligned withpurchasers and insurers and there is full integration betweenproviders and the community.Pointing to the climbing inflation rate for hospitals--5.5% in 1994compared with overall medical care inflation's 4.9% growth, thelowest rate of growth since 1973--Merlin Olson, a partner withDeloitte & Touche, said:"Despite hospitals' energetic efforts to trim their inpatientovercapacity, the fact remains that we still have twice the number ofbeds we need. Moreover, overcapacity weakens the bargainingposition of providers as they face off against employers and otherpurchasers who are less willing to subsidize underpayments bygovernment and other low-margin payers."For more information on the 1996 Environmental Assessmentreport, available for $85, call VHA Teleservices at 800/842-7587.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996THE REVOLT AGAINST THE ONE-DAY STAYBy Beth GinzingerThe hospital care of women during the birthing process has changeddramatically over the last several years. Health care facilities arebeing created to reflect this new attitude toward childbirth byproviding a homelike environment; allowing the infant, mother, andsignificant other to stay together; and minimizing transfers duringthe hospital stay.Most Prevalent Admission Is ChildbirthIronically, the attitude that childbirth is a natural process has alsofueled one of the most hotly debated health care issues: the length ofstay for new mothers and babies. With 4 million deliveries a year,childbirth is the most prevalent cause of hospital admission,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Notsurprisingly, length of stay for normal vaginal deliveries is beingscrutinized by payers seeking to minimize costs.It is particularly difficult in this time of uncertainty to plan forobstetrical facilities. Significant changes in length of stay can have adramatic impact on facilities, particularly for large-volume serviceswith a single-room maternity care concept. And yet, manyinstitutions are facing situations where renovation or replacement oftheir obstetrical services is imperative to their ability to negotiate formanaged care contracts and remain marketable to their physician andpatient constituents.Economic Line Between Wellness And Clinical RiskMany people, particularly clinicians and patients, feel that we havecrossed the line between a wellness approach that is alsoeconomically sound, and an economic approach that is clinicallyunsafe. The recent study completed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock MedicalCenter validated clinical concerns as they relate to newborns andearly discharge. The study team evaluated nearly 15,000 infantsfrom New Hampshire by reviewing readmission rates and ER visitsfor neonates sent home within 48 hours of birth. They concludedthat infants discharged early are at increased risk. The most commonreasons for readmission and ER visits included jaundice,pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. They also concluded, by comparingcosts of early discharge vs. longer hospital stays, that earlydischarge, although clinically questionable, is a cost-effectiveapproach. According to the study, the balance between clinicalissues and cost-effectiveness appears to be a well-developed follow-up program either using a home health approach or a scheduledreturn visit.There has also been considerable discussion about the impact of thereduced length of stay on mothers. Patient satisfaction surveysindicate that mothers perceive that their care is less than adequate,with particular emphasis on the lack of time that the nurses spendwith them. Nurses express concerns that they do not have sufficienttime to educate and evaluate psychosocial issues that may need to beaddressed.Hospitals Are Caught In The CrossfireA number of legislative actions have been introduced recentlymandating the option for a 48-hour length of stay for new mothersand neonates, based on the Dartmouth-Hitchcock study andguidelines from the National College of Obstetricians andGynecologists and the American College of Pediatricians. Earlydischarge is allowed with certain criteria, including clinical standardsand well-defined follow-up care programs. Legislation has alreadypassed in Maryland, New Jersey and Massachusetts and is pendingin California, New York and Pennsylvania. This legislation placesthe hospital in the middle of the crossfire. Based on study findings,clinician pressures and an increasingly litigious society, manyhospital administrators feel compelled to support a two-day length ofstay. However, with continued pressure to decrease costs in the eraof managed care, and with obstetrical admissions contributing to asignificant number of patient days in a relatively healthy patientpopulation, length of stay is a prime target for decreasing resourceutilization.Where will the pendulum stop in the length of stay debate? And willit start to swing again in a few years? With an expected life of atleast twenty years, a long-range obstetrical facility developmentstrategy is needed to weather changing variables. For hospitalsfacing renovation or new construction of their obstetrical facilities,the answer is to plan flexible space and concentrate on two majorapproaches: Employ the labor-delivery-recovery-postpartum(LDRPlus) concept to eliminate use of single-room maternity carefor extended-stay patients, and provide adequate triage/holdingspace.Because of the random nature of arrivals to the obstetrical suite,determining the appropriate number of birthing rooms is achallenging task. Since actual workloads fluctuate from month tomonth, week to week and day to day, use of a daily average forfacility planning, calculated from monthly or yearly total workloaddata, results in a rather marked understatement of space needs. Asmall-volume service (less than 1,000 births) may require twice thenumber of birthing rooms to accommodate the peak than requiredfor the average. Considering the additional the impact of a one-dayvs. a two-day length of stay, and the planning range may be as wideas 200%. Alternatively, planning for the busiest day of the yearresults in severely underused facilities, with these beds frequentlyeither empty or used for postpartum patients, and the high-techcharacteristics of the birthing rooms used only a fraction of the time.LDRPlus Is The KeyThe LDRPlus concept, a mix of birthing rooms and ante/postpartumrooms, is recommended as the most cost-effective and flexibleapproach. Low-risk patients with good prenatal care, who arereceptive to education programs and have no major socioeconomicproblems, are targeted prior to delivery as candidates for a 24-hourlength of stay in a birthing room. For patients who do not fit thecriteria for a one-day length of stay, it is not an appropriate use ofresources to maintain that patient in a birthing room for their entireoccupancy. These patients should be transferred to a postpartum bedfor a longer stay after their recovery period in a birthing room.The goal is to have all vaginal deliveries occur in a birthing roomand use the birthing rooms as labor/delivery/recovery/postpartumareas for patients who have a high probability of being dischargedwithin 24 hours or when census permits. Other patients will betransferred to private postpartum rooms. During peak times, a highproportion of the patients will be transferred. This approachmaximizes use of high-cost birthing rooms while providing ahomelike atmosphere for all patients and cost-effective utilization ofresources. A well-planned women/infants center provides intrinsicflexibility to accommodate peaks and valleys throughout the year aswell as typical forecasting inaccuracies.Triage/Holding Space Is Key To FlexibilityProviding sufficient triage/holding space is crucial for obstetricalfacilities that must handle wide fluctuations in workload. The triagearea is used to regulate the flow of patients into the larger and moreexpensive birthing rooms during peak periods, much as theprovision of a minimal number of postpartum beds allows selectedpatients to be moved out of the birthing rooms more rapidly duringpeak periods.The average length of stay in a birthing room prior to deliveryshould be between 10 and 12 hours. If the stay exceeds this range,patients are probably being admitted prior to experiencing activelabor, often because no triage/holding facilities are available forassessment. Once admitted into a birthing room, it is often difficultto send patients home who are not in active labor. Also, at peaktimes when the unit is at capacity, if the labor or birthing rooms arethe only available space for a laboring patient, the low-risk, 24-hourpostpartum patient will have to be transferred.Triage/holding space can also be used for common prenatal testing(nonstress tests, ultrasounds, etc.). In addition, this space may beused as a return visit assessment area for those patients dischargedwithin 24 hours. Finally, it is important to allocate appropriateresources to prenatal education and care for patients who are eligiblefor a 24-hour length of stay. Patients will have better clinicaloutcomes and a better view of their experience if they are welleducated and well prepared.As the pace of change accelerates in the health care industry,hospitals must continue to balance patient expectations with payerdemands. The LDRPlus approach combined with adequatetriage/holding areas is the best solution for hospitals struggling toplan obstetrical facilities during the 24-hour length of stay debate.(Table omitted for online service.

Themajority of women in the study were not queried about smoking,diet, exercise, alcohol and drug use during their last medicalcheckup. Yet three in five women, age 18 and over, reported riskybehavior in one of more of these areas.Early detection of cervical cancer through the use of the Pap test hasresulted in a 40% reduction in invasive cervical cancer during thepast 40 years. Despite this proven effectiveness, 43% of womenhave not been screened in the past year.Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer amongwomen, and the stage at which it is diagnosed is a major predictor ofsurvival.

Many simply stop when they start to feel better. Aconcern of patients is a belief that they will develop a resistance toantibiotics. Clinicians emphasize that people who fail to take theirantibiotics as prescribed contribute to the development of harder-to-treat infections.A national cross section of 1,010 adults and 100 physicians wassurveyed. Although antibiotics effectively treat only bacterialinfections, six out of 10 adults mistakenly believe antibiotics areeffective against viral infections, such as colds and influenza. Eightout of 10 physicians believe patients save unfinished antibioticprescriptions to use again at a later time.To encourage proper usage of antibiotics, the American Lung Assn.offers a patient eduction brochure, Winter Wellness: A CommonSense Guide to Antibiotics.(Tables omitted for online service.

An eight-year study, involvingnearly 10,000 seriously ill patients in five leading medicalinstitutions, the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences forOutcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) cost $28 millionand was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.Thestudy was reported in the November 22/29 issue of The Journal ofthe American Medical Association (JAMA)."Woefully inadequate communication" between medicalprofessionals and patients near the end of life was the principalproblem found by researchers. Doctors don't clearly conveypatients' chances for survival. And compounding the problem,patients and families don't discuss their wishes soon, or often,enough.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996A TRAGIC MISMATCH"There is a tragic mismatch between the health care many seriouslyill and dying people want and what they get," said study director Dr.William Knaus, critical care specialist and department chair at theUniversity of Virginia Medical School. "They find themselves inhospital environments that are geared to doing certain high-tech,invasive procedures extraordinarily well. Such treatments canpreserve life for conditions that would have previously resultedmore quickly in death. These same techniques, however, can alsoprolong dying and make it a painful and mechanical process. Theproblem is that the system does not know when or how to stop."Findings were particularly alarming because the results werecontrary to outside experts' assumptions about what would make iteasier to curtail aggressive medical care, increase the attention givento pain control and other symptoms, and cut hospital costs.Study patients were from Beth Israel Hospital in Boston,MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Marshfield Clinic/St.Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield, Wis., and the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles Hospital.The SUPPORT study involved 4,301 hospitalized patients who, onaverage, could be expected to survive no more than six months.Patients had one of nine life-threatening conditions, includingcancers, congestive heart failure and chronic liver disease. (Deathsfrom these nine causes account for more than one-third of adultU.S. deaths annually.) Among the findings are the following:+ Doctors didn't know their patients' wishes. For example, ifpatients did not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), doctorsdidn't know about it 47% of the time.+ Of the do-not-resuscitate orders, 46% were not written until a dayor two before death, suggesting little advance planning in terminalillnesses.+ 38% of patients spent at least 10 days in intensive care, whereaggressive treatment is the norm.+ Pain was common. Half the patients able to communicate in thelast three days of life said they were in severe pain.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996SPECIAL HELP FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENT FAMILIESThe second phase of the study, a subsequent two-year clinical trial,involved 4,804 seriously ill patients, who were divided into either acontrol group that received customary care or an experimentalgroup, in which doctors and families had the following special help:+ A nurse whose job was to talk to patients and families about theirconcerns and to keep lines of communication open and clearbetween them and the hospital and physician staff;+ Computer-generated reports estimating a patient's probability ofsurviving six months and how disabled they would be in the nexttwo months; and+ Detailed written instructions on the patient's and family's wishesregarding treatment--including pain control and "heroic measures"such as resuscitation--and how much they wanted to discuss theirtreatment with their doctor.These interventions were developed and based on the kinds ofinformation that doctors said they needed regarding patients' medicalstatus and wishes for treatment. But according to Knaus, "we werestunned to find that it didn't make a bit of difference. The tools thatexperts thought would work, didn't."The three-part intervention did not affect the amount of time patientsspent in the intensive care unit, in a coma or on an artificial breathingmachine before dying. Reports of pain increased, and costs of caredid not change.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR THE DYINGThe study's researchers suggest the following to improve care forthe dying:+ Establish end-of-life practice guidelines;+ Teach medical students and physicians that technologicalapproaches to dying can harm patients;+ Teach palliative care techniques that enhance life at its end;+ Hospitals should examine patterns of care for dying patients,emphasizing the new responsibilities that doctors and hospitals mustassume when death is unavoidable.For more information, contact the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation at 609/452-8701.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996WASHINGTON STATE HOSPITALS SHOW TREND TOWARDSICKER PATIENTS, SHORTER STAYSThe effects of managed care on hospitals are dramatically evident inWashington state. There are fewer people in the hospital today, andthose who are in the hospital are sicker than ever before. This year,for the first time in more than 20 years, dollar charges related to theirinpatient care decreased.In Washington the trend is much more pronounced than in otherparts of the country, according to findings of Bellevue, Wash.-based HBS International (HBSI). Specializing in measuring healthcare outcomes, HBSI found dramatic changes in Washington stateinpatient hospital use in the last year.Although there was overall population growth in the state and thedegree of illness increased by 4%, between 1993 and 1994 hospitalinpatient days decreased by almost a quarter-million. The chargesassociated with hospital inpatient care dropped by over $72 millionand the number of hospitalized patients dropped by 16,670. Thiswas the only year during the four-year study in which chargesdropped, even though the degree of illness continued to increase.In Seattle, almost $90 million less was charged for inpatient hospitalcare from 1993 to 1994, representing a 5% drop in charges,114,156 few patient days, and 10,164 fewer hospitalized patients.Most of the Puget Sound areas followed this trend of treating sickerpatients in less time and for less money.In marked contrast, Spokane area hospitals charged over $8 millionmore during that time period, despite having hospitalized 756 fewerpatients for 21,301 fewer inpatient days than the year before.(Table omitted for online service.

Some 86% said that would be "very"important to them. Seven out of 10 also said they could appreciatethe ability to more effectively collate and present medical historiesand test results, and 55% described as "very" important the benefitof avoiding the need to fill out medical and insurance forms.When exploring the benefits of quality and reduced cost,approximately 75% agreed it would be very important to usecomputer-based patient records to:+ Identify substandard doctors and poorly run health facilities;+ Improve detection of and reduce fraudulent claims by patients,doctors and hospitals;+ Reduce the cost of health care by improving the identification ofwaste and inefficiency;+ Get better statistical data for studying the causes of disease andtesting new treatments.(Table omitted for online service.

The numbersof enrollees and Health Care Financing Administration contracts forMedicare managed care plans have grown enormously in the lastfew years."Medicare managed care will have a growing emphasis on healthand wellness as a key part of demand management," said SheilaJacobs, senior consultant for managed care marketing at Scottsdale,Ariz.-based HSM Group. "It will promote vastly underservedbeneficiaries--a large senior population that's never been servedbefore by managed care. Productivity is no longer the cash cow."Adverse Selection Probably MinimalAn initial problem is adverse selection--drawing people who willdrive utilization up. But, remember, people do not tend to leave theenvironment they are in. When Cigna of Arizona offered a zero-premium product, less than 5% adversely selected, said Jacobs.People don't make a switch because they are not well, but you mustknow the demographics of your population.For example, most people in Arizona--one of the most HMO-penetrated markets in the country--thought the mecca for Medicaremanaged care would be Sun City and the Phoenix metropolitan area,where there are more than 325,000 individuals who make up the65+ population of Maricopa County. But, as few as 70,000 neteligibles are yielded when seniors who have employer retirementhealth plans, the working aged and other categories are eliminated.Jacob explained how insurers found out that some 80,000 of thesenior population were in indemnity plans from their formeremployers, which could not be converted to a Medicare riskproduct. About 104,000 were already in Medicare HMOs whowould require a switching strategy for marketers. Some 40,000people were still part of the working aged and had health insurancethrough their employers. Some had Medicaid--seniors with end-stage renal disease or in hospice care.Demand Analysis Of Marketplace Is A Key"The key is to do a demand analysis in the marketplace," saidJacobs. "You better find out the net eligibles, not the gross eligibles.And remember, patient satisfaction and member retention strategiesare critical. People can change month-to-month to another plan.Within 45 days they can switch, it's not annual."Psychographics And Demographics Are VitalThe health plans that will be successful in government risk programswill need to conduct research to learn the medical needs of theseniors in the geographic area they serve, as well as theirpsychographic and demographic characteristics. SuccessfulMedicare risk products will require sales and communicationtechniques very different from those used to reach the blue-collarworker, the white-collar professional, baby boomers or any othermarket niche, emphasized Jacobs. Then you must never stopanalyzing your product and measuring member service satisfactionand perceptions. This continuous review of product, providers andplan members is critical, not only for statistical evidence, but todocument quality.There are very different ways to market to 60-year-olds vs.marketing to 70-year-olds or 80-year-olds. However, there are somegeneral "satisfiers and dissatisfiers" for seniors, said Jacobs. Inorder of importance, they are providers, prescriptions and hospitals.Through focus groups held by The HSM Group, seniors expressedthe following:+ Providers--Seniors are looking for their own doctors on that list ofproviders, and plans with limited physician choices are definitely ata disadvantage.+ Prescriptions--Formulary is a very important satisfier, and goodprescription coverage is always a competitive advantage. Availabilityof this benefit is important--not having a cap on it, but rather a high-end coverage. "Seniors like to know that it is open-ended," saidJacobs. "In fact, they do not use as much medicine as they thinkthey do, so it's easier to offer a higher benefit because they rarelyget anywhere near the cap."+ Hospitals--Hospital choice is extremely important. Most peoplehave a familiarity with the hospital they go to, and they want it onthe list.+ Friendly environment--Most important to seniors is a friendly andpleasant environment. More people change plans because of patientdissatisfaction with medical staff and lack of understanding of HMOor product. It's crucial to have a strong orientation program forMedicare patients.For more information on managed care marketing, contact Jacobs at602/947-8078.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996NCQA LAUNCHES WORLD WIDE WEB SITE,ACCREDITATION-SEARCHABLE DATABASEThe National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) has a newWorld Wide Web site, which will make information on managedcare quality and individual health plan performance more accessible.The World Wide Web site is located at http://www.ncqa.org.Major areas featured at the Web site are accreditation, HEDIS reportcards, publications, educational conferences and NCQA news.Updated monthly, the NCQA's accreditation status list shows howindividual health plans have fared in NCQA's accreditation process.Visitors to the site will be able to view or download the list, and itsoon will be part of a searchable database as well.

One-third of the new top hospitals are investor-owned, compared with 6% in the study released last year.

"Doctorsare trained to fight disease. They receive inadequate training in thepharmacological and nonpharmacological management of pain."Numerous commentators, including the World Health Organizationand the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, have calledupon physicians, nurses and health care systems to do a better job ofproviding pain relief to the patients in their care. It has been welldocumented that pain relief is inadequate in many hospitals andclinical settings, despite the fact that we have the knowledge,medicines, and other techniques necessary to provide adequate painrelief for patients with nearly all kinds of pain--those experiencingtemporary but acute postoperative pain, those with chronic painfulconditions and those in pain from advanced cancer or other terminalillnesses. Recent research has underscored that most of the time,pain is not only unnecessary, but that unrelieved pain can slow thehealing process, interfere with sleep, increase stress, and may resultin longer periods of hospitalization.The EDC will assist 50 health care institutions that have alreadycompleted another innovative medical education program entitledDecisions Near the End of Life."As Decisions alumni, these organizations are experienced problemsolvers with a commitment to excellent multidisciplinary care," saidMildred Z. Solomon, senior scientist at EDC and project leader."The new Mayday grant is exciting because it will enable us to link,via a World Wide Web site, some of the country's finest experts inpain management at hospitals and nursing homes with aconscience....We hope to create a virtual community of thesededicated professionals, so that they can learn from one another asthey experiment with better forms of patient care."For more information, contact Solomon at EDC by calling 617/969-7100, ext. 2404.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996MEDICAL SCHOOLS RECEIVE GRANTS FOR ADDINGSPIRITUAL TRAINING TO CURRICULUMFive medical schools will incorporate religious sensitivity into thepractice of medicine by developing courses integrating medicine andreligion. A new grant program--conceived by the Rockville, Md.-based National Institute for Healthcare Research (NIHR) and fundedby the John Templeton Foundation--has provided $10,000 each toJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Albert EinsteinCollege of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Ohio State UniversityCollege of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University College ofMedicine and East Tennessee State University's James H. QuillenCollege of Medicine.According to recent Gallup Poll surveys, Americans are highlyreligious--95% believe in god, 57% pray daily and 42% attendworship services weekly. Patient spirituality has been found toinfluence not only illness prevention, coping, treatment and care, buthow patients define and view their illness as well. While more than75% of patients recently surveyed believed that their physicianshould address spiritual issues as part of their care, these samepatients reported that spiritual and religious concerns were neverincluded or addressed in their care.For more information on the faith and medicine program, call NIHRat 800/580-6447.Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996LARGE MEDICAL GROUPS MAKE INTEGRATED SYSTEMSCOMPETITIVEMedical groups have the potential to control provider sponsoredorganizations and integrated health care delivery systems. And allindications are that their involvement will make their integratedsystems extremely competitive with systems where physicians haveless control and ownership.New utilization data indicate that it is more important to have largemedical groups in integrated systems than to have the systems led byphysician executives, although both large groups and physicianleadership may benefit integrated systems. Thus, for integratedsystems to dominate their markets, they will need to consolidateprimary care physicians into large groups and put them undercapitated contracts as quickly as possible, the new data from thethree leading trade associations for medical groups suggest.Large medical group practices contracting with and owned byintegrated health care systems are using hospital services much lessthan smaller groups and solo practitioners, according to the MedicalGroup Practice Digest 1995, which is sponsored by Hoechst MarionRoussel, Kansas City, Mo. Managing utilization is critical tocontrolling costs and premiums charged by HMOs.The large groups that are members of the Unified Medical GroupAssn., for example, reduced average hospital days per 1,000 HMOenrollees by 44% to 151 in 1994 from 269 in 1984, according toUMGA data published in the digest, which is part of HoechstMarion Roussel's Managed Care Digest Series. The average hospitalutilization for all HMOs was 297 days for non-Medicare enrollees.UMGA members reported 872 hospital days per 1,000 Medicareenrollees, compared with 1,698 for all HMOs.UMGA members' enrollees' average length of stay in 1994 was3.05 days for non-Medicare members and 4.44 days for Medicaremembers. This compared with 4.2 days for all HMOs for non-Medicare enrollees and 6.6 days for Medicare enrollees in allHMOs.UMGA has 86 medical group members that represent more than10,000 physicians; most are in California, which is a highlycompetitive managed care market. The average UMGA group had119 physicians in 1994, up 33% from 1993. The medical groupscovered 4.5 million capitated enrollees. Medical group memberscovered an average of 51,646 HMO enrollees per group, and IPAmember groups averaged 60,000 enrollees per group, according toUMGA data published in the digest. The groups reported that anaverage of 57% of their revenues came from capitated contracts,which give them strong incentives to control hospital utilization.Groups are rushing to integrate with other providers. Sixty percentof the group practices in the American Group Practice Assn. expectto be in joint ventures with hospitals by sometime in 1996,according to a survey conducted by the American Group PracticeAssn. for the digest. This compared with 27% of AGPA membersin such joint ventures in 1994. AGPA represents 250 mostly largemultispecialty groups representing 25,000 physicians. AGPAmembers reported a median of 20% of total net medical revenuefrom prepaid or capitated managed care contracts, according to thedigest. A survey by the Medical Group Management Assn. showedthat 53% of its more than 6,500 members had some at-risk managedcare revenue and that the groups reported a median of 17.9% ofrevenue from capitated contracts.(Table omitted for online service. See print edition.)Back to Headline List CopyrightHEALTH CARE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJanuary 1996PROVIDER SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BECAPITATED, BACKED BY RICH COMPANIESProvider sponsored organizations and integrated health care systemsseeking Medicare and Medicaid at-risk contracts are likely to have alot of capitated revenue and be well-capitalized.Even in 1994, when Medicare and Medicaid enrollees accounted forrelatively small percentages of their businesses, HMOs capitated76.4% of their primary care physicians, 45.9% of their specialists,34.7% of their ancillary providers and 33.8% of their hospitals,according to the HMO-PPO Digest 1995, which is part of theHoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.-sponsored Managed Care DigestSeries. Data for the digest were collected by SMG MarketingGroup, Chicago, and the digest was written and produced by TheBusiness Word Inc., publishers of Health Care StrategicManagement.PSOs that are backed by integrated health care systems, nationalhospital chains, large health maintenance organization chains andphysician practice management companies appear to be in the bestposition to seek Medicare and Medicaid risk contracts.This is because it will require a lot of capital to get into the Medicareand Medicaid risk contracting business.Currently, Medicare risk contracting is dominated by four large,national health maintenance organization companies that have almost80% of the Medicare at-risk business, according to the Health CareFinancing Administration. They are Kaiser, Humana, FHP andPacifiCare. HMOs enroll 8% to 9% of the 37 million Medicarebeneficiaries, and that could soar to 30% to 50% during the next fiveto 10 years, depending on how Congress changes the Medicareprogram over the years. If medical savings accounts are included inthe Medicare Preservation Act of 1995, which is part of the BudgetReconciliation Act being negotiated by Congress and the president atpress time, HMO growth could be slowed considerably. MSAswould make fee-for-service providers more attractive to Medicareenrollees and would allow fee-based providers to retain a biggershare of those enrollees.The tables on this page show what integrated systems are likely tolook like, if current HMO contracting patterns are a harbinger ofwhat is to come. In 1994, according to the HMO-PPO Digest, theaverage HMO used 28 acute care hospitals, three psychiatrichospitals, 2,142 affiliated physicians, 653 primary care physiciansand 1,489 specialists. Most HMOs operate in large metropolitanstatistical areas. Integrated systems may compete by being moreselective in their use of providers.In 1994, according to the HMO-PPO Digest, hospitals owned equityin 9% of the industry's HMOs, and 16 HMOs (7%) reported thatthey were part of integrated systems. The digest defined integratedsystems as organizations made up of two or more providerorganizations that have formal agreements to integrate or share thedelivery of health-related services. About 32% of the HMOs inintegrated systems were owned by hospitals. Newer and smallerHMOs were most likely to have hospital ownership in 1994.But many hospitals involved in developing integrated systems are inthe process of developing HMO-like products for their localcommercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets.These new integrated systems and small HMOs are challenginglarge, established HMOs and HMO chains. In 1994, according tothe digest, HMOs with 250,000 or more members covered 25.7million members, or 46.7% of all enrollees. Plans with 100,000enrollees or more accounted for just under three-quarters of all HMOenrollees. The nation's 25 largest HMO plans enrolled 33% of allHMO enrollees in 1994.(Table omitted for online service. See print edition.)Back to Headline List
