Industry lawyers were buoyed by the receptiveness of manyof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit judges to itsarguments and by concession of key points by the government. But too manyjudges still appear to be leaning toward the governments camp to predict anindustry win in the battle over whether Uncle Sam owes thriftsboth livingand deadfor supervisory goodwill promises made during the debacle.     Between 40 and 50 supervisory goodwill cases have alreadybeen filed and a victory in this lead case could encourage more to stepforward. The number of cases could rise above 100 and claims could add upto $1 billion.     Its too close to call, said Daniel J. Goldberg, an attorneywith Housley Goldberg & Kantarian in Washington. Goldberg predicted a 6-5or 7-4 decision in a ruling that could take a year.     Edward H. Sisson, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, aWashington firm representing several supervisory goodwill cases, said hewas encouraged by how the court received the arguments, giving a slightedge to thrifts.     Sisson said that government arguments, such as thatsupervisory goodwill agreements were not contracts and the so-calledsovereign acts doctrine, were revealed as red herrings.     Under sovereign acts doctrine, the government can breachcontracts without obligation so long as it acts to benefit the generalwelfare.     Sisson and other observers were surprised that thegovernments attorney, Douglas Letter, conceded under grilling from JudgePauline Newman that the goodwill agreements did constitute contracts.Newman dissented in a pro-government decision by a three-member panel ofthe same court in May 1993.     If we agree with the court of federal claims that these arecontracts, Newman said, then the govern-ments position on sovereign rightsdoesnt apply.     Goldberg said he was also surprised that Letter appeared toconcede the regulatory capital credit issue to thrifts. This could besignificant, Goldberg said, since the counsel for Glendale, Jerry Stouck ofSpriggs & Hollingsworth, and for Statesman, Charles J. Cooper of Shaw,Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, pursued somewhat different strategies.     Statesmans claim is widely seen to be stronger thanGlendales and Goldberg said it was possible, though less likely, thatStatesman would prevail but not Glendale. But both have valid contracts, hehastened to add.     The oral arguments were punctuated by interruptions fromargumentative judges, who asked for clarifications or interjected sarcasticbarbs. Several judges seemed intolerant of the governments attempt to walkaway from a contract and from responsibility for any attendant damages.     Letter repeatedly invoked an interpretation of the SupremeCourt ruling in Powen vs. Public Agencies Opposed to Social SecurityEntrapment, 477 U.S. 441, a 1986 case suggesting that the government has aright to break a contract.     At one point Judge S. Jay Plager cut in, telling him, Iwant you to remember something from first year [law school] contractsclass.     I had a terrible first year contracts professor, Lettersaid. I learned almost nothing.     Plager instructed Letter that nobody disputes that thegovernment can break a contract. But when a contract is broken damages mustbe paid. Plager then said that thrifts never would have taken on millionsof dollars in liability by taking over insolvent institutions withoutgoodwill accounting promises from the government. Nor would regulators havetried to resolve one failing thrift by dragging down another, said Plager,referring to the knock-out impact of broken goodwill promises.     I have arguments for all of that, Letter said.     Obviously something you learned in contracts, Plager said.     Or in my opinions, joked Chief Judge Helen Nies, who wrotethe majority opinion in the earlier pro-government decision.     Minutes later, Letter tried to flatter Plager by saying, Iwish I had had you as my first year contracts professor.     Me too, we wouldnt be here, the judge retorted.     In the course of his argument, Nies pressed Stouck to showher where in Glendales agreement did the government specifically agree to a40-year goodwill amortization period and promise that there would be nochange in policy, the so-called double promise.     Stouck said these details were spelled out in a letter tothe Federal Home Loan Bank Board by Glendales accountant in a letter hesaid was integrated into the contract.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994INTERSTATE BRANCHING BILL: IT HAS LEGSWith interstate branching legislation appearing to have itsbest shot in almost a decade in passing Congress this year, industrylawyers and lobbyists are scrambling to reshape a measure cynics had givenlittle chance of winning congressional approval this yearif ever.     It has legs, one legislative lobbyist for a bank tradegroup in Washington said. I never thought I would ever see it passed in mylifetime, nevertheless my career, he said with  little sarcasm.     The linchpin of the political viability of the legislationis language that bars branching across state lines without acquisitiona bigcarrot to community banks  because it offers  a potential windfall if theywant to sell out.     An amendment to the legislation offering incentives toinstitutions seeking to branch interstate to do so by acquiring troubled ormarginally capitalized institutions is among options being proposed by somemembers of Congress, industry officials and regulators. No such requirementis contained in the initial legislation that passed the financialinstitutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee Feb. 3 by a 29-0vote. Ironically, the bill was passed before it was officially introduced.But markup by the full banking committee could come before the end ofFebruary.     Another potential change would be to allow states to optout of Douglas amendment repeal, an amendment that will be sought by theIndependent Bankers Association of America. That group believes that thelegislation passed Feb. 3 gives the back of its hand to 14 states that havenot chosen to allow holding companies outside regional compacts to acquirebanks in their state.     The bill passed by the House panel permits full nationwideinterstate bank holding company acquisitions one year after enactment andnational bank interstate branching by acquisition three years afterenactment. The bill allows states to opt out entirely from interstatebranching within three years after enactment of branching legislation. Thebill also allows bank holding companies operating in more than one state toconsolidate those subsidiaries into one bank 18 months after enactment.     But  securities analysts and industry lobbyists believethat the IBAAs concerns about allowing states to opt out of repeal of theDouglas amendment is a mere face-saving move aimed at disguising the factthe IBAA was caught off guard by Sen. Christopher J. Dodds, D-Conn.,announcement and the new-found momentum behind the bill that Dodds decisioncreated.     These officials also said that the only bank of note tobenefit from a state opting out of repeal of the Douglas amendment would beBarnett Bank of Jacksonville,  a $38 billion-asset institution thatdominates the Florida market but is weak outside the state. One analyst inNew York speculated that two potential acquirers Barnett would like to holdoff are BankAmerica in California and Chemical Bank of New York.     Steve Verdier, senior legislative counsel for the IBAA,confirmed that the IBAA was surprised at Dodds announcement and the new-found potential for the bill to pass. I think you could write that aboutanyone in Washington connected with banking legislation, he said. No oneoutside of Mark Leggett, the Washington lobbyist for NationsBank, gaveinterstate branching more than an outside chance of passage this year.     No small part of its new-found momentum is the statementFeb. 3 by  Dodd announcing that he would not seek to bog the legislationdown by adding an amendment that hamstrings the ability of banks of allsizes to grow their insurance sales business.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994INTERSTATE BILL AT A GLANCEThese are the main provisions of the Interstate BankingEfficiency Act of 1994, as introduced in the House Feb. 10:     Interstate banking      By acquisitionOne year after enactment, permits fullnationwide interstate bank holding company acquisitions.

Muldoon, Murphy & Faucette of Washington did the legalbilling on 15 mutual to stock flips in 1993 worth a total of $1.03 billion.     While Silver, Freedman & Taff handled six more flip dealsthan Muldoon, its rival handled bigger flips that issued far more stock.Offerings associated with Muldoon averaged $68.5 million per flip. Silverflips averaged $42.2 million.     We came out on top because we have a lot of veryexperienced people who work in securities and almost everybody hasgovernment experience, said Joseph A. Muldoon Jr. He said the firm thrivesbecause it takes good care of its clients.     The top underwriting, legal and appraisal firms dominatedthe biggest of the 109 thrifts that converted from mutual to stock formlast year, raising $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, according to the data ofSNL Securities.     The king of the conversion hill is Adams Cohen Securities,the underwriting firm on Long Island. It had a piece of flip deals worth$1.1 billion, or more than half of the total 1993 gross. The dozen flipdeals associated with Adams Cohen  averaged $94.4 million in grossproceeds.     Kaplan Associates of Washington led the appraiser group;deals associated with this firm came to $1.05 billion, almost twice as muchas its next closest competitor, RP Financial Inc. Kaplan flips also had thebiggest gross per appraiser, averaging $75.3 million.     The lead firms in these groups handled the doozy deals of1993. When the Coral Gables Federal Savings & Loan Association flippedearly last year, it was the largest  since a few big flips in the mid-1980s, according to Robert Adams, managing director of Adams Cohen. TheCoral Gables deal was eclipsed at the end of the year by Astoria FederalSavings Bank in Lake Success, N.Y., only to be eclipsed earlier this yearby the mother of all flips, Green Point Savings Bank with about $6 billionin assets.     Muldoon and Adams did both the Astoria and Green Pointdeals. Appraising for Astoria was done by Kaplan; RP Financial ofArlington, Va., the second largest flip appraiser, handled Green Point.     Close scrutiny of mutual to stock flips by regulators andmembers of Congress concerned about excessive insider benefits has thesefirms uncertain about what 1994 will hold.     As to 1994, I would say were very cautious, Adams said. Wedont know where the congressional hearings and legislation [on mutualflips] will go. He said the firm is keeping an eye to the windward anddiversifying. Were substantially expanding our sales trading activity andother research work, he said.     Muldoon predicted a clampdown on merger-conversions, but hewas cautiously optimistic that conversions will continue.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994CREDIT UNIONS ARE HEDGING THEIR BETSThe National Credit Union Administration has the authorityto allow AT&T Family Credit Union in North Carolina to serve additionalemployee groups, the credit union and Credit Union National Associationclaim in a motion made in federal district court in Washington. However,given the possibility that banks could win the case, the two defendantsalso say that even if the banks win, relief should only be prospective.     AT&T Family and CUNAs brief, filed as a motion for summaryjudgment in First National Bank and Trust Co., et al vs. NCUA, No. 90-2948,is a crucial component of a lawsuit that could have broad legal, politicaland competitive implications for both the credit union and bankingindustries.     The American Bankers Association filed the suit on behalfof First National Bank and Trust, arguing that the Federal Credit Union Actcommon bond criteria bars credit unions from expanding their field ofmembership beyond their primary service group, that is employees of AT&T inNorth Carolina.     In summing up the banking industrys case, AT&T FamilyCredit Union and CUNA put it best:     The relief sought in plaintiffs complaint includes adeclaration that all amendments to Family Federals charter that wererequested after Nov. 14, 1989 are null and void. Such a declaration woulddivest Family Federal of approximately 95 employee groups. These groupshave 34,000 members30.3% of the total membership of the credit union. Thiswould have a catastrophic effect on Family Federal and its members.     Besides its argument that NCUAs action was proper andFamily Federals charter is lawful and valid, the Family Federal-CUNA briefhedges its bets by saying that even if the banks are right, giving bankswhat they want would impose harm on the credit union of great magnitude,while the competitive harm to the plaintiffs that would result fromprospective relief only is negligible.     The brief added, This requires the court either to rulethat the banks are not entitled to retroactive relief or, at the veryleast, to hold an evidentiary hearing to evaluate the relative harms andother equitable factors such as waiver and estoppel.     Banks are seeking divestiture because they believe thatcredit unions have become unfair competitors because they are not taxed andyet can offer the same services.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994D&OS FACE EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSGiving another kick to one of its favorite politicalfootballs, Congress has moved to extend the statute of limitations forcivil actions against insiders at failed thrifts.     Sen. Alfonse M. DAmato, R-N.Y., pushed for the extension aspart of his efforts to keep pressure on the Clinton administration inregard to White-watergate, the controversy surrounding the role of thepresident and his wife in an Arkansas real estate project that was fundedby a savings and loan that later collapsed.     DAmato offered an amendment Feb. 9 to a supplementalappropriations bill that allows the Resolution Trust Corp. to bring civilsuits for fraud and gross negligence until Dec. 31, 1995. The Senateapproved the amendment the same day by a vote of 95-0, and on Feb. 11 theHouse of Representatives voted 390-1 to instruct their conferees to retainthe amendment.     This means that those who are potentially liable to thetaxpayers cant hide behind the calendar or a legal technicality, theranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said. Congress will nottolerate gross fraud or negligence at the taxpayers expenseno matter whothe culprits are.     DAmato was joined in offering the amendment by Sens. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.     DAmato said he pushed for the extension for fear that thestatute of limitations would run out by the end of February for casesinvolving the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the institution connectedto the Whitewater resort development in Arkansas.     He cited the administrations repeated failure to provideany specific information regarding the expiration of the civil statute oflimitations in the Madison/Whitewater controversy.     Under current law, the statue of limitations for fraud andgross negligence is five years. DAmatos amendment, certain to pass becauseit was attached to a supplemental appropriations bill, extends the statuteof limitations in cases involving failed S&Ls to the same date that the RTCgoes out of business.     Now that the RTC will have additional time, we must beconcerned that it will use it to conduct a thorough investigation and thenrecover some of the billions of dollars taxpayers have poured into thesavings and loan bailout.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994DAVID PAUL GUILTY ON SECURITIES CHARGESAndrew WheatIn a surprise move David L. Paulwho became a symbol of theS&L era as the defunct head of the former CenTrust Bankpleaded guilty Feb.10 to remaining charges in a 100-count indictment.     Miami-based CenTrust failed in early 1990 at an estimatedtaxpayer cost of $1.5 billion. The indictment came two years later and ajury was selected last October for the first batch of counts that chargedthat Paul had diverted bank funds to pay for the work on his mansion andhad obstructed justice. The jury found Paul guilty of many of thosecharges.     The second batch of charges to which Paul just plead guiltycover racketeering allegations that Paul and his associates misledregulators and purchasers of CenTrust subordinated debentures about theunderwriting of CenTrust junk bond investments.     A 1991 FDIC suit against junk bond king Michael Milkenargued that directors of several thrifts, such as Paul, Charles Keating andThomas Spiegel, allowed Milken to draw on their funds to support prices andprevent defaults in his multibillion house of cards. Each of these personsintended to share in the plunder of their respective institutions and toobtain other benefits the Milken Group provided to those who purchasedlarge quantities of Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, the suit said.     An additional charge in the second batch of Paul chargeswas that CenTrust parked a piece of the offering with Bank of Credit andCommerce International parties to make it appear that it was more heavilysubscribed than it was. Further charges allege that CenTrust transactionswith Charles Keatings Lincoln Savings and Loan contained materialinformation that was not disclosed to auditors.     Sentencing is scheduled for April 1, April Fools Day.There will also be Rico forfeiture proceeding March 21.     I have a hard timeeven for internal purposesestimating whatkind of sentence he might be faced with, said Allan Sullivan, the assistantU.S. attorney handling the case. It all is governed by sentencingguidelines. Its all calculated based on fraud losses, and aggravating ormitigating factors.     This marks the conclusion of a successful prosecutionagainst Paul resulting in his prosecution on Rico charges, Sullivan said.     In an interview with The Thrift Regulator in October (Oct.4, page 3) Pauls attorney, Stephen Neal of the Chicago office of Kirkland &Ellis, said there was no question the bank had paid for work on Paulshouse. But he dismissed the second set of chargesto which his client hasnow pleaded guiltyas nonsense put into the indictment solely to soil Paulsname through guilt by association with Keating and BCCI.     Neal could not be reached for an updated comment.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE BANKING ATTORNEY via NewsNetFebruary 21, 1994PROMPT ACTION ON SUPERFUND LAW SOUGHTIt is doubtful that the banking industry will be successfulin trying to use a negative court decision on the ability of a governmentagency to exempt lenders from hazardous waste cleanup suits brought byprivate parties as a lever to force Congress to act quickly on a law whichprovides that protection. That will mean that for the time being,persuading judges to read the lender liability exemption in the currentSuperfund law broadly is the best way for lenders to reduce their potentialliability for cleanup of hazardous waste.     One of the reasons prompt action on the legislation, theSuperfund Reau-thorization Law, H.R. 3800 and S. 1834, is unlikely is thatCongress, even under the most optimistic of scenarios, will have littletime to deal with it this year. Second, the misery-loves-company groupsthat brought the court suit against the Environmental Protection Agencys1992 regulation are unlikely to cave in quickly to pressure from theadministration and members of Congress, even though these groups areacutely aware of the potential economic impact of leaving lenders out todry for the damage caused by borrowers to the environment.     The two groups are state and local governments and thechemical industry, both with a big stake in having someone with deeppockets share the blame for cleanup of hazardous waste. The suit is Kelleyvs. EPA. Frank J. Kelley is the attorney general of Michigan. The ChemicalManufacturers Association was the co-plaintiff in the case.     The bill does what a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe D.C. Circuit says the EPA doesnt have the authority to do unilaterally,establish strict limits on when lenders are liable for hazardous wastecleanup. But in its Feb. 4 decision, the court held that Congress mustgrant EPA the authority to limit lender liability. Otherwise, courts willdetermine the extent of lender liability based on the current Superfundlaw, the court said. The EPA promulgated the rule in response to the FleetFactors decision in the 11th U.S. Circuit in 1990, which imposed liabilityon lenders based on the theory that the mere capacity to influence aborrowers decisionmaking was sufficient to make the lender potentiallyliable. It in effect called into question the secured lender exemption inthe original Superfund statute.     Elliott P. Laws, assistant administrator for the Office ofSolid Waste and Emergency Response at the EPA, testified before a Housepanel Feb. 10 that the provisions in the reauthori-zation law regardinglenders and trustees has assumed a greater level of importance.     Although the government has not yet determined whether toseek a rehearing by the full court in the case, the administrationsproposal would confirm EPAs authority to administer the statute in a fairand effective manner, Laws said. An unnecessary imposition of liability onlenders and trustees ... would have a chilling effect on the provision ofworking capital to otherwise credit-worthy borrowers, or to provide fundsfor the purchase of environmentally distressed property. Clear liabilitystandards for lenders and trustees are necessary elements of theadministrations plan to rehabilitate urban brownfields and to bringdistressed property back into the stream of commerce.     Besides strictly limiting lender liability, the proposedlegislation would overhaul the manner in which shares of responsibility forcleanup of hazardous waste would be allocated and provide for expeditedsettlements. Laws summed it up this way: The administration intends toincrease fairness and reduce transaction costswith the expectation thatmost parties will settle their liability to the U.S. and that more moneywill be spent on cleanups, rather than lawyers.     Under the proposed law an early, expeditious and obligatoryallocation process would be created. Each liable partys share of responsecosts would be allocated by a neutral, third-party allocator. The proposedprocess is intended to reduce, if not virtually eliminate, the expensiveand time-consuming process of litigating these issues in federal districtcourt, Laws said. The plan offers substantial incentives to parties whochoose to settle their liability, and disincentives to parties who chooseto litigate following the allocation.     The American Bankers Association acted strongly against thecourt decision and called for prompt action on the legislation. The ABAsaid it would seek a rehearing before the full court on the rulingit hasbeen certified as an intervenorbut industry lawyers believe that is aholding action aimed at persuading Congress to move quickly on the bill.The only thing that could yield a rehearing is the still-to-be publisheddissent of Chief Judge Abner Mikva to the courts ruling.  ABA and thegovernment could  seek review from the full court if Mikvas dissent isstrong enough, in the eyes of  ABA and the government, to put enough doubtin the minds of other members as to warrant rehearing.Back to Headline List WT03-B38-2IA059-000325-B022-283http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi08.html 205.156.212.5 19970115004509 text/html 253002HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 00:41:43 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:48:46 GMTContent-length: 252812Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi08.html Sample Issue Copyright BOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNet January 02, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEGOTIATED BOND SALES (1819 words) COMPETITIVE BOND SALES (1193 words) NEGOTIATED OFFERINGS (482 words) SEALED BIDS INVITED (3774 words) BOND RATINGS (759 words) NEW ON CALENDAR (512 words) SEALED BIDS (1630 words) SHORT-TERM FINANCING (258 words) THE BOND BUYER'S WORKSHEETS (305 words) BOND CALLS AND REDEMPTIONS (305 words) PROPOSED BOND ISSUES (451 words) PLACEMENT RATIO (271 words) VISIBLE SUPPLY (266 words) ILLINOIS GOVERNOR MAY REVIVE PROPOSAL FOR CHICAGO BEARS' INDOOR STADIUM (405 words) THE BULLHORN (263 words) BOND VOLUME CAP, IN TROUBLE AGAIN, NEEDS REPAIR (738 words) TRENDS IN THE REGION: LEASE REVENUES BUOY SACRAMENTO'S SKYLINE (628 words) MONEY MARKET FUNDS: YEAR-END UPSURGE IN TAX-FREE FUND YIELDS IS TYPICAL, PLAYERS SAY (676 words) BROKER PROFILE: MUNI INVESTORS SHOULD AVOID FUNDS, BROKER SAYS (1056 words) PORTFOLIO MANAGER PROFILE: CONSERVATIVE MANAGING CAN REAP REWARDS (1377 words) SOUTHWEST BOND-WATCH (475 words) A CORRECTION (21 words) NEW TREASURERS: KENTUCKY'S JOHN HAMILTON STRESSES A HANDS-ON STYLE (513 words) NONPROFIT IOWA HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGE (292 words) SCHOOLS' NEEDS ARE FERTILE GROUND (620 words) NRMSIR (179 words) NEWS AND TRENDS: SOUTH CAROLINA TREASURY VOLUNTEERS EARN HAPPY RETURNS OVER HOLIDAYS (440 words) WHAT'S SELLING: COLORADO PAPER RATES COMING BACK TO EARTH AFTER BUSY DECEMBERBY SARAH STIRLAND (303 words) CALIFORNIA QUAKE AUTHORITY SLATES BOND SALE (231 words) THE DIGEST (371 words) PROBE OF EL PASO COUNTY, COLO., FUND BROADENS TO EXAMINE TREASURER (371 words) WHAT TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA BUDGET SURPLUS (235 words) MOODY'S SEES NEXT HUD BILL HAVING 'FAR-REACHING' IMPACT ON BONDS (636 words) CHANCES DWINDLE FOR REFORM OF THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACT (1638 words) LOUISIANA GOVERNOR-ELECT: VOTERS NEED A VOICE ON GAMING (683 words) ENDING WITH A BANG, 1995 VOLUME SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS (698 words) CASH FLOWS BACK INTO MUTUAL FUNDS, BUT NOT EVERYONE GETS A SHARE (538 words) CALIFORNIA DEBATES WHETHER TO LINK SCHOOL FUNDING TO BUILDING PRISONS (600 words) N.Y.C.

Jim Edgar may resurrect a plan to build anindoor stadium for the Chicago Bears professional football team if aproposal to renovate the team's current home, Soldier Field, is indeeddead.    "We plan to touch base with both the Bears and city hall to determinethe status of the renovation proposal," said Edgar spokesman Eric Robinson."If the governor is convinced the proposal is dead, he's prepared toexplore other avenues to keep the Bears in Chicago."    One avenue favored by the governor is the possibility of building anindoor, multi-use facility in the Chicago area that has become known as"McDome," Robinson said.    In the summer of 1995, state officials hinted that a domed stadiumcould be built with bonds issued by the Metropolitan Pier and ExpositionAuthority. Although the authority has used most of its $937 million of bondauthorization, state officials had said it might be possible to issuestadium bonds by refinancing existing debt, a plan that still may befavored by Edgar.    "The governor believes that a multipurpose facility could be builtwithout raising taxes," he said. Robinson would not give details about howthat might be done.    In October, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled a $156 million planto renovate Soldier Field, the Bears' current home. The proposal calls forthe Chicago Park District to issue $100 million of taxable revenue bonds,backed by annual club seat fees, revenues from permanent seat licenses,concession fees, and a contribution from the team. The park district wouldalso issue the remaining $56 million of bonds payable with property tax orother district revenues.    Team officials have deemed the Soldier Field proposal unacceptable andhave reportedly declared negotiations with the city dead. However, Edgarwanted to be assured of that demise before reviving the McDome possibility,Robinson said.    "In the environment we work in, things are never dead until they'redead," he said. "We want to verify that from both sides (before movingforward)."    Meanwhile, a group of Indiana business leaders are continuing theirpush to build a new, $312 million stadium for the Bears in Gary, Ind., tobe financed with taxable bonds issued by the group. About 60% of the bondswould be repaid with various stadium-related private sources. The remaining40% would be repaid from revenues from a proposed 0.5% economic developmentincome tax to be levied in the county.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996THE BULLHORN    "Nothing that was written in their response successfully gets aroundthe fact that Merrill Lynch guided this county into bankruptcy."    - J.

The current problem stems from the federal government's partialshutdown, which includes the Census Bureau, the agency responsible forpublishing the figures states use each year to compute the amounts they areallowed to allocate to bond issuers.    Under normal circumstances, Census would have released that report lastweek, so that officials could begin this year knowing exactly how much theyhave to work with. But because Census workers are on furlough, states willhave to wait awhile before they know what their 1996 cap amounts are goingto be.    But the problem is even worse than that: If past experience is a guide,states may not be able to use those population numbers when they eventuallycome out.    Back in 1990 Census issued the wrong figures during the last week ofDecember, and corrected itself with a new report in January. The TreasuryDepartment ruled that neither report conformed to the letter of the law,and told states they had to go back and use their 1990 volume cap amountsfor 1991.    If history repeats itself, states in 1996 will be stuck with year-oldvolume caps again, and the largest states, which have growing populationsand huge demand for private-activity bond authority, will be hurt the most.    One improvement over last time is that issuers probably will not haveto wait six months before the issue is resolved. When the 1991 snafuoccurred, the Treasury did not issue a ruling until July, leaving states inthe dark for the first half of the year - the period in which theytypically allocate most of their volume cap authority.    The Treasury apparently learned its lesson from that debacle and hasbeen routinely issuing a revenue procedure a few weeks after the beginningof each year, confirming that the numbers in the previous December's Censusreport are the correct ones to use. Last week Treasury officials declinedcomment on this latest mess, and it will be interesting to see how theyresolve the problem and whether they do so quickly.    But the difficulties caused by the delayed Census report illustrate aneven deeper problem facing those who must live under the confines of thecap: its inequity.    Under the volume cap law, states are permitted each year to allocatethe greater of $50 per capita or $150 million in private-activity bondauthority. In 1995 that left 21 states at the $150 million level, and manyof those with more bond authority than they knew what to do with.    But most of the larger states, which are stuck with $50 per capita, arechafing under the cap's restrictions. They, of course, are the ones whostand to be hurt if states are forced to revert to their 1995 allotments -thus, not accounting for any growth in population - in 1996.    There are other problems with the volume cap that affect all states.Chief among them is the fact that the cap is not indexed for inflation, sowhile in dollar terms the cap has remained constant, in reality it hasdropped over the last several years.    In 1993 the Public Securities Association reported that inflation haderoded the cap to the point where it was really $41.25 per capita, not $50,and $120.8 million, not $150 million.    Despite the problems that persist, legislation to ease the volume caphas never caught fire in Congress. Rep. Bill Coyne, D-Pa., in 1993introduced a broad bill to ease bond curbs, which included a provision thatwould have indexed the cap for inflation. But Congress never acted on thatbill.    Former Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, offered a proposal in 1993 designed tohelp alleviate the cap's inequities. Grandy's proposal would have allowedstates with an overabundance of cap authority to shift the authority tostates that had used up their cap in a given year. But Congress took noaction on his measure, either.    And so problems with the volume cap continue. If the population-reportmess creates enough difficulties for the states, 1996 may finally be theyear that Congress is forced to take a hard look at the volume cap law andwhat can be done to improve it.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996TRENDS IN THE REGION: LEASE REVENUES BUOY SACRAMENTO'S SKYLINEBy Joe Bel Bruno    In sharp contrast to California's stagnant construction industry,building projects rising in Sacramento have created a mini-boom in thecapital city.    The skyline in downtown Sacramento has been reshaped to include morehigh-rise buildings, many of them used by federal, local, and stategovernment. Money used to reinvent the city's downtown isn't coming fromprivate dollars, but instead from lease revenue bonds and other forms ofpublic finance.    There are currently two large buildings being constructed and financedthrough lease revenue bonds: the massive new federal office and courtbuilding, and a new addition to the Sacramento Convention Center complex,operated by the city. And what will be Sacramento's sixth major state-ownedbuilding to go up in less than three years - an 850,000-square-foot officebuilding that will house the California Environmental Protection Agency -is already in the planning stages.    Critics complain that the state relies too heavily on expensivefinancing in order to avoid getting voter approval for general obligationbonds, which can be sold at a lower interest rate. Financing constructionprojects with lease revenue bonds can cost the issuer up to twice as muchin interest as other forms of financing.    "Using lease revenue bonds for construction is a fairly standardpractice," said Jerry Beavers of the California Legislative AnalystsOffice. "We're putting out so much in interest that in the end, after thebonds have been paid off, it costs almost double what it actually cost toput up the building."    Lease revenue bonds are paid off - typically over 20 years - from fundsformerly used to pay for leased buildings. Supporting the use of leaserevenue bonds is Gov. Pete Wilson, who contends that they are a good use oftaxpayers' money.    However, some officials note that as the current upswing inconstruction shows, the state is nibbling away at escaping its leaseobligations. Currently the state leases 7.2 million square feet of officespace around Sacramento, while it owns 5.1 million.    "We've used lease revenue bonds for a long time to help financeconstruction costs both (in Sacramento) and elsewhere," said CraigReynolds, chief of staff for state Sen. Lucy Killea, I-San Diego. "However,there has been some talk in committee with the proposal of new constructionprojects to take a closer look at the financing. This will likely happen."    In general, state government is a major employer in Sacramento, hiring62,600 at the seasonal peak, excluding college and university employees.California employs 195,700 people statewide.    Construction projects awaiting legislative approval include two massivelow-rise buildings in the city's suburbs and a cluster of new high-risebuildings on state-owned property south and east of the capitol.    One of the state buildings considered to be among the most extravagantis owned by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. It isdesigned with six terraced levels that are enclosed by outside walls andconcealed behind jasmine shrubbery that extends around the building for twoblocks. Offices open out to the man-made garden setting.    However, because of its private funding, the building has receivedlittle criticism. The $78 million cost was paid by using seven days' worthof the investment returns on the organization's $94 billion portfolio.Unlike other state agencies, CalPERS receives no tax-generated money.    "I think the public would rather have the state build some of thesebuildings using other, more cheaper ways ... or no public money at all,"Beavers said. "There has been so much growth in the past few years, thatnow we are realizing it is time to put a plan together that will manage itbetter."    Legislators are expected to soon devise a plan to organize and managethe buildings, as well as develop a plan to regulate growth aroundSacramento.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996MONEY MARKET FUNDS: YEAR-END UPSURGE IN TAX-FREE FUND YIELDS ISTYPICAL, PLAYERS SAYBy Elizabeth Roy    Tax-free money market fund yields shot up last week - but marketparticipants said the surge was typical year-end behavior.    Meanwhile, the Dec. 22 downgrades by Standard & Poor's Corp. of fourJapanese banks that provide letters of credit for money market fundsecurities has not affected trading, the participants said.    They said the market had already priced in the downgrades.    Standard & Poor's downgraded Mitsubishi Bank to A-plus from AA-minus,Sanwa Bank to A from AA-minus, and the Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi KangyoBank to A from A-plus.    On Thursday the rating agency also downgraded Fuji Bank, to A-minusfrom A-plus. All five banks were placed on CreditWatch in August.    Money market yields rise at year-end for two main reasons.    First, demand wanes as retail investors withdraw funds either to coverholiday or other expenses, or to avoid paying intangibles taxes in statessuch as Florida and North Carolina. Those states tax investors based ontheir holdings on the last day of the year.    Institutional investors also retreat from money market funds in thefinal weeks of the year, players said, either to make tax payments on Dec.15, or to trim the number of investments they have to print on their year-end balance sheets.    At the same time, remarketing agents also want to enter the new yearwith clean balance sheets. As a result, they offer money market funds highyields on daily and weekly floaters in an effort to clear them from theirbooks.    "We're obviously seeing a year-end spike, due to a lot of money that'sbeen leaving the arena," said Bradford Owensby, municipal securitiesanalyst for the $1.3 billion Nations Tax-Exempt Fund and the $110 millionNations Municipal Reserve Fund.    The investment adviser for the funds, a wholly owned subsidiary ofNationsBank of North Carolina, as of yesterday became known as TradeStreetInvestment Associates Inc.    Referring to the high yields being offered on money market instruments,Owensby said: "Dealers don't want inventory, so they've been jacking uptheir rates."    The high yields are aimed at corporate "crossover" buyers in particular- those that can invest in either taxable or tax-free products, he added.    Andrea White, assistant vice president in municipal trading at HarrisTrust and Savings Bank, agreed.    "Yields have been going up fairly substantially," said White, whosefirm runs a $400 million tax-free money market fund and a $250 millioncommon trust fund.    In the week leading up to last Wednesday, yields on weekly floatersrose 45 basis points, and those on daily floaters were up 100 basis points,she said.    Also on Wednesday, White said, weekly floaters were yielding in the4.95% to 5.10% range, compared to returns of 3.70% on tax-free commercialpaper maturing in February.    After Jan. 1, however, short-term yields should drop down to about 2%and stay there for at least a couple of weeks as cash flows back into moneymarket funds, she added.    Only on July 1 do investors receive as much money in the form of couponpayments and bonds maturing as they do on Jan. 1, White noted.    The Harris money market funds have lost $15 million to $20 million inrecent weeks, but the managers expect to have to cope with $50 million ofinflows starting today, White said.    Jim Hannan, vice president at First National Bank of Maryland andmanager of the $88 million ARK Funds Tax-Free Money Market Portfolio, saidsome weekly floaters have been resetting at yields as high as 5.25% - ataxable-equivalent yield of 8%.    "The first week in January, that'll come down to 3.5%," he said.    In the meantime, Hannan said, a money market fund yielding 4.25%, ashis was on Wednesday, offers a taxable-equivalent yield of 6.55% - 95 basispoints over the 5.60% that the typical taxable fund is offering crossoverbuyers.    Even so, Hannan's fund saw the assets of its institutional class dropto $71 million from $80 million at the beginning of December, he said,adding that he expects the money to return this month.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996BROKER PROFILE: MUNI INVESTORS SHOULD AVOID FUNDS, BROKER SAYSBy Jon Birger    Mutual funds offer far more advantages for equity investors than formunicipal bond investors, according to Bill Glassner, an independent brokerin Cedar Knolls, N.J., affiliated with Royal Alliance Associates Inc.    With an equity fund, "a manager really adds value" compared to what abroker can do, said Glassner, who has about 400 clients with accountstotaling $150 million. "I don't have the time to research individualcompanies on my own and give them the diversification they need."    Municipal bond funds also offer diversification and expert research.However, in Glassner's opinion, municipal funds' inherent interest raterisk outweighs their advantages.    For fixed-income investors, Glassner recommends only products with "afinite life," principally bonds but also unit investment trusts, he said.    When Glassner has clients who come to him with existing holdings inbond funds, "I tell them, 'If you didn't like the fluctuations of 1994 -not knowing where you stood with a fund - here's another approach: you canbuy the individual bond and no matter what happens with the ups and downsof the market, you're going to get your money back.'    "The individual client understands that even if everything goes wronglike it did in 1994, they have a guaranteed value on a certain date," hesaid. With a fund, there is no specific date when investors are guaranteedfull return of principal.    While a patient fund investor should eventually recoup his fullinvestment - either through higher yields or appreciating shares -  "it'sharder for the unsophisticated client to visualize that," Glassner said.    One of the few scenarios in which Glassner does recommend bond funds isfor investors interested in the high-yield sector of the municipal market.    "I only use funds for things that I can't efficiently buy on my own,"he said. "On the (high-yield) muni side, I use a fund that has theresources and the people to research the small deals - the unrated deals -and to diversify in a portfolio in order to make it safer."    Glassner's favorite high-yield fund is the Van Kampen Merritt Tax FreeHigh Income Fund.    About 40% of Glassner's accounts is invested in municipals - theremainder divided about equally between equities and taxable mortgage-backed securities.    A self-described bargain hunter in the equity market, Glassner takesfew such risks when buying individual municipal bonds.    Municipal bond investors "are basically looking for safety," he said."I go out of my way to be real safe."    While Glassner said he understands why many yield-hungry institutionalportfolio managers prefer A or triple-B rated bonds, he does not recommendthis strategy for retail buyers.    Individual investors who buy municipals want peace of mind, he said.    "And especially with these low yields (and narrow credit qualityspreads), you're picking up so little extra by taking the uninsured bond,"he said.    About 70% of Glassner's clients are New Jersey residents. He generallyadvises these investors to buy Garden State bonds in order to takeadvantage of the in-state tax advantage.    Interest earned on New Jersey bonds is exempt from the state incometax, which is 6.58% for individuals in the top tax bracket.    "I'm not too concerned about the New Jersey economy," Glassner said ofhis clients' high exposure in the state. "But I will buy a state like Texasif I see enough yield to cover the New Jersey tax."    Some of Glassner's best-selling New Jersey issuers include the state ofNew Jersey itself, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the PortAuthority of New York and New Jersey.    He and his clients also like northern New Jersey municipalities such asEssex County, Parsippany, and West Orange Township Board of Education.    "Investors are generally a little more comfortable if they know thetown," he said.    Glassner is a big fan of zero-coupon bonds, particularly for investorswith a specific time horizon.    "I use the zeros a lot," he said. "I have a lot of people who justdon't care about the income and they love buying a bond at 25 cents on thedollar or 50 cents if it's shorter.    "And I also find higher yields there because the marketplace doesn'treally like (zero-coupon bonds). In general they want the bonds with thecash flow."    Zero-coupon bonds issued by Camden County Municipal Utility Districthave been among his top sellers, according to Glassner.    Because Camden is one of New Jersey's most economically depressedareas, these bonds "don't trade real well, so we end up with a good yield,"he said. "They're insured, and we're going to hold them" to maturity.    For sophisticated investors willing to take on a little risk, Glassnerrecommends housing bonds.    "Some people view the fact that there can be an unpredictable,extraordinary redemption as a negative," he said. "I view that as apositive."    Investors are compensated for the call risk with above-market yields,he explained.    "You can sometimes get a real high coupon at a very small premium witha housing bond," Glassner said. "I usually view a three- or six-monthbreak-even period as fair, but I've got to find a client who knows there'sa little risk of losing the premium a day after he buys it."    Glassner's clients generally buy bonds in the four- to 12-year maturityrange - "though I do have some clients who will go out 30 years as part ofa laddered portfolio.    "In general, people are looking for 5%" yield, he continued. "Fivepercent seems to be the psychological barrier right now."    Investors seem to have adjusted to long-term yields in the 5% to 5.5%range, according to Glassner.    "The area where I get the most resistance is in the shorter end, wherethey're taking 4% or 4.25% for a maturity that they don't think is thatshort - four to eight years," he said. "A lot of clients would rather leavethe money in cash."    As for the flat tax, Glassner said neither he nor his clients areparticularly concerned.    "Nobody's really talking about it - it hasn't come up at all (inconversations with clients) during the second half of the year," he said.    Glassner does not believe a flat tax will pass. And even if it did -thereby reducing municipals' resale value - investors who hold their bondsto maturity would not be affected, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996PORTFOLIO MANAGER PROFILE: CONSERVATIVE MANAGING CAN REAP REWARDSBy Sarah Stirland     A top performance can be achieved even with a conservative strategy,according to Ronald H. Schwartz, portfolio manager of STI CapitalManagement's $150 million STI Classic Investment Grade Tax-Exempt BondFund.    Schwartz's portfolio has consistently landed among the top fiveperforming intermediate funds over last three years.    But he said he achieves his results incrementally. "Our philosophy isthat we don't try to hit a home run," he said.    "We don't feel like we can forecast interest rates far out into thefuture accurately for a long time period, so we will have our short-termbias based on our fundamental and technical analysis - we're not going tomake major bets by any means," he said.    In addition to managing the intermediate bond fund, Schwartz oversees atotal of $1.4 billion in municipals in a Florida fund and two common trustfunds.    But it is the intermediate bond fund that has regularly appeared in theLipper Analytical Services Inc. top-five performer rankings this year.    Schwartz's fund recorded a one-year total return to the end of thethird quarter of 11.31%, ranking first out of 111 intermediate funds.    In 1994, Lipper named the portfolio top performer in its class.    Nothing Out of the Ordinary    Despite this achievement, Schwartz describes his investment strategy asdoing nothing particularly out of the ordinary.    Schwartz has kept the average maturity of the fund relatively short,currently at seven and a half years, with an average duration of fiveyears.    That positioning is in keeping with his philosophy of not making biginterest rate bets, he said.    "If we're bullish on the market we'll extend the average maturity toeight years, but we're not going to say: 'We know interest rates are goingto go lower, let's change this average maturity from seven and a half yearsto 15 years,' " he said.    Instead, Schwartz said that he will extend or contract his maturitiesslightly from his neutral level of seven and a half years, according to hisrate forecast.    "It's the unknowns that really move this market and you can't predictthose," he added.    Instead, Schwartz uses yield curve analysis to find value and toachieve his goal of the highest total return possible.    "We constantly look at the current yield curve market and look at whereon the yield curve would be best to invest," he said.    Currently, Schwartz is buying in the intermediate area, where he thinksthe value is.    In this 15- to 20-year sector, he said, investors can find yieldsalmost as high as those on 30-year bonds with less risk.    "When you go out 10 more years to the 30 years, all you pick up is 10basis points," he said.    Risk-Reward Ratio    "We don't feel that risk-reward ratio is to your benefit, so let's takeless risk by going into the 20-year area and all we give up is maybe fiveto 10 basis points - that's worthwhile, to us," he explained.    "You're basically getting 98% of the 30-year bond with the 20-yearbond, so you're taking less risk or volatility while earning 98% of the 30-year bond," he added.    In addition to using to using yield curve analysis, he gauges value bycomparing municipals to Treasury securities, he said.    The intermediate area also currently looks attractive using thismeasure, he said.    At the moment Schwartz is pursuing a barbell strategy.    In addition to extending his maturity out to about eight years at thebeginning of 1995 when he was optimistic about the market, he has beenbuying prerefunded bonds at the short end of the curve.    "They've been yielding 78% to 80% of Treasuries - that's a veryattractive ratio for the shorter end and for something that is the mostsecure bond in the market," he said.    Schwartz's barbell approach involves buying securities in the one- tosix-year area and in the 15- to 20-year area.    "We feel like that's the area of the curve that has the best returnpotential in this kind of environment," he said.    Schwartz said that although there is nothing unusual about hisstrategy, he manages to find value because the STI fund is a national oneand can also, like many other national portfolios, take advantage of thesupply and demand inequities that crop up in the market at different timesof the year, he said.    This ability to pick and choose between the different states gives himan edge over state-specific funds, he said.    Tracking Prices    Schwartz said that he also makes the most of market inefficiencies bykeeping records of the price levels at which different bonds trade.    "We do very extensive historic relationship spreads of how bonds shouldtrade against each other," he said.    "For example, how should a general obligation bond trade versus arevenue bond? How should a specialty-state bond trade versus a non-specialty-state bond? How should a premium bond trade versus a discountbond," he said.    Schwartz buys and trades according to the aberrations he sees in thesehistoric relationships, he said.    Currently, he is taking advantage of the oversupply of bonds and thenwaiting for the New Year to roll in when a lot of bonds mature, are calledor make their coupon payments.    He estimates that more than $40 billion of cash will flood the marketin January - bringing demand, which he believes will create a good sellingclimate.    As part of his strategy of managing by making small but progressivechanges to his portfolio, Schwartz will trade bonds even if they only givehim a slight advantage, he said.    "If Floridas are trading expensive and Washington bonds are tradingcheap, then I will do that trade and earn a quarter and give that return toinvestors," he said.    Feeling Optimistic    At the moment, Schwartz has extended his portfolio because he hasstarted to feel optimistic about the market again, after worrying, earlierthis year, that the rally had run its course this year.    In addition, he has been buying intermediate bonds because they arelooking attractive again at the moment.    "In the 15-year area, we have seen yields as expensive as 85%, as cheapas 88.3% and it's currently at 88.2%, so you see it's at one of thecheapest areas versus Treasuries for the last three months, and over thepast year, it's been as cheap as 89.4%," he said.    Schwartz said he does not like to take credit risk either.    "We've seen too many investors reaching for yield and buying creditsthat are not adequately compensating them for the risk," he said.    Areas he avoids are housing bonds and utility bonds, he said.    Schwartz's avoidance of housing bonds fits with his philosophy thattotal return is the best measure of performance rather than income.    He believes that portfolios that rely on income are not as worthwhileas funds that rely on total return because total return measures the totalvalue of the portfolio - not just the income, which could be boosted bysacrificing capital.    Housing bonds in particular give investors high coupon payments buttheir value often amortizes as the securities age, not to mention they missout on the chance to benefit from rising prices.    "A housing bond is going to give you a lot of income, but in a bullmarket, those bonds are not going to appreciate very much at all becausethey are going to be called and the investor is not going to see that inthe total return number," he said.    "In a year like this past year, if you just had housing bonds, youcould never have a 13% return," he added.    He points to the Securities and Exchange Commission's 1993 ruling thatfunds must compare their performance with an index in their prospectuses asan example of how important achieving a high total return is.    Schwartz added that he believes total return is the best measure of afund's performance despite the fact that it ignores investors' tax bracketsand any capital gains tax liability that may be created.    Despite his bias toward total return, Schwartz believes that funds thatemphasize current income will still flourish.    "I think that current income funds are going to be around and will dowell.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996SOUTHWEST BOND-WATCHCalifornia    Six months after former Assembly Speaker Willie L.

Prado    Wyoming    The Internal Revenue Service has approved a program that uses statefunds to back general obligation bonds issued by local school districts,allowing them to borrow with higher credit ratings, according to astatement released by Cheyenne law firm Rothegerber, Appel, Powers, &Johnson.    "This ruling will allow the state to go forward with the School BondGuarantee Program for public education in the state," state auditor DaveFerrari said in the prepared statement. Ferrari helped draft the 1994legislation that established the program.    The ruling - issued in a private letter from the IRS - grants Wyomingthe approval needed to continue the program.    "The ruling was essential in order for the program to operate asintended," said Gregory Johnson, an attorney with the firm, which wascounsel to the state in seeking approval.

Hamilton describes himself as a conservative businessman but aDemocrat. "With a name like 'John Kennedy,' how could I be anything else?"he said. He also noted that at 32, he's Kentucky's youngest treasurer thiscentury.    Despite the fact that Hamilton completed only one year toward hisbachelor's degree at Lexington Community College, he is credited with"turning a failing (transportation) business around and increasing grossrevenue by $350,000."    The company, United Transportation Inc. of Lexington, was whereHamilton honed his managerial skills as president from 1983 - the year heleft college - to August 1995.    Hamilton, a political neophyte, plans on exploring the possibility ofexpanding the treasurer's investment activities - perhaps by addingmanagement of an LGIP to the office's responsibilities.    "We're going to work more closely with Kentucky's finance secretary andthe revenue cabinet compared to the last treasurer," Hamilton said. "Thosetwo agencies play an essential role in the state's investment programs.There needs to be an active and independent participant involved."    When pressed for details, Hamilton said he is interested in expandingthe treasurer's presence in investment policy decisions, but notnecessarily his authority.    Hamilton succeeds another Democrat, Frances Jones Mills, who servedthree separate terms as Kentucky's treasurer, the first beginning in 1976.    "Ms. Mills often didn't attend the meetings of the State InvestmentCommission," he said. "She would often send a surrogate. That will nothappen with me. But as far as any changes in investment policies, I willhave to learn more about the process before proposing anything."    Under state law, the treasurer serves as vice chairman of the StateInvestment Commission, which meets quarterly and essentially acts as anoversight board.    The day-to-day operation of the cash fund is conducted by the Office ofFinancial Management and Economic Analysis.    "Historically, the Investment Commission approves policies andprocedures and the staff of my office implements their decisions," said DonMullis, executive director of the financial management office.    There is currently at least one LGIP in the state, but that is operatedby the Kentucky Municipal League and the Kentucky Association of Counties,Mullis noted.    Although the state is permitted to establish an investment pool, onehas never been authorized, Mullis said.    "If such a pool were begun, it would in all likelihood start with theInvestment Commission and be managed and administered by this office,"Mullis added.    Kentucky's cash fund is doing fairly well, Hamilton said, pointing tothe revenue surplus of several million dollars. He said he hopes to enhancethe surplus by examining ways to boost returns for the state's cash fund.    "For me the biggest challenge ahead is restoring the sense of integrityof this office," Hamilton said. "So maintaining a strong presence on theInvestment Commission will be a good step in that direction."Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996NONPROFIT IOWA HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGECHICAGO    Two not-for-profit health systems in Iowa have signed apreliminary agreement to merge, leaving unclear the status of $220 millionof outstanding debt.    Officials of the Iowa Health System last week approved a memorandum ofunderstanding to merge with St. Luke's Health System. The memorandum isgood until March 1; Scott Eldridge, chief financial officer of St. Luke's,said he expects the final agreement to be reached late next month.    St. Luke's now has about $70 million of outstanding tax-exempt debt,Eldridge said. All of the health system's bonds have been sold withinsurance, and therefore carry a triple-A rating, he added.    The Iowa Health System has about $150 million of outstanding tax-exemptrevenue debt, according to chief financial officer William Miller. He saidthe debt is rated A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and A1 by Moody'sInvestors Service.    "I can't really say what will happen to the debt in the mergedorganization because it hasn't been decided yet," said Eldridge.    "We're sorting out those options now," echoed Miller. "One thing weknow for sure is that there certainly won't be a refinancing."    Eldridge suggested that the two groups may become jointly obligated forthe combined $220 million of debt now outstanding.    "It looks like ultimately, we will (both) be fully responsible for allthe debt of the merged organization, instead of carrying individual debtfor each operating unit," he added.    Eldridge said Sioux City-based St. Luke's decided to merge with DesMoines-based Iowa Health System primarily to capture a bigger share ofstatewide managed-care health contracts.    "Both systems are strong, and they'll be getting stronger through themerger," said Eldridge. "We view it as a way to attract more (primary care)physicians into our systems."    - Cris CarmodyBack to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996SCHOOLS' NEEDS ARE FERTILE GROUNDBy Kieran Beer    There was a time when immigrant children from all over the world gottheir first taste of the American dream at the local public school.    Public schools constructed in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s were safe,clean, well-lit places. Some of them were even elegant structures,expressions of the nation's faith in public education and the opportunityfor personal advancement.    Times certainly have changed. The structures built decades ago, whichserved to school other generations, are in decay, and there seems to belittle public will to restore them or to build new schools.    That certainly is the conclusion of the page one story that ran in theNew York Times the day after Christmas. The story cited hard numbers fromthe Government Accounting Office that $112 billion is needed to renovateold schools and build new ones. Despite that need, states, municipalities,and school districts are spending less than ever on schools'infrastructure.    The Times account also offered anecdotal evidence of our neglect ofschools that sound like accounts of life in the third world: a collapsedceiling in Montgomery County, Ala., that could have injured children; aleaky roof and condemned gymnasium in a New York City school; and termiteinfestation in New Orleans.    Like any crisis, the state of the infrastructure of America's publicschools has myriad causes. Among these are overcrowding caused by a newwave of immigrants - particularly in places like Texas, Florida,California, and New York - and the fact that baby boomers have producedtheir own boomlet of school-age children. But no confluence of problemsexcuses our society's indifference to children and to the dark future suchindifference will create.    All of this provides muni bankers with an opportunity to be the goodguys, despite all the heat they have taken during the debate about a flattax. A number of flat tax proponents have characterized muni bankers -referring to them as Wall Street bankers to emphasize their distance fromMain Street - as an ignoble lot who, in league with government bureaucrats,help fund boondoggles and profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Well,building and repairing schools is not a boondoggle - it is a nobleendeavor.    But to be the good guys, the municipal bond community will need tocontinue to reinvent itself. Even as a number of more nimble firms arelooking at project finance and other alternative methods of finance, themunicipal bond community should be exploring both traditional and new waysto build new schools and repair existing ones.    Alternative methods of finance are necessary given the anti-tax, anti-spend political climate. Brokering a private-public partnership between theinformation technology vendors and the states to upgrade schools is oneplace to start.    Another reason creative methods of finance will be needed for educationinfrastructure is that education itself needs to undergo revolutionarychange. Even as we try to figure out ways to give kids good one-on-onelearning experiences with teachers, it is important to apply the revolutionin information technology to education. (Hence, the importance of theinformation technology companies.)    There is no reason that a state's best teachers - or even the country's- should not be accessible electronically to thousands of childrenregardless of the school districts they live in, one member of themunicipal bond community observed. "Schools ought to look more like theSony Movie Megaplex than Adlai Stevenson (Intermediate High School)," saidan investment banker.    There are many obstacles - including the need to work out the tensionbetween local and regional control of schools. But a vision that returns tomaking school structures express our faith in education and the future isworth fighting for.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996NRMSIR    The Securities and Exchange Commission has designated six companies asnationally recognized municipal securities information repositories, orNRMSIRs, in accordance with its new secondary-market disclosure rules forbroker-dealers, which go into effect today.

Eckstrom andseveral Treasury staffers were busy with some shopping of their own -hunting for bargains in the capital markets.    And on Dec. 26, while the malls were jammed with people waiting in lineto make their holiday shopping returns, the state Treasury was looking forhigher returns on South Carolina's surplus funds.    Although both days were official state holidays, the treasurer and somestaff members volunteered their time - while investment banks and theFederal Reserve were open - in an effort to boost the returns on statefunds that otherwise would have remained dormant, according to JohnPownall, deputy treasurer in charge of investments.    In all, the state Treasury managed to pick up about $11,300 in extraincome on $152 million in idle funds over the holidays, Pownall said. Thetotal returns were about $93,700, while they would have been about $82,400had the funds been allowed to remain dormant, earning about 4.8%, hesaid.    The state picked up the extra income by investing in five-dayrepurchase agreements with state banks, Pownall said.    Eckstrom and Pownall, along with Treasury staff members Faye Nealy,Leanne Register, and Chuck Sanders, participated in the volunteer effort,which was the second time the group had volunteered on holidays. The firstwas on Nov. 24, the Friday after Thanksgiving.    During that holiday, though, the extra earnings were less - about$3,000 extra on a total investment of $43 million, Pownall said.    The idea for the volunteer program came from long-time treasury stafferKen Cliatt, Pownall said.    "As soon as we took office, (Cliatt) sent me an e-mail message tellingme that he had been suggesting this for some time," Pownall said. "Hethought there was some low-hanging fruit here that we could take advantageof. And we thought that this was just too good an idea to pass up - it'sjust common sense, basic investing."    Although the extra earnings are not earmarked for charities because ofstatutory restrictions, the benefits will be passed on to the people of thestate, who can in turn pass them on to the state's needy, Pownall said.    "(Giving the money to charity) is a great idea, but unfortunately it'ssomething that the law wouldn't allow us to do," Pownall said.    "But we think that to the extent that the taxpayers have a little extramoney in their pockets, maybe they can put it to use in charities or othercauses," he continued.    "It may be a Christmas present to the taxpayers."Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996WHAT'S SELLING: COLORADO PAPER RATES COMING BACK TO EARTH AFTER BUSYDECEMBERBY SARAH STIRLAND    Colorado paper is currently trading at rates that are lessstratospheric than usual, according to Richard O'Connor, a municipal traderin Kirkpatrick Pettis' Denver office.

O'Connor attributes this change to the lack of market participants atthis time of year and November's flood of issuance in the state.    Normally, Colorado municipal bonds trade at above-market levels becauseAmendment 1 has made in-state paper scarce. The amendment mandates that allnew bond issuance must be voter-approved.    In early December, retail investors in Colorado were gobbling upprerefunded bonds with a vengeance.    "There was a huge appetite for prerefunds - you couldn't find bonds.There was so much retail appetite because a lot of money came due Dec. 1,"he said. "You could easily sell a $1 million block of prerefunded bonds."    Many retail investors, who tend to be older retirees, have a preferencefor these types of Treasury-backed securities or for other triple-A ratednames because of previous bad experiences with higher yielding credits,O'Connor said.    "When you have your older investors who have been burned in the past onlesser credits, they don't care what it is so long as it's Moody's(Investors Service) and (Standard & Poor's Corp.) triple-A," he said.    To get his hands on prerefunded Colorado bonds, O'Connor contactedmutual funds that owned the securities and offered them high prices, hesaid.    "You pay them what would appear at the time a fairly stellar number forbonds - they couldn't necessarily turn you down and you turn around andflip (the bonds) in a phone call," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CALIFORNIA QUAKE AUTHORITY SLATES BOND SALELOS ANGELES    The newly formed California Earthquake Authority hasslated a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Co. to underwrite a $1.5 billionrevenue bond sale later this year, part of the $10.5 billion in funds thenew agency needs.    Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Bear Stearns & Co. are also among the majorfirms in the syndicate, according to the announcement from insurancecommissioner Chuck Quackenbush.    In addition to the bond sale, other funding sources for the authority'splan to pay homeowner earthquake damage claims includes $1 billion in cashcontributions from insurance companies, and another $3 billion in fundspromised by insurance companies if necessary to pay claims.    The plan also includes $2 billion from reinsurers, $1 billion assessedfrom earthquake insurance policy holders, and $2 billion from additionalassessments on insurers, Quackenbush spokesman Richard Wiebe said.    Quackenbush, elected in November 1994, returned last month from a two-week global jaunt aimed at seeking reinsurance for the new authority.    Gov. Pete Wilson in October signed into a law a bill appropriating$500,000 to investigate the viability of an earthquake insurance authorityand laying much of the groundwork needed for its start-up.    Quackenbush and Wilson proposed the authority's creation last summer inthe wake of an exodus of homeowner's insurance carriers after massivedamage claims stemming from the January 1994 Northridge earthquake near LosAngeles.    - Antonio A.

El Paso County district attorney John Suthers' office confirmed lastweek that Shipley is now being included in an investigation centering onformer pension fund manager Mike Witty.    Witty resigned from the pension board in 1994 after the countydiscovered there was no bidding process when he was awarded consultingcontracts to oversee the $80 million fund's real estate investments,according to county officials.    However, the inclusion of Shipley in the inquiry is not expected tohave any immediate impact on the treasurer's office or county finances oroperations, said Ken Kile, deputy county treasurer.    "I don't believe it's gotten to the point where it will have mucheffect," said Kile.    Shipley, who is still on the job, did not return telephone callsseeking comment.    Suthers' investigation began after the county learned of a secret,unauthorized bank account that Witty allegedly set up in the fund's name in1993. Since then, two audits have been launched, including one by theaccounting firm Arthur Andersen, which county commissioners approved inearly December.    But last week Suthers announced that his investigation had grown toinclude charges that Shipley and pension fund board member Carl Hattonborrowed thousands of dollars from Witty while he was awarded consultingwork.    Hatton resigned from the board after Suthers' announcement Dec. 26, butShipley, who served as chairwoman of the pension fund until Dec. 20,remains on the board. The new chairman is Dan May, a deputy districtattorney who has been on the board since 1994.    Hatton and Witty could not be reached by press time.    An audit county commissioners released Dec. 18 found that while Wittycontrolled county pension funds, they were invested heavily in real estate.The report by Aurora, Colo.-based Comiskey & Co. found that the fund'sconcentration in real estate increased to 34% from zero between 1992 and1994.    An earlier audit in May 1994 noted that besides his $55,000 salary tomanage the fund, Witty earned more than $500,000 in 1993 and 1994 under hiscontract with the fund as a private consultant to oversee the fund's realestate investments.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996WHAT TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA BUDGET SURPLUSLOS ANGELES    When California Journal - a Sacramento-based politicalmonthly magazine - recently asked a number of state budget observers abouta hypothetical surplus of $1 billion, it got responses ranging from doubtthat such a positive number could ever occur to calls for tax cuts.    Stephen Zimmermann, Western region managing director for Standard &Poor's Corp. in San Francisco, said in the Journal's January issue thatCalifornia's first priority must be to pass a true balanced budget - onethat doesn't require crossover borrowing from one fiscal year to another.He also suggested a reasonable reserve of at least several percent of thebudget.    "As for further bonded debt, we'd like to see a real capital needs planthat prioritizes expenditures funded by bonds," Zimmermann told the state'sleading political journal.    "California's current debt service is now about 5% of the budget," headded. "That's considered moderate, so increasing it is not particularly aproblem, as long as the capital expenditures are orderly and planned."    Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,suggested that a surplus ought to retire bond debt to improve the state'sbond ratings.    The anti-tax activist also told the Journal that some taxes should betrimmed, and suggested that the state's massive surplus under former Gov.Ronald Reagan in 1974 led to pressure that brought about tax and bondinglimits under Proposition 13.    - Antonio A. PradoBack to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996MOODY'S SEES NEXT HUD BILL HAVING 'FAR-REACHING' IMPACT ON BONDSBy Joan PrydeWASHINGTON    Moody's Investors Service says provisions in the still-unresolved HUD appropriations bill for fiscal 1996 set the stage for majorchanges in bond-related federal housing programs next year when lawmakersdraft legislation reauthorizing those programs.    "While the housing appropriations bill did not contain substantialchanges to Section 8 or FHA insurance, it would appear to indicate that thefinal outcome of the Capitol Hill debate on housing programs may have morefar-reaching implications for bonds backed by such federal housingassistance, as well as for bondholder security," Moody's said in a recentreport.    Congress passed the funding bill for the Department of Housing andUrban Development, and agencies within HUD such as the Federal HousingAdministration, in late November. President Clinton vetoed the measure onDec. 18, because he disagreed with funding levels of other agencies in thebill not related to HUD. Congress is expected to try to fashion a new billmore to his liking.    Among the HUD provisions in the vetoed bill important to the municipalmarket, one would have given HUD temporary authority to renew expiringsubsidy contracts under the Section 8 rent subsidy program. The provisionis designed to keep alive revenue streams for bond-financed multifamilyhousing projects under the program while Congress in 1996 comes up with aplan for revamping the Section 8 program.    Although Moody's said the provision is helpful to keep those projectsgoing, the bill does not provide for subsidy increases during the nextyear, which could cause problems.    "Extending contracts at current contract rents for one year would keepsubsidy levels constant," the ratings agency said in a report titledMoody's Monitors Rating Implications of HUD Debate. "To the extent,however, that expenses increase while subsidy levels remain constant, thismay signal the beginning of new financial stresses for these projects,subject to the economics of individual projects."    The Clinton administration and Congress want to overhaul the Section 8program because the federal government cannot afford to renew the thousandsof subsidy contracts set to expire in the next several years. Theadministration has proposed transforming the subsidies - which now are paidto project owners - into certificates issued directly to tenants.    For projects also backed by FHA insurance, the administration hasproposed requiring owners to "mark to market" - that is, adjust theircontract rents to market levels and restructure their underlying debt. Inthe event that the lower rent could not support a given mortgage, the loanwould go into default, and a claim would be made against the FHA insurancefund.    The appropriations bill just vetoed by Clinton included a provisionthat would have permitted HUD to begin testing its mark-to-market plan on15,000 units of multifamily housing out of a total of about 800,000 thatreceive Section 8 subsidies.    Moody's said that trial would be instructive, because the big questionabout mark-to-market is whether the FHA can handle a big influx ofinsurance claims that is sure to result if the program is fullyimplemented.    "While the ratings on these bonds are based on the FHA insurance, aquestion remains as to the ability of FHA to process and pay claims in atimely fashion," especially if implementation of mark-to-market sharplyincreased the number of claims that the housing agency was having toprocess, Moody's said.    If that were to happen, "Moody's view on these bonds could beaffected," the ratings agency said.    Moody's said it has requested information from state housing financeagencies regarding their multifamily portfolios "to better gauge the impactof potential changes to the programs."    "In the course of our ongoing surveillance efforts, we are maintaininga dialogue with the agencies regarding the ways in which they are preparingfor potential changes which could affect their Section 8 portfolios,"Moody's said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CHANCES DWINDLE FOR REFORM OF THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACTBy Martha M. Canan    The prospects for overhauling the Glass-Steagall Act have dimmedconsiderably since last year because commercial banking and insuranceinterests cannot resolve a dispute over bank insurance powers.    As a result, the issue of whether banks should have authority tounderwrite municipal revenue bonds is being held hostage to the insurancedispute, which threatens to derail House banking reform legislation thisyear, lobbyists say.    If Congress does not act on Glass-Steagall this year, the FederalReserve Board is expected to come under increasing pressure to expand banksecurities powers, including the ability to underwrite revenue bonds,through regulatory action.    The effort to reform the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibitsmixing commercial and investment banking, gained momentum last spring whenthe House Banking and Commerce committees passed a bill that would allowbanks and securities firms to affiliate through holding companies.    The legislation would give banks new power to underwrite revenue bonds,in addition to existing authority to directly underwrite less lucrativegeneral obligation bonds. However, banks would be required to engage insuch new activity only through separately capitalized holding-companyaffiliates. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed banks todirectly underwrite revenue bonds, but the current language omits thatauthority.    The dispute between the commercial banking and insurance industriesinvolves a provision in a related regulatory relief bill that would haltfor at least five years any regulatory effort by the Office of theComptroller of the Currency to expand bank insurance powers. A relatedissue is whether to allow banks under federal law to affiliate withinsurance companies.    Insurance interests strongly oppose letting commercial banks into theirbusiness, while commercial banking interests view insurance activities asessential to their ability to compete with other financial servicesproviders in a technologically advanced global marketplace.    The insurance dispute has prevented the House leadership from bringingthe Glass-Steagall bill to the floor, because lawmakers do not want tochoose between the two influential industries, which contribute heavily topolitical campaigns. House leaders have long planned to combine the Glass-Steagall and regulatory relief measures into one package for a floor vote.    Months-long negotiations between banking and insurance industryrepresentatives and House leaders and staff - including Speaker NewtGingrich, R-Ga., Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., andBanking Committee chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa - have made little progresstowards crafting a compromise.    In a recent letter to Thomas Labrecque, chairman and chief executiveofficer of Chase Manhattan Corp. and member of the Bankers Roundtable,Leach expressed his frustration with what he views as the intransigence ofbanks that oppose any change in the U.S. comptroller's powers on bankinsurance, sources said.    The letter, which the Banking Committee and the Roundtable refused torelease, prompted speculation that Leach may be ready to suspend orterminate the talks, although some lobbyists said they could not imagineLeach pulling the plug after all the effort he has put into passage of thebill.    A subsequent press release issued by the American Council of LifeInsurance last Thursday reinforced the pressure Leach appears to be puttingon the banks. The council "noted with regret the failure of negotiationsthis year regarding insurance provisions contained in (the reform bill)."The statement said ACLI officials "expressed frustration with the 'delayingtactics' employed by banking representatives to reach a workablecompromise."    The council, which represents 600 insurance companies, charged thebanking interests with being "inflexible," while saying that insurancecompanies have made "significant concessions."    But Alfred Pollard, senior director at the Roundtable, said thestatement reflects "the complexity and difficulty" of the numerousinsurance issues under discussion. "There has been no effort to delay onour part," he said.    At this point, "it's ... looking pretty bleak" for passage of a Glass-Steagall bill in this Congress, said James McLaughlin, director of agencyrelations for the American Bankers Association. "Most people ... think itis already dead, but there is always a slim possibility, at least for thefirst few months of the year," that the House will pass a bill in time forthe Senate to act, he said.    Even if the House passes a bill, any debate in the Senate promises tobe contentious, as would be efforts to reconcile differing House and Senateversions of the measure, McLaughlin and other lobbyists said.    Legislation sponsored by Senate Banking Committee chairman AlfonseD'Amato, R-N.Y., would allow affiliations not only between commercial banksand securities firms, but also insurance companies and industrialcompanies. This approach raises major policy issues, such as whether toallow companies like General Motors into the banking and brokeragebusinesses, McLaughlin said.    D'Amato has said he will not act on his legislation until the Housetakes action, a Senate Banking Committee spokesman said.    D'Amato has made clear he does not want to repeat what occurred duringprevious sessions of Congress, when the Senate three times passed a Glass-Steagall reform bill, only to have it die in the House, lobbyists said.However, election-year politics mean that Senate action cannot be ruledout, even if the House fails to act, because senators may want to placatefinancial services constituents who want reform, lobbyists said.    House Banking Committee spokesman Dave Runkel maintained that the HouseGlass-Steagall bill "is not dead" and that committee staff, led by JosephSeidel, are continuing to broker meetings with banking and insuranceindustry representatives to reach a compromise.    While the main sticking point is over insurance, the rest of the billaffecting the ability of banks and securities firms to enter each other'sbusiness "is pretty much intact," Runkel said.    Wall Street and regional securities firms have differing interests andconcerns about letting commercial banks into their business, with regionalfirms more opposed to competition from banks. The Securities IndustryAssociation has said it supports legislation that would put securitiesfirms on equal footing with banks and not subject the firms to moreburdensome banking regulation.    The securities association has been supportive of banking interests onthe insurance dispute, because securities firms that want to entercommercial banking do not want to be forced to divest insurance-relatedbusinesses.    But the securities group opposes letting banks directly underwriterevenue bonds and other securities, and the association was a major forcein getting Leach to change the bill to require banks to engage in suchactivity through separately capitalized units.    But the requirement would discourage many of the couple of hundredbanks that now underwrite GO bonds from setting up separate units to sellrevenue bonds because of higher associated costs, McLaughlin said. Amongother things, the banks would have to set up firewalls between theaffiliate and the parent and other units, which would mean separate boards,separate sales, no joint marketing, and other mechanisms aimed atprotecting federally insured deposits from the risks of investment banking.    Roughly 30 banks now have affiliates engaged in so-called non-eligiblesecurities activities, such as revenue bond underwriting, under Section 20of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Fed allows creation of such affiliates thatmeet strict revenue limit, firewall, and other requirements.    If Congress does not act this year, the Fed is expected to come underpressure to ease these requirements for Section 20 affiliates, thus pavingthe way for expanded bank securities activities. But the Fed probably wouldact only in small incremental steps, and many banks still would bediscouraged from setting up Section 20 units because of costs, bankinglobbyists say.    Fed regulations now limit revenues that can be derived from Section 20securities activities to 10% of gross revenues. The Fed could "easily"raise this cap to 25%, "if not higher," said Melanie Fein, a bankingattorney with Arnold & Porter.    However, Gingrich said in a recent letter to Leach that he has nointention of contacting the Fed to encourage such action. "I prefer passingthe Glass-Steagall bill in as close a consensus position as possible sothat Congress will ultimately make the policy determinations on theseimportant issues, and not regulators," he said.    The Dec. 13 letter came as a follow-up to a meeting earlier in themonth among Gingrich, Leach, congressional staff, and representatives ofJ.P. Morgan & Co., Banc One, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, and Bankof America. Gingrich said the banking representatives appeared to havemisunderstood his answer to a question about Fed activity in this area.    Meanwhile, a "pivotal event" for banks this year that could change thewhole face of the Glass-Steagall debate promises to be a U.S. Supreme Courtdecision, which is expected by the end of June in Barnett Bank v. TomGallagher, Insurance Commissioner, Fein said.    The case, which is set for oral argument on Jan. 16, asks whethernational banks with branches in towns of less than 5,000 people have theright to sell insurance in small towns, even if a state law prohibits anysuch activity. The National Bank Act prohibits national banks fromunderwriting insurance but contains a key exemption allowing such activityin towns of up to 5,000.    More than a dozen states have "anti-affiliation" laws like the Floridalaw at issue in the case. These laws prohibit commercial banks fromencroaching on the business of insurance agents.    If the high court rules that state law "trumps federal law in thisarea, then banks would not be able to use the town of 5,000 exemption tosell insurance," Fein said. "That would mean that banks would need to pushharder in Congress to gain legislative authority to sell insurance," shesaid.    If the court rules that the federal law preempts local law, banks wouldhave even less need than they do now for Glass-Steagall reform legislation,Fein said. Much will depend on the decision, which could be limited in itsimpact depending on how narrow it is, she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996LOUISIANA GOVERNOR-ELECT: VOTERS NEED A VOICE ON GAMINGBy Christopher McEnteeATLANTA     Louisiana Governor-elect Mike Foster says voters shoulddecide whether they want gambling, and plans to call a special session formid-March to get lawmakers' support for a referendum.    A referendum would either uphold or throw out video poker, riverboatgambling, and the New Orleans land-based casino that the state Legislaturemade legal in a 1992 act.    Foster, who takes office Jan. 8, feels that gambling was "rammed downthe people's throat" without a referendum, said Marsanne Golsby, Foster'spress secretary. Moreover, public opinion has soured on gambling because offederal probes of several state lawmakers' connections with the gamingindustry and poor revenue growth from gaming.    Rather than allowing separate votes for each form of gaming, Fosterwill request an "all-or-nothing" vote, Golsby said.    Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, Louisiana will havegambling for the foreseeable future. The state has existing contracts orlicenses with a number of operators that would not be affected by the vote,Golsby said. Gambling would have to be phased out as licenses and contractsexpire.    In the some cases, such as video poker, the state grants a one-yearlicense annually, so these machines could be shut down almost immediatelyif voters reject gaming. But the state's 12 riverboats would stick aroundlonger because they were given five-year contracts that start to run out in1998.    But New Orleans voters could have to wait until Harrah's Jazz Co.'s 30-year contract runs out before they see a land-based casino leave theircity. That is unless that contract was broken when Harrah's Jazz, thepartnership developing the casino, filed for voluntary bankruptcyprotection on Nov. 22.    Foster and his aides are working closely with Harrah's Jazz, Golsbysaid, to figure out what the company intends to do about its finances andits plans to build what they claimed would be the world's largest casino.The partnership has until mid-March to present a reorganization plan inU.S. Bankruptcy Court.    But Golsby said Foster is reluctant to comment about Harrah's plans,other than saying the state will review its proposals when it comes torevenue-sharing agreements.    For its part, Harrah's Jazz says it wants to push ahead with casinobuilding, yet Louisiana must cut red tape associated with the project andallow it to reduce capital and fixed costs in its operating contract.    Harrah's Entertainment vice president Colin V. Reed said last monththree changes must be made to its contract before a casino can be"successful in a market that has substantially less" demand for gamblingthan first imagined.    First, the casino would scale back the number of slot machines andgames. Secondly, Harrah's Jazz would ask its bondholders to become equitypartners in the operation while it attempts to secure more cash.    Lastly, Harrah's Jazz said the state must be more "flexible" aboutreceiving the $100 million minimum annual tax Harrah's Jazz is committed topaying. The tax is the single largest fixed cost in the project.    Reed suggested that the state should take $125 million, which hasalready been paid, and use that money as an advance on the tax until thepermanent casino is in business. He claimed that the deferral of taxeswould be acceptable under state law because the casino would not be able tomake its minimum payments otherwise.    Under their plan, the state expected to receive the greater of 18.5% ofgaming revenues or a $100 million flat tax from its sole New Orleanscasino, operated by Harrah's Jazz. To date, the state has received only $13million from a temporary casino set up in advance of the permanent Harrah'sfacility.    State budget officials estimate that riverboats and video poker willgenerate about $375 million in tax revenue throughout Louisiana in fiscal1996.    If they intend to repeal gaming laws, state lawmakers must approve aconstitutional amendment by a two-thirds vote and ask that voters take upthe issue. If legislators approve an amendment in mid-March, it could gobefore the public 45 days later at the earliest, or be placed on the ballotin November.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996ENDING WITH A BANG, 1995 VOLUME SURPASSES EXPECTATIONSBy Yong Lim    Suprising market observers, December was the fifth straight month inwhich municipal bond issuance beat 1994 levels, according to figurescompiled from Securities Data Co.

California issuers were the busiest among the 50 states in 1995,selling $20.14 billion. That was down 21% from $25.62 billion in 1994. NewYork was second with $18.73 billion, down 1%, followed by Texas with $10.47billion, up 1%; Florida with $9.05 billion, up a strong 18%; andPennsylvania with $7.15 billion, down 19%. Only 26 states and one U.S.territory reported higher new-issue volume in 1995. North Dakota reportedthe highest increase, doubling its 1994 volume of $241 million to $547million in 1995. Delaware had the biggest decrease in volume, cutting inhalf its 1994 figure of $364 million to $163 million in 1995.

The gains were modest, however, and several mutual fund companies saidthey had not seen their share. They blamed the growing appeal of retirementinvesting, the stock market's stellar performance, and the delayed federalbudget for investors' lack of interest.    According to the ICI, national funds saw inflows of $190.4 million inNovember, compared to October's outflows of $284.2 million. With reinvesteddividends the figures were inflows of $528.9 million and $55.6 million,respectively.    State funds gained $84.4 million in November, compared to losses of$225.5 million the previous month. With reinvested dividends, there wereinflows of $349.2 million and $40.3 million, respectively.    Municipal money market funds also posted inflows in November, as inOctober. Excluding reinvested dividends, the funds added $12.5 billion inNovember, compared to $13.1 billion the previous month. Includingdividends, both months recorded $15.3 billion inflows.    In its monthly report, Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. saidit sold just $300,000 net of all firms' tax-advantaged bond funds inNovember, down from $35.6 million in October, with reinvested dividendsincluded.    A drop in sales from $136.8 million in October to $104.5 million inNovember accounted for the bulk of the shift, according to Schwab spokesmanTom Taggart.    At least part of the drop is seasonal, Taggart said.    "Toward the end of the year, a lot of people tend to reshuffle theirportfolios," he said.    In addition, Taggart said, the stock market's excellent performance hasled many investors to shift cash from bonds to equities in anticipation ofanother great year for stocks.    The growth of retirement investing has further sidelined municipals,since those tax-deferred assets do not flow into tax-exempt funds, Taggartsaid.    Fidelity Management & Research Co. experienced net sales of $14 millionin November, including reinvested dividends, according to spokeswoman TeriKilduff.    But as of Dec. 21, Fidelity's tax-free funds had experienced netredemptions of $41 million - a development Kilduff blamed on investoranxiety over the delayed federal budget.    At Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., spokeswoman Marilyn Morrison said:"Municipal bonds continue to be pretty stagnant."    The largest outflows have come from the firm's national long-term fund,while its intermediate fund has seen the lightest redemptions, Morrisonsaid.    The firm attributes that pattern to investor perception that long-termfunds will suffer most in the event of major tax reform, she added.    By contrast, USAA Investment Management Co. benefited from the netsales trend identified by the ICI. Company president Michael Roth said thefirm's tax-free funds saw inflows of $41 million in November. Roth saidinvestors were attracted by the high yields reached by municipals due tothe market's rally and fear of tax reform.    Smith Barney Inc. has also seen its share of gains, said executive vicepresident Jessica Bibliowicz. December has emerged as the strongest monthof 1995 for its tax-free funds, which also posted gains in November, shesaid.    Investor confidence in portfolio manager Joe Deane is largelyresponsible, according to Bibliowicz.    "Being the number-one ranked fund doesn't hurt," she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996CALIFORNIA DEBATES WHETHER TO LINK SCHOOL FUNDING TO BUILDING PRISONSBy Antonio A. PradoLOS ANGELES    Top California GOP lawmakers said they hope partisanpolitics don't get in the way as they reconvene today in hopes of passing aresolution by next Monday to place a $3 billion state school generalobligation bond issue on the March 26 primary election ballot.    Last year's legislative session ended in September with Republicans andDemocrats deadlocked over GOP insistence that school bonds be linked to aprison bond initiative.    That stalemate must be broken within the next few days, or the measureswill have to wait until November for the next opportunity to appear on astatewide ballot, according to California Secretary of State Bill Jones.    However, the same stumbling blocks that tripped up the bill inSeptember are still in place. While both sides agree on the need for schoolconstruction funding, a Republican bill to be introduced today byAssemblyman Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, nonetheless includes a $1.9billion GO bond measure for new prison construction.    "We have a need for school construction, and a need for prisonconstruction, and Republicans will propose a bill in the early part of thesession to do both," Brulte said in a press statement.    The Democratic school bond proposal does not include the prison bondprovisions. Both measures require two-thirds majority approval in theAssembly and state Senate for passage.    "The Republican approach is still to hold the schools hostage tobuilding prisons," said Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Los Angeles, who lastmonth succeeded San Francisco Mayor-elect Willie L. Brown Jr. as the lowerhouse's top Democrat.    "The Democratic view is (that) we need to build public schools toreduce class size," Katz said. "And after we deal with schools, then we'lldeal with prisons."    Aides to Brulte and Katz would not speculate on whether either sidewould budge and allow a compromise.    When the Legislature reconvenes today, the raucous Assembly will returnto a divided house and probable battles over its leadership.    With Brown's departure on Dec. 14 following his election as SanFrancisco mayor, the Assembly was left with 41 Republicans, 37 Democrats,one Reform Party member, and one vacancy.    The GOP will probably try to install Orange County assemblyman andparty leader Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, into the speakership, oustingBrian Setencich, R-Fresno. Republicans are wary of Setencich because he waselected in an overwhelmingly Democratic vote.    And while the more docile state Senate has 21 Democrats holding asimple majority control - with 16 Republicans, two independents, and onevacancy - Brulte's bond bill probably won't gain the 27 votes needed topass even that less partisan body.    Senate president pro tempore Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, said he opposesany linkage of school bonds to prisons, adding through an aide that hisparty caucus wants to curb what he called the "reckless spending" that hasmade California's prisons among the most expensive in the nation.    Meanwhile, education groups are urging lawmakers to cast politics asideand place school GO bonds on the March ballot.    The state Department of Finance has estimated that California's schoolcapital project needs at least $7 billion to refurbish aging facilities andbuild new schools to handle statewide enrollments estimated at 140,000 newstudents annually.    "If California's financial situation were more dire, I could understandmy colleagues' concerns," said longtime Assemblywoman Dede Alpert, D-LaJolla, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, and among thoseopposed to linking school and prison bonds. "But our classrooms are themost overcrowded in the nation."    She added that while California's debt levels are up, they are moderatecompared to some states.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996N.Y.C. ECONOMIC AGENCY POSTS ANOTHER BANNER YEARBy Christina Pretto     Increased business confidence in the local economy helped to make 1995another record year for the bonding arm of the New York City EconomicDevelopment Corp.    In one fell swoop last year, the city's Industrial Development Agencyused up its entire annual allotment of private-activity bond volume - $120million - to help finance a recycling plant on Staten Island for PrattIndustries, an Australian company.    That deal and others, including some scheduled to close this week,brings the agency's total issuance for the year to more than $864 million,just $7 million less than 1994's $871 million. Going forward, developmentagency officials expect 1996 issuance levels to resemble those in 1995.    The agency is able to exceed its annual allotment of private-activitybonds by using allocations built up in previous years and by applying forextra capacity from state private-activity reserves.    In 1995, the agency completed 39 transactions that ranged in size from$253 million to $1.3 million. In 1994, the agency completed 24transactions.    The numbers run in sharp contrast to issuance levels between 1987 and1993. The most bonds issued in the period was $417 million of debt in 1991.A more typical year was 1987, when the agency issued about $44 million ofdebt.    Corporation officials attribute the increase largely to a greaterconfidence in the economy on the part of small businesses and nonprofits,which has made the businesses more willing to take on long-term debt.Better marketing of the agency's programs has also increased demand, theysaid.    Indeed, corporation president Charles Millard said he would like morebusinesses and nonprofits - especially smaller ones - to take advantage ofthe Development Agency's ability to issue tax-exempt bonds to raisecapital. Such financing is viewed by city officials as an investment toolto revive the city's weak economy.    The Industrial Development Agency is a subsidiary of the EconomicDevelopment Corp., a public-benefit, quasi-governmental entity that ischarged with improving the city's business climate.    The Development Agency - among other programs - issues revenue bondsfor both businesses and nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations needing funds forcapital investment.    Both the corporation and the Development Agency have been at theforefront of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to retain and attractbusiness - and thus jobs and tax revenues, crucial to a city that in thelast five years has lost more than 400,000 jobs while battling to closechronic multibillion-dollar budget gaps.    The issue for Pratt Industries is a key transaction in Giuliani'sagenda to bring in new business. The agency plans to sell another $150million of debt for Pratt in 1996.    The agency also recently sold about $253 million of bonds to finance aco-generation plant for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a transaction that wasbegun nearly four years ago. Together, the two projects are expected togenerate more than 800 jobs.    But the agency is not focused solely on large deals - quite theopposite. The lion's share of its issues over the past two years have beenless than $10 million, and have targeted smaller businesses and nonprofits,such as a $1.3 million issue for the Dance Theater Workshop, a Manhattandance group.    "I want more not-for-profits and small businesses to know we'reavailable," Millard said in a telephone interview. "If they can get accessto capital, then they can have an opportunity to grow."    Many of the smaller issues are unrated and privately placed with fundsthat are familiar with agency programs and need to diversify theirportfolios with small blocks of debt that are still triple- or double-tax-exempt. The bonds are rarely traded and instead are held to maturity.    To facilitate many of the agency's debt transactions, the corporationmust first acquire a title interest in a client's property. Suchacquisition creates a public interest in the business and legally justifiesthe issuance of tax-exempt bonds.    Issuance is also subject to allocation of New York State's allotment ofprivate-activity bond capacity. Of the state's $900 million annual private-activity capacity, the city's Development Agency receives $120 million ayear.    The agency may also apply for reserve allocation, which the state setsaside every year, totaling $300 million. Both state and local agencies maydraw from the reserve on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by thestate Economic Development Department, headed by Charles Gargano.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996S&P SAYS UPGRADE FOR N.Y. WILL COME WITH BUDGET BALANCEBy Christina Pretto    Standard & Poor's Corp. last week said New York State is in line for anupgrade to A from A-minus if Republican Gov. George Pataki succeeds inpushing through plans to cut spending and impose structural balance for thefiscal 1997 budget.    However, the rating agency warned that an upgrade to above the A-levelis years away because the state has yet to demonstrate a commitment tofiscal responsibility over an extended period.    Market reaction to the statement was virtually nil, as holiday doldrumskept trading activity low, several traders said.    "New York paper is pretty stretched as it is," one trader said. "Ithink everybody is into a holiday mode."    Nonetheless, market participants have been grumbling over the past fewmonths that the state - the lowest rated in the country by Standard &Poor's - is due for an upgrade as it embarks on a path of tax cuts coupledwith spending reductions.    The upgrade to A - if it happens - will occur in or around March.Richard Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's, said in an interview lastweek that the positive outlook on the rating would be removed at aroundthat time.    "We're going to make a determination as to whether the rating is A orA-minus in March," Marino said. "At that point we'll take the positiveoutlook off the rating and replace it with a stable outlook."    An upgrade to A will hinge on the state's enacting a structurallybalanced budget that reduces general-fund spending, like that currentlybeing proposed by Pataki, Marino said.    Whether that happens, however, is subject to significant risk,including legislative opposition to cuts in social service spending anduncertainty surrounding changes in federal funding for entitlementprograms, Marino added.    Moody's Investors Service already rates New York State's generalobligation bonds A.    Overall, Standard & Poor's praised Pataki's proposed $63.3 billion all-funds budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 - particularly theadministration's effort to introduce the plan a month ahead of schedule.    "This was an extremely difficult task given the uncertainty surroundingthe federal budget," the rating agency said in a statement.    The plan also calls for reducing state general-fund spending for thesecond straight year, moving budgeting to a cash basis, and balancing taxcuts with cuts in spending, particularly in Medicaid.    Separate but related budget initiatives include a proposal by Patakithat both the executive and legislative branches agree on one set ofrevenue estimates for budget deliberations, which rating analysts saidwould be a step in the right direction.    "Any serious movement ... to this method of revenue forecasting wouldbe viewed positively," Standard & Poor's said.    Currently, the two parties constantly haggle over revenue estimates,which are often revised upward simply to accommodate an unwillingness toreduce spending. As a result, deficits are exacerbated, credit analystssaid.    The governor has also proposed constitutional amendments to require:the Legislature to enact a balanced budget; the governor to propose theexecutive budget by Dec. 1; and the enactment of an austerity budget whenthe budget is passed late, rather than the use of emergency appropriations.    "While these initiatives are very long-term in nature ... if carriedthrough, (they) could position New York to have a credit rating more inline with other states in the country," the rating agency said.    But the state must do a few other things to garner an above-A rating,Marino said, suggesting an elimination - or significant drawdown - of thestate's $4 billion accumulated deficit, and years of on-time budgetenactments.    "An above-A level wouldn't happen before the end of the century,"Marino said. "We're looking for long-term actions."    But some market observers argue that the Pataki administration'swillingness to fight for spending reductions and tax cuts deservessignificant recognition from the rating agencies.    "It's ridiculous. We're below West Virginia and Louisiana," said oneanalyst. "Come on."

While a number of states have the resources to make up for the overdueaid from Washington, a prolonged stalemate between Congress and thepresident could put other states in the same fix as New Jersey, said HymanC. Grossman, a managing director for Standard & Poor's Corp.    With no agreements on appropriations for federal departments governingMedicaid, Medicare, welfare, or job training - the most significantprograms sending money to the states - many states have been spending theirown funds on those programs since the federal fiscal year began Oct. 1.    Yesterday, New Jersey completed the second - and final, according tostate Treasury officials - installment of a $505 million short-term cash-flow borrowing authorization by issuing a $250 million commercial paper taxand revenue anticipation note.    The issue was rated A1-plus by Standard & Poor's and Prime-1 by Moody'sInvestors Service. A line of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland ensuredadequate liquidity for the commercial paper program, and helped secure thehigh ratings, rating agency analysts said.    On Dec. 5, New Jersey issued $200 million in commercial paper Trans asa result of the cash-flow pressure caused by delay in aid from Washington,state officials said.    A spokeswoman for the state treasurer said that while the state ispermitted to borrow $505 million, the $450 million in commercial paperTrans should cover for the absence of federal assistance.    Of the programs that receive federal aid, New Jersey's Human ServicesDepartment faces the greatest potential for disruption, Grossman noted.Most of the proceeds from the commercial paper will go to human services.    "Different states are handling effects of the budget impasse indifferent ways," Grossman said. "Most states are handling the cash-flowproblems internally. They can move money around - apparently with lessdifficulty than New Jersey. But some states have legal restrictions on theability to borrow internally."    Florida is one state that has been able to successfully transfer moneywithin its borders to cover the delayed federal aid, Grossman said.    "In effect, what Florida has done is advance money to service providersthat ordinarily would have been paid from federal money," Grossman said."When and if the federal budget gets straightened out, federal money willflow down to Tallahassee and then the state will reimburse from whence theyborrowed."    New Jersey doesn't have constraints that prevent borrowing internally,Grossman said. But state officials probably concluded that it was lesscostly to issue debt than to shift money around internally, he said.    "When you borrow internally, you have to pay a taxable rate," Grossmansaid. "It's cheaper to go out and issue tax-exempt commercial paper."    The commercial paper Trans should cover the state's liquidity for atleast six weeks, said David Alter, an assistant vice president withMoody's.    "It should be said that the state has adequate reserves to maintain thedifference from that shortfall," Alter added. "The month-ending balance forJanuary is sufficient even without the cash-flow borrowing. It's topreserve proper liquidity, because at some point in January, the statewould normally experience a low point anyway. This borrowing is a littlemore than usual, but they expected to do it anyway."    At this point in time, both Grossman and Alter said that no otherstates have accelerated their issuance as a result of the federalgovernment shutdown. But they do expect other states to follow suit if theimpasse lasts through January.    On Dec. 22, Congress passed a continuing spending resolution that willexpire midnight Jan. 3. The programs operating under that resolution areAid to Families With Dependent Children, veterans benefits, and the budgetfor the District of Colombia.    "Of course, this is America and this thing will get resolved at somepoint and by the time February rolls around, cash-flow estimates show alarge bump up in revenues," Alter said. "So while the situation isdifficult for New Jersey, it is by no means desperate."    Amy B.

Merrill, top lead manager in 1993 and 1994, dropped to second positionfor that category but took the top honor among co-managers.    The figures also show long-term bond sales totaled $156.22 billion in1995, helped by a strong close to the year. The figure was higher than mostmarket observers had expected but still 5% below the $164.5 billion sold in1994, according to Securities Data.    In December, state and local governments sold 818 issues totaling$16.76 billion, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed inDecember 1994, Securities Data said. Private placements are included in allvolume figures but not the underwriting rankings. (See article on page 3.)    Last year Goldman Sachs lead managed 307 issues, totaling $19.83billion. That accounted for 12.8% of the $154.94 billion of long-term bondssold through negotiated and competitive underwriting during the period.    Merrill Lynch lead managed $17 billion in 1995, followed by SmithBarney Inc. with $12.98 billion, PaineWebber Inc. with $12.71 billion, andLehman Brothers with $9.83 billion.    Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been in a dogfight for the top ofthe municipal underwriting rankings since 1987. Merrill, which last won thecrown in 1994, has won five out of the last nine years. But Goldman easilyprevailed in 1995, not only taking first place for the year as a whole butalso grabbing each quarter's top honors.    In co-manager rankings, where each manager in an issue is given creditfor the full par value of the sale, Merrill Lynch led in long-term bondsales, with 779 issues totaling $45.9 billion, followed closely by SmithBarney with $44.88 billion.    After them came Goldman Sachs with $44.57 billion, PaineWebber with$41.63 billion, and Lehman Brothers with $35.61 billion. Merrill last wonthe co-manager rankings in 1989. PaineWebber has dominated from 1990 to1994 as top co-manager in municipal underwriting.    By a large margin, New York City was the leading issuer of long-termbonds in 1995, with 14 issues totaling $5.42 billion. It was the biggestseller of debt from 1991 to 1993, but was eclipsed by the state ofCalifornia 1994.    The New York State Dormitory Authority was second in 1995 with $1.79billion of long-term bonds sold, followed by the New Jersey TransportationTrust Fund Authority with $1.59 billion.    Connecticut followed with $1.56 billion, and the Foothill/EasternTransportation Corridor, Calif., with $1.51 billion.    California fell from first in 1994 to ninth place with $1.25 billion.    Except for the second quarter, where Foothill/Eastern was the topissuer, New York City led every quarter in 1995.    Securities Data's long-term bond rankings are based on issues withfinal maturities of 13 months or longer, while short-term rankings arebased on issues maturing in under 13 months. Municipal forward sales areincluded, but private placements, remarketings, and taxable debt issueddirectly by private nonprofit organizations are excluded. The rankings aresubject to revision.Back to Headline List CopyrightBOND BUYER FULL TEXT via NewsNetJanuary 02, 1996SAYING GOODBYE TO 1995, PLAYERS HOPE FOR QUICK PRIMARY PICKUPBy Michael Stanton    After a week of solid gains despite light post-holiday volume,municipal market players say they are looking forward to a rise in activitythis week to validate prices' climb.    Last week's almost dormant primary market is expected to be replaced bya more active new-issue sector starting tomorrow, but although the calendaris heavier, several underwriters noted that many of the deals planned forthis week are refundings whose ultimate timing will rely on the market'sperformance.    Leading that list is an insured $155 million electric system revenuerefunding issue for Sikeston, Mo., that is scheduled to be priced in thenegotiated sector by lead manager A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.    An underwriter at the firm said the deal - originally planned for lateDecember before the market deteriorated under the weight of a supply surge- has returned to the calendar for next week, but could be delayed again.    "We put it on the calendar, but the market's going to have to tell uswhen it's going to be priced," the underwriter said.    Other significant deals on the negotiated calendar for this weekinclude an $89.3 million general obligation public improvement refundingbond issue for Richmond that is set to be priced by Goldman, Sachs & Co.    Meanwhile, Smith Barney Inc., as senior manager, plans to price a $66.4million sales tax revenue refunding issue for the Riverside County, Calif.,Transportation Commission. The deal is set to be insured by FinancialGuaranty Insurance Co.    In other negotiated action, Goldman Sachs will return to the market assenior manager for a $65 million hospital revenue refunding issue forIntegris Health Systems in Oklahoma. The deal is set to be sold withinsurance from AMBAC Indemnity Corp.    The competitive sector, meanwhile, will gear up for a $127 millionrefunding from Clark County, Nev., on Thursday, while a long-awaited $183.9million Florida Board of Education refunding remains on 24-hour notice.    In Thursday's secondary market activity, traders said municipal priceswere unchanged to up #1/4 of a point in light trading, with what demandthere was coming from other dealers, while major buy-side participantsmoved into a "holiday mode" ahead of Friday's early close and the longweekend for New Year's Day.    Although traders uniformly cautioned that the week's gains were basedon very thin trading activity, most said the slow primary market supply andlight forward calendar, lent the market a firm tone going into the newyear.    "The primary's not going to be dead like it was this week, but it'sstill going to be relatively quiet, so from the supply side of things, Ithink we still have a good tone," another trader said.    The Bond Buyer's 30-day visible supply of new issues expected to cometo market within the next month totaled $2.29 billion Thursday, up $141.4million from Wednesday. That comprised $1.06 billion of competitive issues,up $141.4 million, and $1.23 billion of negotiated issues, which wasunchanged.    Standard & Poor's Blue List of dealer inventories fell $119.9 million,to $1.44 billion.    With the impasse over the federal budget causing a suspension in datareleases from the Commerce Department and Bureau of Labor Statistics,fixed-income players were forced to turn to several privately compiledsources for insight into the economy's health.    Although data on the number of initial unemployment claims for the weekof Dec. 18 was delayed, the Conference Board reported that its index ofhelp-wanted advertising volume fell four points to 127 in November, whichis considered to reflect a drop in the supply of jobs and a slowingeconomy.    The signs of economic weakness helped government market traders sustaintheir week-long rally, pushing the 30-year Treasury bond through the 6%psychological barrier, where it stayed for the remainder of the session.Late Thursday, the long bond was quoted up #12/32, to yield 5.98%.    But both the Treasury and municipal markets' attention remained focusedon Washington, with players voicing hopes that the stress of the governmentshutdown, along with the rapidly approaching presidential primary season,would lead to a quick agreement between White House and congressionalleaders to balance the budget.    The debt futures markets moved up in line with the cash markets'bearish tone, although the municipal futures contract continued tounderperform the Treasury contract. The March municipal contract closed up#9/32 Thursday, to 120#23/32.    But the MOB spread widened again, and was calculated at negative 13Thursday, compared with negative nine Wednesday.Back to Headline List WT03-B38-3IA059-000325-B022-316http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi65.html 205.156.212.5 19970115004538 text/html 24476HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 00:43:49 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:16 GMTContent-length: 24287Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi65.html Sample Issue Copyright CALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNet January 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES MUNI BRIEFS (793 words) LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRIL (461 words) MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCING (207 words) POLLUTION AUTHORITY SELLS $11.2 MILLION ISSUE FOR RECYCLING (83 words) BANKAMERICA OPENS ATLANTA OFFICE (142 words) MERRILL LYNCH MOST ACTIVE UNDERWRITER IN 1995 (539 words) MARKET WRAPUP SNOWFALL IN EAST BOOSTS BAROMETER (164 words) DEAL TALK MENLO PARK ISSUE ENJOYED RIGHT TIMING (266 words) LOCAL FOCUS SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING (145 words) SACRAMENTO UPDATE LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURES (476 words) CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MUNI BRIEFSFirst-time buyers of municipal bonds are quick to pick up on theapparent contradiction of double-A-rated bonds yielding less thansupposedly more secure triple-A insured bonds, according to Robert W.Chamberlin, senior vice president and chief municipal analyst for DeanWitter Reynolds Inc.     While Chamberlin and other analysts agreed there is no simpleexplanation, they all said supply and demand is a major factor behind thedifference, typically four to eight basis points.     "In pure economic terms, a lot of anything tends to cheapen theprice -- even with something that (in theory) should be high-priced,''Chamberlin explained. "That clearly is what is happening with triple-Arated bonds.''According to the Public Securities Association, almost 45% ofnew municipal issues came to market with insurance in 1995.-- Jon BirgerRep. Richard Baker, R-La., is working on separate legislativeproposals that would dramatically change municipal market disclosure andmake it harder for municipalities to file for bankruptcy.     The legislation, which is still being drafted but could beintroduced during the next few weeks or months, stems from a hearing onOrange County that was held last July by the House Banking Committee'scapital markets subcommittee that Baker chairs, an aide and other sourcessaid this week.     Baker had said after those hearings that he planned to introducelegislation to improve municipal disclosure and to make it more difficultfor local governments to file for bankruptcy.     It is not yet clear what support Baker would have for thelegislation from congressional committees that have jurisdiction over theseissues or from municipal market groups.     But the Public Securities Association and Government FinanceOfficers Association plan to consider the draft disclosure bill at meetingslater this month, officials with those groups said. --  Lynn Stevens HumeEnvironmental and transportation bills important toinfrastructure finance are expected to see a lot of congressional activitythis year -- but not necessarily passage.     Lobbyists and analysts give flow control and drinking waterbills better chances for final action than reauthorization of the CleanWater Act. On transportation, the House is expected to take more initiativethan the Senate in laying the groundwork for next year's debate onreauthorizing a major 1991 highway law.     Analysts Debra Coy and Gregg Orrill of Washington Analysis,which is part of the investment banking arm of the HSBC Group, said in arecent report that drinking water and flow control bills, along withSuperfund legislation, "continue to be our best bets for completedenvironmental legislation by mid-1996.''-- Martha M. CananPotential changes in federal funding will move to the frontburner as the number one item affecting state credit ratings in 1996,according to a report from Moody's Investors Service released earlier thisyear.     Health care and welfare are the areas in which state creditquality is most vulnerable, the rating agency said, emphasizing thewidespread reliance of states on federal support -- and voter pressure forlower taxes.     But Moody's said ratings changes this year do not have to be allone-way.-- Peter ListThe National Association of Bond Lawyers is calling on federalregulators to withdraw the long-pending private-activity bond rules, offera new set of proposed regulations for comment, and move quickly to makethem final.     Although a number of issuer groups have suggested re-proposingthe private-activity bond rules, this is the first time the bond lawyersassociation has called for a newly proposed set of regulations since therules were first published in December 1994.For a number of reasons, "including the significance of thisregulatory project and its widespread impact on state and localgovernments, we believe that re-proposing the proposed regulations withmodifications and amendments would be the most prudent way to proceed withthis project,'' NABL said in a letter released earlier this month.-- JoanPrydeRep. Christopher Cox is working with the Securities and ExchangeCommission to draft legislation that would simplify municipal disclosureand make it more like corporate disclosure without repealing the TowerAmendment to the securities laws.     The draft legislation may also propose setting federalrequirements for municipal financial reporting, accounting, and auditing.     "The idea would be to avoid any conflict with Tower and to avoidthe imposition of any new costs'' or burdens on issuers and other marketparticipants, Cox, a Republican from Orange County, said in an interviewJan. 5.     Cox said he hopes to have a draft bill ready within 30 days todiscuss with state and local groups, the Public Securities Association, andother municipal market participants.     "I intend to work closely with the commission and withinterested market participants for an extended period before introducingthe legislation,'' he said.-- Lynn Stevens HumeThese news briefs were excerpted from CPF's sister publication,The Bond Buyer.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRILThe City of Los Angeles Department of Airports will sellbetween $90 million and $150 million in revenue bonds this spring to payfor a new terminal complex at Ontario International Airport in SouthernCalifornia's Inland Empire.     The financing team is already in place. The financialadvisers are Lazard Freres & Co., Charles A. Bell Securities Corp., andMarilyn L. Garcia. The agency was working with Lazard Freres' Los Angelesoffice before it closed. The firm's relationship with the city continuesfrom its New York office. O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles is bond counsel.     The Ontario bond issue, tentatively scheduled for April,will be for about $90 million if the department builds only two terminalsin the new complex and leaves space for a third structure to be builtlater.     But the city also sought construction bids for building allthree terminal buildings to see if it could get an attractive price, giventhe current weakness in the state's construction industry. Constructionbids are due Jan. 26.     If all three buildings are constructed at this time, theproject's cost will be $343 million, with bonds financing $150 million ofthe project, said Kathy Van Ness, deputy management analyst for thedepartment.     "We've been having some protracted discussions on thestructure of the bond issue," Van Ness said. The agency is discussing howto finance the project using airport revenues, passenger facility fees andfederal grants.     Last year, the department refinanced revenue bonds tied toLos Angeles International Airport so it could remove covenants thatprohibited the use of airport revenues for non-airport uses and restrictedthe transfer of airport revenues to the city's general fund. In addition toLAX and Ontario, the department also runs the city's Burbank Airport andPalmdale Airport.     In last summer's bond sale, the department includedinsurance at the bidder's option that was provided by FGIC. It's uncertainwhether the agency will offer enhancement on the Ontario issue, Van Nesssaid.     Ontario handles 6 million passengers a year in its fast-growing service area that includes five million residents and covers SanBernardino and Riverside counties, and portions of northern Orange Countyand eastern Los Angeles County. By comparison, 50 million passengers travelthrough LAX annually.     Ontario airport's lower profile among investors will be achallenge for the agency. Van Ness said she is considering offering anoptional tour of the airport and region to the ratings agencies.     Passenger traffic at the airport, located about 35 mileseast of Los Angeles, has increased steadily for the past decade.     In 1975, 1.29 million people used the airport. In 1993, 6.2million travelers used the airport and 353,000 tons of air freight wereshipped from the facility. The new terminal complex will provide capacityfor 12 million passengers.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCINGThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern Californiaspent much of last week watching interest rates, waiting for theopportunity to sell a $200 million refunding issue.

AsCalifornia Public Finance was going to press Jan. 10, Becker said interestrates were about "20 basis points away from our target."     "There's still some optimism from several economists andbrokerage firms that there's still some hope for a rally," he said from hisLos Angeles office.     Becker, who described the market-sensitive bond sale as a"day-to-day, week-to-week" situation, said he's hopeful the deal will becompleted this month.     Smith Barney Inc. is the underwriter.

Merrill Lynch & Co. topped the list of lead underwriters inCalifornia for full-year 1995 despite its ties to Orange County. MerrillLynch worked on 40 bond issues in California totaling $3.3 billion, givingthe firm a 16.5% share of the market. Issuers the firm worked with lastyear included the State of California, the San Diego County RegionalTransportation Commission, San Bernardino County, Los Angeles County, andthe City of Long Beach.     "We hope to see more issuance at the state level" thisyear, said H. Cody Press III, managing director and manager at MerrillLynch in Los Angeles.     Other players also see increased activity this year.     "I see volume about 10% higher than last year nationally,and maybe a little higher in California because our recovery is underway,"said Anthony J. Taddey, senior managing director at BA Securities Inc. Healso anticipates a very strong note season in California this summer.     Michael P. George, managing director at J.P. MorganSecurities Inc. in San Francisco,  said he expects "clients will continueto be very judicious about bond issuance."     "There will be more strategic financing and less clean,plain-vanilla financings," he said, adding that issuers will be under evengreater pressure to do more with fewer dollars.     Merrill Lynch was followed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. as themost active underwriter in California last year. Goldman worked on 27 dealstotaling $2.3 billion for an 11.4% market share.     PaineWebber Inc. followed with a 10.6% share of the market.The firm worked on 43 issues totaling $2.1 billion in principal amount.     Smith Barney Inc. was the fourth most active underwriter,handling 44 issues totaling $1.8 billion in principal amount. Smith Barneyheld 8.9% of the California market.     Rounding out the top five was Morgan Stanley & Co., whichhandled 10 issues totaling $1.6 billion. The firm captured 8.1% of themarket. Morgan Stanley's 1995 major clients included the City of San Diegoand the San Jose/Santa Clara Clean Water Financing Authority.     Among bond counsel, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in SanFrancisco captured the top spot in both California and nationally.     "While Orrick has been ranked number one for seven of thelast eight years, holding that position for 1995 is particularly gratifyingin light of the nearly 50% reduction in dollar amount of debt issued by theState of California," said Roger Davis, chairman of Orrick's public financedepartment. Davis also anticipates the state will be a more active issuerthis year.     Orrick served on 215 issues with a principal amount of $8.3billion, giving the firm a 41.4% market share. Following Orrick was JonesHall Hill & White; Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth; Pamela S. Jue P.C.;and O'Melveny & Myers.

The deal was among the first out of the gate this year,coming to market on the morning of Jan. 2.     "We priced it first thing Tuesday morning, right after theholiday," said Richard G. Kiss, a managing director at Piper Jaffray Inc.in San Francisco.     Trading got off to a quiet start that day, but by middayactivity picked up.     "We did exactly the right thing because I don't think wecould have achieved those levels" later in the week, Kiss said, adding thatthe final decision to price Tuesday morning was made at a 6:30 a.m.conference call that day.     Cadmus Hicks at John Nuveen & Co. in Irvine also noted that"the deals priced earlier in the week did extremely well."     Menlo Park wanted to achieve $1 million in present-valuesavings through the refinancing of bonds originally issued in 1988 and1992. The Silicon Valley community achieved that objective by realizing$1.04 million in present-value savings, Kiss said.     Menlo Park originally planned to sell the bonds in thesecond week of December, but the market moved away. Wishing to avoidpricing the bonds during the slow holiday period of late December, the citydecided to wait until this month to sell the bonds.     The original bond proceeds paid for improvements in housingprojects, a senior citizen center, and other capital improvements in theredevelopment area in the city's Belle Haven neighborhood, said UmaChokkalingam, Menlo Park's finance director.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSINGSan Francisco Mayor Willie Brown announced in his inauguraladdress Jan. 8 that he is considering financing $150 million in affordablehousing.      Details were sketchy on how the bond financing would bestructured. In his speech, Brown suggested that some of the money would beraised through a tax-increment bond issue.      Word has it that San Francisco's new mayor is considering a$100 million general obligation bond issue and a $50 million tax-incrementissue, tied to the city's Golden Gateway Project Area.      Brown also noted in his inaugural address that the citymust invest in its infrastructure, with or without state and federaldollars.      Brown's reference to infrastructure is another sign thatpublic finance issues will get more attention from the general public thisyear as San Francisco and other California cities try to meet publicservice demands with increasingly scarce dollars and debt capacity.Back to Headline List CopyrightCALIFORNIA PUBLIC FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURESThe California Assembly elected a new speaker and agreed toplace a $3 billion school bond measure on the March ballot when itreconvened Jan. 3.     The Assembly elected Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, to bethe body's fourth speaker in the last 12 months after ousting BrianSetencich, R-Fresno, who held the position with primarily Democraticsupport.     The school bond measure received a vote of 68-to-6 in favorof placing it on the March ballot. The proposal died in the final hours ofthe 1995 session when Republican lawmakers linked their support of schoolbonds to Democratic support for prison bonds.     The $3 billion bond measure for the March ballot wouldprovide more than $2 billion for school rehabilitation and construction and$900 million for improvements to state college and university campuses.     The outcome of the election is somewhat uncertain,especially given voters' current mood to limit government spending and tokeep tax dollars at the local level, instead of sending them to Sacramentoand Washington.     At the forefront of the effort to persuade voters toapprove the school bond measure will be the California State PTA.     "There are a lot of people who are concerned aboutgovernment debt, and it's not a concern to be taken lightly," Betty DeFea,director of legislation for the PTA, acknowledged. "It's like personal andcorporate debt, however. You have to realize what it is you're going intodebt for and then assess whether it's worth the financial risk."     "Schools and children are worth that up-front investment,"she said. "It's wise not to put ourselves in bonded indebtedness foreverything we want, but some things we need."     Education was also a priority reflected in Gov. PeteWilson's proposed $61.5 billion budget, which was announced Jan. 10. Wilsonproposed spending more money on schools, canceling fee increases atcolleges and universities, and providing a tax cut for almost everyCalifornia resident.     The governor is asking Californians to approve $7.8 billionin bond measures to help pay for new schools, prisons, juvenile jails andthe replacement or seismic retrofitting of state roads and bridges.     State Treasurer Matt Fong and Finance Director Russ Gouldwill be going to New York later this month to discuss the state's financialplans, among other matters.     "While infrastructure needs require $7.8 billion inadditional debt, those bonds will be issued by my office in a prudentmanner, balancing the necessities with our ability to pay for them," Fongsaid.     "Californians may be in a better position to take on morebonded debt because our economic outlook remains positive," he said. "Forthe fifth year in a row, revenues exceed general fund expenditures,demonstrating that government spends within its means."     "The investment community does recognize our state'simproving performance. Often our bonds trade at the double A rate, ratherthan at the single A rating," the treasurer said.Back to Headline List WT03-B38-4IA059-000325-B023-3http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi24.html 205.156.212.5 19970115004658 text/html 30271HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 00:44:54 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:05 GMTContent-length: 30082Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi24.html Sample Issue Copyright CARD NEWS via NewsNet January 15, 1990 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FRONT PAGE NEWS TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARD MARKET IN 1990s (1422 words) Squeeze on small issuers (1155 words) STATES NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROM REQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS (348 words) CARDS CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINED OUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION (284 words) BRIEFS *New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and (150 words) *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia (204 words) *March 25-28: 1990 ABA Western Regional Conference for Bank (28 words) *May 19-22: IBAA Bancard's National Credit Card Conference (44 words) *May 29-June 1: Smart Card Applications and Technologies (32 words) BACK PAGE NEWS AIR TRAVEL CARD ADDING INTERNATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR WORLDWIDE PHONE CALL CHARGES (411 words) CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARDMARKET IN 1990s     With the credit card industry now in what has been termed"the third decade of card growth," a new agenda of challengesawaits it.  The coming of the 1990s reinforces the rapid pace atwhich change occurred over the past 10 years and how competitivethe current marketplace has become.     The advances made in electronic processing capabilities inthe 1980s have set the stage for what are expected to be evenmore innovative and flexible payment systems ahead.  "As we buildthose, there will be the ability to offer a variety of paymentmechanisms--whether they be proprietary credit or proprietarydebit or just various other forms of credit programs," LarryMyatt, vice president of marketing and product development atSears Payment Systems Inc., told CARD NEWS.     Despite an electronic environment better able to affectchange, by way of providing more options to retailers andconsumers in a shorter period of time, there is still the need tofine-tune and clarify card product strategies.     The proliferation of products in the 1980s was designed tofit various  customer segments, card enhancements, warrantyprograms, airline discounts and frequent flier programs.     But some of what happened has resulted in major internaldivisions.     "We see every element of the business polarized," Alex Hart,president of MasterCard International, said about bank cards.     The industry is divided between issuers and acquirers, asplit seen as possibly eroding future cooperative efforts,according to an examination of card polarization and consol-idation, prepared by Edgar, Dunn & Conover Inc., the SanFrancisco-based management consulting firm.     An increasing portion of the industry is concentrated amongfewer participants in both the issuing and acquiring segments.Consolidation on the acquiring side has resulted inthe entry of third-party processors with little or no interest inthe issuing side of the business.  Moreover, the proposition thatbanking can retain control of the retail payment system in theupcoming years is very much open to debate.  The largest bankcard processor today by a substantial margin is not a bank butFirst Data Resources, a subsidiary--most troubling of all to bankcard issuers--of American Express.      The top 10 issuers of bank cards in the late 1990s probablywill not be banks, noted David Poe, a principal with Edgar, Dunn& Conover.  Of the top 10 acquirers at present, 4 of theprocessors on the acquiring side of the merchant business accountfor some 45% of the volume in dollars, he said.     In addition, processors have developed innovations aimed atcertain market  segments, such as electronic draft capture (EDC)and low-cost authorization.     Non-bank competitors such as American Express and Sears,Roebuck & Co. are gaining control of more point-of-sale (POS)terminals, as several banks have given up the merchant side ofthe business.     The card system is opening up to yet more competition.Namely, Ford Motor Co., General Electric (GE) Credit, HouseholdBank of Chicago, General Motors, and--potentially posing thegreatest threat of all--American Telephone & Telegraph Co.(AT&T).     The acquiring business is consolidating because of theinability of many banks to remain competitive in the merchantmarketplace.  "Rather than sell their portfolios to their bankingcompetitors, most banks have chosen to sell to non-banks," statedCharles Russell, CEO of Visa U.S.A.     One recent exception to that trend was the acquisition byCiticorp--one of the largest card processors--of the merchantcard business of FCC National Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary ofFirst Chicago Corp.  But many industry analysts think themerchant business will remain within banking only in rareinstances such as this.     Sears Payment Systems recently announced it will process the$60 million private-label card portfolio of Lochmere Inc., aretailer In Woburn, Mass.  Invading others' turfs     Deregulation in the 1980s provided the card industrytremendous freedom with regard to pricing flexibility.  Thedecade saw the emergence of annual and  other fees, competitivepricing, and much pressure on interest rates and annual fees fromnew entrants into the marketplace.     During the period, there were also the first signs ofsaturation, slow growth, and lower response rates to mailings.The merger and acquisition mania also began with Chemical Bank'sacquisition of Continental's card portfolio.   Bank cards begantrying to increase their share of the lucrative travel andentertainment (T&E) market long dominated by American Express,which made its own entree into the large, mainstream retailmarkets.     Another development of the 1980s, the issuing of securitiesbacked by credit card receivables, now accounts for billions ofdollars of securitized assets in this country.     Citicorp, which has securitized close to $8 billion in cardreceivables,  now is offering $750 million in bonds in itslargest overseas issue to date backed by receivables generated inthe United States.  Sears also is considering the distributionoutside the country of its own card outstandings.   In thepresent market, the name of the game is differentiation.  "Ourprime directive is to tailor products and services to meet thespecific consumer's needs," Russell said.     Segmentation became a buzzword in the 1980s as it pertainedto gold, affinity, business and student cards.  There was a newfocus on customer service by the card industry and a growth innational solicitations, spelling the end of only regional andstatewide marketing.     Bank cards now face increasing competition from all sides.In already trying to accommodate the demands of individual marketsegments, bank cards are accepted for payment in supermarkets,fast-food restaurants, movie theaters, parking lots, toll booths,and the health-care industry.  Part of the emphasis here is onspeed in the card authorization and purchase process.     When Sears introduced its Discover card in early 1986, thegrowth of consumer credit was at its peak, noted Carl Steidtmann,vice president for senior management and chief economist atManagement Horizons, a division of Price Waterhouse.     In the realm of differentiated offerings, Discover isselling a cashback feature that no other bank or non-bank cardhas.  Potential new products     But we may be entering a period when a similar opportunityexists for the introduction of new products.  The reason is thatthe burst of activity in the early 1990s probably will be thelast peak of credit growth in the 1990s, Steidtmann pointed out.     Others contend that new product introduction remainsincreasingly diffi-cult.  "We're not in the same cooperativerelationship that we all used to be in when everything was donewithin the banking community," said Poe.     In this decade, many observers say, it will be necessary tobetter understand the data reflecting what is taking place withinthe customer base that bank cards now have.  Financialinstitutions will need information even more to manage the riskof credit cards, noted Donald Auriemma, president of AuriemmaConsulting Group in Garden City, N.Y.     The 1990s will see, for the first time in a decade and ahalf, a rising savings rate, Steidtmann said.  This will happenprimarily for reasons related to demographics.     The savers currently are people between ages 45 and 60.  Thesavings rate did not decline due to tax law changes, individualretirement accounts (IRAs), or even societal greed, Steidtmannsaid.  The real reason was demographics because in the 1980s thenumber of people in the key savings sector went down.  In theprevious decade, the growth of installment credit wasunprecedented, driven largely by the demographics of the time anda fairly stable economic environment.  While the economy atpresent is robust, the 1990s has been projected as an era inwhich unemployment and the demand for credit will fall.     With low unemployment, people from a lower socioeconomiclevel will enter the mainstream of the economy, resulting in anincreased penetration of cards.  Aside from more savings, therewill be more looking for ways to reduce one's own creditexposure, Steidtmann said.  "What previously had gone into debtpayment and into the creation of debt will now go into savings,"he added.      Demographics, to the extent they indicate aturning against the credit culture, pose an unpromising picturefor credit in the 1990s.  The growth ofincome also will have an effect on credit in the new decade.There will be average rates of growth in income but a significantchange in the distribution of income.     The demand for credit will decline, not relatively but inabsolute terms.  Households will not have the same demand forcredit as has been the case.     The issue of market share will become critical to third-party, bank, and proprietary cards.  The 1990s should see areduced demand for proprietary cards with the trend towardreducing credit.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990Squeeze on small issuers     Market share will be the essential component in any AT&Tcredit card product that enters the market.  The share and cardbase that AT&T could draw on, in terms of its calling cardpopulation, represents a huge potential marketing advantage.  Ifthe telecommunications giant offers a cobranded Visa card, forexample, it will most likely be at the expense of the cards thatcardholders already have.     In the 1980s, the growth of private-label credit cards wasnot nearly as great as that of bank cards.  There has been a movewithin the large sector of retailers to come back to private-label cards because of the enhanced marketing  capabilitiesprovided to them, such as target promotions and more informationabout the consumers who buy in their stores.     "Our perspective is that private-label credit cards orproprietary credit cards, merchants' own programs, probably willnot grow in terms of total numbers of accounts, as far as thebank card market will grow in the next few years," observed LarryMyatt of Sears Payment Systems.  Third-party bank cards     However, he thinks there is good growth prospect for thosethird-party processors--like Sears Payment--in devising privatelabel programs for merchants, as retailers look at the costsassociated with operating their own programs.  Therefore, a shiftfrom in-house to third-party operated programs is expected.     Those who maintain their own credit card system in-house nowwill look to third-party processors for other ways of maintainingthat capability because of the costs of new systems andequipment.  There is expected to be more movement  toward third-party processors maintaining the retailer card base than anychanges in or out of the private label business.     If strategic alliances can be formed between both creditofferers and retailers, the opportunity may be created for third-party offerings to develop  in the arena of bank card credit.This is probably the one component of the industry that willexperience growth in the 1990s, due to its ability to offer manyof the benefits of a proprietary card at the cost of a bank card,according to Steidtmann.     Such alliances will have to be based on joint marketing, onproviding information through the channel of distribution, thequality of service, the ability to bring customers to a retailerwho would not go there otherwise, and on a much less expensiveeconomic model.     This outcome is not likely to come about unless the view ofcredit and retail executives toward credit moves from competitionand confrontation to one of cooperation, Myatt added.     In terms of other payment mechanisms, many observers see anenormous untapped market for debit cards at the point of sale--inthe form of proprietary debit, automated clearing house (ACH)debit or direct debit.     ACH debit is expected to be a very active means of paymentin the 1990s, Myatt said.  Part of its implementation was delayedover the controversy in-volving Entree, the national POS debitmark that MasterCard and Visa had been jointly developing.     An antitrust lawsuit filed last summer by the attorneysgeneral in New York and in 12 states has stalled that programindefinitely, if not permanently.     ACH debit has been touted as a national debit card operatedthrough a bank card-like mechanism, as Entree was proposed to be.In addition, American Express or Discover could offer thisproduct with their own cards.     The other ACH vehicle is private-label debit, in which theretailer itself--California's Vons Supermarket is one example--isthe card issuer.  In the 1980s, the financial and retail sectorswere hesitant about whether banks would take the lead in debitcards or if that drive would be spearheaded by individualretailers.     It makes sense from a consumer standpoint to be able to havea debit card that can be used at a variety of retailestablishments, Myatt told us.     "Frankly, we have a lot of concerns about ACH-drivenproducts unless they are bank controlled and bank driven," saidMasterCard's Hart.     The origin of a proprietary debit environment is akin toprivate-label credit cards in that the objective is thegeneration of additional sales volume and added customerconvenience.   Proponents see private-label debit making sense insupermarkets where a lot of checks are now written, and atgasoline stations where there already exist examples ofproprietary debit cards.  New decade's trends     Some of the trends in the 1990s will no doubt becontinuations of existing  developments.  Insiders stress thatthe card industry must know the true net costs when features areadded to cards or efforts are made to attract different customersegments.  Additionally, the industry will require better productand customer profitability information, and it is looking towardthe development of systems that allow making those kinds ofdeterminations.     Further segmentation of card products needs to be in termsof segregating  between convenience users and revolvers.Questions to be addressed include  whether to increase spendingallowed on a credit limit, and permitting the use of a card on amonthly basis as a charge card--with a line of credit still thefoundation for an account.     The 1990s are certain to bring a substantial increase innon-bank card competition.  JCB, Japan's largest bank-issuedcredit card, is seeking to be-come a major world player and toincrease its merchant network outside Japan.     The card already is moving to overtake Diners Club.  JCB canoffer the card electronically, can come in and negotiate with arelatively few processors and reach a large percentage of retailestablishments.     One new product likely to emerge in the future is a coinreplacement card, or possibly a pre-paid card, for handling smalltransactions.     From all indications, there is strong interest in the UnitedStates in chip technology and, specifically, in the integratedcircuit chip capabilities of smart cards.  Unlike in Japan andEurope, the cards have no proximity to their source in the UnitedStates, and have been more difficult to implement. Smart cardsoffer potentially many variables and, for that reason, U.S. banksare less inclined to agree on the direction in which to proceed,noted Kevin Wilby, vice president of the retail transactiondivision at Business Modeling Techniques Inc. (BMT) in Rochester,N.Y.  On top of that, the first demand in this country would befor the institution of smart card standards--which poses a muchmore difficult task than the magnetic stripe that reflects astandard format, he said.     Consolidation and internationalization in the industry isexpected to continue, with more pressure to process transactionsinexpensively.  Besides controlling operating expenses, manyofficials see a need for behavioral scoring at the point of saleto minimize the number of declines in the system.  Theenhancement of this intelligence at the point of sale will be afactor in controlling credit losses.     Aside from network and communications enhancements tosupport this new level of intelligence in database management,the focus will continue on making investments in systems and onthe maximizing of efficiencies.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROMREQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS     A new law that took effect last week in New York state,reportedly the first of its kind in the nation, prohibitsmerchants from requiring customers to put their address ortelephone number on sales slips when making purchases by creditcard.     This controversial practice--along with that of recordingcredit card numbers on personal checks when a purchase is made bycheck--has been sharply criticized by consumer advocates, whohave maintained that merchants are exposing customers topotential fraud and are violating their personal privacy (CN,Oct. 30, 1989, p. 1).     The state law will "address the unauthorized disseminationof personal information," said Daniel Feldman, a stateassemblyman who sponsored the bill.  He also introducedlegislation last year that mandated carbonless credit card formsin New York.     While both the Visa and MasterCard associations appeareduneasy over con-sumers being made to write their card number, itsexpiration date and a phone number on checks, they have focusedmore attention on ending the requirement by  merchants that acardholder's phone number be written on a credit card sales draftin order to complete a card transaction.     The Bankcard Holders of America (BHA), a Herndon, Va.-basedconsumer education group, has urged the 2 bankcard associationsand the National Retail Merchants Association (NRMA), amongothers, to clarify and enforce policies to bar the current check-cashing policies of merchants.     Visa and MasterCard spokesmen have said the associationshave a limited ability to take action in response to these checkacceptance procedures.  The bank card industry has rules in placeto protect itself against liability for the use of a credit cardto pay for returned checks.     A number of merchants in the state were convincing customersthat their address and phone number were necessary to make creditcard purchases, Feldman  said, when the information actually wasbeing used to compile mailing lists.    One exception to the lawis that merchants who do not have the capability to verify acustomer's card electronically may still ask for a customer'saddress or phone number.  The penalty for violations of the lawis $250.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINEDOUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION     The Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), the Delaware affiliate ofChase Manhattan Bank, will acquire the credit card portfolio ofBank of Boston Corp. and its affiliate, Bank of BostonConnecticut.  In addition, Chase has acquired the majority of thecredit card portfolio of Investors Savings Bank of Richmond, Va.     The combined outstandings of the MasterCard and Visaportfolios represent  $660 million.  The Bank of Boston portfoliohas $625 million in outstandings, and the outstanding balances ofInvestors portfolio are approximately $35 million.     Last year, Chase also purchased the portfolios of MichiganNational Bank, Meritor Financial Group of Philadelphia, andLeader Federal Savings Bank in Memphis, Tenn.     Bank of Boston, in a move similar to the response of otherNew England institutions to the region's slumping real estatemarket, said it would write off about $300 million in loans forthe final quarter of 1989 and set aside about $280 million forother possible losses.  But the company predicted it would breakeven in the fourth quarter and earn a $145 million profit for1989, due in part to its decision to sell its credit cardbusiness, which has 675,000 cardholders.     Bank officials said the card business, while profitable,would drain financial resources that the bank would rather puttoward marketing other consumer products such as home equity,residential mortgages and education loans.     The Investors portfolio includes approximately 40,000MasterCard and Visa accounts.  The institution also has enteredinto an agent bank agreement with Chase under which it willcontinue to offer credit cards bearing the Investors name andlogo to its customers throughout Virginia.  In the future, theaccounts of Investors' existing card customers will be servicedby Chase with no disruption in service.Back to Headline List CopyrightCARD NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990*New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and*New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus andrail system, will allow commuters to use creditcards to pay for tickets starting in the fall.

Unlike the cardassociations, which are pushing stored-value applications, AmericanExpress has installed T&E (green or gold card), Optima and corporateaccounts on one card. Future applications might include electronicpurse and loyalty programmes, according to a source familiar with theprogramme.The microprocessor chip cards are produced by Solaic, a division ofFrench-based Group Sligos, and smart card terminals will be provided byUS manufacturer VeriFone and French producer Dassault Electronique.During the pilot, about 30 to 100 cards are being tested by employees.At the point of sale, a consumer inserts his/her card into a reader/pinpad, enters a personal code and selects to which account the purchasewill be billed. American Express' back office has already certified theVeriFone Omni460 base terminal and the SC450 smart card peripheral.The card is accepted at the company cafeteria but the test will beexpanded to include other sites within the World Financial Center, asource said. A table-service restaurant at headquarters will also testportable terminals manufactured by Dassault.American Express confirmed that since before Christmas, it has beenoperating a small employee test of a multi-application smart credit andcharge card. Fewer than 50 cards were involved, she said, emphasisingthat it was not a significant event in the opinion of the company.American Express has taken a leadership position within the Smart CardForum, a US-based multi-industry group set up to advocate thedevelopment of smart card systems.

Explaining the rationale behind thisstrategy, Felicitas Mozo-Dimaano who heads LandBank's card business,said that there is a large well of "cardable people" who can be tapped.The LandBank Visa card entitles cardholders to savings on utility billswhen they use the card. In terms of settlement of their outstandingaccounts, special payment features allow cardholders to opt forpayments for costly items worth over P2,000 to be made in three-monthlyincrements, up to 24 months.In addition, a payment scheme known as Lite Payment Option, allowscardholders to make partial payment of their account of at least 10percent of their monthly purchases and cash advances. Cardholders canalso withdraw up to P20,000 a day from the bank's ATMs and ATMs fromthe Megalink-run network.PVB Visa cardThe Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), one of the Philippines' newestbanks, has also entered the credit card issuing business. An agreementwith Equitable Credit Card Network, an affiliate of Equitable Banking,has allowed the bank to issue a Visa card by using the former's cardprocessing capabilities in its card issuing business.PVB, a private commercial bank owned by 500,000 World War Two veterans,started operations in August 1992. It issues the Classic and theVeteran Gold Card, catering to both the middle and upscale markets.Existing playersAs competition increases, some of the more established players arelooking to consolidate their positions by introducing new products orenhancing existing ones. Bank of the Philippine Islands, one of the topfive issuers, is to roll out the BPI MasterCard later this month.As for its standard Burgundy card, this will receive a revamp and willbe relaunched to carry a longer repayment period, and a lower minimumpayment of 5 percent of monthly balances. In addition, the bank willcontinue to run its successful"Frequent User, Sure Winner" bonuspoint/incentive programme until mid-1996.Citibank, which has 300,000 cards in issue, is banking on its enhancedcustomer service to keep its top position in the market. The bank,which claimed to have achieved a 91 percent score in terms of overallsatisfaction of its customers, has recently introduced the 24-hourCiticard Banking Center which offers a wide range of banking and creditcard transactions.Meanwhile, the Far East Bank and Trust Company introduced a newinstalment plan for holders of the FarEastCard. The low interest planoffers cardholders an instalment limit equivalent to three times theirregular credit limit, up to a maximum of P150,000. In addition, thebank will waive interest on the first instalment payment.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Statistics also indicatedthat mail-order purchases registered a corresponding increase, but at afaster pace of 82.7 percent, reaching S$409,000.The international card association said that its analysis of a numberof sectors, including travel and entertainment, retail and serviceswhich comprised health care, education, etc, showed that card spendingon all sectors experienced year-on-year growth in 1995.The fastest growth was recorded by the service sector which grew by 31percent, growing from S$3 million in 1994 to S$3.9 million in 1995.Trailing behind were the travel and entertainment and retail sectorswhich grew by 13 percent and 12 percent respectively.Overall T&E spending in 1994 was S$9.3 million, which jumped to S$10million in 1995. The retail sector grew from S$17.3 million in 1994 toS$19.4 million in 1995.A breakdown of the retail and services sectors showed that growth washelped by increases in hardware purchases and spending on educationwhich expanded dramatically by 127 percent and 190 percentrespectively.MASTERCARD CHRISTMAS SPENDING - DEC 10-DEC 23              1994                   1995              Transaction    % of    Transaction    % of      %              Amount ($/m)   Total   Amount ($/m)   Total     GrowthT&E            9.31          30.96   10.4           30.49     12.11Retail        17.3           57.6    19.4           56.64     11.9Services       3              9.9     3.9           11.4      30.84Total         30.9            -      34.25           -        13.41Source: MasterCard InternationalCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

According to the survey, only 20percent of the 3 million Bahncard holders have opted for the paymentfunction which has been on offer since last July.It is three years since Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railwaysoperator, introduced the Bahncard, which costs DM220 ($153) and offershalf-price travel for a year.The product quickly attracted a customer base of more than 3 millionand so impressed the banks that they competed vigorously to provide apayment function: Citibank was finally selected as the Bahn'sco-branding partner and agreed to offer either a Visa or an Electronchip at no additional charge.Citibank acknowledged from the start of the marketing campaign lastJuly that the deal would be profitable only if cross-selling activitieswere successful. Since revolving credit is scarcely used, and there isno annual fee for the card, Citibank had no prospects of generatingadequate revenue from the card itself.The bank estimated that 50 percent of existing Bahncard holders wouldopt for either Electron or Visa functions and that 1.5 million to 2million new customers would be won. But Handelsblatt's survey indicatesthat the past six months have fallen far short of those goals.Citibank is refusing to comment on the Handelsblatt survey and alsodeclines to produce its own figures on the "improved" Bahncard, arguingthat the marketing campaign got off to a slow start. Deutsche Bahncommented that the marketing figures could not be analysed properlyuntil the product had been on the market for 12 months.The marketing campaign hit problems from the start. Citibank signed thedeal with Deutsche Bahn on the assumption that all cards wouldautomatically carry either the Electron or the Visa function. But afterprotests from consumer groups, Citibank said the payment option wouldbe provided only if customers expressly asked for them.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Visa has been awarded processing rights to Gesellschaft furZahlungssysteme (GZS), the Eurocard/MasterCard processing centre inGermany.In return, processing houses in the Visa camp, such as B+SKartenservice may process Eurocard/MasterCard payments, although thiswas previously the sole preserve of the GZS.The deal is regarded as a triumph for the GZS, which recognised sometime ago that it would in future have to compete with its member banksand their affiliates for card processing work. The bank-ownedorganisation responded by investing in new processing systems - andapplying for a Visa processing licence.Traditionally, most German banks issued Eurocard/MasterCard cards only,while Visa issuers such as BfG Bank and Berliner Bank were very muchthe exception. But now a number of institutions are offering bothEurocard/MasterCard and Visa. For the processing houses, this is achance to win the processing contracts for both Visa andEurocard/MasterCard, but also carries the risk of losing existingbusiness.The Visa deal is effectively an admission by the GZS that it is nowcompeting with its own member banks for processing contracts and can nolonger afford to exist on Eurocard/MasterCard business alone.In recent months most large banking groups have established some sortof processing capability and, as a result, some savings banks(Sparkassen) are reported to have cancelled their processing agreementswith GZS altogether.But the GZS believes the capability to process both Visa and Eurocardpayments will be crucial in future."Dual processing capability will bea benchmark for measuring the success or failure of card processinghouses," a statement said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It then plans to take it to national roll-out in Julyto be available in all 160 of its stores.According to Ingrid Bosman, direct marketing manager for the ClicksClubcard, the card is "South Africa's first true loyalty card". Beforethe launch, Click's management researched the success of direct loyaltycards in the UK, France, Spain and the US.Since August 31 1995, 200,000 cards have been given free to customersand it is expected that this figure will rise to 400,000-600,000 laterthis year."Customers can't use the card for payments, it's purely for collectingpoints," Bosman said. One point is given for every R5 ($1.40) spentwith a minimum of a R10 spend. After three months, if the customer hascollected 50 points, then discounts may be given from 5 percent offcosmetics and jewellery to 2 percent off all other purchases."The discounts are the direct benefit to customers after three months,"Bosman said. Other advantages include cardholders receiving the ClicksChristmas catalogue before general release, information on specialsales and promotions and new product launches.South African retailer Dions had a similar loyalty store card a fewyears ago but this was discontinued."In South Africa there are a lot ofprivate label credit cards and some of them are incurring debt, so wedidn't want this problem. We want to use the card as a marketing tooland not be bogged down with maintenance," Bosman said.Interested customers can fill out their enrolment forms in-store wherethey are given a card number for immediate use. The card is then putthrough the cashier's till when paying for purchases and the cardnumber is linked to that sale. The card supplier to Clicks is BN CardTechnologies of Johannesburg.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It will initiallybe offered to selected customers of Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi withthree other Turkish banks coming on stream later this year.According to Derya Goknar, Europay's operations manager for EastEurope, "as time passed it became more difficult to differentiatebetween Gold and Classic cardholders. So we thought we would recreatethe distinction with the Signia card. We believe that in the next threeyears, 3,000 Signia cards will be issued."Europay already has 400,000 MasterCard cards in Turkey of which 55,000are Gold cards. It also has 2 million Cirrus/Maestro cards issued byits 22 member banks."Signia is not just a card product but is being positioned as a privatebanking product," Mehmet Sezgin, Europay's regional business managerfor Turkey, told CI. He added that about five Turkish banks areactively researching ways to offer private banking to their selectedclients. "Signia is the first product offered by those banks wanting toget into private banking and as such is the first product of its kindon the Turkish market," Sezgin said.A minimum credit limit of $50,000 is required in order to become acardholder and each application must be approved by the bank's board ofdirectors."Our market research in the last year-and-a-half gave a positiveoutcome. Yes, there is a market for the Signia card. The packagingaround Gold cards has not been successful and this has been eroding thehigher market segment for Visa and MasterCard," Sezgin added. Hemaintained that Eurocard/MasterCard cards have a transaction value 35percent higher than on Visa cards.It is expected that the annual fee will be set at $500 with an interestrate of 16 percent monthly. Inflation in Turkey is currently running athigher than 100 percent.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

TheEurocard-branded card is said to be generating three times as manysales as other credit cards.The card was launched in March 1995 and allows cardholders toaccumulate points which can be redeemed against the purchase of a Fiatcar or other services, such as Lufthansa flights.Roberto Culasso, product manager responsible for the Targa card at SanPaolo di Torino, said: "The product was the idea of Europay and wasinspired by the General Motors card. It has proved highly suited to theItalian market."The average annual expenditure on the Targa card was running at L2.5million ($1,500) and L3 million. At the end of last year, we estimatedthat average spending on the Targa card was L7 million to L8 million.The definitive figure will not be available until March this year, butI would not be surprised if it was higher than our current estimates,"Culasso said.Meanwhile, the number of Targa cards in issue passed the 100,000 markand additional partners are expected to join the points scheme,bringing the figure to about ten.Europay International pointed to the success of the card to illustratethe wisdom of its decision to work with the Italian banks."Targatypifies Europay's approach in Italy, where we are to committed toworking closely with the banks. We feel this is more effective thanmerely promoting our brand," said Gaetano Carboni, senior area managerin Southern Europe for Europay.Recent figures from Europay show that the Italian market is finallyshowing signs of growth. Transaction volume for credit and debit cardsin the Europay stable increased by 21 percent in 1995, while the numberof payments went up by 31 percent.The number of Europay products increased by 15 percent last year, withthe number of debit cards rising to 3.6 million and credit cards goingto 754,000.Visa, however, continues to dominate the market, with 4.7 million debitand credit cards in circulation and transaction volume of $7 billion.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Its logo is to appear as it does on theInternational Carte Bleue Visa card (at the bottom, on the right, justabove the hologram).The new design is an integral part of the Groupement Carte Bleuestrategy designed to relaunch the Carte Bleue brand in synergy with theprint advertising campaign launched last autumn in national magazines(See CI 142).The redesigning of the domestic-only Carte Bleue card appears as one ofthe major plans in support of the Groupement Carte Bleue's pressadvertising campaign in the national magazines, said the company. Infact, the overall design of the cards belonging to the Carte Bleuerange has to follow a certain logic and be coherent with the clearlydefined brand policy, it added.In addition to the appearance of the Carte Bleue logo on the front ofthe card and to the increased amount of space available for bankbranding, the other components of the changed design are as follows:- the horizontal hologram in the middle of the card is to become asquare hologram in the right-hand column, as on international cards,with the original design: this new hologram will appear on all Frenchbank cards designed for domestic use;- the CB logo, symbol of interoperability and of acceptance amongFrench retailers, will occupy the space at the top, on the right, abovethe hologram.Jean-Marc Bornet, chief executive of Groupement Carte Bleue, told CI:"This change in the visual aspect of the Carte Bleue Nationale (aproduct already in use among nearly 5 million customers), is part ofthe Groupement's long-term policy of concentrating the range of cardson the Carte Bleue brand, which is greatly appreciated by Frenchpeople."This focusing on Carte Bleue as well as the greatly increasedco-operation with Visa are the two poles of a policy designed toimprove the Carte Bleue members' profits through the increase in thevalue of their products".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It has also become one of the leading issuers of MasterCardcorporate cards in the US with 127,000 cards.The Illinois-based finance company initiated corporate card programmesfor its co-branding partners, including General Motors and two of itssubsidiaries, Electronic Data Services and Hughes Corporation.Household also issues cards for Ameritech, Palomar Products, and foritself.As part of the exclusive partnership, Carlson will market its cards tomultinational corporations based in the US starting this quarter, toEuropean countries in the second quarter and in Asia and elsewhere in1997. Household Limited, a credit card bank in the UK, gives thecompany a foothold in Europe. Carlson Wagonlit operates the CarlsonTravel Network, AT Mays in the UK and Viajes Ecuador in Spain.The Household deal is also a victory at the expense of First BankSystems, which was Carlson's co-brand partner from 1993. Thatrelationship ended in December. First Bank remains the leader amongbank T&E card issuers with 575,000 commercial cards and 250,000purchasing cards branded by Visa. American Express, however, dominatesthe commercial T&E market with more than 7 million cards.Carlson Wagonlit, which is based in Minneapolis and Paris reported $12billion in sales last year with 4,000 locations in 125 countries. Theagency will contribute its extensive corporate client list and itstravel service.A Household spokesman said the companies had created a fully integratedreporting package that goes beyond turnkey software provided byMasterCard.Co-branded corporate cards are a rarity, since T&E cards do not earninterest income from revolvers and so do not generate the same profitdynamics as consumer credit cards.Wells Fargo Bank and Cincinnati-based Star Bank last year introducedcommercial cards with travel rewards built in, but neither involved aleading player such as Carlson.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This stands for Citibank South Dakota, one of the New York Citymoney centre's issuing banks.Citibank has solicited customers with an unbranded Visa gold card thatmakes no mention of the bank, with the exception of some fine printamong the terms and conditions.   The offer represents a major shift instrategy for a bank that has heavily promoted its name for years. But abank spokeswoman denied that Citibank was changing its long-termstrategy of promoting the bank brand."It's not a strategy but rather a test to reaffirm how important thebrand is. We do things like this to gauge customer reactions," shesaid. The bank regards the test as being no different than offeringdifferent combinations of fee, service and interest rates to differentcustomers.In 1986, Citibank purchased the Choice card programme which featured arate lower than the standard Citibank Visa card but without any extrabenefits. It was offered to customers with exceptional credit recordsin the era shortly before the upsurge in competition.The CBSD card offered a 4.9 percent teaser rate for six months, noannual fee and up to $15,000 credit limit. The rate increased to 5.4percent above prime.In recent months, Citibank has invested more heavily in its cardsbusiness, which began growing in the latter half of 1995 after severalyears of stagnation. It has also been promoting its name in new ways,dropping its familiar Citibank Visa advertisements in favour of thebank name alone.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It plans to solicit theremainder of its portfolio by offering the same value-added rewardsprogramme for a fee.The result is a seven-tier rewards scheme whereby cardholders canredeem points accumulated through charge activity. The programme, whichfeatures rewards offered by retail, travel and dining partners, mirrorsone offered by its UK-based parent Midland Bank.Peter Davidson, executive vice president and head of consumer bankingat Marine Midland said it is essential to retain lucrative customersalready on the books. "The approach we take in customer management isone of determining who our most profitable customers are anddetermining what it is that attracts those people," he said.Marine Midland divides its portfolio into four categories of revenuegeneration: highly profitable; moderately profitable; marginallyprofitable, or those which cover variable costs; and the unprofitable,which do not cover fixed or variable costs.Davidson said Marine Midland is looking to "put a wall up" around itscore customers. "In most cases, 20 percent of the portfolio generates100 percent of the profits," he said. Those accounts that are marginalor unprofitable should be charged fees or higher rates to either makethem more profitable or encourage the customers to close their account.Because of the fierce competition in the market, it may be very costlyto replace one good customer. "If you have a highly profitablecustomer, that customer may generate upwards of $300, $400 or $500 ayear for the bank. To lose one of those, you might need ten averagecustomers. If you could spend on an existing account what you would ona new account, then that is well worth your while."The MarineAdvantage programme also addresses the attrition ofvalue-conscious customers, those who have been lured away by co-brandedschemes. "We already addressed the needs of price conscious and serviceconscious customers," he said.Marine Midland consumer research found cardholders preferred fun orout-of-the-ordinary rewards, and rewards that are attainable soonerrather than later. This self-branded programme is administered byMaritz of Missouri, a third party that developed card-based employeeincentive programmes.Davidson also said Marine Midland will test ways of getting rid ofunprofitable customers in the second quarter of this year. "Oneapproach is to price them, to the point where they accept the terms orleave - a $50, $75 or $100 fee," he said.All of this suggests that Marine Midland, too, hopes to tap into thebooming credit card business. The bank is just starting to make a dentin the marketplace, growing its loans by $300 million last year to $1.8billion in receivables, placing it among the 30 largest US portfolios."We see cards as a very profitable product, when managed properly, andwe feel it is still a growth business, what with the new uses that arecoming about."Still, Davidson acknowledged several danger signs that have emerged atthe end of 1995: a dip in consumer confidence and a slight rise inpersonal bankruptcies and charge-off rates."It may be time to be alittle cautious and concentrate on finding the best customers that areout there in the marketplace, given signs that the economy perhaps issoftening a little bit. I don't think there are any disasters out thereyet, but it's a good time to be prudent."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"Byall appearances, it's a win-win-win situation for Ford, Citibank andtheir marketing partners," said Bruce Brittain, president of theconsultancy."We have seen a net 7 percent growth in the number of accounts in thepast 12 months and evidence that their revolvers are carrying largerbalances. These are healthy signs for the portfolio," Brittain said.In a separate survey, Brittain also noted that American Express' OptimaTrue Grace has grown 45 percent since April or an additional 500,000accounts. The study suggested that American Express is reaching ayounger, less affluent segment than its traditional business.Meanwhile, the quietly successful General Electric Rewards card mayhave declined as much as 20 percent in the same six month period.Brittain says that once again, changes to the card's rebate schemestrigger cardholder behaviour. In this case, rebates were remitted as anannual cheque starting July 1995, rather than coupons to be used withmarketing partners. If a programme change is to blame, Brittainexplained, then he expects the portfolio numbers to rebound in thecoming months.Petrol rebate cards continue to perform well. Chemical Bank's Shell Oilcard enjoyed a 15 percent increase in accounts in the last nine months.Virtually all of the accounts are new to Chemical's portfolio (soon tobe called Chase Manhattan) and two-thirds were already Shellproprietary customers who were converted.According to the survey, the GE Exxon card has only attracted 250,000cards in its first year, a quarter of the size of the Shell programmeafter the same duration. Brittain found that Exxon, unlike Shell, didnot market the card to its entire proprietary portfolio.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Joseph A Giannone reportsWITH ADVERTISING and other marketing channels growing increasinglycluttered, credit card issuers and organisations are seeking toincrease their profile through sponsorship of major events. Sportingevents are being selected to market cards and the brands as well as tapinto some of the enthusiasm fans have for their sports.Exclusivity does not come cheap, however. According to IEG SponsorshipReport, a newsletter covering the sponsorship trade, Visa Internationalspent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights on theNational Football League, the Elton John tour and some destinationdeals.MasterCard is spending $10 million to $15 million towards the soccerWorld Cup in 1998, the National Hockey League and several golfcompetitions. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 millionin relation to World Cup 1994.Card sponsorships took off in 1984 when American Express was a leadingsponsor to the Olympics, according to Jim Andrews of IEG, a consultancyspecialising in sponsorships. But in 1988 Visa took over leadsponsorship and has subsequently generated great success by exploitingits exclusive sponsorship rights.Sponsorship activity grew heated this year, as the two associations andAmerican Express each landed one among three major sports leagues. InApril 1995, Visa announced its deal with the National Football Leaguewith an estimated value of $50 million over five years. Visa thissummer created tie-ins as the official card of Triple Crown horseracing.American Express in May signed on with the National Basketball League,paying $30 million for three years. It also signed a sponsorship dealwith the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of TexasStadium, though Visa has rights bestowed by the league.The most recent industry deal was scored by MasterCard in December witha four-year, $2 million exclusive deal with the National Hockey League.MasterCard is touting its gold cards at several title golf tournaments,such as the PGA Grand Slam and the Colonial.Likewise, the NHL hockey and NASCAR automobile racing circuit will beused to promote standard cards. Three more golf title sponsorships arepending, a MasterCard spokeswoman said.Visa and MasterCard continued their worldwide sponsorship commitments.Visa paid $40 million for the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.MasterCard seized on World Cup soccer as a global marketing platform.It paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 championships in France,according to IEG. A four-year package of associated sponsorshipsleading up to the games is worth $40 million.Credit card groups are not alone in seizing on sponsorship as a new wayof doing business, according to Jim Andrews, an IEG vice president.Sponsorship spending will top $5.4 billion in the US next year, 15percent more than the $4.7 billion projected to be spent in 1995.Sponsorships have become popular as a rallying point for everything acompany does. For MasterCard and Visa, the World Cup and Olympics haveformed the cornerstone promotions used by members as well as theassociations."In sponsorships, it's not just what you have, it's what you do withit," said Mava Heffler, MasterCard senior vice president in charge ofsponsorships. MasterCard, she said, has expanded its soccer sponsorshipto include a broadcast television soccer report and markets the brandas host of smaller events leading up to the World Cup championships."The current level of activity can be traced to the Olympics, in termsof what it has done for sponsors in a number of ways. Companies havefound that whenever they ran promotions to make donations to the teams,their usage went up," Andrews said.The big winner in all of this, though, may be Delaware-based MBNAAmerica, the second-largest bank card issuer in the US and king ofaffinity credit cards. At the same time as Visa secured the NFL spot,MBNA was chosen as the issuer for 30 professional football franchises.Likewise, MBNA has been tapped by MasterCard to issue cards for all 26hockey teams.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCARDS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996ADVANTA LOOKS AT GLOBAL EXPANSIONAdvanta Corporation, one of the fastest growing credit card issuers inthe US, is getting serious about reproducing its success in othercountries. Joseph A Giannone reportsADVANTA IS joining the swelling ranks of US non-bank credit cardissuers that are expanding beyond national boundaries. Last year,Advanta formed a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland to issuecards in the UK. And that, according to Advanta International head JimAllhusen, is just the beginning."International business will be a key part of corporate expansion andit will be a major part of our strategy. We plan to be opportunisticwhen we find markets that are inefficient or stagnant," Allhusen said.Within the US, the limited-purpose credit card issuer based nearPhiladelphia has jumped into the elite top 20 while it continues tooutperform the industry. Advanta managed $11.9 billion in assets at theend of the third quarter, making it the 13th-largest issuer in the US.In the first nine months of 1995, the company added 1 million newaccounts for a total of more than 4 million.The company, which has its roots in making loans to educators inPennsylvania, has recruited several industry luminaries withinternational credentials. Most notably, former MasterCardInternational chief executive Alex "Pete" Hart joined in 1994 and wassubsequently named CEO of the company.Hart has since lured two association colleagues to join him: ArthurKranzley, formerly head of MasterCard's worldwide debit business, whocame on board in the autumn.Earlier this month, the company hired Hung-Fu "Hank" Chiang, who lefthis post as general manager of MasterCard China. Chiang also had workedwith Hart at First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles.Chiang, an American of Chinese descent, will report to James Allhusen,an executive vice president in charge of Advanta International, anewly-formed group. Allhusen, who ran consumer banking and cards forStandard Chartered Bank, came on board last year. His career includesstints in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.Allhusen noted that Hart, Chiang and he all have expertise and contactsin Asian markets. He said people were now in place to develop an Asianstrategy. When asked if a China strategy were in place at Advanta,Allhusen replied, "No, not yet."But company executives speak openly of plans for global expansion byway of joint ventures with indigenous partners in certain high-growthmarkets. Unlike Citibank, MBNA or Household International, which haveset up issuing banks in target markets, Advanta will seek to createventures with like-minded banks as it did with Royal Bank of Scotlandlast year."We believe Advanta has skills within the company which have made itvery successful in the US. We see opportunities in foreign markets touse those same skills to our advantage. My job is to find out whichskills are most transportable across borders and to find partners wecould work with in those markets," said Allhusen, naming RBS as anexample.Royal Bank, he said, "is just as committed to the success of theproposition, has a strong image, a strong brand and an infrastructureto support a cards operation. What we bring is a number of skills thathave not yet been developed in the UK market."In recent months, Advanta has been more aggressive in seekingpublicity, another sign that the company seeks recognition as a leadingcards player.Allhusen said the increase is coincidental, since the company recentlyhas had much to proclaim. Advanta has a motive in trying to earn thefavour of Wall Street to boost its share price, a tactic recentlyemployed by First USA. News of international expansion could helprectify a depressed price-earnings ratio of 12.5, which according toAllhusen is"lower than it ought to be."Along with the other pure plays, Advanta's Class A stock took a plungeat the end of December, dropping to $38 per share from an October highof $49.According to analysts pure play companies such as Advanta, which derivealmost 100 percent of their revenues from credit cards, have sufferedfrom recent reports that make gloomy predictions for the future. In thelast few quarters, charge offs and personal delinquency rates havecrept upward on average, though individually Advanta's loss experiencehas been better than the industry as a whole.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS                                  Three months    Nine months                                  ended Sept 30   ended Sept 30                                  1995   1994     1995   1994Net revenues ($/m) *                 151   114      431    321**Net Income ($/m)                      35    27       99     77Earnings per common share ($)       0.81  0.65     2.35   1.88Return on equity (%)               24.88 26.47    26.08  27.13Total managed assets ($)          11,938 7,627Book value per common share ($)    13.49 10.51*  The amortisation of credit card DAC, net of deferred fees, is nowincluded in operating expenses and has been reclassified from netinterest for 1994.** Excludes $18.4 million gain on sale of credit card relationships.Source: Advanta CorporationCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The St. Petersburg-based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured productslike checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank willmarket home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might becomethe nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEOof Raymond James Bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically andelectronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial servicesso all (customers') financial services can be received from our firm," shesaid.     The bank's initial target market will be the securitiescompany's hefty customer base of some 300,000 clients.     "We'll be able to offer our clients several productchoices. We have the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweepaccount) option, and the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstadexplained. The Heritage funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.     The company will continue its tradition of not providingadditional incentive to brokers selling top proprietary products."Compensation is consistent for all three product options," Schefstad said.This compensation practice appears to have worked to the detriment of theHeritage fund family, where growth of the individual funds has fallenbehind other brokerage house proprietary funds, despite the company'snationwide branch network.     Schefstad said that James is the only broker/dealer towholly own a full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, whichmust resort to the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the bankingbusiness, James purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of$12 million from the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the companychartered the Raymond James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate inall 50 states.     The bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million inassets and $136 million in deposits.     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has beenwrestling with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies andintegrating the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.     "Because of who owns us, we've had to obtain regulatoryapproval for everything we've done. For example, when we developed ourconsolidated statement, we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosurepolicy and separation of accounts," Schefstad said.     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near itsheadquarters in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank'sefforts taking place electronically, particularly through the nationwideautomated teller machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATMhas yet to gain wide acceptance, but Schefstad said the firm's brokerageclients are sophisticated enough to understand and use direct-depositoptions available through the automated clearing house system.--John J.JedlickaBack to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SECOND PUERTO RICAN DEAL CAPS DECEMBER CALENDAREying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Ricobecame the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt inDecember.     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100million offering of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basispoints over Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. Thenotes, which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language,enabling a public-style execution of the offering without registration atthe Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resultedfrom S&P rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie Astor,chief financial officer.     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low ratesin December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank toissue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's firstindependent bond offering.     Jefferies & Co. captured the leading underwriting positionon the deal because of  its relationship with the bank, and Smith BarneyInc. acted as co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15insurance companies.     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part bythe bank's phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has hadan average return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since thebank's initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciatedin value by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billionasset bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter lastyear.     The deal for First Bank follows a first-time subordinatedoffering by another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in themonth. BanPonce Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in10-year subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparableTreasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston (see CFO Alert12/11/95, P.5)Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SUSQUEHANNA ADDING DEBT TO EQUITY TO FUND ACQUISITIONSeeking to fund its expansion efforts, SusquehannaBancshares Inc. recently issued shares of common stock and is prepping anoffering of senior notes that is expected to hit the market at the end ofJanuary.     "We're in the process of acquiring a thrift in Maryland for$63 million, and we don't have that cash on hand," said J. Stanley Mull,vice president of the Treasury at Susquehanna. The acquisition of FairfaxCorp., located in Baltimore, follows the thrift acquisitions last April ofAtlantic Federal Savings Bank and Reisters Town Federal Savings Bank.     Including the greenshoe option, a total of 1.495 millionshares were issued at $26.50 per share, or $25.31 after underwriting fees,for proceeds of $37.8 million, Mull said. Oppenheimer & Co. led theoffering, followed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. and Legg Mason WoodWalker Inc.     Susquehanna chose Oppenheimer as lead on the deal becauseof advisory services the investment bank had provided in the past, Mullsaid, noting that Keefe, Bruyette added a strong, bank-market name to thedeal, and Legg Mason provided strong distribution in the Maryland area,where many of the bonds were sold. Around two-thirds of the offering wassold at the retail level, and the rest to institutional investors.     Susquehanna anticipates approaching the debt market laterin January to offer up to $35 million in senior debt, the proceeds of whichwill also be devoted to the acquisition, Mull said. He noted that amaturity for the notes had yet to be determined. Oppenheimer and KeefeBruyette will underwrite the offering.     Susquehanna Bancshares Inc., which has $3 billion in assetsin both Pennsylvania and Maryland, operates six commercial banks. Itrecently formed a subsidiary, Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. South, to act asthe holding company for the thrift assets.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BANK BONDS ON TOP: ONE AWESOME YEARReturns on bonds issued by banking institutions climbed toremarkable heights in 1995 -- relatively speaking. Whether they can sustainlast year's pace, however, is another story.     Aggregate total returns reached 21.85%, topped by single-Arated banks, which found a return of 22.11%. Although the total return forcorporates overall was higher at 22.24%, duration adjusted returns,considered a more accurate measure, showed bank bonds besting virtually allother corporate and government securities (see table on P. 2).     Still, the heights to which bank returns climbed arerelative to their starting point at the beginning of the year.     "Banks were cheaper going in, so there was a big upside,"said Anne Robinson, a fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns. She added thatbank spreads widened considerably toward the end of 1994, largely due toFederal Reserve interest rate hikes earlier in the year.     Spreads on bank bonds are strongly correlated to interestrates, due to the interest rate sensitivity of banks' businesses, which mayaccount for some widening of spreads in the third quarter 1995. At thattime, minor concerns of inflation were sparked. Shortly after, however,positive inflation numbers were released, a number of large banks announcedmergers, and there was significant purchasing of U.S. Treasurys by theJapanese central bank, which drove rates down. These factors all worked totighten spreads in the fourth quarter, actually doubling returns from theprevious quarter,  to nearly record levels. However, investors see littleroom for improvement in the bank bond market, at least compared to othercorporate bonds.     "Our view is that spreads are at fairly narrow levels, andthere's not much room for upside," said Mike O'Brien, a banking analyst atFidelity. He noted that while there has been some deterioration in bankingfundamentals, such as credit quality, those fundamentals are still verystrong. "An investor wouldn't be overweighting in the bank sector, butprobably wouldn't be getting out either. The sector may not perform as wellas before, but we don't think it will have problems."     O'Brien further noted that consolidation in the industry,which has been a driving factor behind the rally, appears to be windingdown somewhat, and that upside stemming from ratings upgrades has probablyleveled off.     "The sector is balancing out at high single-A -- it's hardto get excited about the sector," O'Brien said. He noted that Fidelity isfocusing on shorter-maturity debt  --  buying five-year paper rather than20-year -- to guard against spreads potentially widening later in the year.     Robinson generally agreed with O'Brien's prognosis of thebank sector, noting that there is only a 30-basis point spread differencebetween the best and weakest banks. That compares to a 45-basis pointdifference at this time last year.     "We don't see spreads tightening any further. But aninvestor can still make money in banks if rates go down later in the year,"she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996POTENTIAL FUNDING DILEMMA: MIXED MESSAGES FROM FASBBanks that left securities in the held-to-maturity categoryof Financial Accounting Standard 115 during the recently provided transferwindow, with the intention of using those securities later to do repurchaseagreement transactions, may find that strategy closed to them if a proposedstandard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board is enacted in itscurrent form.     The proposed standard was issued as an exposure draftaround the same time that FASB provided banks with a window to transfersecurities currently classified as held to maturity into the available-for-sale category without a penalty. The window of opportunity in FAS 115,Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, closed atthe end of 1995, after which such transfers are strictly prohibited. Theproposed treatment for longer-term repos likely influenced held-to-maturitydesignations under FAS 115 during the restructuring window, and willcontinue to do so.     For example, a financial manager may have intended to use afive-year bond classified in held to maturity as collateral in a repotransaction next year. However, that may not be possible under the samefavorable terms if the proposed statement becomes an accounting standard,and so the manager may have chosen to use one of the other two categoriesinstead.     Banking institutions typically designate securities usedfor longer-term repos into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealizedgains and losses needn't be marked to market. However, the proposedstatement would require any repos with a maturity of three months or moreto be recorded as a sale, and hence marked to market. Banks would therebybe limited to using repos with maturities of less than three months, whichare still liabilities under the proposed statement. The proposed saletreatment for longer-term repos increases volatility in capital and wouldsuddenly have to appear in the income statement when the rule comes intoeffect. The proposed transition date currently is Dec. 15, 1996.     "This is a major concern for our industry," said MartiSworobuk at America's Community Bankers. "Smaller banks and thrifts dependon repos for general banking operations. Many of our members believe thatthe proposed standard would do away with repos beyond three months andincrease their costs by at least 30-40 basis points."     These institutions can also turn to the Federal Home LoanBank system for advances, although that is a more expensive source offunding. In addition, Sworobuk noted, the future of the FHLB as an easilyaccessible and available funding source is uncertain given the currentpolitical climate.     FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit onrepos is a period that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because theBoard believed that the vast majority of repo transactions held far shortermaturities.     "We've since learned that there are more transactions withdurations around three months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, theproject manager at FASB. He noted that the Board generally attempts toderive arbitrary thresholds where there is a low concentration of businessactivity, in order to avoid dramatic differences in accounting requirementsfor many similar transactions. FASB will likely reconsider the three-monthlimit as it continues its deliberations.     Following the comment deadline Jan. 22, FASB will hold apublic hearing toward the end of February. As of the middle of last week,the accounting standard setter had received about 25 comments, most ofwhich were notifications to testify at the public hearing.     America's Community Bankers was preparing last week aletter to FASB in order to express the views of its constituents.  Thetrade group recently surveyed members with assets of $1 billion or more fortheir views on the proposed statement, and found that many banks believethe standard would eliminate a source of cheap, long-term funding. A largesavings bank in Wisconsin noted that it intends to extend its use of reposout to one or two years, and that the proposed change would negativelyinfluence its operations.     "To make a long story short, they're all saying that theywould have to shorten maturities and go to a higher-cost-of-fundingsource," Sworobuk said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BUYBACKS DROP OFF IN '95 MERGER MANIAThe heady volume of stock repurchase programs announced bybanks slackened in 1995 from the previous year, while repurchase programsannounced by thrifts more than doubled in the same period, according toSecurities Data  Co.     The volume of announced programs in 1995 fell 25% from theyear before to just over $20 billion, a drop that surprised analysts, whonoted possible reasons including frenetic merger activity and heady stockvalues.     Observers of the savings and loan industry attributed thenearly 140% increase in the volume of stock repurchases announced bythrifts to factors that have been affecting banks for some time, includingthe need to use capital and control burgeoning earnings-per-share andreturn-on-equity ratios.     Perhaps the most important reason, they said, was to wardoff acquirers seeking assets on the cheap.     Marni Pont, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., saidthat stock buybacks can prohibit banks from engaging in stock poolings, acomplication experienced by First Bank System in its efforts to acquireFirst Interstate. She noted that banks may thus have decided to limit theirbuybacks in favor of poolings, a strategy confirmed by the treasurer of aregional bank whose institution recently chose to cut short its announcedbuyback for that very reason.     Another reason, Pont noted, was the rapidly rising valuesof bank stocks, which, according to Keefe's KBI 50, provided an averagetotal return in 1995 of 60.02%.     Yet despite a total return of 63% in 1995, AmSouth Bancorp.decided to pursue a stock buyback last fall in order provide shares for itsemployee benefit and stock plans.     "You can generate a fairly good internal rate of return(through a buyback) because the increase you achieve in EPS and ROE seemsto offset any cost that you incur through book value dilution," said ListUnderwood, head of finance at the bank.Back to Headline List CopyrightCFO ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BANK GROUPS JOIN ARMS AGAINST FILING PENALTIESRepresentatives of the nation's lending industries havejoined together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for a plan theybelieve will raise the penalties for failing to file, or filinginaccurately, so-called "information returns," -- the infamous 1099s.     These forms are used by lenders to report payments ofdividends, interest and interest accrued on accounts but not preciselypaid. For example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit,U.S. government securities or similar instruments.     The Clinton administration proposal sprang out of thebudget stalemate that has persisted over the last several weeks. Theadministration submitted a proposal to the Republican leadership inCongress Dec. 7 as an alternative to Republican calls for deep cuts in thefederal budget. The proposal outlines increases in miscellaneous fees andthe closing of certain loopholes. Aimed more at stirring indigination thanwinning congressional support, the proposal includes several otherprovisions that the administration knew would be opposed by powerfulcorporate interests. For example, it calls for federal banking regulatorsto impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.     The provision at issue appeared to be limited to paymentsfor services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC. However, according toa letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin dated Jan. 2, thelenders said that an explanation provided by the Joint Committee onTaxation Dec. 15 indicated a provision with much broader scope.     Those signing onto the letter include Credit Union NationalAssociation, the American Bankers Association, the American Land TitleAssociation, America's Community Bankers, the Independent BankersAssociation of America, the Investment Company Institute, the NationalAssociation of Realtors, the Public Securities Association and theSecurities Industry Association.     The implication is that even if the proposal had merit, itis unlikely to be supported in Congress--especially in an election year.However, given that this is not a normal budget process, the groups arejoining together to marshall their muscle out of fear that in a late nightdeal, the provision could be swept into a compromise--at great cost tolenders of all stripes.

Interest rates also jumpedduring the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on consecutivedays.

The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usuallyreferred to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" areslightly less onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-basedInternational Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft couldrequire disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to beissued by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the CanadianInstitute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press forcompanies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.     This difference of opinion has been going for at least ayear, and officials from all three groups are expected to engage in morehaggling on the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposalswill be due June 30.     Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rulepromises to shed more light on how and where banks make their money. Andthe rule became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announcedit would start publishing its group results according to InternationalAccounting Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hiddenreserves to smooth out balance sheets.     Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide atleast one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographicallines. In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internalfinancial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.     The North American approach also starts with the way abusiness views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ...recognizes the fact that this information does not always reflect thedominant source and nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC'sproject manager. "In certain cases, therefore, information needs to bemodified for external reporting purposes."-- Craig WebbBack to Headline List WT03-B38-9IA059-000325-B023-186http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi23.html 205.156.212.5 19970115005040 text/html 28709HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 00:48:34 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:05 GMTContent-length: 28520Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi23.html Sample Issue Copyright COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNet June 13, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization (781 words) S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume (850 words) Commercial MBS Volume, by Rating Agency (37 words) How the Rankings Were Compiled (223 words) What They Charge (113 words) Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling (158 words) Multi-Family Paper Blows Out (461 words) DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels (219 words) Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros (236 words) Nomura Places Warehouse Paper (147 words) THE GRAPEVINE (532 words) CALENDAR (189 words) CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization   Hoping to resuscitate its real estate lending business, Bank of BostonCorp. is radically altering its operations: From now on, it will onlyoriginate commercial mortgages that can be securitized.   In an exclusive arrangement, the nation's 16th-largest bank has engagedGoldman, Sachs & Co. to structure and distribute mortgage-backed notes thatcan be sold to several classes of investors.   Bank of Boston's move is a departure from the traditional real estateoperations of banks, which have always been long-term holders of commercialmortgages. It's performance is sure to be tracked by regional banksnationwide, many of which are weighing similar plans.   The strategic shift results from months of discussions between seniorofficials at Bank of Boston and outside securitization experts, includingadvisers from Kenneth Leventhal & Co. and the New York law firm of Weil,Gotshal & Manges.   In talks earlier this month with borrowers and other outsiders, Bank ofBoston management expressed a sense of urgency about shifting its approachfrom "book and hold" to "originate and sell." According to a bank positionpaper, failure to adopt a securitization strategy would jeopardize itscommercial mortgage franchise. Under such a scenario, the bank said itwould:   * "Lose a large portion of our asset base in one to three years."   * "Have no competitive term credit to attract new relationships."   * "[See its] revenues decline due to the loss of higher spread credit."   * "Not be in control of our balance sheet as we continue to acquirebanks."   Like many other institutions, Bank of Boston has been a reluctant realestate lender during the early part of this decade - in contrast to itsaggressive style in the 1980s. For the most part, it has been booking mini-perms (three- to five-year loans) that carry strict covenants and recourseprovisions. With such onerous terms, the bank has been losing prospectiveborrowers to its competitors, and the outlook has worsened with theproliferation of Wall Street's commercial mortgage conduits.   Now that real estate values are rebounding, the bank wants to offerfriendlier terms on loans that can be regularly packaged into commercialMBS and rolled off its balance sheet.   In July, Bank of Boston's 90 commercial mortgage originators will starthawking the new product line. It features long-term (five- to 20-year)loans without covenants or recourse provisions. The bank will write$750,000 to $10 million loans. The credits will carry fixed and adjustablerates, amortizing over 20 or 25 years.   The goal: To re-establish Bank of Boston as a one-stop resource fordevelopers and other real estate owners in need of construction, mini-permor long-term financing. The new program is designed to finance shoppingcenters (anchored and unanchored), apartment buildings,industrial/warehouse facilities, office buildings and hotels.   By securitizing these loans, Bank of Boston can continue to build realestate relationships and generate fee income, while meeting managementconcerns about its asset-liability mix, risk exposure and capitalrequirements.   How does the bank plan to profit from its securitization program? Thebulk of its earnings will come from the "positive arbitrage" that is leftover from a loan's interest rate after paying issuance expenses and therequired yield to MBS holders.   The bank estimates it will charge borrowers 275 to 350 basis points overthe Treasury curve and be left with 50 to 70 bp of profit. That projectionis considered somewhat optimistic, given that lenders are being forced tolower their loan prices in order to cope with mounting competition.   On top of the loan spread, the bank will also collect an origination feeequal to 1.5% to 2.25% of the total loan amount, plus a $16,500 applicationcharge.   MBS investors can expect Goldman, Sachs to provide a fairly regular flowof multi-class issues, each backed by at least 30 mortgages. A typicalissue will be made up of a triple-A rated senior tranche yielding 100 to125 bp over Treasuries, a smaller single- or double-A tranche yielding 140to 175 bp over, a double- or triple-B class yielding 300 to 600 bp over andan unrated piece with spreads in the mid- to high-teens.   Spokesman for Bank of Boston and Goldman, Sachs did not return calls forcomment.   Bank of Boston is counting on the securitization program tosubstantially boost its origination capacity from its current annualcommercial mortgage output of about $250 million. It's not known whetherthe bank also plans to securitize part of its $3.5 billion in existing realestate loans, which were not underwritten with MBS investors in mind.Nearly half of its current portfolio is secured by New England properties,with the rest scattered throughout the U.S.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume   Standard & Poor's Corp. was the most active rating agency in thecommercial MBS market in 1993, working on more than half of the year'sdollar volume, according to data compiled by Commercial Mortgage Alert.   Of the $14.7 billion in transactions for which rating information wasgathered, S&P rated offerings valued at $7.6 billion.   Fitch Investors Service Inc. and Duff & Phelps Corp. were neck-and-neckfor second place. Fitch rated issues valued at $6.75 billion, while D&P'stotal was $6.70 billion. Moody's Investors Service Inc. came in last, with$6.2 billion of rated deals.   S&P also ranked first based on the number of deals rated, with 46,followed by D&P (42), Fitch (36) and Moody's (28).   The survey - the first ever to track rating-agency activity in the CMBSmarket - also showed that Fitch's business grew by a whopping 63% lastyear, from $4.1 billion in 1992. The number of deals it rated more thantripled.   Moody's was the only agency to see its volume fall, logging a 12%decline, from $7.1 billion.   Still, several executives at Wall Street firms expressed surprise thatthe agency ended up so close to the pack. Moody's suffered several keystaff defections last year, which limited its ability to processtransactions. The firm estimates that it turned away a couple of billiondollars of offerings that it otherwise would have rated.   What's more, Moody's has taken a strict view on certain types ofcommercial MBS. That strategy has rankled underwriters, opened upopportunities for rival agencies and, ultimately, cost Moody's some marketshare. But because of its stellar reputation among bondholders, Moody'sended up rating most of the year's biggest deals.   Investment bankers weigh a number of factors when selecting a ratingagency, but the requirements of investors tend to be the dominant factor.MBS buyers often insist that transactions be rated by either S&P or Moody's- the two most-established agencies. And for most deals, they want thecomfort of two ratings. This opens the door for the market upstarts, D&Pand Fitch.   Another key factor is service: How quickly and smoothly a deal will berated, as well as the accessibility of analysts to investors. At the end oflast year, when deal volume picked up sharply, the agencies were swampedwith business. Moody's temporarily stopped accepting additional business inSeptember. S&P, which has a much bigger staff dedicated to commercial MBS,was forced to do the same the following month.   Things have calmed down somewhat since the beginning of the year, withdeals usually taking six to eight weeks to go through the rating process.One Wall Street executive commented that all of the agencies still havebottlenecks, but he - and several others - singled out Fitch for providingparticularly good service.   Because the issuer's cost of funds is generally the overriding concernin every deal, underwriters are known to shop for agencies that willrequire the least subordination in order to attain the desired rating. Anincrease in the level of subordination, or other credit enhancementfeatures, can lead to dramatically higher borrowing costs.   The individual bias of each agency is also well known in the market.Moody's, for example, is comfortable with multi-family and retail deals,but is wary of offerings backed by debt on office buildings and hotels.Fitch has led the way on deals collateralized by nonperforming assets, butis especially strict on offerings with single borrowers.   D&P has been regarded as the most lenient and least influential of theagencies. But underwriters said that D&P has become tougher under thedirection of Joseph C. Franzetti, a respected analyst who was recruitedlast September from S&P, where he ran the mortgage-backed securities group.    At the other end of the scale is Moody's, which seems to pride itselfon being the toughest rater. Last fall, for example, it issued a widelypublicized warning to investors about a "marked deterioration in the creditquality" of commercial mortgage issues.   "We're much less concerned with market share than with assigning high-quality ratings," said Tad Philipp, associate director of the agency'sstructured finance group. "We're never going to have the market share ofsome of the other rating agencies."   Despite their frustrations with the agency, investment bankers wouldlove to see Moody's play a bigger role in the CMBS arena, because of itspowerful reputation in other segments of the bond market.   For this reason, some are perplexed by the fact that Moody's has devotedfewer resources to this market than its rivals. After losing some staffersto Wall Street houses last year, Moody's at times found itself with as fewas four or five professionals in its commercial MBS area, down from itsfull complement of seven. The agency is on the verge of filling two newpositions, but it is still out-manned by its rivals: S&P employs about 20professionals, while D&P has 14 and Fitch has 13.   Philipp said that Moody's is committed to the market and expects it togrow. "But we don't feel the need to staff up to handle peak volumes."Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Commercial MBS Volume, by Rating Agency                1993      1992    Chg.  1993  1992              ($Mil)    ($Mil)     (%)   (#)   (#)   S&P       7,581.5   6,819.8   +11.1    46    20   Fitch     6,755.3   4,144.0   +63.0    36    10   D&P       6,705.7   5,346.4   +25.4    42    21   Moody's   6,240.7   7,060.4   -11.7    28    19   Source: CMBS DatabaseBack to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994How the Rankings Were Compiled   Commercial Mortgage Alert used its new CMBS Database to calculate thevolume of business handled by each of the four rating agencies over thelast two years.   The Database, which includes every transaction completed since themarket's inception, carries rating information for the vast majority ofdeals in recent years. All told, there were 123 deals valued at $17.7billion that closed in 1993. But of those, issues with a face amount of atleast $1.7 billion were not rated - $638.4 million in Fannie Mae deals and$1.1 billion in private placements used to finance acquisitions by Goldman,Sachs & Co.'s Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund.   Of the remaining $16 billion in deals, rating information from at leastone agency was gathered for offerings totaling $14.7 billion.   Because of confidentiality agreements, the rating agencies declined toprovide information about private placements, and in some cases thisinformation could not be learned independently. The agencies did provideaggregate data. S&P, for example, said it rated 62 commercial MBS dealslast year totalling $8.2 billion. And Moody's said it rated a total of $7.2billion in deals. However, the survey counted only ratings that could betied to specific transactions.   Agencies were given full credit for the total principal amount of an MBSissue, even if they rated only some classes in a deal.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994What They Charge   Commercial MBS underwriters say fees don't play much of a role in theirselection of a rating agency.   The four agencies each charge about the same - and their compensationpales in comparison to other issuance costs, such as legal fees. The ratingagencies are usually paid six to 10 basis points of the value of the ratedclasses, or $60,000 to $100,000 for a $100 million transaction.   However, the complexity of a deal is also factored in, as well as thegeographic diversity of the collateral. Those factors can push the fee to20 basis points or more.   Underwriters say that Fitch tends to charge more than its rivals, butnot materially so.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling   If Freddie Mac heeds the advice of Lehman Brothers Inc., it will soon becanceling its plans to securitize a $1 billion portfolio of performingmulti-family mortgages.   Last week, Lehman, as financial adviser to Freddie, recommended againstthe transaction - saying the issue did not make economic sense for theagency. The purpose of the offering was to free up capital that Freddiecould recycle back into the mortgage market.   Bear Stearns Cos., which would underwriting the offering, continues tolobby hard in favor of the transaction.   Considerable dissension has developed among senior executives at themortgage agency about whether to go forward with the offering. Theprincipals involved will air their differences at a pivotal meeting that isscheduled for this Wednesday.   Michael May, a Freddie vice president for structured transactions,predicted a final decision would be made within two weeks.   As envisioned, the transaction would have involved  Freddie sellingsubordinate tranches and retaining the senior notes.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Multi-Family Paper Blows Out   Strong investor demand enabled Natwest Markets to rapidly sell $50million in fixed-rate securities backed by debt on apartment complexesowned by Southwest Property Trust Inc., a Dallas REIT.   The two-class offering, priced June 3, was oversubscribed, forcingNatwest to scale back individual allotments in order to give all investorsa piece of the pie.   The senior $50 million class, rated double-A, was priced at par to yield7.824%, or 110 basis points over the seven-year Treasury. The offering alsoincluded an interest-only strip, which was sold to an unnamed investor.   The spread on the senior notes was 20 basis points tighter than thespread on Southwest Property's similar $50 million transaction lastDecember - a time when many more deals were competing for investors'attention. But for the REIT, which initiated the transactions to financethe acquisition of multi-family properties, tighter spreads were smallconsolation for the higher yield it must pay: 7.82% versus 6.54% inDecember.   Both transactions grew out of a $100 million line of credit that NatwestMarkets provided to Southwest Property last year.   The REIT tapped half of the credit line in November to finance theacquisition of six properties. The REIT paid back the bridge loan with theproceeds of the first securitization, which was backed by new mortgages on13 apartment complexes in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona.   Southwest Property drew down the rest of the credit line over the pastfew months to finance other acquisitions. That bridge financing was paidoff with proceeds of the latest securitization, which was backed by newmortgages on 12 garden-style properties in Texas, one in New Mexico and onein Arizona.   The offering carried attractive prepayment protections for bondholders.If the REIT prepays the mortgages, it will have to pay bondholders thedifference between the coupon on the securities and the prevailing Treasuryrate. The yield-maintenance agreement is designed to protect investorsagainst declining interest rates by compensating them for having to re-invest their funds at lower yields. Under these provisions, bondholdersusually receive the difference between the coupon and a rate equal to theTreasury yield plus an additional spread. In the Southwest Property deal,however, investors will receive the difference between their coupon and theflat Treasury rate, making the potential compensation greater than normal.   The class A notes mature in February 2001, but are extendable for twoyears. If the notes are extended, their coupon rate, currently 7.72%, willbe increased to either 9.43% or 375 basis points over the seven-yearTreasury, whichever is higher at the time.   The two Southwest Property transactions were the first commercial MBSdeals handled by Natwest Markets, the New York investment banking arm ofLondon-based National Westminster Bank PLC.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels   The conduit operated by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and EquitableReal Estate Investment Management Inc. is expanding into the hotel sector.   The team, which already originates and securitizes multi-family andretail credits, plans to extend up to $1 billion of hotel loans nationwide.   Equitable believes that the time is right to get back into therebounding hotel sector, which it pulled out of five years ago. This timearound the company will employ more conservative underwriting standards.For instance, it will base lending decisions on the properties' historic,rather than projected, income.   Under the program, Equitable will identify borrowers through itsnational network of investment offices. The loans will be originated byColumn Financial Inc., an Atlanta-based joint venture between the conduitpartners. DLJ will then securitize the mortgages. Equitable Real Estate andDLJ are subsidiaries of Equitable Companies Inc.   The conduit will originate non-recourse loans with 10- to 20-year termsfor all types of lodging properties. Loans will range from $2 million toabout $25 million, with interest rates that are 325 to 450 basis pointsover Treasuries, depending on the debt-service coverage. A 1.75 DSC ratiowould merit a 325 bp spread. But a 1.40 ratio - considered more likely forhotel properties - would result in a 350 to 400 bp spread.Back to Headline List CopyrightCOMMERCIAL MORTGAGE ALERT via NewsNetJune 13, 1994Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros   Greystone & Co., an investment banking boutique, has started acommercial MBS unit, staffing it with three veterans from the disbandedmortgage operation of Daiwa Securities America Inc.

When Nomura started shopping the double-A notes for Shurgard StorageCenters Inc., a Seattle REIT, it discussed pricing them at a spread of 120basis points over seven-year Treasuries. Some investors said thetransaction, backed by a collateral type still relatively new tosecuritization, would never get done at spreads of less than 130 bp.   But in the end, Nomura was able to slightly better its initial target,pricing the single-class offering at 102% of par value for a 115 bp spread.The offering was helped by its strong bondholder protections and thescarcity of new issues in the market. Still, it took Nomura several weeksto privately place the notes.

Manella, Berry, in anticipation of filing a bankruptcy for hisclient, transferred the client's business assets away from her businessknowing that the assets were collateral for an SBA loan. This action wastaken with intent of concealing the assets from representatives of theSBA and the bankruptcy trustee."This is a particularly egregious case because it involves an attorneywho attempted to use his knowledge of bankruptcy proceedings to profitat the expenses of the U.S. Government," said Steve Marica, assistantinspector general for investigations at the SBA.Berry is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8, 1995. He faces a maximumsentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Melvin Belli Files Chapter 11Melvin Belli is one of the most well-known lawyers in the country. Hisfame was such in the '60s that he actually appeared on an episode of theTV series "Star Trek," as "Gorgon," a creature who made the  children ofone planet visited by the starship "Enterprise" murder their ownparents.As a lawyer, he brought personal injury lawsuits to the publicconsciousness and was a role model for many law students.Now his firm has filed Chapter 11 and Belli has hired San Franciscobankruptcy lawyer Penn Butler to represent him."There are two culprits," Belli said. "One is Dow Chemical who went intobankruptcy and reneged on the $4 billion they had set up to pay [tortclaimants]. I had put out $5 million to $10 million for doctor'sreports, etc. The bank was going to lend us $45 million based on the DowChemical settlement."But when Dow went into bankruptcy, that loan disappeared and Belli foundhimself cash poor."The second [culprit] is the $15 million [I had to pay my wife] in thedivorce," Belli said.Belli said the Chapter 11 is merely buying "the finest personal injuryfirm in the country" some time until everyone can be paid off in full."I have $50 million to $75 million in big cases coming in," he said."The oil case in Alaska, the Marcos case, the implants -- they're allcoming in toward the end of this year and over into the next year. Butwe had some current creditors who wouldn't wait. It was impossible to doanything but go into a Chapter 11."Belli is now an outspoken convert of the bankruptcy system."People don't realize what Chapter 11 really is for," he said. "I havechanged my former opinion of that. I didn't know the difference betweenChapter 11 and ordinary bankruptcy. [Now I say], thank God that we'vegot Chapter 11."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Lenders Worry That Consumers Cannot Afford Increased DebtFor the first time in history, consumers owe more than $1 trillion ontheir non-mortgage installment credit. The outstanding balance on theircredit cards is approaching $400 billion. The most recent statisticsfrom the Federal Reserve show that total outstanding consumer revolvingcredit was 19 percent higher through the end of October 1995 than it wasat the end of October 1994. According to RAM Research's BankcardBarometer, credit card delinquency rates increased from 3.89 percentduring the first quarter of 1995 to 4.33 percent during the fourthquarter of the year.All these numbers have the people who lent the money more than a littlenervous that debtors will be unable to pay their bills."1996 will be a year when we see higher delinquency and loan losses asthe consumer becomes more overextended," predicted John Kirby, seniorvice president in charge of consumer lending for SouthTrust Bank ofAlabama, N.A., in Birmingham, Ala. "Credit cards have been highlysolicited during 1995, leading to a suspicion that a larger number ofcustomers will have more credit card debt than their income provides."Kirby explained that this explosion in credit card availability was theresult of several new lenders entering the market. In order to establishloan volumes these new lenders were very aggressive in the solicitationof business and often offered very low rates. Lenders who did not lowertheir underwriting standards or rates in response to this competitionlost business to the new lenders. Many of those customers who left werebetter credit risks than those who stayed. As a result, all lenders havean increased risk of loss on consumer loans regardless of whether theyextended credit to borrowers that they might have previously rejected.W. Doug King, executive vice president of Wachovia Corp. in Winston-Salem, N.C., agreed that consumers will have increased difficulty payingtheir bills during 1996 and saw it as a continuation of a trend thatbegan during 1995."Over the past several years consumers have taken on a great deal ofdebt. The strained ability to service indebtedness through income, whichis not growing at a rapid pace, makes it very difficult for consumers toaddress unexpected expenses," King said. "In the household environmentof two incomes where one or both consumers have lost jobs due todownsizing, consolidations, or mergers, many have had to take lowerpaying jobs, or are still unemployed. This situation has, of course,significantly impacted the debt repayment ability of those affectedconsumers.King also noted that increases in the prime rate, which went from 6percent to 9 percent in less than a year, significantly impacted theability of consumers with adjustable rate mortgages to finance theirother installment debt.The ease of filing for bankruptcy is another reason why King expects tosee higher consumer loan losses during 1996. "Filing is simple andinexpensive, there is no longer a social stigma attached to bankruptcy,and the judicial system, in many cases, appears to be encouraging the'fresh start' concept of bankruptcy."While these factors would be conditions causing loan losses at any time,the lending practices of credit card issuers have created a fragileeconomic environment for consumers."The credit card industry has flooded the market with a variety ofcredit card offers, most with tempting teaser rates. These offers haveencouraged some consumers to accept higher credit availability than canbe serviced with their income. In addition, the teaser rates quicklyexpire resulting in higher debt service obligations."Credit card issuers offering incentives for credit card use have addedto the problem of consumers taking on more debt than they can handle.While there is nothing inherently wrong with consumers using creditcards that offer rewards, "many consumers are being shocked at howquickly miscellaneous purchases can add up," King said. "For example, insome cases consumers, who have purchased groceries with credit cards,are finding that they do not have the ability to pay off those purchasesupon receipt of the credit card statement, and actually wind up payingfor those groceries over an extended period of time."And King sees the trend of increased consumer loan losses resulting fromlowered credit standards continuing beyond 1996."From a realistic standpoint, due to 1996 budgetary and earningspressures, the possibility of some banks lowering credit standards tomaintain growth and earnings may exist. In the event some banks in theindustry did lower credit standards consumer delinquencies and losseswould clearly move to even higher levels."So, are lowered standards for issuing credit cards going to bankrupt thelenders along with the borrowers? Probably not."The good news is that credit card debt is but one segment of theconsumer debt," said William E. MacDonald III, the president and CEO ofNational City Bank, Cleveland, in Cleveland, Ohio, and the chairman ofthe Consumer Bankers Association."To fairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans from homeequity and personal and revolving credit lines. If you look at the debtservice burden from a macro perspective, including both mortgage andinstallment loan payments, the debt level numbers are not as alarming,"MacDonald said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 19965th Circuit Judges May Prohibit Chapter 13 Plans Calling for DirectPayment of CreditorsBankruptcy judges may deny confirmation of Chapter 13 plans that callfor the debtor to make payments directly to creditors, the Fifth Circuitruled in William C. and Julie C. Reid v. Michael Gross (In the Matter ofWilliam C. and Julie C. Reid), No. 95-40249 (December 11, 1995). The percuriam decision was not released for publication."We write briefly today only to emphasize that In re Foster, 670 F.2d478 (5th Cir. 1982), stands clearly for the principle that thebankruptcy court has broad discretion in determining whether a debtormay act as disbursing agent in place of the trustee, thereby avoidingthe Chapter 13 trustee's fees," the court said. "Although Fosterrecognizes that the debtor should have flexibility in formulatingChapter 13 plans . . . we find no error in the bankruptcy court'srejection of the proposed, amended plan, which, in this instance,included a modification of First Bank and Trust's original loan to thedebtors."Back to Headline List CopyrightCONSUMER BANKRUPTCY NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996U.S. Trustees Respond to Chapter 13 Guideline CriticismThe December 21st issue of Consumer Bankruptcy News included an articleentitled "EOUST Hears from Tennessee Legislators." This article alsoappeared in Bankruptcy Court Decisions News & Comment, where it includeda note that bankruptcy judges had also written to the Executive Officefor U.S. Trustees to express concern with the proposed revisions to theChapter 13 Trustees' Handbook and the proposed ethical guidelines. Inresponse to the BCD version of the article we heard from Linda EkstromStanley, the U.S. Trustee for Region 17 (E.D. and N.D. Cal. and D.Nev.), the chair of the Standing Trustee Subcommittee and Ellen B.Vergos, U.S. Trustee for Region 8 (Ky. and Tenn.)."As United States Trustees, and as members of the subcommittee whoparticipated in the drafting of proposed Standards of Conduct forStanding Trustees and proposed Handbook Revisions, we are particularlyconcerned that Chapter 13 administration be ethical, efficient andeconomical for all who come in contact with the system.  This is a goalof all those in the U.S. Trustee Program who have been involved withthese proposals."We feel it necessary to correct some misconceptions circulating aboutthe proposed standards and handbook revisions.  Many of thesemisunderstandings were contained in your recent article entitled'Legislators/Judges Worry about EOUST's Proposed Rules.'"Your article quoted a letter from four members of Tennessee'scongressional delegation who expressed a concern that 'these newregulations would negatively impair the effectiveness of the trustees,and result in major financial losses to the creditors . . .' We submitthat if one reads the proposed standards and handbook revisions, onewill see that this expressed concern is misplaced."The proposals are divided into two portions: the first establishes fiveethical standards; the second gives guidance in incurring expenses andin determining what is reasonable and necessary.  The standards arethose which ought to guide the fiduciaries in the administration of animportant trust.  The standards are, in part, to address abuses.  Forexample, there have been instances where standing trustees have hiredand paid substantial salaries to family members for little or no work.There have been trustee family members who have received excessivecompensation with benefits packages far exceeding those available forcomparable positions in the public and private sectors. Other casesinvolve self-dealing by trustees who have charged trust operations sumsfar above market rates or for often unnecessary expenses. These are ofserious concern.  Every dollar spent on unnecessary expenses comes outof the pockets of the debtors."The 21 U.S. Trustees in the country are charged by law with the duty tosupervise the Chapter 13 trustees in their respective regions. 28 U.S.C.Section 586(b). While the U.S. Trustees have and will continue to dealwith abuses on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Trustees will be aided intheir supervision by definitive standards of which the standing trusteehas received advance notice about expected conduct. Written standardswill protect against claims of arbitrary or disparate treatment and, inpart, are a response to standing trustees' requests for writtendirection."The U.S. Trustee Program is also obligated by law to review and approvethe budgets of each trustee operation.  This duty arises from 28 U.S.C.Sec. 586(a)(1) which expressly limits the use of percentage fees to payfor compensation and the actual, necessary expenses of the trustee."It is up to the 21 U.S. Trustees to act as 'watchdogs' over expensesand to approve only those which meet the actual and necessary test.  Theproposed handbook revisions are to serve as a guide for the regionalU.S. Trustees in determining whether an expense of the Chapter 13trustee in their respective regions is actual and necessary."The proposed standards and handbook revisions are not being offered asan attempt to 'federalize' Chapter 13 trustees' operations, ascharacterized by the Tennessee congressional delegation whose letter wasquoted in your article.  Rather, they are to serve as standards forthose in the system which will remain largely unchanged."Another misconception in your article is that 'the bankruptcy benchclosely monitors the operations of the trustees. . .' While thebankruptcy courts adjudicate the issues which come before it in Chapter13, it is the U.S. Trustee who is charged by law with monitoring thebudget and office operations."When the standing trustee system is examined, it is clear why Congressfelt that supervision and oversight were necessary.  The standingtrustee is a statutory fiduciary whose rights and responsibilities aredefined by statute as well as by the terms of the confirmed plan.  Thetrustee receives payments from the debtor and holds them in trust todistribute according to the terms of the confirmed plan or as otherwiseprovided by law or court order.  To fund the standing trustee operation,the standing trustee receives a percentage of all moneys received underplans.  These fees are held in trust to pay for the collective cost ofadministering all chapter 13 plans."By virtue of appointment by the U.S. Trustee, the standing trustee isassigned to his or her caseload. The standing trustee's compensation andoffice overhead are funded by the moneys paid by debtors through theChapter 13 plans.  Eighty percent of the standing trustees in thecountry are paid maximum compensation of $122,816 in addition to havingall their overhead paid. The overhead and compensation are paid cut ofthe funds paid in by the debtors and not by the trustees.  The standingtrustee is not subject to the vagaries of the marketplace, but receiveshis or her salary and overhead by virtue of the number of case filingsin the district.  Many of these trustee operations are quite large.  Forexample, in the Western  District of Tennessee, the three standingtrustees disbursed over $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1995.  Each yearapproximately $2 billion flows through the standing trustee operations.Clearly, Congress intended that the use of these fiduciary funds besupervised."Your article suggested that 'letters from bankruptcy judges . . . haveargued in favor of keeping the system as it is.'  The fact is that manybankruptcy judges have written.  Some favor the proposals, some want tokeep the system as it is, and others favor some proposals and argueagainst others.  The comments are across the board."Finally, your article, quoting from the congressional letter, cites asan example of increased cost, that the regulations would require thatthe West Tennessee trustees' operations to be split into two distinctoffice requiring the purchase of new equipment and the hiring of newstaff. The actual proposals as written, do not require the splitting,but would prohibit a co-trustee operation to enhance accountability ofthe individual trustee.  There are other more cost effective methods bywhich the same result could be accomplished."The writer of your article suggested that there is a lack of meaningfuldialogue between the U.S. Trustees and the standing trustees which could'harm the system.' In fact there has been extensive dialogue.  Commentsand suggestions concerning the proposals have been sought and obtainedfrom standing trustees, judges, creditors and others in the system.Many U.S. Trustees have held meetings with the standing trustees intheir respective regions to obtain comment and input.  This month thesubcommittee met directly with a cross section of standing trustees fromthroughout the country. Many useful suggestions and comments have beengathered from this process.  The dialogue is ongoing and will beconsidered in revising the standards and guidelines early next year.Additionally, all written comments will be reviewed by the members ofthe Director's Advisory Board in the next few weeks.  The Board iscomprised of bankruptcy judges and United States Trustees.  The Boardwill also hear oral presentations from some of the commentators,including representatives of the NACTT."If your readers would like to receive a copy of the proposals, writeLinda E.

Because of the recent rise in bankruptcyfilings, Chief Judge Paul A. Magnuson (D.

"We are not asking our bankruptcy judges to do more -- weare requiring it. We will continue to seek ways to improve thebankruptcy system's efficiency, but we critically need these 11additional bankruptcy judgeships."Also testifying in support of the legislation was Judge William E.Anderson (Bankr.

Schmidt of Schmidt Marketing Inc. in Burnsville, Minn.As I travel from law firm to law firm, I often am amazed at thesimilarities in how marketing programs are organized or not organized.In fact, some of the most common marketing structures are downrightdysfunctional.Whether a firm makes its marketing decisions in one of the ways listedbelow is sometimes related to how long the firm has been engaged inmarketing. In other cases, it is a result of the firm's culture and thedegree of individuality that it allows.Since many of these structures actually can produce negative results,poor use of resources, internal competition, ill-designed strategies andpotential conflicts, I would like to use a few borrowed clichis to pointout the characteristics of six faulty marketing programs, and theproblems they may create for you, your marketing director, or your firm.Six Dysfunctional Marketing Programs1. The Squeaky Wheel Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristics: The lawyers who demand the marketing resourcesget them.Discussion: Without a marketing plan or firm-wide goals, decisions aboutallocating marketing resources are made on the basis of demand. So it'spossible that the firm is spending money on lawyers who are ineffectivemarketers, and activities that will not produce results.Result: The firm is not working toward any common objectives, andindividual attorneys use firm resources to build their own practices andpotentially portable books of business.2. The Flavor of the Month Marketing ProgramDefining characteristics: Something more "sexy" or interesting alwayscomes along to capture the attention of the marketing effort.Discussion: In these programs, the attention span of the marketingdirector, marketing committee or marketing partner is relatively short,and new ideas always receive immediate endorsement. One month it mightbe a client survey, the next month a home page, and the next an imageadvertising program, with no real commitment to any direction orstrategy.Result: The firm engages in scattershot initiatives instead of buildinga foundation and conducting the follow-up necessary to achieve realmarketing success.3. The Monkey See, Monkey Do Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: The firm imitates the marketing efforts of itscompetitors or other law firms in its market.Discussion: I can't tell you the number of law firms that have decidedto undertake an activity because another firm is doing it. From hiringmarketing directors to writing newsletters, their strategies simplyreflect those that their competitors employ. My advice is, if anotherfirm has already cornered the market on an activity, your firm should dosomething else; the innovator firm almost always receives the greatestrewards.Result: Since these firms do not take time to determine what they aretrying to accomplish (their objectives), and the best ways to achievethese objectives, their marketing efforts are usually ineffective.4. The Pass the Buck Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: Something or someone else is always holdingthings up in marketing.Discussion: I think lawyers in this type of marketing organization wouldhave a hard time selecting just one response to this multiple choicequestion:"I cannot do [whatever I was supposed to do] because:a. The management committee never responded to my memob. The marketing director never set up a meetingc. The brochure is hopelessly out of dated. My contact never called me back."Result: No one ever takes the initiative or implements marketing ideas.5. The Grass Is Always Greener Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: Other law firms' clients are a lot moreattractive than the ones the firm already has.Discussion: Usually the result of a poorly designed compensation systemproving too many incentives for origination or not enough for clientretention, this type of program encourages lawyers to pursue newrelationships, sometimes at the expense of existing ones. Taken to theextreme, some lawyers refuse to work on matters for the client of acolleague, or to introduce other lawyers into their own clientrelationships.Result: Lawyers are chasing new business while existing (hard-earned)clients slip away.6. The Every Man/Woman for Himself/Herself Marketing ProgramDefining Characteristic: Everyone in the firm gets equal time andresources for marketing.Discussion: Obviously, not every lawyer has the same skills oropportunities with respect to marketing. While everyone should beencouraged, not everyone warrants the same resources. The internalcompetitiveness and lack of coordination usually found in this marketingstructure can be apparent even to prospects and clients, who may seelawyers from the same firm call on them on consecutive days or notice alack of internal communication. Working together undoubtedly seesgreater marketing success.Result: The lawyers are not taking advantage of their collectivecontracts and ideas, and may even be pursuing conflicting opportunities.ConclusionThere are some firms whose primary goal is just getting the lawyers toundertake marketing activities -- any lawyers and any activities. Andthe last thing a firm should do is construct what the lawyers perceiveto be barriers to marketing, such as processes, controls or approvals.Still without a better system for making decisions about marketingstrategies and resources, many law firms will find their levels ofactivity and expenses going up appreciably without correspondingresults.Back to Headline List WT03-B38-11IA059-000325-B023-267http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi123.html 205.156.212.5 19970115005234 text/html 48224HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 00:50:41 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 08-Jan-97 21:56:14 GMTContent-length: 48034Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi123.html Sample Issue Copyright THE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNet December 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIES (545 words) SHARE ACCOUNTING CRACKDOWN (316 words) SCOTS SEEK GUIDANCE ON PRELIMS (344 words) GOVERNANCE POLICIES SHOWN TO BE UNRELATED TO PROFITS (562 words) BACKING FOUND FOR DERIVATIVES STATUS QUO (320 words) NEWS BRIEF DIRECTORS' PAY RETREAT BY AUSTRALIAN UIG (90 words) `BLACK HOLE' FEARS PROMPT MD&A PLEA (133 words) CADBURY COMPLIANCE CONTINUES TO CLIMB (166 words) BITTER PILL FOR SUGAR ON PLAYERS' TRANSFERS (189 words) CHARITY GOVERNANCE LAPSES DISCOVERED (303 words) DATA SHORTFALL HIGHLIGHTED FOR ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVES (163 words) LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULED (477 words) BUTTE SPARED GROUND-BREAKING COURT ACTION (548 words) GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998 (611 words) ASB PRODUCES `GENUINE' CASH FLOW STANDARD (393 words) ANDERSEN REJECTS BLAME FOR WICKES (987 words) CONFERENCE REPORT NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONS (625 words) CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIESUK STANDARD setters will face concerted opposition from the brewing andhotel industries to proposed accounting changes which could slash 10percent or more from the pre-tax profits of both sectors.The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) wants to impose a generalrequirement for companies to depreciate the value of their properties.Current rules enable them to avoid this on the grounds that theproperties are either increasing in value or being regularly maintainedor refurbished.Shares in the brewing industry fell recently in anticipation of thechange, even though it would have no impact on a company's cash flow.The proposals are contained in a new ASB discussion paper onmeasurement of tangible assets, which the board expects to lead to anew accounting standard. The paper argues that it is normally"uneconomic" to provide a limitless extension to the life of a propertythrough maintenance or refurbishment.The board also wants all companies to have their propertiesindependently revalued every five years. About 60 percent of companiesrevalue operating properties. These values should also be kept up todate, the board says."Under the present arrangements, companies that revalued theirproperties in the late-1980s at the height of the property boom havesince been able to leave these valuations in their accounts unchanged,"pointed out ASB chairman David Tweedie. One exception to the new ruleswould be so-called "trophy" properties, assets of historicalsignificance which have an unlimited useful economic life and need notbe depreciated. This category might include stores such as Harrods,prime site city hotels or 16th century coaching inns.The possible impact of the proposals is shown in the table, supplied byanalysts UBS Global Research. Scenario 1 is conservative, assuming 25percent residual asset value (being freehold land and remaining bricksand mortar) and a 50-year depreciation charge. Scenario 2 is moreoptimistic at 33 percent residual value, 100-year depreciation onfreeholds and 50 years on long leaseholds.The board has recommended that investment properties should continue tobe excluded from depreciation (assumed in the table). UBS points outthat this will be particularly welcomed at certain companies such asP&O and GUS, where investment properties form by far the greatestproportion of their portfolio. However, the analysts also stress thatthis exemption may eventually be lost under EU accounting plans.Another bright spot for the companies, says UBS, is the paper'sapparent suggestion that an element of repairs and maintenance spendmay be capitalised and depreciated along with the asset.The majority of this spend is currently written off immediately to P&L,UBS points out. Therefore earnings benefits could come via deferral ofa part of the expense, potentially offsetting any additionaldepreciation hit.The proposals have been put out to consultation and a draft standard islikely some time next year. According to an ASB spokesman, a finalstandard is unlikely before 1998"at the earliest".Sector (based on FT-SE 100) potential negative impact on earnings %                                            Scenario 1    Scenario 2Brewers/pubs and restaurants, alcoholic beverages                                  10-15         3-8Leisure and hotels                           5-10         3-8Retailers, general                           2-3          1-1.5Water                                        5-6          2-3Source: UBS Global ResearchCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The AccountingStandards Board's Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) wants to see the realvalue of shares - not merely their nominal amount - charged to theprofit and loss account.The new proposals would apply to Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) aswell as more long-standing types of scheme. LTIPs, a new type ofexecutive share scheme which links rewards to performance, have becomepopular since the Greenbury Committee on executive pay recommended theyshould replace existing executive schemes last year.Companies' use of LTIPs is an ongoing source of controversy. A recentstudy by corporate governance analysts Pension Investment ResearchConsultants found a host of top UK plcs were breaching good practiceguidelines on their use (see TA 5913).Under the new proposals, adjustments would be made to the profit andloss account charge to take account of such factors as: changes in theprobability of performance criteria being met; conditional awardslapsing; or purchases of shares at different prices (either to hedgethe cost of conditional awards or meet the cost of final awards).In cases where options are granted at a discount (ie the exercise priceis below the market value of the shares at the date of grant), the UITFsaid, the discount should be recognised as an expense over theappropriate period. One example is SAYE schemes, where the exerciseprice is normally at a 20 percent discount.Executive share options schemes are unlikely to be affected by theproposals, as Greenbury recommended that executive share options shouldnever be issued at a discount.The proposals have been sent to finance directors of listed companiesfor comments.A deadline of November 7 was set for responses.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

ICAS also wants the figures to be audited.The institute analysed the prelims of 20 top 500 companies and comparedthem with the information contained in the annual report. To itssurprise, the study revealed not all companies included a profit andloss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement in prelims as amatter of course.Every company published a P&L but one omitted a balance sheet and fourfailed to include a cash flow statement. Inclusion of the statement oftotal recognised gains and losses (8), the reconciliation of movementsin shareholders funds (9), and the historical cost profit and lossstatement were found to be still more variable.Analysis of narrative content showed that all but one company in eachcase included a chairman's statement and financial highlights. But only11 and 10 respectively published a financial review or chiefexecutive's statement.ICAS has called on the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop anon-mandatory statement of best practice to improve consistency.The Scots also argue that the market would be better served if the datawere audited."Using audited information would result in the preliminary announcementbeing an extract of the annual report which provides a consistent levelof information across all companies," said Graeme Bissett, convener ofthe institute's Accounting Standards Committee.At present, Stock Exchange rules stipulate that prelim figures musthave been "agreed" with the auditors. Bissett claimed this requirementhad been"intepreted differently by different companies".The ASB is expected to review the subject of prelims soon and ICAS'scomments are the latest contribution to an expanding debate.The Big Six firm KPMG recently argued that prelims could be materiallycurtailed if they were largely replaced by the immediate filing ofaudited statutory results (see TA 5914).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Only in the UK was a "slight correlation"detected.The finding comes in a survey of European corporate governance byDeminor, a Brussels-based consultancy which advises minorityshareholders. The widespread absence of such a link, the companyspeculates, suggests the relationship between corporate governance andfinancial performance could only be proved "in the medium-term". LargeAmerican pension funds have established a link on the basis of muchlarger statistical data, the report points out. This explains why agrowing number of Anglo-Saxon and other institutional investors"explicitly take corporate governance standards into account wheninvesting in European companies", Deminor adds.Overall, the UK was furthest advanced in the field, ahead of (in order)France, Germany and Belgium. Holland was placed last among the fivecountries surveyed. A large majority of Dutch companies, the reportsays, employs fiduciary mechanisms and structures unknown elsewherewhich produce "serious and significant distortions between ownershipand control".Deminor analysed how shareholders were treated in main stock indices ofeach country - FT-30 (UK), CAC-40 (France), DAX (Germany), AEX(Holland) and BEL-20 (Belgium). Publicly available information from atotal of 140 companies was surveyed, including annual reports andcompanies' bye-laws.Scores were awarded against a range of criteria, such as use of boardcommittees and quality of information to shareholders. Final rankingswere then compared with financial performance based on EPS/Stock Priceratio.In addition to the rankings, three other main conclusions emerged. Somecorporate governance issues are neglected everywhere; countries differwidely on certain criteria; and there remains much room forimprovement.Few corporations provided information on directors' independence andthe internal working of the board. On director's remuneration and theissue of board committees, however, a clear divergence emerged.British companies complying with the Greenbury Code reveal much abouthow they pay directors. But in most other countries, with the exceptionof a few French companies, shareholders are given only an aggregateamount of total remuneration. Other countries have also been slowerthan the UK (and to a lesser extent France) to respond to the idea ofestablishing specialised committees for tasks such as directors'remuneration and selection.The UK, Germany and Belgium were found to be the only countries thatlargely adhere to the "one-share - one vote" principle. In France andHolland, shareholders holding multiple voting rights are more common.In most countries, Deminor says, voting at general meetings and filingresolutions remain a problem. "Cumbersome" deposit requirements andproblematic proxy voting are identified as two areas where improvementsare needed. Companies incorporated in special forms (eg Societes enCommandites par Actions in France, Stichting Administatiekantoor in theNetherlands)"are often used to seal off management from shareholders",the study alleges.Despite the wide disparities in performance, Deminor believes across-the-board reform is inevitable.Corporate governance - the top scorersUK                GEC, Glaxo-Wellcome, Hanson, Marks & Spencer,                  BootsFrance            Air Liquide, CCF, L'Oreal, Lyonnaise des Eaux,                  Rhone-PoulencGermany           Daimler-Benz, Lufthansa, Munich Re, Veba, ViagBelgium           Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Bekaert, Generale de                  Banque, Societe Generale de Belgique, UCBThe Netherlands   Aegon, Heineken, KPN, Royal Dutch, UnileverSource: DeminorCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

A survey of 139 organisations which use derivatives has found ahigh-level of consistency in their accounting for the four main typesof derivative instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options).Over 90 percent of respondents match the accounting with the economicsof the transaction, by recognising the effects of the derivativeinstrument at the same time as the hedged item. The survey, by KPMGPeat Marwick, was released on October 11, the deadline date forcomments on derivatives accounting proposals issued in the summer bythe Financial Accounting Standards Board. FASB wants derivatives to becarried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value, asuggestion which has sparked controversy (see TA 5911).Overall, 96 percent of respondents require correlation between theeffects of the derivative and the hedged item, while 91 percent requirethe derivative to be linked to specific assets or liabilities orhomogenous pools.Some 99 percent of those surveyed reported that they requirederivatives instruments to be designated and documented as relating toa particular risk management strategy in order to qualify for riskmanagement accounting.The vast majority of organisations require a specific assessment of therisks being managed for derivative instruments to qualify for specialtreatment, though practice varied in the criteria used to define andevaluate risk. Just 18 percent of respondents believed FASB's proposalswould be an improvement on present practice - though there wasrecognition that modifications were needed."The survey results indicate the respondents utilise a similaraccounting framework," commented Ken Russell, a partner in KPMG PeatMarwick's professional practice department."Guidance from the FASB isneeded to establish specific details of how the existing framework isto be applied."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The study,by Coopers & Lybrand, found that compliance among FT 100 companies hasreached 97 percent.The main area of non-compliance is the code's recommendation ofappointing at least three non-executives. Among smaller listedcompanies, 27 percent failed to adhere to this principle.Elsewhere, the survey comments on the recommendation that directorsshould report on the effectiveness of their systems of internalfinancial control. This has focused the attention of boards on thissubject in a way that has never happened before, it says. However,descriptions of internal financial control were found to vary in lengthand quality, with better companies giving tangible examples of stepstaken.Unsurprisingly, few companies are willing to indicate where there maybe weaknesses. And only a "handful" gave opinions on the effectivenessof internal control systems.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Under the so-called Bosmanruling, clubs can no longer demand a fee for out-of-contract playersseeking to move between clubs in the European Community (see CA 5913).The adjustment reflects Tottenham's assessment of the diminution ofplayer values this may cause.The move reduced the club's net assets from #37.4 million to #25.3million.Tottenham was the only club in England's top division to capitaliseplayer values in 1994/95. The write-down reflects its decision to beginamortising to residual values of zero.Newcastle United, which valued players at #10.9 million in its 1993/94accounts, reacted to Bosman by taking players off the balance sheetaltogether.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996CHARITY GOVERNANCE LAPSES DISCOVEREDUK CHARITIES urgently need to improve key aspects of their financialmanagement in the wake of the Cadbury report, new evidence suggests.A study of the financial governance of 18 charities by BirminghamBusiness School found that few have independent audit committeesconsisting of non-executives. Those which do rarely exclude executivetrustees and often include paid executives.The authors, professors Trevor Gambling and Rowan Jones, ask whetherall charities should have an audit committee. They suggest such acommittee could meet a minimum of twice a year with only the externalauditor and non-executive trustees in attendance.The report, sponsored by the Chartered Institute of ManagementAccountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England andWales and the Charities Aid Foundation, raises a number of issues.Not one of the charities surveyed had a coherent policy on theaccumulation and disposal of reserves. Large proportions or evenmultiples of annual expenditure are being either "taken out of thinair" or small surpluses are squirreled away "against a rainy day".The report asks if charities should spend the whole of their incomeevery year, subject to making provision for long-term liabilities andproperly calculated future reserves.New arrangements for financial reporting by charities in England andWales came into force this year. These include a statutory requirementfor the financial statements of unincorporated charities, as well ascharities constituted as companies, to be audited by registeredauditors.The new arrangements also impose a duty on charities' auditors toreport certain matters which may be found in the course of their workto the watchdog Charity Commission. In October, the Auditing PracticesBoard issued new guidance on the audit of charities which takes the newrequirements into account.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

So concludes a new surveyby Edinburgh accounts monitor, Company Reporting.The study found that those companies which include derivatives in theiraccounts do so at nominal value. "From this measure alone an analystwould find it very hard to formulate an idea of value and risk," thesurvey concludes.The ASB published new proposals on the disclosure and measurement offinancial instruments in the summer (see TA 5912). They contain interimrecommendations designed to improve current practice until newstandards appear.The ASB's long-term aim of current valuation was used by only 5 percentof relevant companies analysed."It is clear that present practice issome distance from the ASB's `best practice' specifically in terms ofcurrent value and risk measurement," the report concludes.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULEDA NEW series of actuarial standards will help investors and analystscompare the results of Australian life insurance companies.The first standard, released in mid-October, will force life companiesto revamp the way they calculate profits and their obligations topolicy holders.Actuarial Standard 1.01 on Valuation of Policy Liabilities, produced bythe Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board (LIASB), overlaps with adraft accounting standard released by the Australian AccountingStandards Board (AASB) in August. But AS 1.01 differs in certaindetails, in particular on how to calculate profit margins from lifepolicies.When the AASB released its own draft standard, ED 73, some of thedetails on the calculations - known as "premium splitting" - had notbeen finalised and are not expected to be finalised for another threeyears.LIASB chairman Peter Vinson said the differences between the actuarialand the accounting standard were at the"third level of detail". TheLIASB approach was the result of almost a decade of discussions inwhich he had been involved, he added.Vinson hopes the AASB's approach will eventually dovetail with theLIASB's. He believed it is still quite possible for both sides toadjust their version of how profits should be treated so they ensurethey eventually agree.There had not been sufficient time to ensure the two standards wereidentical where they overlapped, he stressed, as the LIASB had beenrequired to produce a standard to take effect from December 31 thisyear.The new actuarial standard requires profits from a life policy to berecognised over the duration of the policy - rather than be brought toaccount when the policy is signed or be recognised in any other way thelife group chooses. Practices have hitherto varied widely.Known as the Margin on Services (MoS) approach, the method ensures thatthe life groups can only declare profits as they actually deliver theassociated services, and those services are paid for by clientpremiums.The actuarial standard also sets out the method for calculating howmuch money the life company is required to pay out on a policy - itsobligations to the policy holder - and requires that liability to beshown on the books.Vinson said the new standard allowed the performances of life groups tobe compared for the first time. The new standardised approach tofinancial reporting would assist the anticipated future public floatsof several major life companies and add another measure ofcompetitiveness within the industry, he added.Actuarial standards have the status of law in the same way asaccounting standards and actuaries will soon have to deal with asuccession of them. AS 1.01 will soon be followed by standards dealingwith solvency and capital adequacy.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But itappears to have come close on this occasion."In view of [the directors'] undertaking, the panel has refrained fromundertaking proceedings under section 245B of the Companies Act 1985,"the panel said in a statement. Butte responded by saying it was "not inthe interests of the shareholders to pursue this matter any further".The affair concerns accounting for shares in mining company Gem RiverCorporation. A Butte spokesman said the company had received a"considerable sum" in shares in return for organising an explorationprogramme for Gem River in Montana and helping to float the company.Some shares were sold immediately on the Alberta Stock Exchange, but 70percent were "escrowed" and could not be traded immediately because theprogramme's success could not be guaranteed.Despite this, Butte realised the escrowed shares as profits in its 1995accounts. The panel maintained that profit should only have beenincluded on the shareholding that had been realised at the time theaccounts were completed."We knew exactly what was there and believed profit realisation wasreasonably certain," the Butte spokesman said. He also complained ithad taken "some considerable time" for Butte to get a "clear opinion"from the panel on what the treatment should be.The revision has led to a downward adjustment in 1995 profits of#967,000. The spokesman refused to speculate on whether the profitwould be realised in 1996. Butte Mining, which collapsed in 1991 and isnow a litigation vehicle only, is no stranger to controversy. A numberof the company's original directors were later charged with conspiracyto defraud. And in June this year the High Court threw out a #110million-law suit which Butte brought against the Big Six firm Ernst &Young.Butte claimed E&Y predecessor firm Arthur Young had given negligentadvice when it was reporting accountant on Butte's 1987 flotation andin connection with the company's acquisition of North Butte Mining in1988. The company had unsuccessfully tried to pursue the case earlierin the US state of Montana. But the suit was dismissed in 1995 when theMontana District Court determined it had no jurisdiction to hear thecase.Butte resurrected the claim in the UK in the form of a counterclaim toan E&Y writ for unpaid fees. As well as claiming #110 million which thecompany claimed its shareholders had lost as a result of the firm'snegligence, the company's new management claimed an extra #110 millionin what Butte calculated was the interest accrued on the damages.However, Mr Justice Lightman ruled it was not"just or appropriate" forButte to be allowed to resurrect the claim.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998GERMANY HAS moved one step closer to the reform of corporate governancewith a set of proposed changes which may become law in 1998.A parliamentary committee headed by the ministers of justice andeconomics wants stricter controls on statutory audits and heavierresponsibilities for supervisory board members at German companies. Theproposals stop short of any radical change, however, and may well bediluted before they are presented to parliament.On statutory audits, the committee's report is a summary of ideas whichhave already gained broad acceptance with German corporations and arewelcomed by the accounting profession.In future, the statutory auditor of a German company will be appointedby the supervisory board rather than the board of managing directors.That means the auditor's independence need not be reconciled withbusiness interests."It doesn't make sense for the management under scrutiny to decide whataspects of the business should be audited," said a source at thejustice ministry in Bonn.In addition, every member of the supervisory board will have the rightto an advance copy of the auditor's report and the auditor will beobliged by law to attend the supervisory board meeting on the year-endaccounts. Big Six firms in Germany say they already do bothvoluntarily.According to the justice ministry, the committee is also consideringways to make the auditor's certificate more detailed and meaningful.The stock phrases of unqualified approval still used by practically allauditors, including the Big Six firms, include neither comment noranalysis. But no detailed suggestions will be made until discussionshave taken place with accounting profession lobbyists.Other reforms show that the committee's approach is essentiallyconservative. An official petition against the supervisory board willstill have to be backed by 5 percent of voting capital, compared with10 percent before. "We don't want the supervisory board to beundermined by gratuitous petitions," is the view from the justiceministry.The committee has also refused to bow to public opinion by reducing themaximum number of supervisory board positions any individual may hold."It's very difficult to set fixed limits," said the justice ministrysource."It depends on the person's intellectual powers. For somepeople, even one board position would be too many."Only one of the proposals is not already standard in countries withreformed systems of corporate governance. This is that banks which holda shareholding of more than 5 percent in a listed company may no longerexercise their custody clients' voting rights in that company as well.Even institutional investors in Germany typically allow their custodianbank to decide how to use their voting rights, often giving the banksan additional voting strength of several percent. This additionalvoting power makes the banks even more powerful, say critics of thecurrent system.But the government is concerned about the implications. It does notwant shareholder representation at companies' annual meetings todecline, but knows it is unrealistic to expect all investors to dotheir own voting, even by post.One solution suggested by the justice ministry is to give an individualexecutive responsibility for avoiding any conflicts of interest betweenthe bank's voting rights and those of its customers. From the bankscomes a suggestion to set up independent voting companies to handlevoting for custody clients.None of these changes will occur quickly. After lobbying, the draft lawis expected to go to Helmut Kohl's cabinet at the beginning of nextyear and will reach parliament a year later -at the earliest.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Its aim is to improve communication ofinformation on liquidity, insolvency and financial adaptability.The original FRS 1 brought the UK in line with international practiceby scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour ofa cash flow statement. But its practical use convinced the boardfurther changes were needed.Under the 1991 standard, the cash flow statement reported movements incash and cash equivalents (investments with maturities of up to threemonths). But, because treasury management practices differ, the ASBgrew concerned that this may give rise to uncertainty about theinvestments to be included as cash equivalents.Under the revised version, only movements in actual cash (defined ascash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts) will beshown as cash flows.Proposals for reform of FRS 1 published last December in exposure draftFRED 10 have survived with only minor refinements. Other main changesinclude a new section providing expanded disclosures on the managementof liquid resources.The orders and headings for cash flows have been changed to bring theminto line with those used in directors' commentaries (eg the operatingand financial review).The cash flow statement has also been tied in more closely with thebalance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flow on the widely usedfinancial indicator, net debt.Cash inflows and outflows may now be shown net in certain restrictedconditions, for example, if they relate to a constantly renewed short-term facility or a commercial paper programme.The revised FRS1 becomes mandatory on March 23 next year.As The Corporate Accountant went to press, the International AccountingStandards Committee published proposals on accounting for pensions andemployee benefits which are out of step with current UK practice.Exposure draft E54 recommends valuations of future benefit obligationsat each balance-sheet date (not every three years as is standard in theUK). The draft says these should reflect market conditions at the yearend, in contrast with the UK practice of using longer term actuarialestimates.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Paul Rogerson reportsARTHUR ANDERSEN is refusing to accept any blame for failing to spotaccounting errors which led audit client Wickes, the DIY chain, tooverstate profits by #51 million ($80 million).The firm responded defiantly to a letter to shareholders, despatched bythe company on October 16, which claimed Andersen "should have reactedmore effectively" to "warning signals" of false accounting."We were the victims of every auditor's nightmare - a skilfullyexecuted, collusive fraud which deceived everybody," risk managementpartner Chris Nunn said.The incident has once again focused attention on how muchresponsibility auditors should bear for detecting deliberate deception.The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales isconducting a campaign to alert firms to the threat of fraud in anenvironment where financial scandals are increasingly likely to trigger"deep-pocket" negligence claims (see TA 5913).In this case Andersen appears to have escaped a lawsuit. Afterconsulting with its lawyers Wickes has decided to take no action. Butthe company has reserved the right to do so "in the event that furthermatters emerge".Wickes shares have been suspended on the London Stock Exchange sinceJune, when it was first announced problems had been found in the timingof the recognition of profits from suppliers' rebate schemes.The irregularities resulted from discrepancies between the supplycontracts reported to senior management and those actually negotiatedby buying staff.Under arrangements which are common in the retail industry, Wickes andits suppliers negotiated incentive arrangements under which the chainwould be rewarded for achieving target levels of sales of particularproducts with either a discount or a rebate.It also took up-front payments from suppliers for marketing costs or inreturn for shelf-space, often tied to a pledge to achieve a certainvolume of sales.The letter to shareholders, from new chairman Michael von Brentano,follows an investigation into the company's accounts by PriceWaterhouse and lawyers Linklaters & Paines.The probe has confirmed there was "serious mismanagement" in certainWickes operations. Problems were centred on the company's buyingdepartment, where investigators found "deliberate misrepresentation" ofcertain deals with suppliers.The rebates and contributions which senior management required thedepartment to obtain ran into tens of millions of pounds. They amountedto #13 million in 1993 and rose to #30 million in 1994 and #57 millionin 1995.In many cases these sums were booked as profit in the year the dealswere signed rather than spread over the period of the supplyagreements, the investigation found.In some instances the rebates booked to profit were not actuallyreceivable or Wickes was required to meet unrealistic volume targets.Some deals were also found to be uncommercial.As a result of the deception, the group's 1994 and 1995 accountsincluded significant levels of rebates and contributions which had notbeen earned. The necessary adjustments announced by von Brentano haveslashed Wickes's consolidated shareholders' funds by #51 million.The probe found' that "ultimate responsibility" for the debacle must beborne by former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum. Theinvestigators found no evidence that he or any other directors wereaware of the deception.But Sweetbaum and a number of other individuals agreed to repaysubstantial sums in profit-linked bonuses. Wickes has agreed to take nofurther action against them.Andersen approved an accounting policy for supplier rebates andcontributions, but the "underlying substance of many deals did notaccord with it", the report said. Instances came to light in 1995 ofamounts being booked to profit earlier than was justified."The board believes that senior management and the auditors should havereacted more effectively to these warning signals. These matters werenot brought to the attention of the Audit Committee, which was assuredby senior management and by Arthur Andersen that the rebates and thecontributions were shown properly in the group accounts."Andersen is to resign as auditor when work on restating the 1995accounts is finished but Nunn was adamant the firm could not reasonablyhave been expected to do any more to uncover the deception. He pointedto the letter's concession that "false or misleading documents producedto the auditors misdescribed the nature of suppliers' payments andconcealed the true position. "Third party confirmations are the highestquality verifications an auditor can receive," said Nunn.If they are falsified, the auditor has little chance to discover what'sgoing on until the amounts become too big to conceal."Under UK auditing standard SAS 110, auditors must plan and conductaudit work to have a reasonable expectation of detecting a materialmisstatement in the accounts caused by fraud."In 1995 the work that was done confirmed to the best of the evidenceavailable that there were no hidden agendas or conditionalitiesattached to the supplier rebates," said Nunn."Even now, having focused on what we might have done differently, onehas to say the answer is `very little'. If every report points in acertain direction it is difficult for auditors simply to say `you'relying'. It will always be the case where one is fighting this kind ofthing, one cannot be 100 percent certain of detecting it."It is reported that neither the UK's Serious Fraud Office nor theDepartment of Trade and Industry is likely to take further action.A"thorough review" of the group's controls and procedures is now underway.Disciplinary action has been taken against two ex-directors withresponsibility for the buying department and more is planned againstcertain middle-ranking executives and junior employees.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CORPORATE ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetDecember 1, 1996NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONSThe Hampel committee on corporate governance is proceeding withextreme caution. Paul Rogerson reportsIT WOULD be folly to expect anything too radical from the committee oncorporate governance led by Ronald Hampel. Or so it would seem, judgingby a recent speech by the ICI chairman to a conference attended by 100senior figures from business, academia and the accounting profession.Hampel rarely speculated on how his body might "carry the torch" handedto it by the Cadbury and Greenbury bodies on corporate governance andexecutive pay (respectively). Instead, he focused on what he viewed asthe damaging fall-out of the high profile lately attained by thesesubjects in the UK. A "visitor from Mars" would believe that "a newindustry" had developed in corporate governance, said Hampel. It wasquite worrying, he said, that this had been attended "almost byhysteria". In reviewing the landmark Cadbury code for listed companies,his group seeks to provide an environment in which business can prosperand grow, Hampel said."That is a fundamental behind all our deliberations. We must notstifle, we must stimulate," he said. Responding to a question, Hampeldenied that the Cadbury code is stifling business. But the furore thathas grown up around corporate governance had "denigrated industry" healleged.The Greenbury recommendations on executive pay were squarely in hissights. "All the public debate has been about boardroom excesses and99.9 percent of business has been dragged down with it. It needs to besaid all the time that business must prosper."The Hampel committee has sponsored research into Cadbury and Greenbury.However, Hampel said it would only have two sets of annual reports onwhich to comment on the latter, so it would be "dangerous to be tooprescriptive".The conference, at the London headquarters of the Institute ofChartered Accountants in England and Wales on November 1, coincidedwith the launch of a vast consultation exercise by Hampel. Thecommittee is seeking feedback from a wide range of bodies, includingsome in Europe and North America, on different aspects of its remit.The most important questions to which it is seeking answers areparaphrased below. When responses have been assessed, Hampel aims toissue a draft report in the middle of next year "to see if people thinkour conclusions are appropriate". A final report will follow at the endof 1997.Given the political context of Hampel's deliberations, the subject ofcorporate governance will continue to generate controversy. Theconference coincided with the publication of a report to the committeeby employer's body, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). TheCBI explicitly rejects the concept favoured by the opposition LabourParty that "stakeholders" such as employees, customers and suppliersshould be represented in boardrooms. The interest of shareholdersshould continue to be paramount, it says, dismissing the idea theseinterests could be accommodated in German-style two-tier boards.Hampel may have set a laissez-faire tone for the conference, but it wasnot adopted by every speaker. Anne Simpson, joint managing director ofgovernance consultancy Pension Investment Research Consultants, had "nosympathy" for those who think companies are over-regulated.Shareholders are beginning to turn up at AGMs "to ask questions and notjust eat the sandwiches", she said.Simpson demanded an end to the rubber-stamping of management decisionsin votes and the end of discretionary voting. Increasing shareholderactivity has led some companies to try and rewrite the rules, sheadded. They included British Aerospace, which moved to get rid ofthe"crucial" shareholders vote on its annual report and accounts.Ronald Hampel is a non-executive director of British Aerospace.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The result is that Daimler will have to continuepublishing earnings calculated in accordance with Germany's commercialcode alongside its US GAAP results.The Justice Ministry's decision has serious implications for DeutscheTelekom, which will face the same double book-keeping difficulties asDaimler next year when its shares are listed on the New York StockExchange.Jurgen Funck, state secretary at the Justice Ministry, indicated earlyin 1995 that a concession could be granted from the requirement topublish group accounts that comply with German reporting standardsprovided enough companies wanted to avail of it.In recent weeks, however, the ministry indicated several times thatopponents of the reform had gained the upper hand. Now Herbert Biener,head of accounting standards at the ministry, has made clear that theproposed reform has been defeated."We're not going to make this changejust for the sake of two or three companies," he said.First proposed in March 1995, the proposed concession would haveextricated Daimler-Benz from the double-accounting dilemma it has facedsince its shares were first listed in New York in 1993. Since then,Daimler has been obliged to produce group accounts under both US GAAPand the German commercial code and has come up with earnings figureswhich are sometimes poles apart.Led by Bayer and Schering, the opponents of reform were clearlyunwilling to assist Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Telekom in their questfor foreign capital by agreeing that their US GAAP consolidatedaccounts could be also acceptable for domestic regulatory purposes.They believe that, rather than US GAAP, international accountingstandards (IASs) should become the benchmark for German companiesseeking to raise capital abroad.While Biener believes that corporations and their accountants shouldvoluntarily adopt whatever reporting requirements are demanded byoverseas capital markets, he makes no bones about his preference forIASs. Speaking at a recent accounting conference in Gottingen, Bienerrepeatedly criticised Daimler's technique of double-accounting and thefact that it can produce contradictory results.IASC secretary-general Bryan Carsberg, who also spoke at theconference, welcomed the Germans' support for IASs. But he acknowledgedthe serious dilemma facing companies which will need a listing on theNew York Stock Exchange before IASs are endorsed by the Securities andExchange Commission - which will not happen until 1999 at the earliest.Carsberg said that companies in that position would have no choice butto produce US GAAP accounts, but he hoped that they would use optionsmost comparable with IAS so that it would be easy to change again toIASs after 1999. Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the EuropeanCommission, said it is doubtful that companies would want to return toIASs after adopting US GAAP standards, simply because of the upheavalinvolved.It remains to be seen how Daimler will respond, now that the companyfaces the prospect of having to produce a US GAAP reconciliation for atleast the next four years.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The proposals are contained in exposure draft FRED 10 whichthe standard-setter issued on December 7.Although FRS 1 brought the UK into line with international practice byscrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of acash flow statement, ASB chairman David Tweedie acknowledged that thetime has come for more improvement."The cash flow statement introduced by FRS 1 itself broke new groundand has proved both popular and valuable," Tweedie said. "We have nowgained sufficient experience in its practical use to be able to proposesignificant improvements."FRED 10's main features include a proposal to switch to a "pure" cashflow statement, with the concept of cash equivalents being dropped. Theexposure draft also proposes that expanded disclosures be provided in anew section dealing with the management of liquid resources. FRED 10would change the order and headings for cash flow to bring them intoline with those used by directors in their commentaries on operationsand finances. It would also tie the cash flow statement more closelyinto the balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flows on thewidely-used financial indicator, net debt."Our aim has been to make the cash flow statement simpler to understandand more descriptive of the way business is conducted," Tweedie said."The board believes that the changes represent a significant stepforward, and will be of real benefit to preparers and users ofaccounts. Not least of the improvements is the move to pure cash flowstatements."Comments of the new exposure draft should be sent to the ASB beforeMarch 8.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The working party expects to be able to link the proposedstandard with auditing rules, allowing the audit report to use thewords"true and fair . . . as applicable to small companies".If the proposals find support, the aim is to pass the paper to the ASBwhich has the power to turn the draft into a standard after the usualprocess of seeking comments on an exposure draft. Comments should bereturned to the working party by March 29.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

As many as 70 percent of securities could bereclassified as "available for sale" as bankers seek to maintainfunding flexibility under the new rule, which is an effort to giveinvestors a more accurate picture of a bank's worth.In November, FASB decided to allow banks to move securities from "heldto maturity" to"available for sale" before the end of the year. The one-time adjustments can be accomplished without forcing the institution torevalue all of the securities in its held-to-maturity category.The action already is having an effect. For instance, the First StateBank of Texas in Denton will use the new rule to make a larger share ofits securities available for sale, probably at a 70-30 split comparedwith the previous even split between the two accounts. The 70-30 splitis expected to become common among banks large and small by the end ofthe year.FASB is moving toward making banks mark more of their assets to marketvalues. FASB has also formally issued a draft of a proposed ruleeliminating some of the advantages of securitisations and long-termrepurchase agreements. Under the proposal, a securitised borrowing thatextends over 90 days will be treated as a purchase and sale (seereport, p8).It is all part of a continual, incremental effort to put more of thebalance sheet under mark-to-market rules. Some analysts expect theboard to consider marking liabilities to market sometime next year.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996ACCOUNTANTS GIVEN ULTIMATUM ON SELF-REGULATIONTHE GERMAN Government has served notice on the country's auditors thatthey must improve self-regulation to avoid having practice rulesimposed on the profession by law.Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingenin early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting policy atthe Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputychairman of the professional body of German accountants, the Institutder Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).Biener took issue with the profession's new quality standards,introduced just a few days earlier (CAI 64). Even under the new rules,he said, German accountants would still not be obliged to actively seekout evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts."The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said."Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The lawallows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obligedto argue things out with the company."Biener also criticised the IdW for its delay in dealing withshortcomings in the 1994 switch by Bayer, Schering and HeidelbergerZements to international accounting standards. Gross countered that itwas not feasible for the IdW's main practice committee to intervene atan earlier stage, but that the improvements it suggested would beincorporated into the companies' 1995 accounts.Biener acknowledged that Germany's leading accounting firms are world-class, but expressed concern about the profession's rank- and-filemembers. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise toaudits which are just average, rather they should allow accountantswith an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which isup to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died outbecause they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession hasgrasped that message."German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regainpublic confidence. "Our audits have become suspect," Biener said."Sooner or later, German accounts will no longer be accepted by theinternational community."In turn, Biener himself is under pressure from the European Commissionto introduce an accounting regulatory regime along the lines of thosethat exist in other EU member states. Addressing the Gottingenconference, Karel van Hulle, the commission's head of accountingpolicy, pointed out that most EU countries have already establishednational standard-setting bodies that can further Europe's accountinginterests in the deliberations of the International AccountingStandards Committee (IASC).Biener argued that bodies whose agendas are dominated by accountinginterests are not in the best position for regulating the profession.He said that since all accounting firms have their own commercialinterests, they may avoid making initiatives to change the status quo.Biener, therefore, suggested that German, and in turn Europeancompanies, set up a regulatory body modelled on the US FinancialStandards Accounting Board.In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea."Iwon't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] bodyoperates in a sensible fashion," he said. Gross of the IdW counteredthat the main practice committee is already operating as a standard-setter.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This resulted in a confusing system of doubleaccounting, with the company's US GAAP results often differingsignificantly from those calculated under German accountingregulations.Daimler's move is still resented by some of its corporate peers whichhad hoped that by presenting a united front in negotiations with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) they could have won exemptionfrom the more rigorous requirements of US GAAP. Yet at the time of its1993 Wall Street debut, Daimler had little choice; it needed access tocapital, and a New York listing - necessitating US GAAP accounts - wasthe best way to raise it.Liener was forced to resign from Daimler's management board in May 1995and responded by blaming the former chief executive, Edzard Reuter, fora policy of foolhardy expansion. Daimler-Benz is now in seriousfinancial difficulties and announced a loss of more than DM1 billion($692 million) in the first half of 1995.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

With between 120 and 150 partnersbelieved to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000per partner.The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADTfor Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million forBritannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989, which wereaudited by Binder.Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profitswere #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assetswere less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT waseventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit againstBinder in 1992.The judge in the case found Binder had been negligent in its audit ofBritannia and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADTbecause of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off onthe accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop wasasked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accountsgave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishopreplied that he did.Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted aduty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for anyadvice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which heldthat auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless ofwhether they are negligent.Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it willsucceed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparoprinciples apply," a spokesman said.BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of thefirm merged with Arthur Andersen. Other Binder offices merged with StoyHayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some of thepartners joined other accounting firms or went into industry.

The Manchester- basedcompany, which was owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and MartinHarrison, was mainly involved in leasing cars, property and computerequipment.Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a duediligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate financeadvice in connection with the transaction.In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations andadvice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceedwith the acquisition."It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisitionSovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the wayit was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position beenrevealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not haveproceeded with the acquisition."In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions ofSch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing, and in 1992 it forcedthe resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance ofits UK operations.Bank Austria also alleges error in a report by PW which stated thatSovereign made a profit of #3.4 million in 1991, when according to thebank it actually made a #1.4 million loss.However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted areal due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said thefirm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisitiontook place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuationat the time of the purchase."We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defendthem," Hainsworth said."If it is being alleged that we valued thecompany at between #30 million and #40 million for the purposes of thetransaction in June 1990, then emphatically we deny it."The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The casecould take two years to be heard.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED KINGDOM:  AUDITORS TO SEEK OFFSHORE LIMITED LIABILITYUK ACCOUNTING firms are set to follow the lead of their US counterpartsby setting themselves up as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). Themove is designed to protect their partners' personal assets in theevent of being successfully sued for negligence.Unlike the US Big Six, which took advantage of legislation introducedin the state of Delaware to become LLPs, UK accounting firms would haveto register their businesses offshore because UK law restricts limitedliability protection for partnerships.Attention is focused on the Channel Island of Jersey whose Parliamentis considering whether to recognise LLP status. While a dependency ofthe British Crown, Jersey does not form part of the UK and has ameasure of administrative independence, including its own legal and taxsystem.In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's Parliamentary Financeand Economics Committee said it would propose a bill to the island'sParliament permitting the creation of LLPs. Price Waterhouse and Ernst& Young have announced that they would register their UK practicesoffshore in Jersey if the island chooses to recognise LLP status.Under the proposed law, an LLP would remain liable for its debts, butindividual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligentact would have their personal assets protected from debts arising fromthat negligence.Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner, andall LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLPwould be required to provide a #5 million ($7.7 million) financialprovision - a sort of bond - for judgments against the partnership. Thedraft law will be debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey,during the first quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to thePrivy Council for sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-end."We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liabilitypartnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Ysenior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number ofclients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and therewould be no change to their UK tax arrangements. The Jersey option isclaimed to be cheaper than incorporating as a limited liabilitycompany, an option chosen by KPMG for parts of its UK audit practice in1995 (CAI 62). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates thesaving could be as much as 10 percent of pre- tax profits, comparedwith the cost of KPMG's chosen route.Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new lawin Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects andsurveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey."At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then youare liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to thatnegligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of CharteredAccountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change theprinciple of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Actof 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These thingstake time, and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law forpartnerships, which dates from 1907, as"not relevant to modern times".Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary legislationwould be needed to change it, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Swaps are accountedfor differently than foreign currency forwards. And foreign currencyforwards are accounted for differently than foreign currency options,"he told the annual conference on current financial reporting issuessponsored by the Financial Executives Institute.Sutton indicated that businesses need a single, articulated set ofguidelines to use. "There's no guidance at all in many areas," he said,adding that"the accounting literature for swaps is badly outdated". Hesaid the most recent guidance can be found only in a brief 60-wordconsensus published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)more than ten years ago.FASB is currently considering two other methods for accounting forderivatives. One would require valuing derivatives at market andcharging value changes against income if the derivatives are activelytraded, or against equity if they are long-term holdings. The othermethod would charge all changes in the values of derivatives againstincome.The SEC, meanwhile, is preparing a proposal that will mandate improveddisclosure about accounting policies, require quantified informationabout market risk and make companies analyse and state theirderivatives strategies. Release of the document was expected before theend of 1995 after receiving the approval of the SEC chairman.Sutton said the new disclosure requirements would essentially codifymany existing practices. Most companies that report derivativesexposure use one of three methods: value-at-risk; an interest ratesensitivity analysis; or a table of raw data showing present and futurecash flows.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

They suggest alternative measures that run counter to recentsuggestions, including Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) recommendationsadopted in 1995.Their report was commissioned by the federal government as backgroundfor debate on the upcoming review of the Canada Business CorporationsAct, planned for 1997.Ronald Daniels, dean of law at Toronto University, and Randall Morck, abusiness professor at Alberta University, believe that issues such asthe size of boards of directors or the level of insider ownership of acompany are largely irrelevant.The two professors say the government should neither encourage ordiscourage insider ownership of companies because there is no evidencethat concentrated ownership leads to a poorer performance. They alsosuggest that there is no point in separating the roles of chiefexecutive and chairman of the board and say governments should not tryto control the size of boards.In contrast, the TSE has said that companies should not have large,unwieldy boards, has called for the separation of the roles of chiefexecutive and chairman, and wants the board composed largely of outsidedirectors.The professors would, however, like to see increased focus on what theyconsider the root of one of the most important corporate governanceissues: non-arms'-length transactions between related companies, alsoknown as self-dealing. "This deals with the actual problem, not withthe symptoms of the problem," Morck said.The professors recommend that all companies with a dominant shareholderset up a special conduct committee of entirely independent outsidedirectors to review any proposed internal transactions.While they do not see the need to change current laws requiring atleast two independent directors on every board, they want thegovernment to tighten the definition of independence. They point outthat many so-called outside directors are company lawyers, advertisingexecutives or senior managers of companies with close businessrelationships. "Outside directors should be outsiders," Morcksaid."They should have no relationship whatever with the company."The professors also recommend that directors be paid only in stock orstock options, because that would align their interests with those ofthe shareholders. They also want directors to be held liable in class-action suits by shareholders, but only after the government has clearlydefined the limits of that liability, which they say should not extendbeyond the change in value to a company measured by the value of thedecline in share price.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Bank of Montreal and manufacturer NovaCorp were lauded for their "clear, effective" annual reports, describedby the judges as "shining and brilliant".Awards are handed out in 13 categories, including various resourcegroups, manufacturing, hi-tech, media, telecommunications, utilities,merchandisers, financial institutions and conglomerates. As well, thePost bestows annual environmental awards.The tie seems to reflect the overall improvement in the quality ofannual reports, said Philip Creighton, co-ordinator of the judges whorepresent the awards sponsors, the Canadian Institute of CharteredAccountants, the Canadian Investor Relations Institute and the TorontoSociety of Financial Analysts."The field is getting better," Creighton said, adding that there isstill room for improvement. For example, in the hi-tech sector - a newclass this year - it was often difficult to tell what a particularcompany was selling."I think it depends on how mature the industry is and how long it hasbeen worrying about these problems," Creighton said. "The basicindustries have made tremendous progress in being able to write abouttheir processes in a fashion that is understandable and in supplyinginformation. I can remember when all those industries were as bad as hi-tech is now."The Bank of Montreal was chosen as the winner in its category and forthe Award of Excellence because of its excellent separate financialgoals and measures section, which "provides insight into the bank'sperformance . . . The only weakness noted is consistent with all thebank reports reviewed - very limited revenue, cost and capitalsegmentation information."Nova Corp's report was praised as "a brilliant annual report loadedwith extensive disclosure and meaningful segmented information on alloperations".The Award of Excellence in the environmental awards went to NorthernTelecom. "Not only has Nortel issued an interesting and informativereport, but it has distinguished itself from other companies throughcontinued efforts to improve the quality of its environmentalreporting," the judges said.They particularly liked its"Lifecycle" approach, which looks at thecompany's products from concept to consumption, and clearly describesthe potential impact those goods have on the environment. And thejudges were especially pleased with Nortel's decision to produce fewerhard copies of the environmental report, making it available on thecompany's World Wide Web site instead.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The committee was set up a year ago in response torecommendations made by the TSE's corporate governance study."Although [Canadian] disclosure requirements are currently high, thereis enough non-compliance to cause concern," said Thomas Allen, acorporate lawyer and chairman of the committee. "The remedies toparties who are injured by lack of disclosure are clearly inadequate."Allen said his committee's recommendations would give those sufferinglosses as a result of inadequate or misleading disclosure reasonableopportunities to recover those losses.The committee also suggested that companies pay a minimum fine of C$1million or 5 percent of their market capitalisation - whichever ishigher - for misinformation. As well, major shareholders would beliable for unlimited sanctions if they knowingly influence companyofficials to release inaccurate information.Another recommendation was to broaden civil liability to include so-called continuous disclosure documents, such as quarterly financialreports and press releases. Currently, companies and directors areliable only for incorrect information in a prospects or takeovercircular.Moreover, investors would be able to seek damages from experts, such asconsultants, if their advice leads to misinformation. The liabilityceiling for experts would be the greater of C$1 million or three timesthe annual fees they receive from the company."We think [the penalties] are enough to get corporate Canada'sattention but not so much that it risks dramatically injuring corporateCanada," Allen said.He acknowledged that the recommendations will force companies to spendmore money to ensure that corporate documents are accurate. "We thinkthat the cost, whatever it is, is more than offset by the benefit toCanadian markets of the repute in which they will be held by virtue ofenhanced disclosure."Although Edward Waitzer, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission,hailed the report as "an outstanding piece of work", one of the TSEcommittee members thinks it does not go far enough. According toToronto lawyer Philip Anisman, C$25,000 "would not provide a level ofcompensation for investors that would warrant a class, or even anindividual, action".In a dissenting statement on the report, Anisman wrote:"It is alsoquestionable whether it would provide adequate deterrence. The ceilingon directors' or officers' liability should be the greater of at leastC$100,000 or their total compensation during the year preceding thedisclosure violation."Anisman also pointed out that the committee's recommendations containseveral loopholes that lessen the impact of the sanctions. For example,they exclude professional advisers, such as accountants and lawyers,from liability.The public has until March to comment on the proposals.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The conference will also address the Internet's manysecurity issues and concerns."The Internet is an open system and wasn't designed to be secure," saidJim Kates, the consultant in charge of conference activities. "Peopleusing the system usually aren't thinking about whether the data theyare transmitting is confidential or sensitive or not," he said, addingthat there are few products on the market today that can help keep asystem secure.Kates said this is especially problematic when the Internet is used forelectronic commerce. A system still needs to be devised for the sale ofsecurities and the transmission of confidential information that relieson mutual integrity and mutual authentication of buyer and seller andwhere the integrity of the data remains authentic, he said."There are some security products on the market, but they can beillegally accessed," he said. "It's useless to perform a transaction ifat any point in time it can be intercepted and changed."Kates said that, as for now, an auditor's best use of the Internet isas a reference source or marketing tool. "An auditor completing anenvironmental audit can find information on how to dispose of wastemore easily," he said. "Or a firm can search the net to find out howits new product stacks up against potential competition."There's a bulletin board where auditors can discuss audit issues.There are search utilities an accountant can use that will seek outinformation for him, by using key words, like `bank securities fraud'."IIA, like all major accounting bodies, has its own on-line base forsending pictures and text to members and other interested parties.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FASB SEEKS STANDARDISATIONJames R Peterson reports on FASB's efforts to develop accounting rulesfor the booming market in financial assetsTHE US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is close tocompleting a major effort to standardise accounting for transfers offinancial assets. A preliminary draft of the proposal has beenavailable for comment since October, and the board is encouragingparticipation at a hearing on the proposal scheduled for late February."The proposal breaks new ground in resolving long-standing questionsabout whether transactions should be accounted for as securedborrowings or as sales," said FASB project manager Halsey Bullen. "Theboard wanted to develop an approach that would be responsive todevelopments in the financial markets and have some consistency andrigour to it," he told CAI."There are any number of financial assets traded in today's boomingfinancial markets," he said. "This proposal will enable people to findsound answers to questions on how to account for new kinds oftransfers, such as securitisations, where you take a set of assets andtailor them to an investor's desire for a certain predictability incashflows and control over risk."The proposal covers transactions which until now were treatedseparately in accounting, such as securitisations, sales of partialinterests, repurchase agreements, securities lending, loan syndicationsand participations, sales of receivables with recourse, and servicingof mortgages and other loans.The document states that "the new standards would provide accountingand reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assetsand extinguishments of financial assets." Those standards would bebased on consistent application of the accounting method known as the"financial components approach", which has to do with the issue ofcontrol, a word that is central to any understanding of the newproposal.If a company has surrendered control over the transferred assets, thetransaction would be considered a sale. Otherwise, it would beaccounted for as a secured borrowing.A company would have to recognise all financial assets and servicing itcontrols and the liabilities it has incurred after a transfer offinancial assets. It would also have to remove from the balance sheetthose assets it no longer controls and those liabilities that it hassatisfied.In FASB's proposal, a lender has surrendered control only if all of thefollowing conditions are met:* The transferred assets have been isolated from the lender beyond itsreach and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership.* The lender obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferredassets.* Any agreement to repurchase the assets can be satisfied by deliveryof assets that are readily obtainable.* The transfer is not temporary.The plan would require that liabilities entered into as part of atransfer of financial assets initially be measured at fair value, ifpractical. It would require servicing assets to be measured byallocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold andretained interests based on their relative fair values on the transferdate.The FASB proposal also addresses the issue of loan impairment. After atransfer, servicing assets and liabilities would be subsequentlymeasured by amortisation over the period of estimated net servicingincome, with impairment to be recognised if the carrying amount ofunamortised servicing assets at risk exceeds their fair value.The proposal would allow elimination of a liability from the balancesheet only if a debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of itsobligation for the liability, or if a debtor is legally released fromprimary obligation for the liability by the creditor or by the courts.Bullen expects the proposal to spark some controversy. He saidcompanies that find they must report as a sale what they've beenreporting as borrowing will not like it because they may have torecognise a loss.The proposal could also dampen the use of "repos", or repurchaseagreements by banks. FASB wants to reclassify all repurchase agreementsmore than three months long as sales. At present, repos, in which oneparty sells securities to another and agrees to buy them back at aspecified price at a specified time, are treated as collateralisedloans.Banks are currently able to classify repos as "held to maturity" and donot have to mark them to market prices on a regular basis. If repos areclassified as sales, banks would have to mark the securities they sellto market and account for any gains or losses.Bullen, meanwhile, expects some heated discussion about FASB's plan toeliminate the distinction between normal servicing and excess servicingof mortgages. This change might allow an inefficient mortgage servicerincurring costs exceeding receivables to account for the transaction inthe same way as a more efficient servicer.While constructing its new approach, FASB looked closely at theInternational Accounting Standards Committee's proposed internationalaccount standard on Financial Instruments, which would permitderecognition of financial assets and liabilities upon transfer of"substantially" all underlying risks and rewards.FASB found this standard insufficiently consistent because it is opento varied interpretations.When approved, the proposal will supersede a number of FASB standards,including Statement 76, Extinguishment of Debt, and Statement 77,Reporting by Transferor for Transfers of Receivables with Recourse.It would also amend Statement No. 115, Accounting for CertainInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities, to clarify that a securitymay not be classified as held-to-maturity if it can be prepaid orsettled so that the holder of the security would not recoversubstantially all of its investment.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996OIL GIANTS HIT BY NEW FASB RULEA new standard dealing with impairment of long-lived assets is set totake its toll on the fourth-quarter earnings of US oil companies. JamesR Peterson reportsSHAREHOLDERS WILL see their dividends from US oil and gas stocksreduced as companies come to grips with a new standard, Accounting forImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, from the Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB).The move is unlikely to cause unusual concern, however, because theeffect on dividends will be temporary, affecting earnings in a singlequarter, and because the new accounting rule ultimately will allowshareholders to better predict a company's future earnings.Texaco is taking a fourth-quarter charge of $640 million, whichanalysts say will swing the company's quarterly results into a loss.Earlier this year, Burlington Resources, Ashland and Phillips Petroleumrespectively took $304 million, $90 million and $49 million in charges.Besides Texaco, at least two other oil giants, Mobil and Chevron,expect to take big charges related to the new FASB rule.The new rule, Standard 121, was implemented so that investors couldbetter assess the true worth of a company's assets. The new rule callsfor all US companies to compare the future expected values of assetsagainst current book value. If the future values are less than book,the company must write down the value of that asset.Oil and gas companies are particularly affected by the rule changebecause it is the first time they have had to assess each of theirproducing fields on a case-by-case basis. Under a previous informalSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule, oil fields wereevaluated on a nationwide or worldwide basis. The SEC allowed the firmsto offset those fields that had a value less than book against otherswith higher values."Aside from the SEC rule for the oil and gas industries, there was nostandard for impairment of fixed assets until FASB adopted the currentstandard last spring," according to FASB project manager Carmen Bailey,who said it is hard to predict which other industries are facing largewrite-downs.George Batavick, Texaco's assistant comptroller, emphasised that thecompany's fourth-quarter write-down is a one-time-only, non- cash eventand that the assets in question are only technically impaired. "Theassets are producing positive earnings and positive cash flow," hesaid. "But since the cash flow on an undiscounted basis would notrecover the investment that is on our books, the FASB rule necessitateda write-down.""Under the old SEC rule, we looked at our producing oil fields in theaggregate," Batavick explained. "In the aggregate, we had highinvestment fields being paired with low investment fields and the cashflows exceeded the total investment. However, on a field-by-fieldbasis, the individual cashflows of particular high investment fieldswere not recovered by the cashflows."The write-down was based on Texaco's estimate of the current and futurevalue of each of its oil fields. "If you have acquired a property whenits price was high, and today's prices are lower, the carrying value ofthe asset must be reduced to come into line with today's prices andwhat we expect the value of the property will be in the future."Batavick said the question of valuing assets becomes a problem when acompany acquires a large firm with highly valued assets. Key toTexaco's write-down is its recent acquisition of Getty Oil Company."Investors ought to feel more secure," he said, "because the write-downwould otherwise have been reported as a depreciation expense in futureyears."The new rule establishes standards for "impairment of long- livedassets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to thoseassets to be held and used", and also for"long-lived assets and certainidentifiable intangibles to be disposed of".The original scope of the FASB project was limited to accounting forthe impairment of long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles. Theboard decided to include goodwill related to impaired assets afterdeciding that long-lived assets could not be tested for impairmentwithout also considering the goodwill arising from the acquisition ofthose assets.The board also decided to include depreciation in the scope of itsproject because it found that the choice of depreciation method andestimates of useful life of an asset could have an impact on whether animpairment exists. FASB suggests that an asset's depreciation methodshould be reviewed periodically and changed if current estimates of theasset's value differ significantly from previous estimates.The history of Standard 121 extends to July 1980 when the AccountingStandards Executive Committee of the American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants (AICPA) urged FASB to provide more accountingguidance for the impairment of fixed assets. No action was taken untilthe mid-1980s when FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) took up theissue. EITF members, noting a significant increase in the size andfrequency of write-downs of long-lived assets, suggested there was aneed for a single rule.In 1989, a report by the Institute of Management Accountants revealed acontinuing steady increase in write-downs and called for moreauthoritative guidance on accounting for impairment of long-livedassets.As a result of these recommendations, FASB added a project to itsagenda in 1988 and issued for comment a discussion memorandum,Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and IdentifiableIntangibles. The final exposure draft, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,was issued last year and the new standard was adopted last March.Standard 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal yearsbeginning after December 15 1995. However, some firms, like Texaco,have chosen early application of the rule.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE ACCOUNTING INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITHFollowing publication of an extensive study of international accountingpractices, Gerry Acher, KPMG's head of audit and accounting in the UK,traces the background to the IASC's new- found prominenceIT IS increasingly recognised that international accounting standardsare a force to be reckoned with - as demonstrated by the publication inDecember of TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting - and the man whoignores them risks being left by the wayside while others set the pace.In essence, their importance arises because international standards areneeded and international accounting standards (IASs) fit the bill,having been markedly improved in recent years.When the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) wasfounded in 1973, part of the dream was that a single set of standardswould allow a company to raise finance anywhere in the world. Thatdream has become a pressing need. Companies around the world grapplewith other people's standards in order to tap foreign capital markets.In particular, entry to US capital markets is open only to those whoprepare their financial statements in accordance with US accountingprinciples, or who reconcile their domestic financial statements tothese principles. There are a few exemptions from this for specificareas of accounting.What irks companies is not so much the differences in the rulesthemselves as the fact that they are another country's rules; the firmshave had no input to the development of these rules, and there is alittle bit of national pride at work. For example, some Europeancountries feel particularly aggrieved when they are required to use USGAAP.With the world as its constituency, the IASC does not have thisproblem. Almost everyone has reached this conclusion. The GermanGovernment has let it be known that it will tolerate the use of IASsfor domestic purposes. The issue is also under consideration in France.The European Commission has also softened its stance. There were earlymutterings of a Euro-ASB, but in the end, reason triumphed over badhabit. The commission wants to work with the IASC and to allow Europeancompanies to prepare their consolidated accounts under IASs.Most significantly, however, capital market regulators across theworld, in the form of the International Organisation of SecuritiesCommissions (IOSCO), have reached a milestone agreement with the IASC.IOSCO agrees that the current list of IASs contains a nucleus ofacceptable standards. Moreover, it will work with the IASC to try toensure that 15 new or revised IASs, to be issued by 1999, will also beacceptable to IOSCO. If that can be achieved, IOSCO will endorse theIASs for use in listings anywhere in the world. In theory this includesNew York, and the achievement of this is a prime goal of the exercise.London already accepts IASs.ImprovementThat IASs have reached this position is a testament to theirimprovement in recent years. At one time they were thought of as thelowest common denominator. But during almost ten years in office, DavidCairns, former IASC secretary-general, steered the organisation througha major revisions project, cutting out many of the optional treatments,and bringing it to the top table among the standard-setters.Cairns's successor, Sir Bryan Carsberg, who brings to his roleconsiderable authority and experience in the accounting and politicalfields, now talks on equal terms with his counterparts at, for example,the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the American FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB). In the list of five bodiescollaborating on recent international studies on future events, hedgingand provisioning, you will find the IASC.National standard-setters want international convergence as far aspossible, and not purely from a theoretical viewpoint; convergence hasstrong practical attractions too.First, there are obvious advantages in borrowing, or participating in,others' research. Countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong take thisapproach to its ultimate conclusion and base their accounting systemsdirectly on IASs.And second, there are real benefits for preparers and users. It wouldbe a genuine convenience for international groups to have the same setof accounting principles for local and group reporting. When companiesdo cross-border mergers and acquisitions they become users ofaccounting information. If the two parties spoke the same accountinglanguage it would be one less obstacle to deal-making. And it would begood economics. The better everyone understands the information, thebetter the resource-allocation decisions will be.How are standard-setters pursuing this goal? They now look to theIASC's work as the reference point. The UK's ASB does this. Most of itsproposals regard developments at the IASC. For example, the draftStatement of Principles owes much to the IASC's Framework. In addition,the appendices to FRS 4 and FRS 7 go to the trouble of explaining whyit was felt necessary to depart from IASs in those standards. But we donot just respond to the IASC; with Sir David Tweedie newly appointed tothe IASC board, the UK's standard-setting body is strongly representedin the process.PrinciplesI am particularly pleased that principles rather than rules are thebasis of the international standards. We must fight to retain thisgeneral approach, and not allow the standards to drift towards a cook-book approach. The differences from our own standards are limited,although sometimes significant.For example, the IAS definition of a merger is very similar to theUK's. And like FRS 6, merger accounting must be adopted if thedefinition is met; acquisition accounting applies in other cases.Acquisition accounting itself is very similar but, crucially, it wouldaccommodate the acquirer's intentions, such as reorganisations, in thefair value exercise. The end product of this is goodwill. Here a majordifference crops up.Under IAS 22, positive goodwill must be capitalised and amortised overup to 20 years. Negative goodwill is used to reduce the values assignedto the non-monetary acquired assets and any remaining amount treated asdeferred income, to be spread over up to 20 years. Alternatively, thewhole amount may be dealt with as deferred income.The UK approach is largely to write off goodwill directly to reserves.While this is under review, it seems likely that even if the UKrequires goodwill to be capitalised, the amortisation requirement willdiffer significantly from that of IAS 22.It is important to be aware of such differences and of the futuredirection of the international standard-setters. If convergence ofstandards - or at least an acceptable set of international standards -is to be achieved, more interest in their development is necessary thanhas been shown hitherto.Staying with intangible assets for a moment, development costs areanother area of difference. Under IAS 9, if certain conditions are met,then development costs must be capitalised (and subsequentlyamortised). For those who think that the IASC takes its lead from theUS this is a salutary lesson; under US GAAP, development costs arenever capitalised.Like the UK, IAS 16 permits fixed assets to be revalued. Unlike the UK,it requires revaluations to be done on a class-by-class basis and to bekept up to date. If such a requirement was in force in the UK then manyof the anomalies of its present mixed system would be alleviated.Accounting for financial instruments - including derivatives - is aproblem for everyone. At present, the IASC has a standard coveringdisclosure and presentation (IAS 32). No standard-setter yet has acomprehensive measurement standard. The IASC aims to have one by June1997. In the meantime, IAS 32 should keep preparers, auditors and usersoccupied. Its disclosures of credit risk, fair values and hedges aredemanding and informative. Its presentation rules are innovative.Freed from the constraints of a legal framework, the IASC is able torequire companies to report preference shares that contain anobligation as debt. On top of that, hybrid instruments, such asconvertible debt, are to be split into debt and equity elements andseparately accounted for.Some of the other differences from UK standards are as follows:* Jointly-controlled entities may be proportionately consolidated;jointly-controlled assets must be proportionately consolidated. (Onlyunincorporated joint ventures may use this treatment in the UK).* The cumulative exchange differences on the net investment in aforeign entity are presented as a component of equity. They aresubsequently taken into the calculation of profit or loss on anydisposal of the foreign entity. There are no such requirements in theUK.* When translating the financial statements of a foreign entity, theprofit and loss account should be translated at the actual or averagerates. The UK also permits the closing rate to be used.* The minority interest in a subsidiary may be based on the relevantshare of the pre-acquisition book values of the subsidiary, as opposedto the fair value as mandated in the UK.* The current portion of long-term debt may be excluded from currentliabilities where the company can and intends to refinance it on a long-term basis. This is not generally possible under the UK's FRS 4.* Only a major line of business could qualify as a discontinuedoperation. The UK definition refers to a material effect on the natureand focus of operations. Moreover, the discontinued operation's profiton ordinary activities - that is, before extraordinary items and thusafter interest and tax - must be disclosed. Discontinued interest andtax need not be disclosed in the UK.* Extraordinary items are more possible. IAS 8 cites earthquakes andexpropriation of assets as examples. Such events would be withinordinary activity under the UK's FRS 3.As mentioned earlier, 15 new or revised standards are expected from theIASC by 1999. In part these will fill gaps in the portfolio - forexample, at present there are no comprehensive standards onpresentation (i.e. the form of accounts) or on earnings per share. Butthere are also some contentious issues in the pipeline. In addition toa measurement standard for financial instruments, a revised standard ondeferred tax (due soon) and a new standard on intangibles (due in June1996) are on the way. These last two present difficulties ofharmonisation.FundamentalThe UK and the US use fundamentally different bases for bothrecognition and measurement of deferred tax. The UK recognition basisis the well known timing differences approach, whereas the US seeks torecognise the tax that would arise on a realisation of all of theassets and liabilities at their book values, known as the temporarydifferences approach. The UK, increasingly the international odd-man-out, provides only partially for timing differences; the US provides infull for its temporary differences.There is no synthesis of these two systems; whichever way the IASC'sjudgment goes - and the indications are that they will find in favourof the US bases - discord will be the result.With intangibles, the issue is the extent to which they can beseparated from goodwill. In the UK, the current proposal would allow,for example, an acquired brand to be separated out where its fair valuecould be reliably measured. The IASC's proposal (E50) agrees inprinciple. However, it does not regard a measurement based ondiscounted future revenues - as is typically the case for brands - assufficiently distinct from the measurement of goodwill to meritseparate recognition.The IASC has come a long way. In the field of accounting developmentsit has moved, unnoticed by many, from the rearguard to the van. But thecampaign is not over yet. If the world is to move forward we mustachieve the goal of listing on a US exchange under IAS. This is whatthe IASC is fighting for; it deserves our attention, co-operation andsupport.TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting is published by Macmillan, price#350, and provides a fully-comparative guide to official accountingrules and their practical applications for 14 national regimes, plussystematic explanations of IASC standards and the 4th and 7th EUdirectives.

But, as CAI reports, an early resolution of the  complexissues involved seems unlikelyMORE THAN a year after a group of creditor banks announced a DM255million ($180 million) lawsuit against Price Waterhouse over its auditsof two German companies brought to the brink of bankruptcy by allegedfraud, the court case opened in Frankfurt at the end of November.But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, thejudge quickly proposed an adjournment until after former executives ofthe two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat, have been triedon charges of criminal fraud.The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for severalyears because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes toprove that the former executives of credit factoring company, Procedo,and its biggest customer, sports-surface manufacturer Balsam, engagedin fraudulent transactions that led to the collapse of both companies.Muscat, who advised both companies, is accused of "deliberateinvolvement" with the alleged frauds.Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his caseagainst PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partnersacted with the intention to defraud, rather than just negligently. Buthe is unwilling to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to aprolonged adjournment. After both sides had consulted with theirclients, the court planned to reconvene on December 19 to make a finaldecision on the adjournment.The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of "intentional misconduct"in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approvingthe accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added anew claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval withoutactually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.The alleged fraud centres on Procedo's factoring transactions withBalsam which led it to advance cash to the manufacturing company inreturn for collecting its trade receivables. Prosecutors claim thefactored invoices were doctored to make Balsam's turnover look biggerthan it was. Balsam filed for bankruptcy in June 1994 after its topmanagement was arrested on suspicion of fraud, a move that precipitatedProcedo's petition for protection from its creditors. The biggestcasualties were the companies' bankers which claim to be owed DM2.3billion.PW's involvement stems from its audits of Balsam, which it undertookjointly with a Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, FMP. Muscat, a partner inboth PW and FMP, audited Procedo in an individual capacity. He wasarrested in August 1994 on charges of fraud.In an interview with CAI, PW's senior partner in Germany, WolfgangKrause, said his firm may have to be bailed out by PW's European firmif the creditor banks are awarded the legal damages they are seeking.Krause said PW Europe would "naturally" provide financial support sincethe German practice has no funds to pay an out-of- court settlement,let alone the full sum of DM255 million for which it is being sued. "Wedon't have any possibility to build reserves," he said, citing the highcost of personnel, information technology, training and liabilityinsurance in Germany.That insurance, however, is unlikely to cover the millions PW could endup paying as a result of the Balsam/Procedo lawsuit. In remarks aboutthe German accounting profession in general, Ulf Pohl, managingdirector of Wirtschaftliche Versicherungsstellethe, the leadingprovider of professional indemnity insurance cover for accountants inGermany, said firms invariably take up "substantially less" than themaximum cover of DM70 million that he offers.Moreover, Pohl said German corporate law makes it impossible foraccountancy firms to insure against "intentional misconduct" by theirpartners. In the Balsam/Procedo suit, PW and six of its partners areaccused of precisely that misdemeanour.While the court action is now under way, PW still hopes it can reachagreement out of court. "Our legal counsel is strongly urging us to seethe case through, but we don't want this business to go for another tenyears," Krause said.Meanwhile, there is little evidence that PW has been damaged by theunfavourable publicity generated by the lawsuit. Only six partners haveleft or retired (including Muscat and Gerd Frielingsdorf, two of thosenamed in the suit), and fee income continues to rise.Provisional figures for the year to the end of last June showed grossrevenues of DM253 million, up 5.4 percent from the previous year.Revenues for 1995/96 are projected at DM275 million.Those figures make PW the smallest of the Big Six in Germany, butKrause explained that the firm's approach to the market differs fromthat of its larger competitors. Its share of statutory audit work isprobably smaller than that of any other major German firm; instead itfocuses on audit-related projects such as due diligence, treasurymanagement, internal audit consulting and balance sheet planning forcompanies which are not statutory audit clients.Like PW firms in other markets, the German firm likes to regard all itsprofessionals as"consultants". Many assignments are awarded inconnection with mergers and acquisitions where PW's corporate financesubsidiary has acted as a consultant. In fiscal 1995, audit workaccounted for 40 percent of fee income compared with 43 percent theyear before. At other Big Six firms in Germany, the figure is around 60percent.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

After years ofdancing round the issue, the world's stock market regulators finallycame to an agreement with the International Accounting StandardsCommittee (IASC) on a timetable for a set of core standards that wouldbe acceptable for cross-border listings and capital raising.Having been dismissed for years as a well-intentioned but ineffectualstandard-setter, the IASC could not conceal its delight. AustralianMichael Sharpe, who took over the role of IASC chairman on July 1,hailed the agreement with the International Organisation of SecuritiesCommissions (IOSCO) as an "historic moment"."Companies should now feel confident that the IASC and IOSCO are fullycommitted to developing IASs that will be acceptable everywhere in theworld and recognise the efficiencies that may be obtained from usingIASs," he said. "At the moment, companies using IAS standards can raisecapital on many global stock exchanges. Now they know that they will beable to access all of them in the not-too-distant future. Not justwhole companies, but whole countries will now move to IAS rules."Amid the jubilation, however, the huge task facing the IASC between nowand the end of the decade must not be underestimated. Included in the15 standards that the IASC has agreed to issue or revise at IOSCO'sbehest are some of accounting's most controversial issues, such asfinancial instruments, intangible assets and leasing.Even if the IASC manages to stick with its ambitious timetable, its newand revised standards would still have to be endorsed by IOSCO'stechnical committee before they can be recognised as acceptable forcross-border listings in all capital markets. The final hurdle will begetting the national securities regulators to recognise IASs in theirrule books.The stance adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),which regulates entry to the world's biggest capital market, will beespecially important. Domestic US companies are determined that theyshould not have to compete head-on for the same capital with foreignregistrants that are not subject to the full rigours of US GAAP.Research unveiled in the spring of 1995 suggests, however, that the gapbetween IASs and US GAAP may not be as wide as is generally thought.According to Trevor Harris, the accounting professor at New York'sColumbia University, who undertook the study: "We found that at leastfor firms utilising the IASC's revised International AccountingStandards there are few instances, especially from an investor'sperspective as opposed to a technical accounting perspective, where thecompanies' compliance with IASs would not meet US GAAP."Harris also noted that endorsement of IASs would not necessarily weakenthe SEC's hand. "If the SEC believes a company is hurting investors byobfuscating the information, despite apparent compliance with IASs,then it can still impose its regulatory control if the company isregistered," he said.With so much attention to keeping the Americans on side, some of theIASC's other power brokers are concerned that their interests are beingpushed to one side. Those concerns have been heightened with therealisation that political squabbles about the future direction of IASsare being overtaken by events on the ground, as more multinationalcompanies switch to US GAAP in return for entry to the New York StockExchange.The hegemony of US GAAP led the European Commission, in particular, tosignal that it might intervene to halt the slide. Addressing a meetingof European accountants at the end of 1994, John Mogg, the commission'sdirector general for the internal market and financial services, said:"We must recognise that Europe cannot escape its own responsibility toshape accounting standards. We cannot be merely reactive to thesolutions put forward by others."Mogg's sentiments were amplified by Karel van Hulle, head of thecommission's accounting standards unit. After acknowledging theshortcomings of the commission's existing accounting directives duringan address to the European Accounting Association in May, van Hulleadded: "We have to change our approach in the area of financialreporting or the European input into the debate will diminish. Idisagree with those who argue that this is a good thing. Something hasto be done to prevent the directives becoming a burden on progress."Such talk raised fears inside and outside Europe that Brussels waspreparing to go it alone in harmonising the accounting practices of theEU's 15 member states. Those fears, however, were eventually put torest at IOSCO's annual conference in July, when Mario Monti, thecommissioner responsible for accounting policy, signalled that Brusselswould seek to work through the IASC as the best way to harmoniseaccounting practices both within the EU's member states and with theoutside world."Agreement on IASs would enable us to enter negotiations with otherregions aimed at securing mutual recognition of public offer andlisting prospectuses based on these same IASs," Monti said. "We believecompanies should only be required to prepare one set of consolidatedaccounts, and we plan to examine the possibility for European companieswith an international vocation to prepare their consolidated accountson the basis of IASs."Brussels' embrace of IASs is also mirrored by a realisation among someheavyweight EU member states that, rather than fretting from thesidelines about the IASC's perceived Anglo-Saxon bias, it is better tomake their voices heard by playing a more active role in thedeliberations of the global standard-setter. Most European countries,however, are hampered by the fact that they do not have strong standard-setting bodies, such as the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) orthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the US, which couldfly their flags at the IASC.France, for one, is set to remedy that situation with the announcementby economy minister Jean Arthuis that he plans to set up a state bodywith the power to issue binding pronouncements on financial reporting.Addressing the 50th congress of the country's professional accountancybody, the Ordre des Experts Comptables, Arthuis warned that France'sexisting accounting regime, which is based on legislation rather thanprivate-sector standards, "is threatened with sclerosis".A key feature of Arthuis's proposed Comite de la ReglementationComptable (CRC) is that its pronouncements would draw heavily on IASs.That could remove a big obstacle facing capital-hungry Europeancompanies: the need to prepare multiple, and often contradictory,accounts to satisfy the needs of both domestic regulators and overseasstock markets. "I would like to say that I find this ambiguoussituation unacceptable," Arthuis said. "It leads to questions about thetruthfulness of the accounts of large French companies and isdetrimental to their credibility."The half-year results of Pechiney provided a prime example of whatArthuis was referring to. In the run-up to its planned Novemberprivatisation, the aluminium and packaging group switched to US GAAPand reported a Fr658 million ($130 million) profit for the six monthsto the end of June.But France's stock market regulator, the Commission des Operations deBourse (COB), took exception to Pechiney's new accounting policies,highlighting the fact that if it had stuck with local reportingrequirements it would have reported a small loss for the period. Theuncharacteristically public rebuke from the COB came at a bad time forPechiney, as its shares were already facing general indifference frominvestors.Pechiney's predicament is familiar to companies in neighbouringGermany. Because its accounting traditions are so out of step with whatis demanded by international investors, Germany has been forced toundertake a fundamental rethink of its approach to financial reporting.A radical solution emerged from Bonn in the spring of 1995 when justiceministry official Herbert Biener proposed that German companies withglobal ambitions could be allowed to use IASs or US GAAP for theirconsolidated financial statements and would only have to respectdomestic accounting requirements in individual company financialstatements.Biener's proposals come at a time when another German company - thistime the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom - ispreparing to follow the lead of Daimler-Benz and list its shares in NewYork. Unless Biener's proposal finds its way onto the statute books byearly next year, however, Telekom will find itself in the samepredicament as Daimler: having to issue two different sets of groupresults, one that complies with German accounting regulations, theother with US GAAP.For both companies, a crucial aspect of Biener's proposal is that USGAAP would be an equally-acceptable alternative to IASs as a basis fordrafting consolidated accounts. Their interest lies in removingobstacles to listing their shares in New York, and the SEC will notaccept accounts drawn up on the basis of IASs.Such a radical solution, however, is causing unease in some quarters ofGermany's corporate establishment. Companies like Bayer and Hoechsthave never accepted what they see as Daimler's capitulation to theexcessive demands of the SEC in terms of disclosure. Instead, theyfavour IASs (Bayer adopted IASs for its 1994 accounts; Hoechst plannedto do so for its 1995 financial statements) because, unlike theformulation of US GAAP, Germany has an input into IASs andrepresentation on the board of the IASC.Sharpe summed up their fears in an address to the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges at the beginning of October. "I believe that itis unacceptable that a sovereign state de facto delegates to anotherstate the drawing up of their accounting standards," he said."Delegating to an international institution in which many sovereignstates have their say is one thing, whereas delegating to another stateis quite another."Germany is also divided on the need for a national standard- settingbody along the lines of France's proposed CRC. According to JohannesMaret, Arthur Andersen's senior partner in Frankfurt: "A standard-setting body would be responsible for exacting greater influence in theformulation of IASs and checking whether these were compatible withGerman law."On the other hand, Dietrich Dorner, outgoing president of theprofessional body for German accountants, the Institut derWirtschaftsprufer, believes the need for a consensus approach instandard-setting would weaken the standard of financial reporting inGermany."I'm not optimistic that [a standard-setting body] would be any betterthan what we have at the moment," he told CAI in November. "It wouldpronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effectwould be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."Whatever route German companies eventually take to make their accountsmore useful to international investors, it is clear that the existingpractice of making generous provisions for a wide variety of possibleliabilities and losses will have to be curbed. While billed as anexample of German accounting's conservative bent, over-generousprovisions are also a classic devise for smoothing earnings bydepressing profits in good years and bumping up the bottom lines whentimes are bad.The IASC took aim at that practice at the end of November with adiscussion paper which proposes that provisions for future operatinglosses should be banned except where they result from contractualcommitments. A similar line was taken in separate documents issued bystandard-setters in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, which hadworked with the IASC on the provisions issue.Unveiling the UK discussion paper, ASB chairman David Tweedie said:"Some will say the restriction on provisions is imprudent but we don'twant phoney liabilities . . . with forecast future losses we sometimesget into psychoanalytic accounting; it's like trying to read your mind.If you want to recognise [future losses] let's have a detailed planfirst. You can't smack in phoney liabilities because you intend toreorganise."Such thinking goes against the current trend in the British bankingindustry, which took advantage of record profits in 1995 to bump up bad-debt provisions. Such efforts to iron out the cyclical swings thatcharacterise bank earnings have the blessing of regulators. "It seemsto me preferable to recognise that expected losses, particularly ifthey can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, have been incurred whena loan is written rather than waiting until the loss materialises,"according to Bank of England executive director Brian Quinn.And awash with profits, the banks have been more than willing to heedQuinn's advice. Barclays Bank introduced so-called defaultprovisioning, involving up-front provisions based on expected lossesover the life of a loan; Lloyds Bank opted for a once-off #120 million($200 million) boost to its general provision for bad debts based onfears that higher inflation would hasten another economic downturn anda desire to avoid having to raise provisions sharply in the future.Financial instruments are an accounting issue guaranteed to dictate thepace for both banks and their large corporate clients for some time tocome. Following explosive growth in the use of derivatives in recentyears, calls for tighter regulation of the market have been matched bygreater urgency in the push to develop accounting standards that candeal with the complexity of financial instruments.Even before the dramatic collapse of Barings Bank in February, the IASChad declared that its financial instruments project "remains theboard's single highest priority for 1995 and beyond". That culminatedin the May publication of IAS 32, which deals with disclosure andpresentation issues. The fact that the standard had been in thepipeline for six years, and that measurement and disclosure offinancial instruments remain to be tackled, demonstrate the complex andcontentious nature of the issues involved."Both investors and lenders need to have a much better idea of whetherrisky derivatives are being used," said IASC technical director LieselKnorr when the standard was unveiled. "The disclosures which we are nowasking for will make it much easier to assess the risks that companiesrun when they use financial instruments such as derivatives."Meanwhile, progress on the second phase of the financial instrumentsproject, dealing with recognition and measurement, continues slowly,with the next milestone expected to be a discussion paper to be issuedby the end of 1996.That perennial bugbear of the accounting industry - goodwill andintangible assets - continued to grab the headlines in 1995. The yearkicked off with drugs company Wellcome using the UK's lenient goodwillrequirements as part of an unsuccessful challenge to a hostile takeoverbid from pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo. Wellcome charged that Glaxo's bidcould prejudice rival bidders from overseas because they would have toamortise the ensuing goodwill against future profits, whereas Glaxo, asa UK company, could choose to write-off the goodwill immediatelyagainst reserves.Australia's Pacific Dunlop also pointed to what it perceives as theUK's unfair advantage in goodwill amortisation in a row with regulatorsduring 1995. With the Australian Accounting Standards Board expected toissue an exposure draft by year's end that requires goodwill to beamortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years, PacDun noted thatthis is more onerous than the treatment permitted in the UK or in theUS and Canada, which allows goodwill to be written off over 40 years.PacDun's concerns, however, could prove short-lived, at least asregards the UK. In June, the ASB issued a working paper that proposesthe abolition of reserve accounting for goodwill. Tweedie outlined theproposals as follows: "For companies wanting to take thestraightforward option, intangible assets and goodwill may becapitalised and depreciated over a maximum of 20 years with only aminimal annual recoverability review. On the other hand, for companieswishing to show the critical value to their businesses of intangibleassets and goodwill, there will be no need to make an arbitraryamortisation charge each year. Instead, continuing value can bedemonstrated by a review of future cash-flow forecasts."That approach differs from exposure draft E50, issued by the IASC inJune, which rejected the ASB's view that some intangibles need never beamortised. The eventual shape of a revised UK goodwill standard,however, remains anyone's guess.As part of a lengthy process to ensure broad-based support, the ASBheld its first-ever public hearing at the beginning of October at whichits goodwill proposals were put to the floor. With little consensus onthe specifics of the standard-setter's proposals - most disagreementcentred on the ASB's proposed impairment tests to determine if goodwillshould be subject to a once-off write down - a standard remains sometime away.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Interest in applications such as image archive and retrieval,image positive pay and CD-ROM delivery will continue to skyrocket,predicts David Medeiros, a consulting analyst with The Tower Group,based in Wellesley, Mass.     The coming year also could bring wider acceptance of the Internetfor transmitting sensitive data; the long-awaited introduction ofRapid*EDI; less interest in electronic data interchange (EDI); andmore banks using electronic check presentment (ECP), say consultantsin assessing last year's trends. Banks Offer Image Processing     "As soon as enough large banks have installed image-based cashmanagement, corporate banking customers will come to expect it.  Ifyour bank's not offering it, they'll find [a bank] that is," Medeirosnoted.     Indeed, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, Bank of Boston andChemical Banking Corp.'s New York-based Geoserve division came tomarket in recent weeks offering check images on CD-ROM (CORP, Dec. 27,p. 7).     Chemical also announced plans last year to integrate imaging intoall phases of its check operations, including proof-of-deposit andarchiving.     The technology allows firms to use search and retrieval softwareto pull up a check image on a personal computer screen, as opposed tofinding the image on microfilm or pulling a paper check out of astorage box, the banks say.       "Many [banks] anticipate that they will be able to resolvetelephone inquiries while the payee or customer is still on thephone," added Mary Ann Hardy, an image product manager at Bank ofBoston.     Similarly, many banks began offering image-enabled wholesalelockbox processing last year, including Harris Bank, based in Chicago(CORP, Dec. 27, p. 7).       The bank says the technology will streamline its operations andprovide customers with reduced storage needs and immediate access tocheck and remittance images for faster accounts receivable-posting andreconcilement.     Using the lessons of history, here's a look at the major storiesof 1995 and how they'll relate to the decisions you'll be making thisyear:          *  Best Marriage of Technologies:  Interbank check imaging.  Bycombining check imaging and electronic check presentment (ECP), theFinancial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) developed a paperlesscheck clearing process to reduce check fraud and provide faster accessto funds (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 1).  Banks also will benefit from faster,cheaper check clearing, FSTC says.     Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, Bank of Boston, Citibankof New York and Chemical, exchanged digitized check images acrossdissimilar systems as part of a pilot sponsored by FSTC.  "Theultimate aim of interbank check imaging is check truncation," notesone FSTC member.      The next steps for interbank check imaging involve addingsecurity features, anticipated industry standards, and remote storagecapabilities.     *  Biggest Development in Electronic Commerce:  The multiple newproducts promising hardware-based encryption and back-end support forInternet commerce.     "There has been a lot of hype about the potential for break-ins,but now with recent [product] developments, the Internet is viable,"explains Iang Jeon, senior analyst with Forrester Research,headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.     For example, the Templar Certification Program, introduced lastyear by Premenos Technology Corp. of Concord, Calif., allowselectronic data interchange (EDI) vendors to incorporate Templar withtheir translation software to offer secure Internet EDI.  Similarly,the Internet Services Roadmap from Digital Equipment Corp., based inMaynard, Mass., offers a set of secure Internet services for users andservice providers.     Other companies that introduced new products last year forsensitive data transmission over the Internet include RSA DataSecurity and Netscape Communications Corp., both of Redwood City,Calif., and Atalla Corp. in San Jose, Calif. (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 1).     *  Most Talked About Product:  Rapid*EDI.  The low-cost financialdata interchange system was scheduled to pilot in July but hit a snagwhen Sterling Software of Dallas pulled out of the project (CORP, May31, p. 1). MCI Communications Corp. of Arlington, Va., then choseCertiSoft Solutions of Englewood, Colo., to produce the software(CORP, Oct. 18, p. 8).      The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) hadawarded MCI the contract for this project in 1994 to provide a cheap,Windows-based EDI service in hopes of boosting financial EDI volumeson the automated clearing house network (CORP, Dec. 14, p. 1). Regardless of the delay, NACHA believes it has achieved part of itsgoal of encouraging the development of financial EDI:  There are nowat least five low-cost financial EDI packages on the market.     *  Most Surprising Trend of 1995:  Only a handful of banks rushedto take advantage of newly loosened interstate banking rules.  SinceOctober, bank holding companies have been allowed to unify multistateoperations on a single platform.  But "I don't see [many] banks doingit," notes Connie Beck, executive vice president with NationsBank,headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.  "We see it as one of our keycompetitive advantages for [the next three years]."     Indeed, banks have claimed for years that putting their corporateproducts on a single platform would allow them to slash costs, reduceerrors and add new technologies more quickly.  But Cynthia Glassman,managing director with Furash & Co. in Washington, D.C., speculatesthat some large banks may be tied to the strategies they developed inthe era of restrictive geographic boundaries -- emphasizing localservice, granting local bank presidents autonomy to react to regionalconditions, and encouraging internal competition to push down costs.      Glassman warns that this may not be a viable strategy in 1996. "Entrepreneurs like to deal with the president of the bank, andthey're not going to do that with a big, nationwide bank," she said.     *  Sign of Things To Come:  The EBT Council held its inauguralmeeting in 1995 (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 1).  The group was organized byNACHA to help facilitate the Federal EBT Task Force's plan for anationwide infrastructure that will enable EBT processors to handletransactions across the country, allowing for the portability ofbenefits.  The EBT Council also will take up the continuingcontroversy over bidding procedures used to award EBT contracts.     *  Biggest Bank Merger of the Year:  Chemical and Chase.  The $10billion merger, due to be finalized this summer, will create a titanin the fields of transaction processing and funds transfer services,industry watchers predict.       The "new" Chase will have a strong international presence,greater role in electronic funds transfer and more resources tobankroll bold technological experiments.  In the New York area alone,the combined banks will account for 35 percent to 40 percent of thewholesale banking markets, estimated one analyst who asked not to beidentified (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 1).     In addition, Yun Jae Chung, a banking analyst with NatWestSecurities Corp. in New York, says the banks generated about $1.9billion in 1994 from their transactions processing businesses alone.      *  Most Daring Prediction for 1996:  EDI is dead.  "Not only haveEDI implementations flattened, they've trailed off," notes MikeAlfonsi, who manages the treasury consulting practice at CoreStatesBank, based in Philadelphia.  Alfonsi anticipates little growth in EDIat the current price of implementation.  "We've a hit a wall withcost," he claimed.     Another consultant, who asked not to be named, added that EDI istaking on another form.  Moving transaction data electronically isavailable through procurement cards, lockbox imaging and E-mail, saysthis consultant, who claims:  "Over the short run, no one is going tomake a lot of money on EDI."      Beck counters that "more and more companies have the systems inplace to really leverage EDI, some of them are increasingly making itmandatory."     *  Top Advice for 1996:  Get your feet wet with ECP if youhaven't already, recommends Steve Takahashi, group senior vicepresident for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashibelieves more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin toexchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boostproductivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage ofECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.       "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gonelive," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to sendbut not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchangingECP items early this year.  (Dave Medeiros, The Tower Group, 617/235-5777; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services Company, 312/904-7477; Bankof Boston, 617/434-6883.)  Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE EFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996NACHA, EDIBANX DISCUSS LINK TO SPUR EDI IMPLEMENTATION       The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and theEDI Bank Alliance Network Exchange (EDIBANX) are considering ways totie the two networks together to facilitate more widespread use offinancial electronic data interchange (EDI).       "One of the problems with financial EDI right now is that notenough people are doing it," observes Scott Lang, staff director forNACHA's Bankers EDI Council.  Both groups hope that by interconnectingthe networks they'll be able to boost bank revenues and lower costs byincreasing financial EDI volume.        The Bankers EDI Council moved last October to create the EDIIntegration Task Force to formally take up the issue.  Comprised ofrepresentatives from NACHA, EDIBANX, the Federal Reserve System, NewYork Automated Clearing House (NYACH), VisaNet and the leading EDI-capable banks, the task force was scheduled to hold its first meetingas we were going to press, at the NACHA/Treasury ManagementAssociation Financial EDI Conference in Nashville.       EDIBANX and NACHA representatives, however, have been meetinginformally since June.  The early NACHA model to emerge from thosetalks has certain ACH operators acting as ambidextrous "gateways,"able to handle both the native X12 format from the EDIBANX network andNACHA's CTX.  These gateway operators would wrap an incoming EDIBANXtransmission in the CTX envelope for delivery on the ACH network, andwould similarly unwrap any outgoing transmission for delivery on theEDIBANX network.       Establishing the technical infrastructure, value-added featuresand protocols may prove the easiest issues of this partnership.  Thetougher call will be whether EDIBANX will retain its franchise.     EDIBANX "wants the traffic to go one way.  If that's somethingthey insist upon we'll probably never get anywhere with thesediscussions," says George Thomas, senior vice president with theNYACH.  But EDIBANX will lose its exclusivity, and possibly itsmembers, if the network has to accept EDI transmissions originated onthe ACH system. EDI Implementation Moving Slower Than Expected     The EDIBANX network, which is operated by the Chicago ClearingHouse Association, went on-line in October 1994 but quickly lostmomentum due to the slow pace of EDI implementation.  By summer 1995,EDIBANX and NACHA had begun informal talks to explore the possibilityof working together to boost corporate-to-corporate electronicpayments.       "I'm not sure I can put my finger on any one reason why it'smoving slowly," says Mark Stuparich, vice president of New York-basedChase Manhattan Bank, which has put off its EDIBANX implementation dueto weak customer demand.  "The volume has not been growing as rapidlyon the EDIBANX network as we had hoped, and so the incentive for us tomove has not been as great," he explains.       One incentive that has failed to materialize is cheaper pricing. EDIBANX had assumed there would be sufficient network volume tojustify fixed prices. Chase, and other banks with large-scaletransactions, anticipated significant savings over CTX pricing whichvaries depending on the addenda size.  But Stuparich says "the volumesaren't there yet in the EDIBANX network, so it's probably not evenfair to try to make a comparison."     "To the extent that implementation of the EDIBANX product isslower than anybody expected, it's probably pretty much in line withthe slowness of the rest of corporate electronic trade payments, saysRichard Bort of Richard Bort & Assocs., a consulting firm in ShermanOaks, Calif.     "I got involved in financial EDI in 1986 and from that timethrough today, we've been saying:  'It's coming!  It's coming!'  Butthe implementation of corporate electronic trade payments has beenmuch slower than anybody had ever thought it would be," he says.      NACHA's Lang suggests it has been difficult, if not impossible,to achieve a critical mass of EDI trading partners because not enoughfinancial institutions are EDI-capable.  The Chicago Clearing Housethought it had the answer with EDIBANX, which got rid of the NACHA CTXenvelope to simplify the EDI format and provided a guide to EDI-capable trading partners.  But companies have apparently not rushed totake advantage of the value-added features.                 "You'renot going to get companies to switch banks just so they can get  EDI," says NYACH's Thomas.  "What you have to do," he says, "issomething NACHA is doing with the Rapid*EDI program:  Provide a low-cost vehicle to make virtually every financial institution EDI-capable."     The Rapid*EDI software is a scaled-down, turnkey package, whichenables small-to-medium-sized financial institutions to receive EDI.       Today EDI is a risky business on the ACH network as fewer than 10percent of NACHA-member banks claim to be EDI-capable, says Chase'sStuparich.  By contrast, EDIBANX provides a guarantee that thereceiving bank will be able to properly handle a transaction.       In addition, the EDIBANX network provides syntax editing,validation and acknowledgements, all of which NACHA has been pushed bymembers to provide.       "They both have something to gain by having a partnership," saysStuparich.  "What NACHA has to gain is some of the enhancedcapabilities that were built into the EDIBANX network.  I think whatEDIBANX has to gain is rapid access to a large volume oftransactions." Is There Sufficient Demand for EDI?     While the obvious synergies  prompted creation of the EDIIntegration Task Force, it remains an open question whether the twonetworks together will generate any more EDI traffic than they've beenable to achieve separately.       Though less elegant than the native X12 format used on theEDIBANX network, NACHA's CTX envelope provides the essential EDIcapability.  And even though the CTX is limited to 9,999 addendarecords, "that hasn't been a major stumbling block in the typicalaccounts payable world," says Stuparich.     "There are a number of reasons why EDI is difficult; financialEDI is yet a little bit more difficult," says Bort, who suggestscorporate treasurers and chief financial officers are still notconvinced they need to bother with electronic trade payments.  It willcome, says Bort, if reengineering catches up with corporatedownsizing.     "Companies that do it right reengineer.  They find better ways toget from point A to point B," and that includes implementingelectronic corporate trade payments, says Bort.  But, he adds, "that'snot the way corporate America has done it.  They chop the peoplefirst.  Then they haven't got enough people to figure out how do we dothis thing called 'EDI.'"      NACHA and EDIBANX have the people to figure it out, but arehaving some trouble figuring out how to do it together.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCORPORATE EFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996CHECKFREE, SERVANTIS COMBINE TO LEAD ELECTRONIC COMMERCECheckfree Corporation gave electronic commerce a boost when theColumbus, Ohio company agreed to acquire software developer ServantisSystems Holdings Inc., says one analyst.  The deal makes "Checkfree amore effective player, and whenever you have more than a couple ofplayers that are capable it pushes things more quickly," observesDavid Weisman, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based ForresterResearch.     The acquisition of Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis provides thethird leg of the triad that Checkfree has been methodicallyconstructing, says Michael Sapienza, Checkfree vice president formarketing.  That triad consists of electronic consumer-, business- andbanking-services.  But until recently, Checkfree was a little wobblyon both the banking and the business legs.  Checkfree Alliances Corral the Market     In a matter of months, Checkfree has gone from a consumer billpayment service to the dominant presence in electronic commerce,according to one financial analyst who says, "nobody is even remotelyclose to them."      Prior to acquiring Servantis, Checkfree's focus was electronicbill payment and invoicing.  Missing from that strategy were front-and back-office banking capabilities.  "You need to do all thosetransactions between the bank and its customers.  Checkfree never hada very good solution for that, which is part of the reason thatMasterCard moved on," says Weisman (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 8).     For almost three years, Checkfree and MasterCard were connectedat the hip.  "We were their exclusive electronic banking and billpayment service provider and they were our exclusive distributionchannel to financial institutions," explains Sapienza.  But neitherpartner was satisfied with the arrangement.     Since the expiration of the MasterCard deal a year ago, Checkfreehas been aggressively signing up partners.  Milwaukee-based FiservInc., Automatic Data Processing Inc. of Roseland, N.J., Plano, Texas-based EDS and Cybercash of Reston, Va., have tightened Checkfree'shold on electronic bill payments and invoicing.       "The amount of resources it takes to do hundreds of thousands ormillions of bill payments makes this an economies of scale game.  AndCheckfree has a lot pumping through it," says Forrester's Weisman, buthe adds the company was still missing a good home banking platform.     With Servantis, Checkfree not only gets home banking andcorporate cash management products, it also gets MasterCard back.  Thecard association aligned with Servantis earlier this year tofacilitate MasterCard's wholesale banking product, MasterBanking.     "We view the Servantis ... banking transaction processingbusiness, and its software and mainframe hardware, as being a superiortechnical solution to that at Checkfree," says A. Christian Frederick,Mastercard's senior vice president of remote banking and strategicplanning.  "It is quite evident that Checkfree has validated that[opinion with this purchase.]"     How effective Checkfree will be in leveraging its purchase ofServantis is still an open question.  "How to best integrate the twocompanies is something that is not 100 percent figured out yet," saysCheckfree's Sapienza.  Who stays and who goes, for example, will bedecided over the next 30- to 60-days, says Sapienza.       Another concern is the role Servantis majority owner Welsh,Carson, Anderson & Stowe will play at Checkfree.  Because the purchasedeal is being done with both stock and cash, the New York-basedventure capital fund will end up owning more than 20 percent ofCheckfree.  (A.

For instance, Sterling Software of Dallas, and VeriFone ofRedwood City, Calif., joined Visa International of San Francisco andMasterCard of Purchase, N.Y., in releasing electronic commerceproducts last year.       Sterling announced COMMERCE:Connection, a suite of products thatincludes Windows-based electronic data interchange (EDI) andtranslation software (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 8).  Visa and MasterCardjoined forces to support a single, secure specification for bank cardpurchases on the Internet (CORP, July, 12, p. 4).  And VeriFone saidit was readying Virtual Terminal software that would replace aretailer's "grey box" from VeriFone (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 6).       Other new product releases in 1995 included:     *  More Choices for International Clients.  Cut-throatcompetition in the states forced many vendors to expand theirmarketing efforts overseas.  For instance, Citibank introduced aEuropean lockbox service that offers multi-currency, multi-countrycollections from a centralized facility (CORP, Nov. 15, p. 4). Servantis Systems Inc. of Atlanta, installed Spanish language versionsof its PEP and Micro ACH (automated clearing house) applications inColombia (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 6).

"It iseven occurring with entry-level jobs, and that is pretty scary."Providian Corp., Capital One, and AT&T Universal Card Services are the onlymajor issuers that have gone this route for positions below top portfoliojobs, but recruiters worry the practice may spread.  "Providian is extremelylitigious, and they have sued a manager two years after he left, and a juniorperson was threatened with a suit," says a recruiter who requests anonymity.She frets those kinds of actions will have a "chilling" effect on job-changingin the industry.A Providian spokesperson won't comment on any legal actions taken by thecompany, but adds, "We don't require non-compete agreements, and we neverhave."  However, all employees are required to sign a confidentialityagreement as a condition of employment.Confidentiality and proprietary agreements usually are sufficient to protect acompany's interests, notes Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of humanresources at Capital One Financial Corp., but there are some extremelysensitive areas such as modeling that rate special treatment.  "As competitivepressure increases, non-compete contracts have the potential to become fairlycommon," he says.  "Companies in trouble will make outrageous salary offers toget trade secrets if they feel they need them for survival."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Card Executives' Platinum PaychecksIn the not-too-distant past, before the shareholder- rights movement began andcorporate directors found themselves staring down the barrel ofmulti-million-dollar lawsuits over executive compensation, corporations had afree hand to reward senior executives as the board saw fit, sometimes in spiteof company performance.  Shareholder militancy and Internal Revenue Servicerule changes have changed all that, and boards of directors go to great painsto justify the pay they grant to upper management.  Bonuses and long-termincentive payments are playing a bigger role than ever before, much to thechagrin of executives at floundering companies.  But for the fortunate few inAmerica's growth industries, the rewards have never been greater, and fewindustries in the 1990s can match the growth record of the credit cardbusiness.In the coming months, compensation committees will be reviewing 1995performance and determining how to reward the officers who produced thoseresults.  If last year is any indication, that will mean hefty paychecks forcredit card executives, both those who manage portfolios and those in relatedservice companies.Performance-based pay is resulting in a windfall, as proxy statements makeclear, with many of the industry's top executives clearing more in bonus paythan base salary.  And bonuses tell only part of the story:  betweenrestricted stock grants, options, and assorted perks, card bosses findthemselves in a position that Jay Gatsby could appreciate.And why not?  Industry growth continues apace, and the competition that occursat the account level carries over to the executive suite.  If corporationswant to keep dancing with the guy they brought in-and almost all of the top 20card executives are men-they had better be willing to match or exceed what thecaptains of their ships could command elsewhere.The same reasoning is being applied at second and third levels of management,and even below.  Pay for performance, skill-based pay, and relatedcompensation approaches are translating into fatter paychecks for more people.By the same token, employees at under-performing firms are faced with staticbase pay and a bonus cupboard that's fairly bare.Meanwhile, democracy is coming to card shops in that more employees aregetting bonuses and stock options.  But that also means that many employeesnow face new financial risks.Compensation PacesettersTo get a measure of the current state of the card industry's paychecks, CreditCard Management reviewed 1995 proxy statements issued by more than 30 publiclyheld card issuers, bank holding companies, and card-related service firms.Those reports dramatize the increasing importance of bonuses based oncorporate performance.  Last year, a third of the card industry's topexecutives received more money in bonuses than base pay; on average, bonusesequaled 89% of salary.  Two years earlier, only 11% of those officers receivedmore in bonuses than salaries, and the average bonus was only 60% of base.Those who successfully enhance shareholder value stand to reap substantialrewards.Executives from so-called pure-play card companies dominate the list, in partbecause of the enormous growth experienced by firms such as MBNA Corp.  andFirst USA Inc., but also because of the nature of proxy statements.  Only thefive highest-paid officers are presented in those reports, and very few creditcard executives number in those ranks at bank holding companies.  Citicorp'sRoberta Arena may direct a $35 billion asset, but unless one's title includesthe word "chairman" at Citi, an individual will not be in that group.  Asexecutive vice president of bank cards, Arena rates an honorable mention inCiti's proxy, along with a score of other execs, but that only means hersalary and bonus were somewhere south of $1.7 million in 1994.Multi-Tiered RewardsSince taking over American Express Co.  in the wake of 1991's Optima debacle,Harvey Golub has engineered a noteworthy turnaround at thetravel-and-entertainment card king, refocusing attention on the core businesswhile tripling net income over 1992's level.  A bonus that's 255% of base payvaults Golub to the top of the card pack in terms of 1994 income, and two ofhis lieutenants join him on the list of the industry's 10 best-paidexecutives.  In contrast, the failure of Golub's predecessor, James D.Robinson III, to achieve financial objectives in 1992 cost him a substantialpart of his bonus and, ultimately, his job.Salary and bonus alone ignore substantial additional pay, including long-termincentive payouts to Golub of $1.8 million in 1994, vesting in restrictedstock grants, and stock options that have boosted his stake in AmEx to 227,162shares with an option for 752,500 more.Not far behind was Charles M.  Cawley, whose salary and bonus more thandoubled to $2 million.  Not coincidentally, corporate net income increased$58.8 million to $266.6 million.  Cawley was rewarded with an additional$1,025,000 in restricted stock.Paychecks for card issuers are fatter than their vendor counterparts, with oneexception:  Pat Thomas, chairman of the recently-merged First FinancialManagement Corp., stands head and shoulders above the field, with bonusesaccounting for the bulk of his $6.8 million package for 1994.  That'ssignificantly above the chairman of First Data Corp., the firm that acquiredFFMC, parent of National Bancard Corp.  (NaBanco), Telecheck, NationwideCredit, and other payment-industry companies.Besides its richness, Thomas's deal with FFMC was an anachronism in an erawhen the compensation committees of corporate boards set executive wagepackages.  Thomas enjoyed a personal-service contract that stipulated a bonusof the lesser of 2.5% of corporate income before taxes or the market value of94,500 shares, with a minimum bonus of $1.8 million.  He also received optionson 500,000 shares, participation in incentive plans, and various perks,including payment of premiums on $5 million worth of life insurance andpersonal use of the corporate jet, a $59,073 value in 1994.FFMC had 1994 revenues of $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior year andconsistent with a 29% compounded growth record over the previous five years.Bonuses at RiskIn contrast to Thomas's bonus, Henry C.  Duques, chairman of First Data,technically received no bonus, but that's deceptive.  Duques's packagereflects a growing management trend toward risk-based rewards for managers.Some corporations, including Household International, are requiring seniorexecutives to purchase stock, and others are granting all rewards in the formof stock and other instruments whose value is determined by companyperformance.In Duques's case, a 1994 performance grant worth $3 million was granted.  Halfof that amount was in the form of options on 372,088 shares at $40.31; inmid-1995, shares were trading at $63, a nifty $8.4 million gain if the optionwas executed.  The other $1.5 million is dependent on First Data's return onequity in 1995 and 1996.A similar calculated gamble is being taken by Capital One Financial Corp.'stop executives, Chief Executive Richard D.  Fairbank and President Nigel W.Morris.  In September, the two agreed to forego cash bonuses and stock optionsuntil the turn of the century in exchange for a one-time grant of 1.5 millionand 1 million shares, respectively, at $29.19 per share.  Half the optionvests only if the share price reaches $37.50; the balance vests in incrementsup to $50.Their potential $52 million windfall in five years comes at the cost ofgenerous bonuses in the past.  In 1994, when Capital One was spun off bySignet Banking Corp., Fairbank netted $8.08 million and Morris $4.35 millionin cash and restricted stock.Golden HandcuffsStock performance is a major factor in most executives' incentive plans.Typically, a hypothetical investment of $100 in the corporation's stock iscompared over time to a similar investment in a peer group's stock or ageneral index.  If target prices are exceeded, the pool of incentive pay goesup accordingly; if objectives are not reached, some or all of the pool is injeopardy.Earnings per share or net profits often determine to what extent executives'incentive pool will be funded.  Often, disbursements are in the form ofrestricted stock that vests in three to five years.  "It's more of a goldenhandcuff than a lucrative element of the compensation package," says Donald M.Cunningham, principal of Tulsa, Okla., recruitment firm BankSearch Inc.A 25% gain in stock value in 1994 was sufficient cause for rejoicing bymarketer Ideon Group Inc.'s directors to boost bonuses beyond the maximums setin 1993.  Maximum incentives of 30% to 120% of base pay had been set from themanager to the chief-executive level, but the compensation committee was sopleased with the organizing work for the cobranded PGA Tour Partners card thatit awarded bonuses of 160% of base, and 190% in the case of Chief ExecutivePaul G.  Kahn.Unfortunately for Ideon, the PGA card has not lived up to expectations, andthe firm has had a shaky 1995.  Top management shares the down-side risk,which was not the case under former Chief Executive Steven J.  Halmos, whoresigned in late 1992, when the stock lost 13% of its value.  Halmos received$2.65 million in salary and no bonus in 1991 and 1992, but that compensationapproach ended with a 1993 amendment to the federal tax code.  The amendmentrestricts the deductibility of compensation over $1 million unlesspre-established performance goals are met.  That's why corporate boards now goto considerable lengths to justify executive pay in proxy statements.Top executives who derive all of their compensation from base salary are ararity, and the same is becoming true of lower-level managers.  Restrictedstock seldom is part of compensation at the second and third tiers, but stockoptions and other perks are beginning to filter down.  Signing bonuses andgenerous relocation packages are becoming more prevalent, recruiters report,particularly for positions with highly valued skill sets.  BankSearch'sCunningham cites the case of a collections supervisor who received perquisiteswith little or no relation to the job.  "An auto came into play even though itwas apparent he was desk-bound," Cunningham recalls.Comparative Pay ScalesWith the vast majority of management jobs in the $50,000 to $150,000 range,credit card recruiters focus their energies filling those posts.  Widedisparities exist for comparable positions in different geographic areas andbetween banks, but generally managers at the low end are garnering bonuses of5% to 7% of base, vice presidents and assistant vice presidents typically fallin the 10% to 15% range, and higher-level executives can realize up to 30% ofbase in annual bonuses, recruiters say.A risk analyst probably will enjoy slightly higher pay by working in a cardprogram as opposed to mortgage lending, auto loans, or some other area of abank, but the main distinction is demand.  While he predicts "tremendousgrowth both in terms of the number of jobs and the compensation" for debitcard marketers in the next five years, headhunter George C.  Genel concedesdebit counterparts "are probably paid a little less" than their oppositenumbers in credit.Even in customer service and collections, "credit card people tend to be paidbetter than their retail-banking counterparts because they're recognized asmore crucial to the success of the card business," suggests John D.  Walp, whorecently left CoreStates to become director of compensation and human resourcesystems at Advanta Corp.  "Customer-service staffers do double duty becausethey also act as salespeople, whereas their counterparts in a branch may onlyanswer questions."  Collections on unsecured loans also are more sensitivethan an auto loan for which the bank has recourse, Walp adds.Nonbanks and pure card issuers such as Advanta rate an edge in pay over theirbank counterparts, recruiters indicate.  GE Capital Corp.  is consistentlycited as a leader.  "They want the best people, and they live in an expensivemarket (Connecticut)," explains New York recruiter Nancy Griffiths.Marketers in DemandWith competition heated for new accounts, card marketing specialists are oneof the industry's hottest commodities, with top people almost findingthemselves in a bidding war for their services, Cunningham notes.  Salaryspikes in the 30% range have occurred over the last two years forproduct-management and marketing jobs, he says.  One prospect he was wooingwas offered a 25% pay hike to $93,500 in a less-expensive market, but turnedit down, believing an even more attractive offer will soon come his way.Recruiter Donald D.  Duggan of Westminster, Colo., says that prospect may beright.  A marketing manager he recently recruited also received a 25% raise, a$10,000 signing bonus, a guaranteed bonus of $10,000 the first year, and arelocation package "that will put $4,000 to $5,000 extra in his pocket," saysDuggan."The business has gotten more sophisticated, and complexity has made thesecond- and third-level managers more valuable," agrees recruiter Judy Collinsof Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest.  Ten years ago, she was placingcredit policy and risk managers in $45,000 jobs; today, the same positionscommand $70,000 to $80,000.Equity PositionsSigning bonuses are becoming quite common, according to Genel of ThousandOaks, Calif.  "Most companies will purchase the old home of a person who hasto relocate after 60 to 90 days, and perhaps pay the points and fees to closeon the new house," he adds.  "Bonus programs that used to top out at 10% noware at 12% to 15%, and people are reaching those caps."The biggest potential bonus is equity in the card portfolio itself.  Companieslike Capital One have a distinct advantage over banks in tendering that bonusto the rank and file.  Once its initial public offer was complete and its fatewas no longer tied to Signet's, where poor performance in other business linescould mitigate sterling card results, Capital One had the latitude to rewardrisk-taking that boosts the bottom line in a way banks cannot, Dennis H.Liberson, vice president of human resources, says.  It began last March byunveiling a stock option plan called OneGrant that extends all the way down tothe mail room.OneGrant entitles every full-time worker to buy up to 200 shares at thethen-current price of $19.31 per share.  Half the options vest after two yearsand the balance in March 1998.  And while many option offers expire in threeto five years, Capital One employees have 10 years to exercise them.OneGrant "whetted associates' appetite" for the employee stock-purchase planthat came next, according to Liberson.  All staff members can now designate upto a 15% payroll deduction for the purchase of Capital One stock at 15% belowthe market price.  By year-end, participation had climbed to more than 800employees, almost a quarter of the work force.At one point last year, employees had realized paper profits of about $2,000apiece on their options.  A subsequent price dip all but wiped out that gain.Management recognizes the need to balance the goal of building anentrepreneurial spirit with the demoralizing effect plummeting stock pricescan have, particularly on young staffers inexperienced in the ways of themarket.  "We knew a correction would come, but that long-term we could drivestock appreciation," Liberson says.  That's why the company limited the amountthat employees could invest, even in the case of middle- and upper-levelmanagers.Non-Financial GoalsA third program dubbed Entrepreneur Grant rolled out in September.  The 50 topmanagers, excluding Morris and Fairbank, could swap up to 25% of their basepay and bonuses over the next three years in exchange for stock options; 43took advantage of the offer and eventually will own about 286,000 shares.Participation was unanimous at the senior level, Liberson reports, though somemanagers with less disposable income elected not to enroll (the programincluded managers in the $50,000 to $60,000 range).  "A mandatory stock-optionapproach would not work very well because it could create financial stress forsome associates," Liberson explains.  Likewise, granting restricted stock toexecutives would not motivate them as much to drive up stock prices as anoption plan in which their own cash is at risk.Bonuses can be paid to virtually every AT&T Universal Card Services Corp.employee, though they have less to do with financial performance than how wellcustomer service is delivered.  "We can measure 100 different processes daily,from telephone response time to the accuracy of invoices, and everymeasurement has a defect standard," says Ira S.  Walter, UCS's director ofhuman resources development.  A bonus is paid quarterly based on the number ofdays the standard was met; bonuses typically are in the 8% to 10% range forcustomer-service operators.Financial performance comes into play in management ranks, but even therecustomer service impacts pocketbooks.  "Every single employee, including theCEO, has an element of their bonus that depends on customer delight," saysWalter.  "What determines long-term success is customer loyalty, and we wantto engage everyone in that focus."Bonuses of 30% for senior-level positions at AT&T are common, recruitersindicate.  Walter declines to comment on specifics, but says, "we are willingto pay significantly more than the competition if they earn it.  Weparticipate in salary surveys to determine compensation rates, so we knowwe're competitive."Downside of RiskAlthough Advanta has several lines of business, three-quarters of revenuesderive from credit cards, so performance in that arena dictates overallperformance and share value.  Employees at every level are invited to take anownership position through a stock purchase plan and a 401-k plan thatincludes Advanta stock as an investment option.  The stock purchase provides a15% price discount and is limited to 15% of compensation.  "The trenddefinitely is to be more inclusive in making bonuses an integral part of thecompensation package, so that pay has some risk involved, based on companyperformance," Walp says.Jack B.  Hofmann, Advanta vice president of human resources, willingly acceptsthe risk of staff angst if the stock takes a bath.  "We're not the kind ofplace that attracts people looking for security," he says.  "We generallyattract people who are willing to put their pay at risk.  That makes for amore highly motivated work force."The danger is that employees may end up sharing risks in market forces overwhich they have no control.  A case in point is the collections area, whereconsolidation is occurring at a rate significantly above that of cardissuance.  Smaller firms are ill-equipped to compete, and shareholder value isplummeting for some.  A $100 investment in Payco American Corp.  in 1990 wasworth $59.14 at the end of 1994, and that drop is reflected in the pay of topexecutives.Top managers at Payco saw their bonuses slashed 10% last year, resulting in 4%declines in total compensation for the two top executives.  Stock optionshaven't been a factor in their packages since 1992.  And while there'sjustification in holding a president and chairman accountable for a decline incorporate profitability, the connection becomes more tenuous when people havea limited impact on strategic success.That may have been part of the thinking of Hatim A.  Tyabji, president andchief executive of terminal maker VeriFone Inc., who asked his board to forgocash bonuses for himself and other executives after earnings and stock pricesdipped in 1993.Though VeriFone's performance improved in 1994, Tyabji made the same requestlast year.  Instead, he asked that cash bonuses be used for a cash andtime-off bonus program for all employees.  The board agreed and also grantedstock options to the executive officers.VeriFone's balancing act is instructive for all corporations as incentive paycontinues to get pushed further down the line.  Everyone enjoys sharing therewards, but there's a limit to the amount of risk that can be imposed on therank and file.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Sweeter Deals for Entry-Level WorkersCompensation that reflects shareholder value is a given for occupants of theexecutive suite, but the same philosophy is being extended all the way down toentry-level service workers at some card shops.Performance bonuses are most common in collections and recoveries, an areawhere the cost-effectiveness of rewarding top performers is easily measured."It's easy to create incentives to make sure your top performers get the mostpay in that area, but it's more of a challenge to incent strictcustomer-service jobs," says Kathy A.  O'Doherty, human resources manager forFirst Chicago Corp.'s First Card operation.Advanta Corp.'s Jack B.  Hofmann isn't so sure.  "There are all kinds of waysto make call-center jobs fun while linking them to clearly defined outcomes,"the vice president of human resources believes.  Trips and prizes, in additionto cash, are all part of the incentive mix for hourly employees at Advanta."People are motivated by more than money," Hofmann says.  "They want to bechallenged and recognized."Customer service and other hourly positions are pegged to the going wage ratein a geographic market, not to any prevailing industry rate, points out JoAnne R.  Moeller, who oversees compensation for Banc One Corp.'s 50,000employees.  But being competitive isn't enough when full-tilt expansion is onthe agenda, and that's the challenge faced by Capital One Financial Corp.,which intends to add 1,000 entry-level jobs in the Richmond, Va., market alonethis year.To increase the desirability of Capital One over other local firms, thecompany is rolling out a benefits package that includes health insurance forall associates working 20 hours or more per week, and three weeks vacationafter a year.  "We're competing for people in a very tight labor market,"explains Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human resources.Thus, Capital One decided to reallocate resources to reward people more in theearlier stages of their careers rather than on the basis of seniority andposition.  By slashing employee attrition and going to more of a managedhealth-care approach, Liberson expects the new benefits package to end upcosting the same as the program it replaces.Liberson also expects retention of longer-term employees to be aided by thestock-option plan Capital One introduced in March.  Besides giving employees avery real stake in the company's performance, that program is creatingstock-ticker watchers out of 20-something workers with no investmentexperience.The change is reflected in the types of questions top executives hear atmonthly "town meetings" for employees at various Capital One facilities."They're fielding fewer questions on mundane, trivial personnel stuff, andmore on the company's business strategy and stock price," reports Liberson."The climate is different."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Number-Crunchers Are a Hot CommodityFor young people interested in a career in credit cards, here's a word ofadvise:  buy a calculator, get a pocket protector, and master the art ofmathematical model-building.  The credit card industry wants numbers people,and it's bidding up the price for good ones."The competition this year for credit policy and risk specialists is tougherthan I've ever seen it," one frazzled card recruiter reports.With one eye on rising delinquencies and the other on analysts' resumes,portfolio managers are trying to hire the experts who can minimize losses and,hopefully, boost profits.  Helping to make these skills white-hot iscompetition for those experts from new quarters.  Long-distance telephonecompanies and utilities are discovering a need for risk-management help, andthey are bidding for the services of the banking industry's stars in riskscoring, credit policy, and modeling."Data is data, and if you can leverage it into a model that reduces losses orincreases profitability for an issuer, that can mean millions of dollars to acompany," says Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc., a New Yorkfirm specializing in placing people in analytical functions.  "An analyst withone year's experience can pretty much move anywhere in the country."Recruiter Judy Collins of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest points to thework of Fair, Isaac and Company and CCN-MDS in modeling for sparking the jobboom.  "The tools became available for this business, and that is creating thedemand for people with backgrounds in math, computer science, or some othernumbers-type of degree," she says.On the other hand, people with general management backgrounds may find thegoing rough in the coming years.  "It's a soft market for people-to-peopleskills," Collins notes.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996The Nine Lives of Dale BrowningYou might say, card industry utility man D.  Dale Browning can't resist achallenge.When asked by friends to evaluate Golden, Colo.-based ProCard Inc., astruggling procurement card company they were thinking about investing in,Browning quickly accepted.  After weeks of review of the ProCard operation andits strengths and weaknesses, Browning returned to his friends with a 30-pagereport, a two-hour presentation, and the conviction that ProCard hadpotential.  "The more I studied the company, the more I concluded that it hasa very, very good product," he says.  "But it had not been marketed properlyand not enough money had been put behind it."So, when his friends asked Browning to invest in the 6-year-old privately heldcompany, "I thought about it for a week," Browning says.  "Then I said Iwouldn't make an investment unless I could manage the company.  They agreed."Once again, the industry veteran found himself in the middle of an emergingmarket:  the corporate purchasing card arena.Indeed, it came as no surprise to friends and industry observers that Browningjumped at the chance to pump new life into ProCard.  Browning has decades-longexperience in all facets of the card business, is familiar with procurementcard programs, and has a track record of operating successful card programs,says Denny D.  Dumler, president of Visa Plus, Visa's on-line globalautomated-teller-machine network.  Dumler worked closely with Browning fornearly 25 years, first at Rocky Mountain Bankcard System and later at Plus."I can't think of anyone better equipped" to run ProCard, Dumler says.  "He'sa real giant in the industry."A PioneerBrowning's professional life has been one of breaking new ground, first inbank cards-in 1969, he participated in the creation of BankAmericard, theforerunner of Visa-and later in electronic banking and debit cards-he servedon a committee that designed the first off-line debit card, which evolved intothe Visa check card.And Browning's accomplishments didn't stop there.  During his 25-year tenureat Colorado National Bank, he made the Denver-based bank a force to bereckoned with in both consumer credit cards and electronic banking.  In 1968,he founded Rocky Mountain BankCard System, the card issuing subsidiary ofColorado National Bank, and one of the largest bank card processors in thewestern United States.  While there, he helped develop a card program for theU.S.  government, a prototype for what is now known as a procurement card.Browning followed that in 1982 with the creation of Plus System Inc., aregional electronic banking network which later evolved into the firstnational automated-teller network in the U.S.  And he served as president ofCNB and Rocky Mountain from 1986 until November 1993.  He continued as chiefexecutive of Plus until 1993 when Visa took over that company.At that time, Browning became senior consultant to Visa International.  Andwhen offered the opportunity to take over ProCard, he couldn't refuse.  "Themore time I spent at (ProCard), the more intrigued I was with the software,"he says.  "The software was quite flexible.  The enhancements they wereworking on would greatly increase their ability to compete and handleadditional volume."  ProCard's PC-based software provides an integratedpurchasing card management system designed to reduce the administrative costsof procurement card programs.In addition, Browning says, "I was impressed with the people who workedthere."To be sure, ProCard-which provides backroom support for banks offeringcorporate card products and services-has a lot going for it.  An early entrantin the corporate purchasing card arena, it serves four banks nationwide-FirstNational Bank of Chicago, National City Bank, NationsBank, and Cass Bank, thenation's largest freight-payment provider.  In September, when Browning tookover as president and chief executive, some 420 corporations, including 100Fortune 500 companies, used ProCard services.  During the first few monthsunder Browning, ProCard added about 120 new corporations and was indiscussions with about a dozen others.Different DirectionBut ProCard was a victim of its own success:  It had trouble keeping pace withthe demand for its services.  In early September, the company had a backlog of80 corporate users waiting for software to link the ProCard system to theirgeneral ledgers, Browning says.  And that slowed system growth in both volumeand number of customers.Despite these problems, however, ProCard is the right product for the righttime, Browning says.  "The timing is right," he says.  "Within the last year,there have been more banks committed to procurement or purchasing cardprograms than in all the years prior.  It's going to be like a snowball goingdownhill."  Indeed, the volume on ProCard cards alone is increasing by 20% amonth compared to a year ago, Browning adds.But before ProCard can reach its potential, it needs to head in a differentdirection, Browning says.  Under the strategy mapped out by ousted founder andformer chief executive Stanley Anderson, client banks had to conform toProCard's requirements.  For example, ProCard worked exclusively withMasterCard International.  "This company is no different than other softwarecompanies," Browning says.  "It should support all products irrespective ofhow they're branded in the marketplace."  ProCard now works with both the Visaand MasterCard associations.Anderson says he planned to make ProCard brand neutral, but was initiallylimited to MasterCard because ProCard was using software from Columbus,Ga.-based processor Total System Services Inc.  that was compatible only withMasterCard's system.ProCard also used to work exclusively with a single processor-Total System,another fundamental mistake in Browning's eyes.  "A company should beresponsive to the needs of the banks, not make the banks go with itsprocessors," he says.  ProCard is negotiating agreements that enable it tolink up with any processor.What's more, ProCard formerly required clients to buy the entire procurementcard package, from software to training to client services, Browning says."We debundled all that," he says.  "A bank can select and choose what servicesit wants to buy.  It doesn't have to buy the whole package."The ProCard package enables banks and their corporate clients to review, edit,audit, and reconcile bank card transactions on a daily basis andelectronically post the purchases to the companies' general ledger systems.European RetreatAfter assuming control of ProCard, Browning also shut down the company'sEuropean office.  "In my view, we hadn't capitalized on the opportunities inthe U.S.  For this company to take on the responsibility (of the Europeanmarket) meant we'd have to expand at the expense of the U.S."  Ownership ofthe European operation-Ireland-based ProCard Inc.  Ltd.-was awarded toAnderson when he left the company in July.But even this shift in underlying philosophy isn't enough to guarantee successfor ProCard.  In its rush to meet customer demands for specialized informationreporting, ProCard "spent quite a bit of money putting in fixes to systems"rather than looking at what enhancements the program might need in the longterm, Browning says.  "Now we're reallocating resources on working on acompletely new system with all the enhancements," he says.ProCard is expanding beyond transaction processing to providing value-enhancedfunctions, for example, breaking out information for corporations required toreport on transactions with minority vendors.  Those enhancements arescheduled for release in mid-1996.Already, ProCard has corrected many of the problems resulting from its rapidgrowth.  Since taking over at ProCard, Browning has funneled more resources toupgrading software and hardware to cope with the expected growth in volume.The new product system-expected to be in place by the middle of thismonth-will handle four times the volume and do it in half the time, Browningsays.And the company also has eliminated the 3 1/2 month backlog of some 90corporate clients waiting to come up on the ProCard system by hiring 10additional computer programmers.  "Now we have a backlog of 30 companies,which is super.  That's as fast as we can do it," Browning says.  "Theturnaround from the time the corporation signs and the custom programming isless than four weeks."ProCard has also added new staff to go out to the corporate clients and traintheir employees.  And the company is setting up a customer-service center thatwill take calls directly from the banks' procurement card customers, ratherthan having the corporate customers call the bank first.  "The bank won't haveto build its own infrastructure," Browning says.  "The bank tells us how theywant the calls handled.  And the (corporate) customer will think he's dealingwith the bank."With all these changes, Browning says he believes ProCard will be able tocapture a large share of the procurement card market.  But he concedes that itwill take time to get ProCard back on track.  "In a couple of years, we'll getthe company going down the right path," he says.If that happens, Browning will have yet another success story to add to hislist of accomplishmentsBack to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Catch-Up Time At MasterCardIn an exploding U.S.  debit card market, the contest for bank card associationsupremacy is turning into more of a rout than a race.  For while MasterCardInternational and Visa U.S.A.  offer similar products and both haveimplemented aggressive marketing strategies, Visa has solid control of theoff-line card market, and is processing millions more on-line point-of-saletransactions monthly.  Now MasterCard, with new leaders at its debit helm, istrying to pull something out of its hat that will cut into Visa's lead.Through the first half of 1995, 5.8 million MasterMoney off-line cards hadbeen issued by 665 financial institutions, compared to 25.1 million Visa checkcards by 1,808 issuers.  MasterCard refuses to release transactions figuresfor its Maestro on-line debit product, but analysts believe it is low.  Visa'sInterlink, meanwhile, is the largest on-line POS network, processing more than15.8 million monthly transactions.It's against this background of Visa dominance that Purchase, N.Y.-basedMasterCard is launching different marketing projects while simultaneouslyadjusting to management changes.  Last summer it was announced that G.  HenryMundt III, president of MasterCard's Cirrus System Inc.  global automatedteller machine network, would become executive vice president of MasterCard'sGlobal Debit Services Group, replacing John O.  Smith who planned to retire atyear end.  Steven L.  Van Fleet is replacing Smith as general manager ofMaestro International.And in October, Arthur Kranzley, who headed Maestro in the U.S.  since itsformation in 1993, left to become senior vice president for Horsham, Pa.-basedAdvanta Corp., a non-bank financial-services provider and a major credit cardissuer that employs former MasterCard chief Alex W.  "Pete" Hart.  Kranzley'sreplacement has not been named.Hard PressThough Mundt emphasizes that the personnel moves will not affect MasterCard'sstrategies and that most of the MasterMoney and Maestro management teams areunchanged, analysts still expect it to be years before MasterCard is able tosignificantly reduce Visa's debit lead in the U.S.  Observers attributeMasterCard's position to its previous debit strategy that emphasized Maestro'sinternational expansion, rather than MasterMoney's or Maestro's domesticgrowth.  Most U.S.  card issuers give off-line cards marketing prioritybecause the products generate much larger interchange revenues ("The DebitCard Balancing Act," December, 1995)."When MasterCard was building up Maestro, Visa was putting the hard press onthe Visa check card," says D.  Mark Jackson, vice president of St.Louis-based Boatmen's Bancshares, a leading MasterMoney issuer.  "AfterMasterCard redirected it focus, Visa check card already had a huge lead.  Andonce a bank is issuing cards, it is hard to get them to change brands."Visa gained its off-line advantage in spite of MasterMoney's interchange feeschedule that generates higher transaction revenues for issuers than does theVisa check card.  On a $100 non-supermarket purchase, MasterMoney acquirerspay card issuers between $1.31 and $1.69 for electronic transactions, comparedto $1.08 when a Visa check card is used.Among the strategies used by Visa to expand Visa check card issuance aremarket launches in specific cities that feature month-long advertisingcampaigns utilizing such vehicles as newspapers and radio.Assisting IssuersWith Visa dominating the off-line market, MasterCard finds itself workingharder to expand its presence.  The association is running televisioncommercials that explain how MasterMoney operates.  And MasterCard's 1996focus will be to assist issuers in broadening their card bases, and triggeringmore activity.  Initiatives will include regional and local advertising,including direct mail."The bottom line is that Visa and MasterCard have good off-line debit productsand there is a still huge, uncommitted, market out there," Mundt says.  About65% of financial institutions are not yet issuing off-line cards.But while MasterMoney is gaining strength domestically, Maestro's strongestimpact has been overseas.  Though only about 13 million Maestro cards havebeen issued in the U.S., 100 million cards are committed worldwide.  Maestrois particularly strong in Latin America, where 5.5 million cards have beenissued in the last two years in such countries as Argentina, Chile, Ecuador,Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.This strong international activity eventually will spread to the U.S., Maestroexecutives believe.  Mundt projects Maestro's growth rate will exceed that ofCirrus.  The ATM network, which had volume of just 60,000 transactions duringits first year in 1983, is expected to have processed more than 300 milliontransactions in 1995.  Maestro has more than 55,000 merchant locations,compared to more than 64,000 for Interlink.Shifting EmphasisTo stimulate Maestro expansion in the U.S., MasterCard is shifting itsemphasis from issuers to signing merchant acquirers.  The association's goalis to have the nation's top 50 credit card acquirers processing Maestrotransactions this year, up from 36 in 1995, and it is aggressively lobbyingindependent sales organizations to sell Maestro to merchants.  Maestro alsoteamed with terminal vendor VeriFone Inc.  in 1995 for a so-called TravelDestination Program.  In that program, acquirers in key traveler locationsthat sign merchants to accept Maestro receive such awards as VeriFoneterminals and personal-identification-number pads.MasterCard expects 5,500 PIN pads and 400 terminals sets will be distributedin the program.  Analysts estimate more than $200,000 worth of hardware willbe awarded.Merchants also will receive price breaks on terminals as an incentive toupgrade or trade in devices so they can support such products as debit cardsand smart cards, and electronic-purse and cardholder- loyalty programs.Merchants and acquirers that move from paper-based systems to electronics alsowill receive processing discounts.  Furthermore, Maestro is targetingmerchants that traditionally have shunned debit cards, including such chainretailers as apparel and shoe stores, lower-cost hotels and motels, andcar-rental agencies.  MasterCard is launching a pilot with its St.Louis-based BankMate shared regional network and Enterprise Rent-A-Car fordebit card acceptance in 20 Midwest locations.  "There is a huge market formerchants where the customer has to pay in advance," says Carl Stefanelli,Maestro vice president.MomentumBy getting more merchants on board, Maestro is trying to ride an expansionwave created in 1995 when San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, a foundingmember of Interlink, left the Visa-owned network for Maestro.  Wells is thethird-largest on-line card issuer as well as the third-largest debit acquiringinstitution.  Factors that prompted the move included MasterCard's long-termstrategies, pricing, service levels, and partnerships."MasterCard is very focused on the on-line product, which is what Wells Fargoneeded for our customers," says Debra B.  Rossi, Wells Fargo senior vicepresident, adding that the association doesn't short the MasterMoney card,either.  "They don't rob Paul to pay Peter," she says.Yet, even with its initiatives, Maestro still has a long road to travel beforeit matches Interlink's activity.  When both networks went national in 1992,Interlink already was the largest regional POS network in the United States,with strong name recognition and activity on the West Coast.  Maestro startedfrom scratch."Maestro's problem is that it lacks the visibility of Interlink," says anindustry consultant familiar with MasterCard who insists on anonymity.  "Itwill be more difficult for them to expand in the U.S.  than even for theregional networks, which already have a solid market penetration."But with its strong international presence and new domestic tactics,MasterCard's debit movement could just be starting to hit stride.  "Ourstrategy is the right strategy for a global basis," Mundt says.  "On-line,PIN-based debit is where people want us to go."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Throwing Down The GauntletThe foreign invasion of the burgeoning point-of-sale market in the UnitedStates is getting stronger with the entry of another international powerhouse.Scotland-based De La Rue Fortronic, which controls a large chunk of theEuropean terminal market, has begun a North American operation in Hartland,Wis., with a strategy of opening additional U.S.  offices and creating anational sales force.De La Rue is joining the stream of international vendors positioning for theexpansion of smart card programs.  While the company has shipped more than400,000 terminals overseas and controls 45% of the United Kingdom market, 35%of the German market, 60% of the Norwegian, and 70% of the POS terminal marketin the Netherlands, De La Rue's U.S.  presence is slight, with its terminalsjust being used in small pilots.  But the company could soon become a NorthAmerican fixture.More than 50% of De La Rue's revenues are projected to be generated from theU.S.  within five years.  It expects to open offices on the East and WestCoasts, with a sales force situated throughout the continent.  "We're not aflash in the pan," says Phillip Johnston, De La Rue Fortronic president.  "Wehave the money and backing to make a big impact."Laying a FoundationDe La Rue already has started laying the foundation for its North Americanpush.  Currently, it is the only supplier of devices for London-based Mondex'selectronic purse program, and Wells Fargo Bank is using De La Rue terminalsfor its employee test of the Mondex system in Wells' San Franciscoheadquarters ("Mondex Leaves the Station," October, 1995).  Guelph, Ontario,will launch a city-wide Mondex pilot next year.  De La Rue also expects tosupply at least half the terminals for Visa's stored-value program that willbe launched in Atlanta in July in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.More than 5,000 merchant locations are expected to accept smart cards in theAtlanta area.Yet, in addition to smart card tests, De La Rue is moving into more mainstreammarkets.  It is selling an unspecified number of its F95 POS devices andsoftware to Atlanta-based processor Nova Information Systems for deployment inhotels and motels.  Nova recently combined its merchant bank card businesswith First Union Corp.'s and First Fidelity Bancorporation's, creating thenation's eighth-largest merchant-processing operation servicing more than90,000 retailers.Nova selected the De La Rue devices because the terminals have memory that isseveral times greater than other vendors' devices that sell for a similarprice, says Joseph P.  Cohane, Nova vice president.  The enhanced capacitywill permit Nova to support a variety of applications on a single device, suchas frequent-user programs and check-guarantee services.The processor also wants to support smart card programs, and De La Rue devicesare successfully operating in European chip card programs, such as Mondex inEngland, Cohane says.Starting from ScratchBut while De La Rue is the latest in a growing list of foreign-based vendorspushing into the North American market, the company is following aless-traveled path by starting its operation from scratch instead ofpurchasing an established American company.Before setting up shop in the U.S., De La Rue's terminals were distributeddomestically by Hartland-based Direct Data.  When Direct Data ceasedoperations last September, De La Rue created its own U.S.  operation to havestronger control over the sales and marketing of its devices.  Its Hartlandheadquarters will handle sales and marketing, software development, productmanagement, distribution, and customer service.  Terminals will bemanufactured near De La Rue's Dunfermline, Scotland, world headquarters.Even as De La Rue gets its house in order, executives say the company alreadyis well equipped to take market share away from the U.S.' two largest andbetter-known terminal vendors, Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone Inc., andPhoenix-based Hypercom Inc., in addition to other players that have increasedtheir marketing efforts in the last year, such as Minneapolis-based DataCardand Redwood City-based Atalla.  The company has deep pockets, a strong productline, and international success.  Its parent company, The De La Rue Group, hadoperating revenues of $1.2 billion last year with a profit of $230.4 million.De La Rue Fortronic generated $45 million in revenues.The company also can leverage a 600-person service organization situatedacross the U.S.  that currently services the The De La Rue Group's otherbanking products, such as coin counters.  Johnston says De La Rue willemphasize its full range of offerings to prospective customers, includingsmart card applications; open architecture, which permits terminal users tocreate their own software programs; and loyalty programs that can be tailoredto support individual retailers.  "We're the experts in smart card technology,and if we didn't think we could gain major footing in the U.S., we wouldn't behere," Johnston says.Despite De La Rue's aggressive push into the U.S.  market, some of its moreestablished U.S.  competitors do not expect to change strategies to competewith the upstart.  "I don't think (De La Rue) brings much to the party interms of technology," says Albert Irato, Hypercom president.  "It will have noimpact on us whatsoever."The Line-UpDe La Rue's main products include the F95 terminal, which features 640kilobytes of memory, an integrated printer, two-line display, and an optionalsmart card reader.  Most terminals shipped over the last few years have only32 or 64 kilobytes of memory.  Devices with greater memory can support morecomplex and a greater number of applications, such as frequent-shopper andsmart card programs, in addition to standard debit and credit.  The terminalsells for under $400.The F105 product, which is being used in the Mondex program, features adisplay which permits consumers to view the balance remaining on theirstored-value cards.  The device is priced at approximately $500.In addition to supporting Mondex, which has 8,000 cardholders and 750merchants participating in an electronic-purse program in Swindon, England, DeLa Rue has supplied more than 2,000 F95 devices to Shell Oil Co.  that arebeing used in a British customer-loyalty program.  De La Rue also will supplyterminals for Visa smart card pilots this year in Australia and Canada.But while De La Rue is active internationally, its key aim is to import thatsuccess to the U.S., and some analysts believe the company has the ability togain a domestic toehold.  "It will be an uphill battle for De La Rue, but theyhave the resources and a good track record in Europe," says Jerome Svigals, aRedwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.  "There is a big market andDe La Rue could very well be a successful contender."-Richard MitchellBack to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Some More Elbow Grease, PleaseFaced with fiercer competition than ever, credit card marketers returned tothe basics when they advertised their products in 1995.  The mind-numbingonslaught in 1994 of ill-conceived television commercials featuring big-budgetspecial effects and print ads narrowly focused on price ("The Best of a BadLot," December, 1994) were replaced by higher-quality work that deftly putbrand image first and product information second.That's not to say card marketers have abandoned playing up key selling points,such as interest rates and rebates, in their ads.  On the contrary, thatnuts-and-bolts technique flourishes in direct mail, where introductoryinterest rates and other cardholder perks routinely appear on the front ofenvelopes to draw consumers into the offer.While the entries submitted for this year's Credit Card Management CardIndustry Marketing Awards earned higher marks from the marketing experts themagazine assembled to judge them, the overall quality of the entries fellshort of winning the judges' highest praise.  Card marketers have plenty ofroom for improvement, the judges say.Judging the television commercials and print ads was Richard Kimmel, presidentof Chicago-based Kimmel & Co.  J.  Randy Howell, vice president and senior artdirector for Chicago-based DraftDirect Worldwide, judged the direct-mailpieces.The ads submitted in the print and television categories that failed to earn athumbs up were sunk by story lines irrelevant to selling credit cards,non-distinctive brand positioning, and poor execution.  "Consumers simplywon't take time to unravel the message of a poorly constructed ad," Kimmelargues.At the same time, many of the direct-mail entries were weakened by verbosecopy and one-size-fits-all product positioning.  "There are really no ruleswhen it comes to the creative side, but successful direct marketers know theirtarget audience and don't make the package threatening or difficult tounderstand," says Howell.Given the shortcomings of this year's contestants, only four entries earnedrecognition in the television and print categories, rather than the usualfive.  Nonetheless, our judges, both professional marketers, still foundseveral gems that clearly stated the brand image of the card and which weresupported by lucid copy points."Effective advertising takes a unique position in the marketplace," saysKimmel.  "Unique positions can be successfully defended because they areunlike those taken by competitors.  Consumers remember uniquely positionedcampaigns."The surprise of this year's judging is that for the first time in theseven-year history of the competition, neither American Express Co.,MasterCard International, nor Visa U.S.A.  earned first-place honors in thetelevision category.  That distinction went to Citibank, which also netted tophonors in the print category.  Stern's, a division of Federated DepartmentStores Inc., finished atop the heap in direct mail.  All observations arebased on our judges' comments.Category:  Television CommercialsTelevision is one of the most power advertising mediums available because itcan use emotion and information to seize, define, and fortify a product'sposition in the marketplace like no other medium, says Kimmel.  This year'swinning television ads do just that.  "Establishing a unique position is themost important task of any ad campaign," says Kimmel.First Place:  "Tuxedo,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.After years of being a bridesmaid, Citibank finally gets to the awards altarwith this story of a T-shirt and jeans guy who doesn't spend a lot of money onclothes, but who decides to go all out for his wedding day by purchasing atuxedo.  He pays for the tux with, you guessed it, his Citibank card.  Whyshould viewers care?  Because Citibank was conscientious enough to call theyoung man to make certain that the charge for an expensive tuxedo, an atypicalpurchase for him, wasn't fraudulent.  It's the kind of service people don'texpect from a card issuer, but which makes the bridegroom very happy."This is the type of ad that takes a position in the market and builds a brandimage," says Kimmel.  "Citibank not only says it has a good product, it does awonderful job of telling people they give them something more than a creditcard-they serve the customer.  It's a well-executed commercial."Second Place:  Toys 'R Us Visa,Bank of New York.  BBDO New York.Ad agency BBDO uses clever camera angles and a play on words to bring afun-and-games perspective to a credit card that earns cardholders discounts ontoys based on their spending.  The slick-looking sports car the narrator issitting in as he informs prospective customers they can earn discounts towarda new car when they buy a set of tires turns out to be an optical illusion.The auto actually is a toy photographed to look like the real thing.  So, too,is the boat hitched to the car, which the narrator says also can be bought ata discounted price.After dazzling viewers with this photographic hocus-pocus, the narratorsuccinctly explains the card's benefits-discounts earned on Toys 'R Uspurchases for each transaction.  "The photographic sleight of hand is veryappropriate and doesn't divert viewer's attention from the sales message,"says Kimmel.  "The benefits of the card are clearly spelled out.  It's acharming piece of work."Third Place:  "Vacation,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.This story of a dad doing his job as a father is the follow-up to Citibank'stop-ranked "Tuxedo."  There's Dad talking about a recent family getaway.  Oneday the wife informs him the family needs a vacation, the next day Dad ispacking everyone up for a road trip-it's his job.  Once on the road, thefamily spends "a gazillion dollars" buying cheap souvenirs that will wind upcollecting dust in the closet.  Dad begrudgingly pays for it all because it'shis job.  Soon afterward, the family car breaks down.  Dad gripes and moans,calls a tow truck and pays for the repairs-it's his job.  Dad's choice ofcurrency?  His Citibank card, which takes care of all his credit needs-that'sCitibank's job.While this commercial effectively builds on the brand positioning in "Tuxedo,"it could have more clearly explained the benefit of packing a Citi card whenmishaps occur, says Kimmel.  "You're guessing at the what the benefit is," heexplains.  "It's not clearly explained how Citibank solved the problem in away no other issuer can.  But it's still a good piece of work."Fourth Place:  "Locked Out,"American Express.  Ogilvy & Mather.Celebrities make effective product endorsers, because the sight of theminstantly grabs viewers' attention.  In this spot, comedian Jerry Seinfeldengages in a ridiculous romp after locking himself out of his apartment whilepreparing for a date.  Dressed only in a bathrobe and with just minutes beforehis date arrives, Seinfeld, who just happens to have his AmEx card, dashesacross the street to buy a suit.  Emerging moments later in his dapper duds,Seinfeld pulls together all the pieces he needs for a magical evening.  Inwhirlwind fashion he tracks down a locksmith to open the door to hisapartment, purchases a bouquet of flowers and hires a quartet.  He even buysan umbrella when an unexpected rain shower kicks up.  All the purchases aremade possible by his AmEx card.  His apartment door unlocked moments beforehis date arrives, Jerry has enough time to ice the champagne for his bignight.  Too bad the door lock jammed, and he can't let his date in.While this ad scores high marks for clearly telling viewers in a creative waythat having an AmEx card can get them out of tight situations when they haveno cash, Seinfeld's trials are too far-fetched to convincingly support thatidea, Kimmel argues.  This ad has the ingredients to have placed higher, butin its current state it is not in the same league as the top three finishers.Category:  Print AdvertisingCritics who argue print advertisers need to shift their focus away from imagetoward price may want to rethink their case.  Consumers don't respond to thehard sell from print ads.  Instead, they expect print ads to tell a visualstory that establishes a brand image.  "You can't shout numbers at people whenthey aren't listening," says Kimmel.  This year's print ad winners do nothingof the sort.First Place:  Citibank.  Lowe and Partners/SMS.Citibank strikes gold again with this clever play on the old adage that peoplecan't judge a book by its cover.  Two photos, one of a menacing motorcyclerider and the other of a nerdy looking fellow, are juxtapositioned to make astrong point about the value of Citibank's photocard.  The headline next tothe biker's photo says, "This is you."  The photo next to the nerd says, "Thisis the creep who stole your wallet."  The copy at the bottom of the adexplains that a Citibank photocard provides cardholders with the security ofknowing that if their card is ever lost or stolen, con artists will have atough time using it.  "The ad gets to the point, explains the value of theproduct, and does so with a sense a humor," says Kimmel.Second Place:  F&M Bank, Winchester, Va.  Barber Martin & Associates,Richmond, Va.The strength of this ad is its headline, "The Credit Card For People WhoThought They Couldn't Get One."  It quickly grabs the reader's attention anddraws him into the copy points, where the value of the product is clearlyexplained.  A brief description of how a secured card works is also included.Since the only graphic elements are a photograph of an F&M card and the bank'slogo, the art direction doesn't get in the the way of the message.  "This adis clear and distinctly positions the product," says Kimmel.  "The headlineaddresses the target audience.  It's not the most charming or personable ad,but it is effective."Third Place:  The Associates National Bank.  Parrish Wickersham & Partners,Dallas.This ad targeted at the coveted college-student market uses flippant MTV-stylegraphics and a pointed headline, "Are You Ready for the Real World?"  to grabthe reader's attention.  The centerpiece is a picture of the Earth, over whichseveral statements about the everyday financial problems facing collegestudents are pasted.  Smack dab in the middle, in bold type, is the headline.Succinct copy explains why students can benefit from an Associates creditcard, which sets up the tag line, "Real Plastic for the Real World.""This ad is irreverent enough to spark the curiosity of college students,"says Kimmel.  "It is pointed and makes the product sound useful enough to meettheir needs."Fourth Place:  Old Kent Bank.  Felder Communications Group, Grand Rapids,Mich.This ad hawking Old Kent's Card Miles program, through which cardholders canearn discounts on airline tickets, gets right to the point.  Key sellingpoints are summarized in bullet fashion-free airline tickets for all U.S.airlines can be earned with 20,000 Card Miles, and there are no blackoutperiods restricting the use of the tickets.  Copy points that explaincardholders earn Card Miles points for all transactions, even for everydaypurchases such as gas, groceries, or dry cleaning, rescue a headline that istoo pointed-"Turn groceries into free plane tickets."  A winning effort, butplenty of room for improvement, says Kimmel.Category:  Direct MailDirect mail is the medium for the hard-sell, because consumers expect to bebombarded with special deals through the mail.  The key, however, is not tocreate a piece that makes consumers feel unimportant by using transparentflattery or pitching an offer that they may feel is unaffordable, which inturn makes them feel inadequate.  "Effective pieces address who theircustomers are and what they want," says DraftDirect's Howell.  "Know yourmarket."First Place:  Stern's (a division of Federated Department Stores Inc.)Heinrich Marketing.What puts this piece above the competition is the simplicity of its message.The oversized envelope displays part of a $20 bill in a window, whichimmediately implies the offer brings savings.  To the left of the window is agreen border-the color of money-with the headline, "What You See Is What YouGet."  At the bottom of the envelope is a tag line, "Extra Cash the Next TimeYou Shop."Inside, the letter features a $20 coupon good toward Stern's charge cardpurchases.  The letter clearly lays out the benefits of accepting Stern'spreapproved credit offer:  a $20 coupon, and an additional 20% off purchasesthe first day the card is used.  A postscript at the bottom of the page liststhe location of the Stern's store nearest the prospect.  The back side of theletter displays a map listing the addresses of the 27 Stern's stores in NewYork and New Jersey.  "This offers implies real value without talking down tothe customer, and summarizes the key points," says Howell.  "There is noguessing as to what the offer is about."Second Place:  Bank of New York.  Gillespie Advertising Inc.This entry for Bank of New York's Toys 'R Us Visa earns high marks for its useof four-color printing and the continuity of its marketing message throughoutthe entire package-"Turn everyday spending into free toys."  The message isrepeated on both sides of the envelope.  Inside, a four-color, tri-fold flierfeaturing silhouettes of children playing and the Toys 'R Us logo explains howcardholders earn a 3% rebate on Toys 'R Us purchases and a 1% rebate on allother purchases.  The rebates are redeemable toward discounts on futurepurchases at Toys 'R Us as well as Kids 'R Us clothing stores.The flier also mentions a program to earn discounts on family vacationsthrough Toys 'R Us.  The letter features the added caveat of a $10 Toys 'R Uscoupon for accepting the preapproved offer.  "It's a gorgeous package," saysHowell.  "There is continuity to the message in all the elements, and theoffer gets right to the point."Third Place:  REI/SeaFirst Bank.  Hunt Marketing Group.Using a plain, brown envelope with forest-green lettering and brown paper forthe letter gives this piece an understated look that plays to the austerity ofits target audience-outdoorsmen.  The envelope succinctly highlights the keyfeatures of the offer:  no-annual fee, a 9.9% introductory interest rate, a 1%rebate on purchases, and preapproved credit.Inside, the brown-toned flier talks about Jack, a customer who earns 1%rebates for purchases charged to his REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.)  goldMasterCard, in addition to the rebates he earns as a member of REI's dividendprogram.  These perks enabled Jack to not only buy a new parka for his wife,but for himself, which makes Jack a "very happy camper."  "The color of thispackage is not atypical, which helps it overcome initial consumer resistance,"praises Howell.  "It has a simple, responsible look that appeals to itsaudience."Fourth Place:  Marine Midland Bank.  Marketing Resources.This piece for Marine Midland's Humane Society Visa earns high marks for itsunconventional envelope headline, "The Visa Card Most Preferred by EveryoneFrom Alligators to Zebras."  Supplementing the idea are pictures of theaforementioned animals.  A teaser rate of 9.9% and preapproved credit also arehighlighted.  Additional selling points, such as emergency card replacementand a 24-hour toll-free customer-service number, are bulleted.  Inside, atri-fold flier and letter explain the card's services, and how the HumaneSociety benefits from the card's use.  "The package has a little fun with theidea of helping protect animals, and plays with the idea of coveringeverything from A to Z with its envelope message," observes Howell.Fifth Place:  Humane Society/PNC Bank.  Marketing Resources.Unlike television and print advertising, where brand image is more critical,numbers can still make the biggest impression in direct mail.  The strength ofthis entry is its envelope, across the top of which are emblazoned threefigures, 8.75%, $0 and $5,000.  The numbers are designated, respectively, asthe introductory interest rate, annual fee, and maximum credit limit for thecard being pitched.  Underneath these figures is the headline, "Sometimes thenumbers speak for themselves."  Inside, a tri-fold flier, featuring aquestion-and-answer section, addresses pertinent information about the card.The letter includes a chart comparing interest rate charges paid on higherrate cards to those on the PNC card for the same balances.  "This is aneasy-to-read piece that telegraphs the sales message and gets people insidethe package," says Howell.  "The flier tackles marketing points about the cardthat may have fallen through the cracks, but the numbers say it all."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Love Letters From Wall StreetDespite the continued growth of major credit card issuers, Wall Street iskeeping one ear cocked for the first sounds of retrenchment in the extremelycompetitive card issuing market, which explains the lukewarm reception to someof the issuers' stocks.  But the same apprehension doesn't apply totransaction processors, who are emerging as favorites of the investmentcommunity.  Analysts have awakened to the realization that no matter whosecard consumers decide to carry and whether or not they pay balances off everymonth or heap on more revolving debt, processors stand to gain from electronicpayment's growing share of consumer spending.Though some processors are heavily dependent on a few large customers, buyrecommendations far outweigh hold positions, and nobody is urging investors tosell.  As a consequence, stock prices for these firms are posting someimpressive gains, and analysts are bullish about the long-term outlook forcard processors.From Wall Street's perspective, these are computer-services firms, and in thatcategory they are stars.  Recurring revenues are part of the appeal:  whereasa software firm starts off each quarter with zero revenues, processors cancount on a steady income stream from merchants locked into multi-yearcontracts.  Those revenues will only go up, too, as plastic increases its 7%share of consumer discretionary spending.  And processors are positioningthemselves as turn-key payment solutions, with check-verification andguarantee services, debit card acceptance, and any other non-cash paymentoption that surfaces, such as corporate purchasing cards and stored-valuecards.The processing business has fundamental strengths that appeal to manyinvestors.  The consolidation that is occurring among processors means abigger slice of an expanding pie for those that remain.  New competitors facehuge barriers to entry, and the economies of scale keep getting better.The 800-Pound GorillaThat said, observers nonetheless are keeping an eye on firms such as AT&T Co.and Microsoft Inc.  that might try to make a name for themselves in cardprocessing.  MCI Telecommunications Corp.  gained a stake in 1993 when itbought BT North America's processing operation.  More recently it acquired SHLSystemshouse Ltd., a Canadian systems integrator, says Patrick M.  Burton,information processing analyst at Lehman Brothers.  Still, new entrants arealmost obliged to find a strategic partner to compete, and the business's highcapitalization costs primarily benefits leading processor First Data Corp., hesays.Indeed, the arrival of processing's proverbial 800-pound gorilla didn't dampeninvestors' enthusiasm.  In the wake of Hackensack, N.J.-based First Data'spurchase of First Financial Management Corp., analysts retained their upbeatprognostications for the other players.  And why not?  The only processorsthey expect to take it in the neck, at least in the short term, are merchantbanks such as First National Bank of Omaha and Bank of America that competewith FDC in the merchant end of the business.Analyst Steven S.  Birer of Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco, has buyrecommendations for First Data and Riverwoods, Ill.-based SPS TransactionServices Inc., noting the latter has been priced as an issuer since itsacquisition a year ago of electronic giant Tandy Corp.'s card portfolio, andthose price-earnings multiples typically are half the ratios of processors.Value-Added ServicesMeanwhile, FDC's versatility as both a merchant and cardholder processor hascaptured investors' imaginations.  A wide range of value-added services cannow be promoted, including cash management and others that traditionally havebeen the province of banks.  By virtue of its position as the largest merchantand cardholder processor, FDC is in a position to offer services that otheracquirers have shied away from because of consumer privacy concerns, saysanalyst Gregory M.  Gould of Goldman Sachs & Co.  For example, a deal could bestruck with a department store whereby cardholders invoiced by FDC wouldreceive on-the-spot discounts at those stores' cash registers, assuming FDCdrove them.Since its spin-off in April 1992 from American Express Co., FDC has made fivesignificant purchases in the processing field:  NationalCard/NationalCheckProcessing Systems, TeleMoney Services, Envoy Corp.'s card business, CardEstablishment Services, and First Financial, parent of National Bancard Corp.(NaBanco), the nation's largest merchant acquirer.  Between NaBanco, CES, andits own in-house merchant-procession operation, "they must be approaching 30%of the market," estimates Richard Robida, vice president and merchantprocessing specialist with Speer and Associates.For the time being, the situation at FDC is chaotic, with customers frustratedand confused about which subsidiary is doing what, Robida says.  "For the mostpart, the FDC/FFMC merger activities are happening behind-the-scene and ourclients' daily operation and service are not affected," a First DataSpokesperson responds.  "Also, we're working hard to keep our clients,employees, and shareholders informed about merger activities throughout thetransition."But, once the latest merger is digested, banks that compete with FDC will facea tough choice:  "Either they can become a low-cost provider and slug it outfor share, or adopt an exit strategy," he says.Hambrecht & Quist's Birer altered his rating on National Data Corp.  to holdafter the FDC-First Financial merger was announced, reasoning that corporatemarriage "significantly changed the playing field."Banker Exodus?It's not just the analysts who have such opinions.  "The merger of First Dataand First Financial is going to create a significant amount of introspectionfrom the true bank card acquirers," suggests Richardson M.  Roberts, founderand chairman of PMT Services Inc., who predicts many of them will concludecard processing is divorced from their core business.  "This is more atelecommunications business than a banking business.  It's not about makingloans, it's not just credit cards, it's a lot of other payment settlement."If and when the major bank-owned merchant portfolios come into play, "I assureyou we'll be looking at them," says Roberts, who has been building a war chestto make such a bid.PMT, a Nashville-based independent sales organization that does business asU.S.  Bankcard Center, received a warm reception last year when it became thefirst ISO to make a public stock offering.  It priced at $8 a share in August1994.  A second offering of 1.875 million shares in mid-September of 1995 soldat $22.50 per share.  Six weeks later, the stock was hovering around $26.Leveraged GrowthWhile allowing that quasi-processors like PMT inhabit a risky market nichesusceptible to high merchant turnover, analysts like their short-termprospects.  Smith Barney rates PMT as a high-risk stock that will outperformthe market; Montgomery Securities rates it a solid buy.Capital raised in its two stock sales gives PMT the ability to buy out morecompetitors, something the firm has done 20 times in recent years.  The onlydifference is, now it is able to buy bigger firms that cater to higher-volumemerchants than PMT traditionally has served.  That should give PMT moreleverage to drive down transaction costs while it improves service levels toreduce merchant attrition.Although most merchants are authorizing transactions electronically now, "athird of them are still paper-based, so there is still great room for growth,"Roberts says.  He estimates 800,000 to 1 million U.S.  merchants remain to beconverted.With so many merchants likely to go electronic in the near future, Robertsexpects volume gains over and above the 15% to 20% annual transaction growthforecast through the end of the century.  "At that point, credit cards willonly represent 17% of consumer payments," leaving room for considerablegrowth, he points out.Roberts was left with paper wealth of almost $18 million after selling$675,000 worth of stock in September's offer.  He started the company in 1984at age 26.  "Our success has convinced others that this is a greatopportunity," he says.Uneasy AcquisitionAmong the independent sales organizations eying a public stock sales, analystssay, are Nova Information Systems Inc., which backed away from an initialpublic offering last spring, and Gensar, which acquired the processingoperations of TransNet Inc.  three years ago.  Nova in November took overFirst Union Corp.'s merchant portfolio, which had $2.8 billion in chargevolume in 1994, in return for First Union taking a 35% equity stake in theprocessor.One of the few processor sour notes in 1995 was sounded by retail cardspecialist SPS Transaction Services, and that occurred through no fault of itsprocessing business.  Analysts fingered the recently acquired, $920 millionTandy credit card portfolio for the blame.  That situation only fortifiedinvestors' reservations about the card-issuing business:  even as the marketin general and the pure card issuers in particular continue to defypredictions of a slowdown and post huge gains, issuing's inherent risk makesthem skittish.  The stock prices of issuers often take nose dives when reportsabout higher delinquencies, chargeoffs, and bankruptcies come out-and suchreports may increase in the coming months.By comparison, processors' predictable earnings are a safe haven for anyoneinterested in investing in the card industry.  "SPS's stock had gone to $30,but they had a little bit of a stumble with the Tandy portfolio and theyfailed to hit their earnings projections," points out Burton of LehmanBrothers.  "They need to regain their earnings momentum."  SPS had beenselling at about $26 a share in November, the same price it was at 12 monthsearlier when it split two for one.Among the current crop of publicly traded processors, Atlanta-based NationalData Corp.  is the only one that isn't drawing raves from Wall Street.Montgomery Securities' Richard K.  Weingarten rates NDC a buy, but others inthe investment community are more reserved.  "It's not that there's aparticular problem," says Interstate Johnson Lane's Sandra Barker, who pickedup NDC two years ago and has rated it a hold ever since.  "It's more avaluation comment than anything."  With the stock's price up about 40% in1995, the P/E ratio is down to about 22 times 1996's projected earnings,Goldman Sachs' Gould says.NDC has slipped to a second-tier player in the front-end terminal drivingsegment of the processing business, Speer's Robida says, with only Visa'sMerchant Bank Services and MasterCard's MAPP still able to challenge FDC forsupremacy.  Visa is aligning itself with Total System Services Inc.  as thebankers' alternative to FDC.  NDC used to have a similar strategic alliancewith Total.  NDC also has been slow to move from a voice-authorization networkto an electronic authorizer, he adds, and that has hurt it, along withbusiness decisions in the past that alienated many bankers."That's absurd," responds a NDC spokesman, adding "the bulk" of NDC'sprocessing volume is electronic.  "You have to have some voice authorizationbecause your customers want it," he adds.The richest processor stock is Columbus, Ga.-based Total, which trades atabout 50 times earnings.  Twelve years after its IPO, Total's parent, SynovusCorp., still owns 81% of the stock.  Its high valuation makes Total the onlyprocessor that Weingarten rates a hold.Bullish OutlookWeingarten forecasts 20% to 30% earnings growth for all of the half-dozenprocessors he follows.  He characterizes the category as the new breed ofstock leaders, able to outperform the market year after year.  "Incentivecards have helped processors gain tremendous share, but the real driver iswider merchant acceptance," he says.  "When credit card growth slows, otherbusinesses like health care, stored-value cards, and electronic commerce willstart to feed in.  Twenty percent growth will continue for years."Lehman's Burton is a little more restrained in his prognosis, but he too isupbeat.  "The shift from cash and checks is continuing, and it could beaccelerating," he says.  He gives First Data and Check Free strong buyrecommendations, expects SPS to outperform the market, and rates St.  Paul,Minn.-based Deluxe Corp.  (which acquired Financial Alliance ProcessingService, an ISO and processor) a hold.Analysts fret about the impact on a processor if a large account should bolt.Montgomery already has factored in the eventual loss by SPS of Lechmere, anortheastern retailer that was acquired by Montgomery Ward a year ago and isexpected to take its processing business to GE Capital after court proceedingsare settled.No other client danger flags are being raised, however.  Total relies on theAT&T Universal card for a large share of its processing volume, but along-term extension last year gives the analysts comfort.  "It would concernme more if the contract was coming up for renewal," notes Larry Hickey ofFirst Analysis Corp.  With NationsBank and Bank of America now working withTotal, the company isn't overly dependent on any single client, he points out.The riskiness of credit granting keeps investors up at night and makes themskittish about the pure card stocks like Advanta Corp., MBNA Corp., First USAInc., and Capital One Financial Corp.  The processors, on the other hand, area safe harbor and a good way to cash in on plastic's transformation to a majortransaction device.  As one analyst observes, "Boring is beautiful."Indeed, the boring predictability of card processors' growth rates and marginsof 20% for the foreseeable future make this one of the most appealing classesof stock on Wall Street.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Detente for Lawyers And Collectors?Three years ago, they were the new kids on the block.  But now, electronicattorney collection networks are proving themselves by boosting recoveries ofcharged-off credit card debt and relieving card issuers of some of their legalburdens.  And collections agencies, many of which vehemently opposed thelawyer networks muscling their way onto collectors' turf, now are beginning toaccept the newcomers.In fact, it's going beyond mere begrudging acceptance.  Some collectionsagencies themselves have already formed or are planning alliances withattorney networks.  And at least one agency might even create its own attorneynetwork.  "They're not mutually exclusive anymore," says Warren S.  Rosenfeld,managing partner of McNeily, Rosenfeld & Associates, a Washington, D.C., lawfirm that operates the Rosenfeld-Net.Equifax Inc., the big credit-reporting agency that also owns a majorcollections company, Equifax Risk Management Services, crystallized the newattitude last October when it formed a venture with Rosenfeld's firm calledLitigation Access Web.  "The backdrop is the collection agencies have feltthis was our turf and were very reluctant to send any accounts out, or referto attorneys," says Lyle F.  Herrmann, Litigation Access Web product manager."And the attorneys were saying, 'why use collectors?' There was some fingerpointing and bragging rights-me, me, mine, mine, mine.  But there is aneffective place and role for the agency-type collector, and there is aneffective role for litigation."Moving CloserThe folks who give the collections agencies and lawyers their business arevoicing similar opinions.  "Both sides are moving closer to each other," saysEugene V.  Brugger, recovery manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Bank OneColumbus, which uses the National Attorney Network for part of its recoverywork.  "I think there's a realization that there's money to be made bycollaboration."Besides NAN and Rosenfeld-Net, there are now several other attorney networks(box, page 52).  They include the National Association of Retail CollectionAttorneys' NARCA-Net; Dozier Legal Network, a subsidiary of the Richmond,Va.-based Dozier and Associates P.C.; and the network run by the AmericanAssociation of Collector Attorneys.While the networks vary in the range of services they offer and technologicalcapabilities, the common thread is that they allow card issuers to placecharged-off accounts and supporting documents with law firms electronically.That reduces the paper burden, and some networks make it easy for issuers,using computers and software linked to the networks, to keep track oflitigation and the performance of each firm.The networks also can quickly place accounts with their law-firm members,which means issuers' lawyers can devote most of their attention to monitoringwhat the firms acting on their behalf are doing rather than hunting forcompetent attorneys wherever they have deadbeat customers.  "We're dealingwith one attorney instead of 50 attorneys in 50 different states," says EdwardJ.  Casey, collection and recovery manager for Bridgeport, Conn.-basedPeople's Bank, which uses Rosenfeld-Net.  "It takes a big burden off of us."Growth IndustrySensing a growing need for such tracking and oversight services, the attorneywho founded the Dozier Legal Network, John W.  Dozier Jr., stopped doingactual collections work last year when he founded his namesake network.  "Wecame to the conclusion that in order for this to work, we (shouldn't be) a lawfirm trying to run a computer network, we needed to be a technology companyproviding a legal application," says Dozier, who hopes to have more than 400law firms affiliated with his network by year's end, compared with 70 at theend of 1995.Indeed, the attorney networks almost unanimously are reporting strong growth.AACA's network placed 16,000 accounts worth about $70 million last year, butPresident Raymond J.  Cook projects 30,000 accounts and $140 million inplacements this year.  "Credit grantors want to try something different thanthe traditional 'we'll place it with a collection agency approach,'" Cooksays.Despite the networks' growth, one factor reducing tensions between the lawyersand the collectors is the overall growth of the card industry.General-purpose card receivables grew 20% in 1993 and 19% in 1994, and 1995'sgrowth will probably come close.  Such huge growth means lots of charged-offdebt even though credit quality, while showing some signs of fraying, still ishigh.  In fact, card issuers probably can expect to recover about $2 billionthis year.Thus, even some collectors who expressed deep skepticism about the newattorney networks ("This Is No Lawyer Joke," April, 1994) profess today thatthey're not too worried.  "From my personal perspective, they've not takenanything at all (from us)," says Craig J.  Costanzo, chairman and chiefexecutive of Management Adjustment Bureau, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency thathandles about $100 million in charged-off card debt annually.  "There's justso much business out there, it's unbelievable."Doubling RecoveriesWhile a majority of the attorney networks have only brief track records, someare starting to rack up impressive numbers-and thus forcing collectionagencies to take notice.  GE Capital Corp., the nation's largest third-partyretail card issuer, started placing accounts for legal action throughAtlanta-based NAN in 1994.  For the first nine months of 1995, recoveriesthrough NAN were 106% higher than they were for accounts placed forconventional legal action in the same 1994 period.The reason?  The electronic network makes it easy to monitor each account'sstatus, and to compare the performance of the approximately 70 law firms GECapital uses nationwide.  With more than 300,000 charged-off store cardaccounts being placed for legal action yearly, fewer cases are getting lost inthe shuffle, says Mary K.  Kinsey, senior vice president of collectionsservices for GE Capital Credit Services.  "It really forces them (law firms)to look at every single account," she says.Money on the TableWhile there are wide variations among individual issuers, collections expertsestimate that less than 5% of charged-off accounts-perhaps even as low as2%-result in litigation.  But some observers say that as many as 10% ofdeadbeat accounts should be litigated-a goal that's hard for national issuersto hit as they struggle to manage dozens of law firms handling thousands ofcases.The attorney networks say they can get the cases into court that should be incourt.  NAN's president, attorney Douglas W.  Wallace, says his network isaiming for $1 billion in placements this year, compared with 300,000 creditcard claims for just over $500 million in 1995 and 120,000 claims for $240million in 1994, the network's first year.  He estimates about 70% of thecases referred to the 165 law firms in the network result in lawsuits.  "It'sa given that legal action is more effective than any other form of recovery,"says Wallace.Adds St.  Louis collections attorney Donald B.  Kramer, president of Kramer &Frank P.C.  and founder of NARCA:  "Credit card issuers are used to getting a6% recovery from collections agencies.  Attorneys can double or triple that aslong as they give the attorney enough time.  The agencies pour out thepressure in the first 60 days, but if you look at the end of two years, theyattorneys absolutely kill the agencies."Collection agencies, meanwhile, disagree with the practice by some issuers tosend certain deadbeat accounts directly to lawyers, even though agencies mightproduce as good or better recovery rates.  "I think clients are making a poordecision in sending straight to a network," says one collections executive whoinsists on anonymity.Though collections agencies may disagree with the attorneys' bluster, growingnumbers are acknowledging that lawyers have an increasingly important role inrecovering bad debt.  "I do believe that agencies, by not aligning themselveswith attorneys, are leaving a lot of money on the table," says Douglas B.Schultz, chief executive officer of United Recovery Systems Inc., a Houstoncollections agency which does work for seven of the 10 largest card issuers."I do see attorney-agency alliances in the future."With that in mind, Schultz is considering a partnership with one of thenetworks, though he hasn't decided on which one.  He might even form his ownnetwork.Profit IssueAnd while Schultz can get along with lawyers, he nonetheless has somemisgivings about a formal business partnership because of the profit question.If the issuer-client lets his agency keep 35% of the recovered debt, but thelawyers take 25%, "that leaves only 10% for me," Schultz says.  And that thinmargin could be reduced even further depending on which party has to absorbthe court costs, he adds.Still, Schultz thinks allying with attorney networks at the very least makessending paperwork back and forth easier-and thus makes clients happier.  Andif he can show card issuers that his recovery rates are going up because ofmore legal action, so much the better, because it will bring more volume tothe agency.  "I don't think there's that much profit for the agencies, butit's another option," he says.Equifax retains an average of 33% of recoveries and hopes to make its newLitigation Access Web service profitable by asking clients to absorb the courtcosts.  As of early December, some 800 accounts had been referred to the legalservice, but Equifax's Herrmann says it's still too soon to quote recoveryrates.Clearly, however, Equifax is looking to feather its already large collectionsnest-$3 billion a year in placements, about a third of which is card debt-byadding the legal network to its roster of services.  "We wanted to prove tothe industry that we could take the high road to have our collection-agencybusiness work hand-in-hand with an attorney network," says Herrmann.Equifax's basic criteria for referral to the network hinges on the accountbalance (less than $1,000 is less likely to be litigated), the span of timesince a payment, and whether the debtor has a valid address and is employed.Debtors with jobs and assets upon which a court can slap a lien, such as ahouse, are most likely to be sued.Issuers and attorneys still have to be very careful about which consumers theyintend to sue.  Management Adjustment Bureau's Costanzo, who still remainswary of the attorney networks, notes that the federal Fair Debt CollectionPractices Act makes it illegal to threaten lawsuits unless the threat isfollowed by action.But Banc One's Brugger says that his bank, for one, is scrupulous about whatit tells debtors.  "The only time we'll tell customers we're going to sue themis if we have the intent," he says.Ironically, the number of Bank One's lawsuits against cardholders has gonedown recently, according to Brugger who did not cite specific figures.  Heattributes that to more diligent work by the attorneys early in the process.Even Costanzo concedes that correspondence from an attorney can scare paymentsout of recalcitrant debtors.  "The fact that they send a letter out on anattorney letterhead is very helpful," he says.And as that notion gains more and more currency among issuers' collectionsmanagers, the future looks increasingly bright for the attorney networks.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Send In the RepairmenIt's been well over a year since major amendments to the federal BankruptcyCode took effect.  The amendments were hailed by many creditors, includingcredit card issuers, as important changes which would both curb bankruptcyfilings and significantly enhance bankruptcy recoveries.  To date, neitherbenefit has materialized, although some of the amendments have had positiveresults.Indeed, bankruptcy filings have been on a 12-month increase.  When the final1995 numbers are made official, total filings for the past year will likely bein the neighborhood of 920,000, which would be the third-highest yearly totalever.  The rate of increased bankruptcy filings for the past four quartersechoes the bankruptcy explosion of the mid-1980s.The 1994 Bankruptcy Code amendments also have yet to significantly increaseper-case recoveries.  As a result, card issuers are becoming more vocal indemands for a further tightening of bankruptcy laws.The Good NewsOne of the several positive changes made in 1994 was the raising of theChapter 13 debt ceiling to $250,000 of unsecured debt and $750,000 of secureddebt.  This allows more consumers to seek relief through reorganization ofpersonal debts under Chapter 13, as opposed to filings under Chapter 7, inwhich the debtor's assets are liquidated, or Chapter 11, in which business andpersonal debts are reorganized.  In the later two cases, recoveries to cardissuers have always been lower.  In some of the areas of the country, Chapter11 filings have declined, while Chapter 13 filings have increased, althoughonly marginally.Another positive change which holds promise for the long term was thestreamlining of the reaffirmation process by eliminating the need for courtapproval.  By signing a reaffirmation agreement before a bankruptcy dischargeis entered, a debtor agrees to continued liability after bankruptcy.  Thosedebtors who sign such agreements usually do so to avoid a creditor's complaintcontesting the discharge where the account was loaded up with charges beforethe bankruptcy filing, or where an issuer has offered to let the debtorcontinue to use the card account after bankruptcy.  The latter group includesa growing number of issuers who see reaffirmation as a good way to cutbankruptcy losses.A third positive change was extending the so-called pre-bankruptcy presumptionperiod, during which the charges are presumed to be nondischargeable, to 60days.  The presumption applies to both cash advances and luxury goods andservices where either exceeds $1,000.  This change is reported to haveeffectively enhanced issuers' ability to quickly settle potentialdischargeability claims for relatively large sums.  Because so few accounts,relative to total bankruptcy filings, have activity which rises to the levelof fraud required under the present bankruptcy code standard, actual increasedrecoveries from this change, while significant, have not been dramatic.Finally, the 1994 amendments created the National Bankruptcy ReviewCommission, comprised of nine appointed members who have begun their two-yearmission to review the bankruptcy laws, take testimony from affected parties,and make recommendations to Congress regarding future amendments.  While it isa positive development to have a focal point for change, the obvious downsidewould be congressional reluctance to consider changes before the commissionhas weighed in with its report almost two years from now.  Issuers should,therefore, consider a dual approach to reform:  long-term advocacy through thecommission and, hopefully, faster-track changes by seeking direct legislativeinput into needed amendments.ExemptionsA negative change in the 1994 law was the increase in the dollar value ofproperty debtors are allowed to protect from sale by a bankruptcy trustee.The so-called federal-exemption amounts were doubled across the board.Examples include the homestead exemption which was increased from $7,500 to$15,000 ($30,000 for a married couple), and the household-goods exemptionwhich was doubled to $8,000 ($16,000 for a married couple).  Although thefederal exemptions only apply in 15 states, at least two of the 35 otherstates have recently increased their exemption amounts.  One was California,which doubled the exemptions available to its residents, citing the federalincrease as a basis.Because so-called asset Chapter 7 cases can take two years or longer toliquidate, it is still too early to tell the effect of the exemption change.But because every exemption dollar comes directly out of funds which wouldhave otherwise gone to unsecured creditors, the negative effect will certainlybe significant.Much of the past and present volume of bankruptcy filings is attributable tothe marketing of bankruptcy, both direct and indirect.  Indirect marketingincludes word of mouth (with almost 1 million filings per year, there are alot of voices out there), newspaper coverage (it is virtually impossible tofind an issue of any major-market newspaper that does not include an articleabout a well-known company's or celebrity's bankruptcy filing), and how-tobooks about bankruptcy.All of these indirect marketing aspects have resulted in the almost completeerosion of the stigma once attached to filing bankruptcy.  Yes, bankruptcystill is an extreme emotional hardship for most people, but the reluctance tofile is much easier to overcome in an environment where famous individuals andcompanies are often perceived (usually incorrectly) to be using bankruptcyrelief as a mere financial-planning device.By far the most effective bankruptcy marketing, however, has been what is ineffect direct marketing by debtors' attorneys.  They have done an excellentjob of making consumers aware of the bankruptcy option through advertisementsin the Yellow Pages, newspapers and on television, and through targeted mailsent directly to persons facing lawsuits for defaults.  It is no coincidencethat the bankruptcy explosion of the 1980s came on the heels of the SupremeCourt's relaxation of advertising restrictions upon attorneys.Countering the MessagesIn the face of this successful marketing of bankruptcy, major issuers havebeen attempting for some time to communicate the negative aspects of abankruptcy filing to customers, most importantly a bankruptcy's negativeaffect upon obtaining future credit.  Many issuers have also been activelyreferring delinquent customers to local branches of the Consumer CreditCounseling Service as an alternative to bankruptcy.  Some issuers haveadvocated placing national newspaper ads explaining non-bankruptcy options.Just as important as combating bankruptcy marketing is the need to focus uponimproving recoveries from the increasing number of bankruptcies.  In thisregard, it is useful to look at the big picture which shows that, nationally,almost 70% of consumer cases are filed under Chapter 7.  Of these, only about5% result in any recovery to card issuers.  Issuers' main bankruptcyrecoveries have always come from Chapter 13 repayment plan cases which,unfortunately, are less than a third of all filings.The main avenue to a dramatic increase in bankruptcy recoveries, then, is toshift as many Chapter 7 cases as possible into Chapter 13.  This has beentried repeatedly by suggesting amendments to Congress which would eliminateChapter 7 or greatly restrict its usage.  The only such change ever actuallyto survive the political process and become enacted was the largelyineffective substantial-abuse provision, added in 1984.  That provision allowsthe court to dismiss a Chapter 7 filing if the judge determines the caseconstitutes an abuse of the law.  It was intended to directly force thosedebtors with sufficient income to fund a repayment plan into Chapter 13.  Butbecause of procedural and substantive problems inherent in the wording of thestatute, the provision has never had the desired effect, and is ripe forfurther amendment.Rather than focusing solely upon tightening the availability of Chapter 7relief, however, issuers should consider ways in which Chapter 13 can beenhanced and thereby made more attractive to consumers.  A common complaintamong debtors' attorneys and Chapter 13 trustees is that debtors have noincentive to repay unsecured creditors under Chapter 13.  This is because,they argue, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is just as likely to result in the denialof future credit as is a Chapter 7 filing, and both types of filings arereportable for up to 10 years.The Reporting IssueOne way to enhance Chapter 13 would be to roll back the credit-reportingperiod for a Chapter 13 filing while leaving Chapter 7 at 10 years.  If, forexample, Chapter 13 filings could only be reported up to six months afterdischarge, it might be anticipated that many debtors would opt for Chapter 13as the best way of rebuilding their credit.The Chapter 13 option would be further enhanced if issuers were to adjusttheir records upon receiving a Chapter 13 discharge to reflect a favorablesettlement.  They could also alter lending policies to provided that customerswho complete meaningful Chapter 13 plans would be considered for future creditaccording to their individual circumstances, and not be denied creditautomatically because of a past Chapter 13 filing which affected the issuer.With regard to post-bankruptcy credit, Chapter 13 trustees in Texas and Ohiohave had debtor-rehabilitation programs in effect for several years.  Underthese programs, debtors who successfully complete larger-percentage repaymentplans are considered on their merits for new credit by participating lenders.The lenders do not promise new credit, but do agree to disregard the Chapter13 filing, or to consider it as a favorable indicator of a debtor'srehabilitation in evaluating a credit application.  The trustees report thatthe program has successfully encouraged debtors to choose Chapter 13 overChapter 7.A strong advantage of focusing upon enhancing Chapter 13 relief is thatlegislative opposition presumably would be minimal because the proposals arenot restrictive, but rather offer debtors incentives to rehabilitate throughChapter 13 on a voluntary basis.  This approach reflects compassion for thosewho got in over their heads with credit, sometimes for reasons beyond theircontrol, but often due to an unsuccessful adjustment to the relatively new ageof convenient credit.  Surviving in this era requires self-discipline andcredit education, the lack of which is a problem that is societal in scope.A Favorable ArgumentIn addition, as a foundation upon which to argue for legislative action, afavorable argument can be made that the historically high ratio of Chapter 13to Chapter 7 cases in most of the Southeast should be possible in the rest ofthe country.  The Southeast, with the exception of Florida, traditionally hashad a larger ratio of Chapter 13 filings because, according to some areabankruptcy professionals, conservative attitudes prevail in the largely ruralareas, and Chapter 7 exemptions in those states have been generally morerestrictive.This does not mean that a tightening of Chapter 7 should be ignored.  On thecontrary, removing the subjective standard in many dischargeability contests(the so-called intent to repay) with a more objective (reasonable ability torepay) standard, would ease the difficult burden of proof now facing issuersin many jurisdictions.Going further, although strong opposition could be expected from the consumerlobby, it could be proposed that all principal from debts incurred 90 daysbefore bankruptcy be automatically nondischargeable without the need to file adischargeability complaint.  Such an approach would have a foundation in otherWestern countries' bankruptcy laws, which are generally far more conservative.In sum, issuers' goals of decreased bankruptcy filings and enhanced recoveriescould be met, in part, through making Chapter 13 more attractive, which wouldlikely encounter little opposition, while also proposing tighter Chapter 7dischargeability standards.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996A Plan to Improve The Bankruptcy Law* Make Chapter 13 more attractive to consumers by shortening the time negativebankruptcy information will stay on their credit reports.  * Issuers shouldconsider more favorable treatment for debtors who choose Chapter 13 comparedwith those who use Chapter 7.  * Change the subjective "intent to repay"dischargeability standard in Chapter 7 cases to an objective "reasonableability to repay" standard.  * Make principal debts incurred within 90 days ofa Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing nondischargeable-in other words, the consumercannot escape responsibility for repayment.Source:  Becket & WatkinsBack to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Sorting Out the MailThe mountain of mail coming from credit card issuers keeps rising to newheights.  Card mailings are projected to have totaled 2.8 billion pieces in1995, an 18.5% increase from a year earlier, according Tarrytown, N.Y.-basedBehavioral Analysis Inc.In order to get a better read on which issuers are mailing the most and thetypes of cards most frequently mailed, Faulkner & Gray Inc., publisher ofCredit Card Management, began tracking in April 1994 mailings to staffers inits Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.  offices.  Details from thesolicitations were published monthly in CCM's sister publication, Credit CardNews.  Mailings collected through November 1995 totaled 1,077.While the results of such a survey are not a statistically representativesample of the entire industry, they do provide a road map of which issuers aredominating mailings and the types of pricing strategies in play.Top MailersThough issuers are mailing more than ever, the bulk of those mailings arecoming from a handful of issuers.  The top 10 issuers tracked in the surveyaccounted for 56% of all offers received.  To no one's surprise, Citibank wasthe top mailer with an 11.5% share, followed by Capital One Financial Corp.with a 6.8% share, and First USA, at 6.5%.  Unexpectedly checking in fourth isSan Francisco-based Providian Bankcorp (formerly First Deposit), which ranks22nd in receivables, with a 6.1% share.  MBNA rounds out the top five, with4.9% share.On the pricing side, annual fees remain alive, though they continue to loseground.  Overall, 27% of solicitations received had an annual fee.  Abreakdown of solicitations received for 1995 reveals that issuers are mailingfewer solicitations with annual fees.  Just 26% of solicitations received in1995 had annual fees, down from 29% in 1994.  And nearly all gold card offersare promoted as non-fee cards, according to BAI.Fixed interest rates are also disappearing from the landscape.  Variable ratesare now king.  Of the general purpose card offers received, 78% promoted apermanent variable rate, and 29% offered a variable teaser rate pegged to theprime rate, LIBOR, or some other floating measure.Teaser rates virtually have become a prerequisite for card mailings, as 82% ofsolicitations offered either a fixed-rate or variable rate teaser.  The spliton the duration of the teasers was fairly even:  48% pitched teasers for sixmonths or less, while 52% offered teasers for more than six months.As for the types of cards being mailed, gold cards were the dominant subset,netting 52% of bank card mailings received.  BAI reports that gold cardsrepresented 48% of bank card mailings during the second quarter of 1995.Cobranded cards accounted for 15% of all CCN's bank card mailings.  Cobrandedcards totaled 20% of bank card mailings during the second quarter, accordingto BAI.MasterCard International still leads the cobranding derby.  CobrandedMasterCards represented 65% of cobranded card mailings that did not offerconsumers a choice of brand, compared with 35% for Visa.Among cobranded partners, AT&T's Universal Card lead the way, accounting for22% of cobranded card mailings.  American Airlines' AAdvantage card was secondwith a 17% share of mailings, and the Shell MasterCard placed third with a 12%share.Given the volume of mail, Faulkner & Gray intends to monitor card offers evenmore closely in the future.  Which issuers will be the biggest mailers in 1996and what types of offers will consumers see?  Stay tuned.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996An End Run By FraudstersWhen it comes to the war on fraud, the credit card industry has been sofocused on developing new technologies, such as smart cards, to foil conartists that they may have forgotten to scrutinize the legal loopholes andtheir own business practices for potential weaknesses that swindlers canexploit.Indeed, the indictment last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles of 20Vietnamese immigrants for bank fraud has exposed a serious flaw in theExpedited Funds Availability Act of 1988, in addition to possible flaws in howcard issuers govern their own organizations.The type of fraud perpetrated is a so-called booster-check scheme in which thesuspects allegedly wrote checks from accounts with insufficient funds to boosttheir credit limits, then made cash advances and expensive purchases with thecards before the checks were rejected by the banks.  After the credit burdenbecame too great, the defendants allegedly declared bankruptcy.The scheme defrauded issuers nationwide of more than $40 million, and morearrests are expected.  Similar ploys could cost issuers as much as $100million, says Assistant U.S.  Attorney Marc R.  Greenberg.  That's about 14%of the $734 million in bank card fraud in 1994.  Investigators have subpoenaedthe records from 150 credit card issuers, including Chase Manhattan Corp.,AT&T Universal Card Services, Banc One, and Bank of America.The case raises concerns that changes need to be made to the Expedited FundsAvailability Act of 1988, which requires banks and issuers to post a check andcredit the funds as soon as the check is received, rather than waiting for itto clear.Prosecutors claim loopholes in the law enabled the suspects to withdraw largecash advances or buy big-ticket items with the cards after mailing to theircard issuing banks bogus checks to boost their credit limits.  Some defendantsallegedly sent five checks of $5,000 each to one issuer in a week, then spentthe entire amount before the first check was cleared or rejected by the bank,Greenberg says.After the defendants depleted all available credit on their cards, they wouldfile bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy court records reveal each cardholder has from$100,000 to $685,000 in unsecured credit card debt.  "The law requires issuersto open the line of credit as soon as the check is received," says Joel S.Lisker, MasterCard International Senior Vice President of Security and RiskManagement.  "This is a foolish thing to do."Sharing the BlameResponding to fraud concerns, the Federal Reserve Board plans to survey bankson the extent of check fraud losses caused by the Expedited Funds AvailabilityAct.  The six-page survey should begin arriving at financial institutionsaround mid-February.But the case is also drawing attention to card issuers own short- comings inthe fraud battle.  Fraud experts argue that competition and complacency haveprompted issuers to write off booster check fraud as a collection issueinstead of fraud, overlook red flags that suggest fraud, and make cards tooeasy to obtain.  One suspect had five MasterCards from one bank, each one witha maxed out credit limit, says Greenberg.Adds Everett Whatley, president of Raleigh, N.C.-based Card Risk ManagementGlobal:  "Competition makes issuers less sensitive to fraud andcreditworthiness.  They should not allow checks to boost a credit line.  If alarge check is received, they should ensure the funds are in the bank accountthe check is written from before posting it."That's a logical solution, but will issuers heed the advice?Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996I'll Trade You My Portfolio...Card executives who were savvy traders of baseball cards during their youthmay want to brush up those skills.  The concept of acquiring credit cardaccounts via a straight-up trade for accounts of equal value is beingconsidered as a low-cost alternative to buying portfolios.Indeed, with fewer portfolios on the block and escalating premiums, portfoliotrading makes good sense.  After all, issuers can rid themselves of accountsthat don't fit the makeup of their portfolio, such as affinity cards that wereacquired via a merger, by trading for accounts more in line with theirbusiness, such as those in their home market.Confused?  Don't be.  "The idea is to trade away accounts that are morevaluable to another issuer in exchange for accounts that are more valuable toyou," explains Michael J.  Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group,Westbury, N.Y., which is broaching the idea to clients.Let's Make a DealThat's certainly an attractive proposition in an era when banks are underincreasing pressure to grow assets.  But completing an equitable trade is notan easy task, warns to Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Co., aNewbury Park, Calif.-based consulting firm specializing in portfolio sales."I was involved in two attempted trades back in the 1980s, and both times thedeal fell through because one side always felt their portfolio was worth morethan the other portfolio," Hammer recalls.Just how feasible is portfolio trading?  Auriemma argues that with banks beingpushed by investors to grow assets, issuers will start to give seriousconsideration to the concept because the money saved by not paying a premiumto buy a coveted block of accounts can be put toward card marketing.But before issuers rush off to make the trade of a lifetime, they had bestcheck with their accounting departments about the cost of adding thoseaccounts to the portfolio.  Issuers thinking of trading portfolios ought toask themselves the following questions before pulling the trigger on a trade,cautions one Wall Street analyst:  Can the acquisition costs associated withthose accounts still be be amortized?  Will the accounts acquired in a tradebe more expensive to service than those traded away?  And will the acquiredaccounts be more profitable than those traded away?  "There are a lotaccounting issues that must be addressed," the analyst adds.Card experts agree that portfolio trading can be pulled off if the partiesinvolved price their portfolios equitably.  "Portfolio trading is such anattractive option, any prudent issuer will look at it," says Hammer.  Whoknows, maybe one day credit card executives may trade card portfolios aseasily as they traded, when they were kids, a baseball card of Mickey Mantlefor one of Willie Mays.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Cutting Up Commercial CardsFor years, card marketers have successfully sliced and diced the consumer cardmarket into thinner segments by creating products that cater to specificcardholder needs.  But when it comes to commercial cards, there has beenlittle segmentation.Sure, issuers have created purchasing cards and cards targeted at smallbusinesses that offer a revolving line of credit, but those are basicsegmentation techniques, much like standard and gold cards.  Consequently, fewof the high-powered segmentation techniques learned in the consumer markethave been applied to commercial cards.That's because corporations and businesses have historically looked to cardprograms to lower their operating expenses first.  Cardholder perks areconsidered a frivolous expense that raise the cost of the card program.But that attitude is changing.  American Express Co.'s launch of a platinumcorporate card last October signals that small-business executives, at whichthe card is targeted, are demanding more consumer card perks from commercialcard issuers.Catering to NeedsThe reason:  small-business executives tend to be less sensitive to the costof a commercial card program than large corporations, says Fred O.  Gumbel,president of the electronic commerce division for Electronic Data Systems."Small businesses are more willing to accept perks on commercial cards thanlarge corporations even though those benefits may be built in to the price ofthe card," says Gumbel, who headed First Bank Systems' corporate cardportfolio before moving to EDS in 1994.AmEx, which says its small-business customers asked for more perks, answeredthe call with its platinum corporate card.  The card charges a $300 annual feeand $150 for additional cards.  Cardholders receive free companion ticketswhen they buy a full-fare, first-class or business-class airline ticket; freeenrollment in AmEx's Membership Rewards program; free room upgrades,continental breakfast for two, and late checkout at participating hotels; andconfirmed restaurant reservations.Now that AmEx is applying segmentation techniques learned in the consumermarket to commercial cards, will bank card issuers follow?  The answer is yes."There are bank card issuers interested in marketing a cobranded commercialcard," declares Peter L.  Williamson, managing director of Stamford,Conn.-based Salestrac USA Inc.So coveted are some consumer card perks that small-business owners are payingfor business expenses with consumer cards.  "The right rewards are a big plusfor small businesses," says Williamson.  Perks small-business commercial cardholders may see are frequent-flier miles, car-rental and gasoline discounts."Segmentation is becoming more important in corporate card marketing," saysDorsey R.  Grant, AmEx's vice president of customer loyalty, small-businessservices.  "Whether it's data reporting or cardholder perks, commercialcardholders have specialized needs."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Risk-Based Repricing Draws FlakOn cyberspace chat lines and consumer-rights phone lines, Capital OneFinancial Corp.  is drawing heat for the policy it calls risk-based repricingand consumer advocates say is just unfair.Since last spring, a couple of dozen consumers have contacted Bankcard Holdersof America to complain about Capital One's strategy of altering interest rateson existing customers' credit lines when periodic credit-report reviews revealcustomers have been issued other credit cards, have assumed new debt, or haveotherwise altered their credit profile."That's not a huge number, but the ones we hear from are irate," reports RuthSusswein, BHA's executive director.  "They're being bumped from 12.9% to24.9%.  If they're a poor credit risk, I don't see how a rate hike is solvingthe problem."Syndicated columnist Jane Bryant Quinn also took Capital One to task forsharply higher rate hikes and the "gobbledygook" explanations given toconsumers for the adverse action.  Quinn cited the case of a fireman whoseinterest rate went from 13.9% to 24.96% despite timely payments.  Shesuggested bank regulators should scrutinize the practice.BHA also has been critical of other issuers for what it terms penalty rates,citing Citibank and AT&T Universal for higher late fees and rates forcardholders who fail to uphold their credit agreement.  But Susswein notes theconcept of increasing rates for existing customers on the basis of creditreviews of other trade lines is different, and she suspects Capital One isn'tthe only issuer doing it.Capital One President Nigel W.  Morris defends the strategy and predicts mostissuers will eventually follow suit.  He says the practice of both raising andlowering rates "on a selective basis" has been done by the former Signet cardcenter since 1989."Down the road, the credit card business will look more like the insurancebusiness, with pricing based on likely outcomes instead of one price foreverybody," Morris says.  "Knowing who to do it to and when to do it iscritical."Whether a trend will develop toward risk-based instead of performance-basedrepricing is open to debate.  One issuer who requested anonymity says higherrates based on poor credit behavior "makes good business sense," but changingrates or fees for existing customers because they are assuming debt withanother lender amounts to "preying on the laziness of the American public,"cardholders who stick with higher-rate cards simply because they don't botherto find better deals.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Tapping the Ethnic MarketCard issuers looking to tap the expanding Hispanic market ought to keep an eyeon Key Federal Savings Bank's new secured Hispanic affinity card.Key Federal, which is partnering with Texas-based SER, a renowned andrespected national nonprofit organization dedicated to creating education,literacy, employment, and job-skills programs for Hispanics, is betting thecard will be a hit in a market in which affinity cards tend to flop.

On Jan.  4, AmericanExpress Co.'s Centurion Bank and Delta Air Lines released details of theirmuch-anticipated Delta SkyMiles Optima frequent-flyer program.  Then, on Jan.9, American Airlines and the Air Travel Card, the airline industry's60-year-old travel payment system, announced the launch of the AmericanAirlines AAsset Card.  It is a cobranded MasterCard that can be used both as acorporate air travel card and multi-purpose travel-and-entertainment card.  Itis being issued under a partnership between Air Travel Card and GE CapitalFinancial Inc.Just what impact these new cards will have on the businesstravel-and-entertainment market is unknown.  But they bring major new playersinto an already fiercely competitive game."Folks realize there's a lot of money being spent on business travel," saysMichele Turkel, president of Spectrum International Consulting Corp.,Scarsdale, N.Y.  "There's going to be a lot of new travel products."Both new cobranded airline cards face an uphill battle.  The Delta SkyMilesOptima card is a late entrant in the frequent-flyer arena, and must offer aunique rewards package to make it stand out from other products alreadywell-established in the marketplace, observers say.  Indeed, American Expressmakes no secret it is trying to lure away cardholders from Visa and MasterCardcobranded frequent-flyer card programs by offering incentives forDelta-related purchases, points that never expire and bonus points forcarrying balances.  "This is the credit card product our customers have beenasking us for," says Brian Kleinberg, AmEx's senior vice president of newproduct development.  It is the first ever cobranded card for Delta, althoughthe airline has long participated in AmEx's Membership Rewards loyalty program(CCN, Sept.  1, 1995).Delta and AmEx expect the card to bring in more than 500,000 new members tothe SkyMiles program over the next five years, says Paul Matsen, Delta's vicepresident of advertising and consumer marketing.  SkyMiles currently has 18million members.The SkyMiles card offers 1.5 SkyMiles for every dollar spent on Delta AirLines and Delta Connection tickets as well as Delta Dream vacations, and onemile per dollar on all other purchases.  The card also differs from otherfrequent-flyer cards in that there is no expiration date on using the pointsas long as the cardholder travels on a Delta or Delta Connection Flight everythree years.  American Express will issue a gold version of the SkyMilesOptima later this year.The Delta SkyMiles card also rewards cardholders for carrying a balance-0.2SkyMiles for each dollar spent on new purchases.  This could give an AmEx aprofitability edge in a market whose customers are notorious for theirreluctance to revolve balances.The SkyMiles card carries an introductory interest rate of 8.9% for the firstsix months and then converts to the prime rate (currently 8.5%) plus 9.4%.The card carries a $55 annual fee which is waived for all primary AmEx green,gold and platinum card holders.  The annual cap on SkyMiles accumulation is$60,000 in charges.  Bonuses for Delta purchases are exempt from the limit."This card was really developed for people who fly Delta, want to earnfrequent-flyer miles and like the financial flexibility of being able to carrya balance from time to time," says Mary Miller, AmEx's senior vice presidentof partnership sales and relationships.  She says extra SkyMiles are awardedto revolvers not to encourage cardholders to carry a balance but to compensaterevolvers because "they are carrying a heavier financial load" because ofinterest payments.  "We thought we'd give back something," she says.  "Wedon't think it encourages anybody to revolve if they weren't revolvingotherwise."But some observers say most non-revolvers wouldn't be interested in the DeltaSkyMiles card because they can earn points on AmEx's other charge cardsthrough its Membership Rewards program.  "If I already have MembershipRewards, what's the added benefit for convenience users?"  asks Anne MorganMoore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based consultingfirm.However, American Express views the Delta SkyMiles card as a complementaryproduct to its charge cards, Miller adds.  "Our research tells us people liketo segregate their spending, particularly business travelers, our core targetgroup," she says.And though charge card holders who participate in Membership Rewards also canaccumulate frequent-flyer miles on Delta, Miller says the SkyMiles Optimaisn't expected to harm that program.  "They're different value propositions,"she says, noting that Membership Rewards is aimed at cardholders who don'trevolve balances.There are mixed reviews on the SkyMiles Optima, with some observers sayingAmEx missed the opportunity to develop a truly unique frequent-flyer product."I think it's terribly disappointing," Turkel says.  "They waited 10 years tocome out with this product and they come out with something that won't breakthrough the clutter."But others disagree.  "American Express definitely pulled off a coup," saysJames L.  Accomando, president of Fairfield, Conn.-based Accomando ConsultingInc.  He notes that the Delta SkyMiles Optima is "very rich" in benefitscompared to other frequent-flyer cards.  For example, most other programsoffer only one point for every dollar spent and put a three-year-limit forredeeming frequent-flyer miles.In addition, the $55 annual fee is comparable to those on other AmEx productswhile it falls in the middle range of what other issuers charge for theirfrequent-flyer cards, Accomando says.  But the richness of the benefits couldprove to be an Achilles' Heel in the long run, he adds, saying, "a programlike this is very expensive to manage.  The users are transactors-they're notnecessarily people who roll over balances."The Delta SkyMiles card is one more step in American Express' goal of reaching$30 billion in outstandings by the year 2000.The SkyMiles Optima is one of two cobranded offerings from American Express.Last October, AmEx introduced the no-fee Hilton Optima card (CCN, Sept.  15,1995).  Miller says there may be some overlap between the two cards' basessince both target frequent travelers.The SkyMiles Optima card was officially launched Jan.  5 with a television,print and outdoor advertising as well as a direct-mail campaign.  Delta andDelta Connection carriers operate more than 4,800 flights daily to 297 citiesin 48 states and 29 countries around the world.  American Express in lateAugust announced it would launch a cobranded card with Delta, but didn'trelease details of the program until a Jan.  4 press conference.But frequent-flyer card programs are only one area seeing increasedcompetition.  Corporate air card programs-in which a corporation is billedcentrally for all it airline expenses-also are facing some new competition.Through an agreement with GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiaryof GE Capital Services, Air Travel Card will be able provides its seven majorU.S.  airlines that issue the card with the banking, billing and reportingservices needed to offer a comprehensive cobranded card fortravel-and-entertainment expenses, says Charles B.  Fischer, Air Travel Cardmanaging director.  American Airlines-which also offers the AAdvantagefrequent-flyer card issued by Citibank-is the first air carrier to offer thecard.More than 100,000 corporations, including half of the Fortune 500, use the AirTravel Card.  More than 200 airlines accept it.Air Travel Card sought a partnership with GE Capital because of airlines'requests for a multi-purpose card that could serve as a corporate air, T&E andcalling card, Fischer says.Under the program, the participating airline will do central billing for theair charges while GE Capital will handle billing for all non-air expenditures,says Mark Meythaler, American Airlines manager of credit card marketing.Billing services can be customized if corporations prefer to have all chargeson one bill.  The cobranded T&E market is likely to get more crowded beforethe year is out.  A recent Synergistics' report notes that more and moreissuers are looking to frequent-flyer programs as a means of enhancing cardsto compete with the proliferation of value-added cards on the market."I think we're going to see many more cobranded cards," says Randy Petersen,editor and publisher of InsideFlyer.  "The Delta program is only the second ofat least two to three more cobranded card to be launched by the end of 1996."Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996Worsening Credit Quality Casts a Pall Over the New YearAnalysts predicted a decline in consumer credit quality most of last year.Now for a not-so-happy New Year's gift:  Those predictions are coming true.Example:  Moody's Investors Service's most recent index of securities backedby card receivables shows U.S.  consumer credit quality in the third quarterof 1995 slipping, the first quarterly dip in three years.According to Moody's, chargeoffs in the pool of securities it rates rose to4.14% of outstandings in the third quarter from 3.99% in the third quarter of1994.  For September, the chargeoff rate increased to 4.27% of outstandingsfrom 3.83% in September 1994, the sharpest year-over-year increase sinceJanuary 1992.  Moody's tracks $109 billion in securitized outstandings from 74issuers.Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst Edward O.  Bankole blames the booston the recent upturn in consumer bankruptcy filings.  Nonbusiness bankruptcyfilings in the third quarter rose for the second consecutive quarter, to220,945, from 195,308 in the third quarter of 1994, a 13.1% increase,according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts.  Some observerssay personal bankruptcy filings could hit or pass 900,000 when figures for1995 are tallied.  That would be the most since 1992, when there were 900,874filings.Delinquencies in Moody's pool of securitized receivables averaged 4.08% in thethird quarter of 1995, compared with 4.37% a year earlier, Moody's says.  ButBankole says the rate is distorted by the continuing rapid growth in creditcard loans, which reached $299 billion in June 1995, up 28% from June 1994,according to the data from Visa, MasterCard and Discover.The trend is being noticed by other observers.  According to the AmericanBankers Association, total delinquent dollars outstanding rose to 4.21% ofoutstandings in the third quarter, from 3.58% in the second quarter and from2.90% in the third quarter of 1994.Some industry observers blame the increase in delinquencies on the surge inbankruptcies as well as the continued aggressive marketing of credit cardoffers.The number of personal bankruptcy filings for 1995 will near historic levels,Stuart Feldstein, president of Budd Lake, N.J.-based SMR Research Inc..  Thisis troubling to issuers because bankruptcies account for roughly 40% ofchargeoffs.  According to the latest figures from the Administrative Office ofthe U.S.  Courts, there were 832,415 filings between Oct.  1, 1994 and Sept.30, 1995.Some point to increasing consumer debt loads at a time of slow wage growth asanother factor in rising delinquencies.  The amount of revolving credit alonerose 19.1% in the third quarter over the year-earlier period, according toFederal Reserve figures.  Meanwhile, wage growth, and thus the ability to payoff some of that debt, rose only 5.1% during the same period.Intense competition among issuers also has been driving down credit quality asthey scrape to get their cards in the hands of as many consumers as possible.In the push to keep portfolios humming, some issuers are relaxing theirstandards and issuing cards to riskier customers, observers say..Other observers say the continuing decline in credit quality is a correctionfor the rapid growth of card portfolios in the early 1990s.  Chargeoff rates"are seeking their proper levels," says Michael E.  Staten, director of PurdueUniversity's Credit Research Center.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996The Strange Phenomenon Of Overpaying Credit Card BillsThe practice of overpayment of credit card bills came under scrutiny recentlywhen fraudsters allegedly used the tactic to defraud 120 issuers out of about$40 million(CCN, Dec.  15, 1995).  Issuers say the practice is longstandingbut rare, and they say there are legitimate reasons cardholders would makepayments in excess of their credit limits.Overpayment can expose an issuer to fraud.  Because of banking laws, issuersare required to post the checks and credit the funds as soon as they arereceived.  This allows the crooks to take large cash advances and go onspending sprees before the checks are returned as insufficient.But there is a small percentage of cardholders who occasionally will make apayment over their credit limits, issuers say.  This is usually to preventgetting behind on payments or to anticipate purchases that might exceed creditlimits while traveling over extended periods.Industry sources have no figures on how many legitimate customers pay theiraccounts above the credit limit.  "It's very rare," says a spokesperson forJacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T Universal Card Services.But is there really a need for customers to increase their credit limits byoverpaying?  No, says Chris N.  Theoharides, principal of TheoharidesConsulting, Massapequa, N.Y.  Banks have made it easy to get credit lineincreases thanks to toll-free numbers.  And risk scores allow banks to quicklyjudge if the cardholder is worthy of an increase.  Adds Bill Dobbins, vicepresident of fraud operations at Chase Manhattan Bank:  "Why give an issuermoney that's not collecting interest?  You can pay while you're away throughfund transfers or have someone handle your affairs."Issuers interviewed say they will accept an overpayment-but with caution.Cincinnati-based Star Banc Corp.  allows cardholders to overpay and have abalance, says Senior Vice President Collin G.  McKenny."But we watch that because that's one of the tricks of the bad guys," McKennysays.AT&T says it handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis.  "If a cardholderwon't be where their mail is and will be doing some spending, we ask them tolet us know ahead of time," the spokesperson says.One indication that a prepayment is legitimate is that a bill couponaccompanies it, says the AT&T spokesperson.  But depending on how far over thecredit limit the check is, Chase, AT&T and Advanta say they may call thecardholder's bank ahead of time before posting the funds.If a check is received above a credit limit, Key Federal Savings Bank willpost the check but hold some of the money from availability until the bank is"reasonably certain" the check will clear the bank from which it is written,says Robert M.  Bouza, president of operations.  The move is done only incertain cases where the customer is believed to be high-risk and is notagainst banking laws.  "If a check bounces, you've given away the availablebalance-plus," he says.  "You're out of a heck of a lot of money."Chase's Dobbins says the bank will credit the account, but also will call thebank the check is issued from to check the validity of the payment, he says.Overpayment is not always a prelude to fraud, but it should set off warningbells, depending on how far over a customer's credit limit a check is, Dobbinssays.  Fraud experts say a sure warning sign is a check that is mailed with nocoupon in an overnight mail envelope."Someone with a $5,000 credit limit that owes us $1,000 and pays us $1,000isn't unusual," Dobbins says.  "But someone who owes us $1,000, but pays us$10,000 causes a lot of bells to go off," Dobbins says.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996Behind the Growth of Penalties For Rental Car No-ShowsVisa U.S.A., American Express Travel Related Services Co.  and Dean Witter,Discover & Co.  all are now offering guaranteed car-rental reservation andno-show penalties for rental companies during peak periods.  Problem:  Theseappear to be services no one needs.Visa and AmEx rolled out their services in December.  A Discover spokespersonsays the issuer has offered similar services since last May.  But no majorrental companies have signed on to any of the three companies' plans, thoughspokespersons from Alamo, Value and Thrifty car-rental agencies say they areconsidering them.Ironically, Visa and AmEx say the services are in response to requests fromthe car-rental industry trying to combat a chronic no-show problem.  Someindustry estimates peg no-shows at as much as 70% of reservations in somecities during peak periods, such as three-day holiday weekends.AnticipationHowever, executives from Visa and AmEx say they are confident that companieswill climb on board soon.Participation in the programs is voluntary.  Under the services, car-rentalcompanies first must agree to offer guaranteed reservations to customers alongwith penalty fees.  Customers then would be offered the choice of making astandard reservation as they currently do, or guaranteeing a reservation underthe new guidelines.  If a customer accepts the guaranteed reservation, he thenagrees to authorize Visa, AmEx or Discover to charge penalty fees if he failsto show up or call to cancel within a specified time period.  It is the rentalcompany's responsibility to charge the fee.Under Visa's program, cardholders who guarantee their car rentals during peakperiods with a Visa card, are guaranteed a car will be waiting at theirdestination for up to eight hours from their expected arrival time.  In theevent of an overbooking, the rental agency is required to rent a comparablevehicle from another agency and deliver it to the cardholder.  Customers mustcancel eight hours prior to pick-up to avoid a charge for up to a one-dayrental.  In case of a flight cancellation, cardholders have up to one hourprior to the scheduled pick-up time to cancel.American Express offers its customers similar guarantees..  Cardholders willbe assured a car will be held for them for at least 12 hours from theirscheduled arrival time.  If the agency overbooks, the rental agency mustprovide a comparable vehicle from another firm.AmEx cardholders must cancel within 48 hours prior to their scheduled pickuptime to avoid as much as a two-day rental charge.  If the customer's flight iscanceled, the penalty is waived.Discover officials would not discuss their services, except to say a car wouldbe guaranteed for 24 hours and that a customer would be charged up to a24-hour rental fee if he didn't show up without a cancellation.Bad FeelingsBut a major obstacle to car-rental agencies implementing the new services isthat penalties may create ill will with customers.  "If a business travelergets a flight canceled, they have to make a lot more calls than to just therental agencies," says Hertz Corp.  Vice President of Governmental AffairsJoseph N.  Russo.  Rental agencies currently do not impose penalty fees forno-shows who reserve conventional cars.  Hertz is not opposed to penalty feesbut objects to the idea of having such fees mandated by credit card companies,Russo says.  Hertz and Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis impose no-show penaltiesfor so-called special equipment, such as convertibles or four-wheel-drivevehicles that are high in demand.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996A Post-Holiday Lull in Direct-Mail CampaignsMost issuers stayed on the sidelines in the waning days of 1995 and theopening days of 1996.

And in public.  Last month,Diners took a swipe at T&E giant American Express Co.'s revamped MembershipRewards program in ads that ran in major newspapers.The ad headline boasts, "If your rewards program is missing two majorairlines, it's probably still green," and bears a facsimile of an AmEx greencharge card.  Though not naming the carriers, the ad refers to American andUnited airlines, which participate in Diners Club's loyalty mileage program,but not in AmEx's."The renamed American Express rewards program promises the frequent businesstraveler 'a world of choices," the ad reads.  "The truth is, it doesn't evencover the continent."Standing UpDiners executives say the ad is part of a more aggressive marketing campaignthe issuer is launching.  Additionally, they say the new name AmEx chose forits loyalty program last year-Membership Rewards-is a little too close in nameto their Club Rewards program.  And they want everyone to know it.  "When AmExcomes out and copies our name, we have to stand up and be counted," a Dinersspokesperson says.  "We wanted to remind readers that AmEx has an inferiorprogram."Diners Club finished the year with about seven million cardholders and chargevolume around $25 billion.  That pales in comparison to the 37 million AmExcardholders and charge volume of roughly $150 billion.The Best?AmEx executives defend their loyalty program, saying it offers cardholdersmuch more variety and utility.  The program has been honored as the bestinternational program for flexibility and variety by InsideFlyer, a ColoradoSprings, Colo.-based travel magazine.  "We're confident our program is thebest," an AmEx spokesperson says.  "The fact that it is recognized by premiertravel publications speaks for itself."The Diners Club ad and its aggressive stance is unusual, but laudable for theissuer, says Randy Petersen, InsideFlyer's editor and publisher.  "There havebeen some changes in attitude and they are for the better," he says of Diners'new ad campaign.  "I'm a big fan of AmEx, but Diners' comparison is true."While Diners' ad makes a legitimate product distinction, it could backfire,says Richard N.  Kimmel, principal of Kimmel & Co., a Chicago-basedadvertising firm.  The ad makes Diners appear petty , "and being petty doesnot look good," he says."If I had an American Express Card, I might be interested in the airlines thataren't participating, but the ad doesn't tell me," Kimmel says.  "I don'tthink this ad does them a lot of good.

But Diners will not back down from American Expresseven though it has a fraction of AmEx's advertising budget.  "Our pockets arenot as deep as theirs so we have to muster up," the spokesperson says.The chances of AmEx bringing American and United into its fold may be slim.American has a long-standing contractual relationship for the purchase of theairline miles offered through Diners Club cards and the Citi-American Airlinescobranded card.

The program has grown to more than 126,000 cards at thebeginning of 1995, making it the second largest corporate bank card file, froma paltry 4,200 at the end of 1991.  Now Household has taken another step someobservers say will give its program a major boost and make a splash on thetravel-and-entertainment scene:  the issuing of a cobranded corporate cardwith Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the Minneapolis-based travel agency giant.The card, appropriately dubbed The Business Card, is the first corporate cardoffered by a travel agency, and one of the first cobranded corporate travelcards, Household executives say.  Initially, it will be marketed to companieswith commercial travel accounts of $1 million or more.  A version for smallercorporate accounts will be rolled out in mid- to late-1996.Tracking ExpensesThe Business Card will be a general-purpose bank card, available as aMasterCard or Visa.  It will offer a variety of spending limits and travelinsurance packages.  Companies can either use computer modules to compileexpense reports from the card in-house or outsource it to Carlson.  The feefor each card and interest rate will be announced later.As part of the venture, Household and Carlson Wagonlit will produce a jointproprietary management information system (MIS) data base that they claim willoffer companies more detailed information than other corporate cards aboutairlines, hotels and car rentals employees use.  Like traditional expensereports, it will allow companies to track costs as well as identify the mostfrequently used travel vendors, says Ron Muratore, director of planning andcommunications for Household's credit card group.  "It is a management toolthat captures more data and presents businesses with a bigger and betterpicture on how their money is spent," he says.Carlson Wagonlit executives say the new card will offer more information andbetter integration with a cli-ent's expense reporting system than competitors,but would not discuss specifics.  "Our whole plan is smooth integration withother corporate travel systems as well as providing the information that'sneeded to manage the travel expense activity," says Terry L.  Thelemann,Carlson Wagonlit director of marketing product services.  "We don't want ourcustomers to jump through a lot of hoops to get the advantage of the card."But executives from Citicorp Diners Club and American Express Co.  say thereis nothing new about the Household-Carlson venture.  Spokespersons from bothcompanies say they provide detailed, yet easy-to-interpret MIS reports andsoftware allowing companies to receive the reports on-line.Major PlayerSome observers say the new card could swiftly be a major player in the T&Earena.  "Anytime two giants like Household and Carlson join, it will drawattention," says Donald J.  Auriemma, chairman of the Westbury, N.Y.-basedAuriemma Consulting Group.  "They are both leaders in their respectivefields."The fee per card will vary on how the customer wants to structure its expensereports, Muratore says.The program will be launched in the U.S.  and Canada during the first quarter.It subsequently will be expanded to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region laterthis year.Carlson Wagonlit is one of the world's largest travel agencies with annualsales of $12 billion, and 4,000 locations in 125 countries.Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 15, 1996First Bank and Target Aim For A Cobranded Bull's EyeDayton Hudson Corp.'s discount chain Target Stores Inc.  and First Bank SystemInc.  will launch a cobranded card later this month.

Expect scoring models to be used as customer and totalrelationship management tools rather than just as risk assessmentmethods, experts say.       Scoring also will gain acceptance in previously uncharteredwaters, such as the mortgage lending market.       But industry experts tell us you need to be prepared forlegislative and implementational obstacles related to scoring.     Concern over consumer privacy also may prompt more patrolling ofthis technology by regulators.  Creditors and scoring vendors shouldpursue consumer education programs to ease fears over scoring toolsand to ensure that new legislation will not restrict their businesspractices. Evolving Scoring Methods     Creditors can expect a change in business focus in 1996 fromcredit risk management to customer relationship management, accordingto John Coffman of Credit Strategy Management (CSM) of Atlanta.  Forexample, many creditors now  are starting to use data and predictivemodels to manage the entire customer relationship, includingretention, relationship optimization, product design and targeting.     Creditors need to understand that risk management by itself isnot sufficient to ensure optimal profitability, and that themanagement of risk must be integrated with the management of otheraspects of customer behavior, according to Coffman.       Scoring's use is being encouraged by the Washington, D.C.-basedFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac).  Freddie Mac issued afour-page letter last summer supporting scoring practices by lendersfor residential mortgages.      A few months later, Fannie Mae, formerly known as the FederalNational Mortgage Association, put out an eight-page letter thatencouraged lenders to use credit scores in the application process.       The moves by both organizations have prompted new entrants intothe scoring arena -- the technology no longer will be used by onlycredit card companies, but also by mortgage lenders and various otherplayers in that market, said Marty Abrams, director of privacy andconsumer policy at TRW of Orange, Calif.     "It really has changed the way mortgage [lending] has beenconducted, because now we have an endorsement of scoring by a quasi-governmental agency," said Chet Wiermanski, vice president ofacquisition and risk management services for Chicago-based Trans Union.More Work Needed To Educate Consumers, Regulators     Abrams believes increased use of automated processing throughoutthe marketplace -- not just credit models, but response andprofitability models as well -- will create greater interest on howthose models work.  "I think that this is the first in what will be afairly broad discussion into the whole sense of how models work, andhow they affect consumers," he said.     Wiermanski also sees a need for stepped-up consumer education tooffset critics' fears that scores will be used to reject low scorers.     Score developers and users will need to do more than educateconsumers on how they determine scores -- they'll need to educatebusinesses also.  "There is going to be an incredible use ofstatistical modeling of data to determine who it makes sense to dobusiness with, and who it doesn't.  And that is going to create a lotof controversy," Abrams said.     If the industry isn't proactive in educating consumers,regulators may force it to be with new rules or legislation.       The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, wasconsidering last year whether to require creditors and bureaus todisclose risk scores as part of a consumer's credit report file. After much industry feedback, the FTC decidedagainst mandating a score disclosure.  "That, to me, was a keydecision, considering the complexity of risk scores and proprietaryscore cards on the part of credit marketers and credit grantors,"Abrams said.Consumer Education Issues    The decision may create some key consumer education dilemmas inthe coming year.  "We still have to find a way to help consumersunderstand how they can better prepare themselves to be good creditconsumers," Abrams said. In addition, creditors and scoring vendorslikely will struggle with regulators' concern over "disparatetreatment" and its relation to scoring, said Fran Lyons, principal orScoring Solutions Inc. in Atlanta.      Regulators fear that consumers in protected categories will beturned down for mortgage loans because they are scored based on theircredit history, causing the disparate treatment of a protected group.Total Relationship Management    The industry will have to educate regulators that scores do notresult in disparate treatment.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggeststhat automated decision-making is much fairer to consumers thanjudgmental decision-making, Abrams said.      Coffman thinks the industry as a whole will continue to move inthe direction of total relationship management:  "It has caught onquite quickly."      He cited recent articles on AT&T Universal Card as an example ofthis trend.  "You're seeing more and more companies recognizing thatthey need to integrate the management of these two functions:  riskmanagement and customer management [see related story, p. 8]," Coffmansaid.Success Strategies    One key to success in the credit management arena will be thecreation of a comprehensive and easily accessed customer database. Many creditors already have begun creating customer databases for thispurpose, and the trend will continue, Coffman said.      Using a comprehensive customer database, along with modelingtools, will allow the creditor to manage all customer relationships.      The database might include current and historical financial dataas well as transaction data.  It also should include external dataabout customers, such as credit history and other demographic orlifestyle data.

Scoring 101     More and more creditors and scoring vendors will be forced toeducate consumers as to the ABC's of scoring, experts tell us.       But what should you focus on when developing a consumer educationprogram?  TRW instructs its representatives to focus on five "fairinformation values" when interacting with consumers:   *  partnership between TRW and its customers;   *  fairness;   *  balance;    *  education; and   *  dialogue. Advances in Scoring     Consider these latest scoring and credit management tools fromindustry vendors:*  TRW and Fair, Isaac are working together to offer small businesslenders a way to download and score TRW business credit reports withFair, Isaac's Small Business Scoring Service (SBSS).  SBSS, acombination of software and pooled-data scorecards for evaluatingsmall business credit applications, provides an automated interface toTRW Business Information Services' database of business creditreports.     (Fair, Isaac, 800/999-2955; TRW, 800/854-7201.) *  Equifax offers RE-APPEAR, an automated notification deliveryservice for the collections industry.  Users of the service selectcriteria so that credit files of consumers who have collectionspending with the user and have disappeared or "skipped" are flagged. When new or different address or inquiry activity is posted to thefile, RE-APPEAR automatically notifies the customer of the name,address and phone number of the credit grantor who queried the fileand who can then provide updated information on the consumer. (Equifax, 800/879-1025.) *  Trans Union's Revenue Projection Model (RPM), a two-year modeltypically used to predict likely revenue to be generated fromprescreened solicitation prospects, now can be used to make inactiveaccounts, low-balance revolving accounts and seasonal accounts moreprofitable, according to Trans Union officials.  Research conducted byFair, Isaac, the developer of the model, shows that RPM also can beused to rank order existing customers based on likely revenue generation in the 12 months following scoring.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996TIPS FOR MANAGING YOUR NEXT BANKRUPTCY COLLECTION AUDIT    A careful audit of your outside bankruptcy collection agent canhelp improve bankruptcy accounts management and increase profits.  Toaide in this endeavor, CRMR elicited advice from one independentconsultant, Raymond Bell Jr. of Abington, Pa.     Bell spent many years managing a bankruptcy department for amajor credit card company and has audited both collection andbankruptcy accounts.  He directed the handling of consumer bankruptcycases at a national law firm and now is a full-time, independentconsultant.     If you do nothing else when auditing your outside bankruptcycollection agency, your time will be well-spent reviewing the finaltrustee accounting reports to ensure that your claims have been paid,Bell said.     "The final trustee accounting report is the most important audittool in ensuring that you have received correct disbursements from thebankruptcy estate," he explained.     This report will indicate whether accounts have been transferredto a different bankruptcy type, if payments were recorded improperly,or if the trustee made a mistake, he added.     Require your agent to provide a complete account listings forChapter 7, 11 and 13 cases that are active, with data fields for thefollowing:*  Account assignment date;*  Date account information was placed in the agent's system;*  Date the request for notice was sent;*  Date the proof of claim was sent;*  Date the proof of claim was received by the court of the trustee;*  Date of court adversary proceeding;  *  Chapter 13 planned percent payback;*  Claim balance filed with the court;*  Last payment date, payment amount and accumulative amount of       total payment received.     You should review the rationale used to generate the reports, andask that the agent retain the account listing in an extract computeruntil your audit is completed.  This will allow you to subsortinformation as needed quickly and your requests will not slow down theagent's system during business hours, Bell said.     Bell had other suggestions to follow during an audit:*   Establish a pattern of follow-up frequency and criteria for cases.For xample, how many missed payments should trigger a follow-up callor isit for Chapter 13 cases of a certain amount of credit?*   Internally select segments of cases from each type of bankruptcyfor random spot checking.*   Using at least three remittance reports within a 12-month period,test for payments on at least 50 percent of the accounts.*   Review your contract provisions and take a copy with you forreference during your audit.*   Review your prior audit commentary and the agents response.  Takecopies to the audit with you for reference purposes.On-site Review    Bell said the first place he visits during an on-site review isthe lunch- and meeting-room bulletin boards.  These tell a lot abouthow the agency communicates and whether it is up-to-date on issues, headded.    While at the agency, perform audit functions without interruptionand do not leave notes unattended.  If you need to ask questions,which can intimidate agency staff, make a concise list and be sure amanager is present at this stage in the review, Bell advised.     While on-site Bell suggests reviewing the following:*   Licenses.  Are they current and do they apply to state provisionsgoverning an agency?  In cases of an attorney, has this person passedthe bar in the state in which he/she is working?  Additionally, theattorney must have renewed the license in each state of practice andmust meet the state's continuing legal education requirements.*   Written procedures.  The policy guidelines that pertain to youraccount should be up to date.*   Staffing.  Additions, deletions or administrative promotions asthey relate to relate to your account should be explained thoroughly.*   Training.  In-house training, organizational structure andfrequency of internal case reviews by management should be adequate.Post Review    After the on-site review, be sure to provide the client with anoverview highlighting the negative and positive aspects of your reportbefore you leave.  This discussion should be private, Bell said.      Provide the agency with your audit summary.  This ensures thereis agreement to proceed with any corrective action and theimplementation and completion time of desired action.  "The agencyshould be required to respond, in writing, by a pre-agreed time," Bellsaid.      Common problems that may affect agency turnaround includeunorganized agency files, unreceived documents and payments, Belladded.    To keep bankruptcy proceedings running smoothly, Bell suggestedseveral in-house tweaks.  For example, establish tracking abilitiesfor electronic and paper referrals to the agency and require the agentacknowledge referrals.  Additionally, time and date stamp allbankruptcy correspondence before sending it to the agency.  This willaid in auditing the agency's procedures, he said.    Also, establish computer models to predict cash flow andprojected return on Chapter 13 cases that can be compared to actualin-coming, Bell said.    Internally track agent support requests listing the nature antype of request every quarter.  This will help you be more proactivewith this information in the future, Bell said.    Lastly, implement a training program for your bankruptcy andaudit staffs to ensure future audits run smoothly, Bell said. (Raymond P. Bell, private consultant, 800/735-0481.)

Prospective condominium buyers in a 700-unit development in ParkPlace, N.J., now can access NatWest loan officers viavideoconferencing directly from the model home.  However, consumersmust finish the paperwork at the branch.    "Typically 25 percent [of people inquiring about mortgages] willfill out the application.  We are running over 50 percent when they gofill out the application at the model home," said Andrew Demeo,director of interactive marketing for NatWest.    Videoconferencing allows consumers to see NatWest loanrepresentatives and view information on the television screen whiletalking on the phone.    "It is a remote delivery and they are not pressured by being inthe room with an individual," said Demeo.  "They feel in total controland that seems to be important to the consumers.  It gets to ourculture as Americans.  When a salesperson comes and talks to us inperson, we let them finish their sales pitch.  However, thesocialization of how we deal with telemarketers is different.  Mostpeople tend not to stay on the line.  If you can offer that type ofcontrol to the customer, yet offer as much personal contact as a faceto face [conversation] and make it fun, it works."How it Works    Once consumers have toured the model home, they can enter theliving room, turn on a television set there and place a callsimultaneously to a NatWest representative.  The consumer can see astill graphic of the representative in the top one-fifth of the screenon a proprietary pay-per-view channel.    The remaining four-fifths of the tv screen is reserved for movinggraphics.  For example, customers may want to see in graphic form howpayments for a 15-year adjustable mortgage compare to a 15-year fixedmortgage.  The NatWest representative can input the necessaryinformation on the screen and a graphical presentation will appear atthe model home.    NatWest is testing full-motion video for the service and planssoon to offer standard personal computer (PC)-to-PC modemcommunication.  The bank also is preparing a videoconferencing serviceover the Internet.    Demeo would not reveal the cost of the product, but said it "is alot less than you think."  He explained that is a matter of deployinga pc and television set in a cabinet.      Demeo advises lenders to think of videoconferencing as anopportunity help consumers find products which are appropriate fortheir specific needs.  "The key element is presenting conciseinformation as well as [having the consumers] feel like they aremeeting somebody," Demeo said.    After the homebuyers decide which loans are right for them, theNatWest representatives will transmit a closing bill and title righton the tv screen.  In addition, NatWest can estimate the closing andtax costs for the consumers.  The application cannot be completed on-line.  However, consumers are taken line-by-line down the applicationso that they will have all the necessary information when they visit aNatWest branch to complete the application.    NatWest launched the service in the first quarter of 1995 afterDemeo's marketing staff worked closely with officials at the QVC homeshopping channel to learn how to concisely present complicatedinformation via video.    For example, QVC warned Demeo that customers need to beentertained more in a videoconferencing presentation as they are lessapt to just sit and listen when they can simply press an off button.

Creditors should establish written policies on handlingdelinquent payments from certain consumer segments, credit consultantstell CRMR.  This is especially true for creditors that servicegovernment employees, in light of the recent lengthy federalgovernment shutdown which left many employees without paychecks forweeks. Consider these strategies, offered by some industryconsultants, when developing a government employee policy:  *  Review on a case-by-case basis. Examine each case for unusualcircumstances before penalizing an account or initiating collectionefforts.    *  Instruct customers to contact you. Consumers may assume you areaware of their situation.  Statements and bills should adviseconsumers to contact a credit department and explain any paymentdifficulties.   *  Consider special programs. Lenders can establish specialunsecured loan programs with no- or low interest rates for federalworkers affected by a government shutdown.  These programs may not be very lucrative, however, they will inspire long-term customerloyalty, experts say.

Back to Headline List CopyrightCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996RISK MANAGERS NEEDED, REGARDLESS OF LAYOFFS    You could fare better in the churning financial servicesmarketplace by becoming skilled in implementing leading-edge credittechnologies.  That's the lesson evident in the business' latest majordownsizing, AT&T Corp.'s plan to lay off 40,000 employees as part ofits efforts to reorganize by 1997.    More than 200 of the people already accepting AT&T's voluntaryseverance    packages work in the Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&TUniversal Card division, a spokesperson confirmed.  He would not sayhow many are from the risk management department nor give details onthe severance packages offered.    But CRMR has learned that risk management executives are amongthe total.  Several of them already have been approached by other issuers, says one credit executive who asked not to be named.  High Demand    These executives are in such high demand because of their abilityto implement leading-edge technologies, such as statistical analysis,behavior scoring and neural networks, the source said.     A recent survey by Allard Associates of San Francisco, anexecutive recruiter in the credit card and banking industries,indicated that 75 percent of issuers surveyed would be adding staff in1996.  Respondents said many of these people would be in the riskmanagement area.  These issuers also reported the shortage ofqualified executives is so acute that card companies are prepared tosponsor non-U.S. citizens for the jobs.

Tim Pryor, director of NAFCU's regulatory compliance office, toldCredit Union Accountant the IRS' rule is significant for credit unionsbecause it eases the paperwork burden in two areas: when bankruptcies arefiled and when a debt is discharged by state law.        The amount of debt written off isn't the most important aspect, thedebt loss will be the same despite this rule, Pryor said. The rule is mostsignificant because it reduces the amount the paperwork, he said.        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, requirefinancial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C informationreturns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders becausethey say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven inexcess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.        Lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating theneed to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS forseveral years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need toforgive debt.        Pryor said the final rule is "a very big issue for credit unionsbecause the previous rule would have required a credit union to file a 1099when a debtor went bankrupt." And since bankruptcies are on the rise andexpected to increase, credit unions would have been inundated withpaperwork. (See related story page 4).        According to Wayne Winegarden, a NAFCU staff economist, "a rise inbankruptcies since December 1994 is evident in the call report data, andother preliminary data supports the idea that the December 1995bankruptcies will increase even further."        The previous rule, Pryor said, would also have required a creditunion to file a 1099 whenever a debt was discharge by state law--somethinghe said is next to impossible for a credit union to assess. He said it'sdifficult for a credit union to figure out the statute of limitations oneach debt and the actual date the debt was discharged. "Operation of statelaw only applies when it is raised as a defense," he said.        The final regulation says that disclosure to the IRS of debtforgiveness will be required only when one of the following "identifiableevents" occur:         The failure of the borrower to make any payments on a debt forthree years with no significant collection activity by the financialinstitution.         A contractual modification or discharge between the financialinstitution and the borrower.         Discharges in bankruptcy of business loans, but not for consumerloans.         The successful assertion in court by the borrower of the statuteof limitations as a bar to collection.         The cancellation of a debt by receivership, foreclosure, orprobate proceedings.         The expiration of the statutory period for commencing a proceedingon a judgment.        Credit unions must comply with these requirements for dischargesoccurring on or after Dec. 22, 1996.        It's important for credit unions to note, however, that the IRS hasprovided several exceptions to the list of "identifiable events," saidCornelia Schneider, the National Association of Federal Credit Union'sassociate director of taxation and accounting.        "Specifically, discharges in bankruptcy are not reportable unlessthe credit union knows that the member incurred the indebtedness forbusiness or investment purposes," Schneider said. "A credit union will nothave to report a discharge of indebtedness upon the expiration of thestatute of limitations if a member's affirmative defense is upheld in afinancial judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding and the period forappealing has expired. In addition, the final regulations do not requireinterest to be included in the reporting of amounts discharged."Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996SAR, CTR EXEMPTION LIST MIGHT EMERGE MARCH 1The new Suspicious Activity Report form, reported by sources lastweek to be due out by Feb. 1, will most likely come out March 1 at theearliest, and might contain a threshold for money laundering, a Treasuryofficial told Credit Union Accountant.        Banks will begin using the forms when the final regulation becomeseffective.        The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also hopes torelease a preliminary Currency Transaction Reporting exemption process inconjunction with the SAR.        As proposed, the SAR had no threshold for suspicious activitiesinvolving money laundering. As a final rule, a FinCEN source said on Jan.17 that, in response to comments received from the industry, Treasury mayinclude an as-yet unspecified threshold for money laundering. This is theonly threshold the regulators say will possibly change from what has beenpreviously proposed.        The SAR, to be administered by FinCEN and federal regulators, isproposed to be used to report suspicious transactions of bank fraud,insider abuse, etc. involving a specific customer if $5,000 or more isinvolved. If no particular individual can be identified, the threshold willincrease to $25,000.        The form replaces the old Criminal Referral Form and a box on theCurrency Transaction Report. The form will be required to be filed withFinCEN only rather than with a number of agencies.        "It is unlikely that the new SAR will be out by Feb. 1," said aFinCEN official. "Each of the agencies has to finalize its own regulation,the database which accepts the suspicious transactions has to be up andrunning, and the form has to be ready. FinCEN's reg is in the clearanceprocess, as well as are the other agencies' regs, I believe. The formitself is close to being final and the database is operational.        "The instructions on the form, telling you when and what to fileare subject to change, since the instructions are driven by the reg itself,which has still to be issued as final."        A preliminary exemption list for Currency Transaction Reporting isalso expected to be released in conjunction with the SAR release, said anagency official.        "There is a two phase approach," said the source. "The easy stuffwill be a (not-specified-yet) existing list--something like the stockexchange list that people can refer to by opening up a newspaper and listsbusinesses that are already exemptible under current regulation. Phase two,the rest of the exemptions of local places, we are still working out. Myguess is that the second list will come as a proposed rulemaking, up forcomment."        "Law enforcement, regulators and the industry all agree that thereare too many CTRs, but we need to finalize the process, which will reduceburden, without impeding law enforcement." --Lisa TroshinskyBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996EXAMINERS GET LIBERTY IN CUSO LIMITSNCUA has said that for purposes of CUSO loan and investmentlimitations, an examiner can decide on a case-by-case basis to value a CUSOeither at original cash investment or by an equity method of accounting.        The regulator said even though these limitations are statutorilyderived, it gives its examiners leeway because statutory and regulatoryhistory provide no clear answers.        Michael L. Miller, assistant vice president for compliance atIndiana FCU, Indianapolis, wrote to NCUA Sept. 11 and asked severalquestions concerning the loan and investment limitations for CUSOs inRegion IV.        Miller first asked if the 1% investment limit in a CUSO is based onthe original cash investment or the equity method. He explained that inJanuary 1994, Indiana FCU invested $100,000 in Indiana Members FinancialServices Inc., a wholly owned CUSO that is the sole owner of three otherCUSOs--a mortgage company, a vehicle leasing company and a collectioncompany. During the first year, Miller said, IMFS lost $36,000. He asked ifIFCU's CUSO should use the original investment of $100,000 or the equitymethod balance of $64,000 to calculate the investment for the 1% limit.        In legal opinion letter No. 95-0930, dated Dec. 13, RichardSchulman, NCUA's associate general counsel, told Miller that IFCU shoulduse the aggregate cash outlay figure of the original investment of $100,000to calculate the CUSO investment limitation. Schulman noted, however, thatfor measuring a credit union's investment to a CUSO in financialstatements, GAAP should be followed. GAAP uses a cost method, equity methodor consolidated financial statements as measurements.        Miller also asked if IFCU's original cash investment in the IMFSsubsidiary companies be included in the calculation or should it use theequity method's balance.        Schulman replied that IFCU's original cash investment, being theaggregate cash outlay, in the other CUSO's should also be included in thecalculation. He said this is what is meant by "aggregate" limitation.        Miller then inquired whether IFCU's lines of credit to the mortgageCUSO and leasing CUSO were considered a loan to a CUSO for the 1% limitsince these organizations are not directly owned by the credit union. Heexplained that when IFCU owned the second tier CUSO directly, lines ofcredit to the mortgage CUSO and leasing CUSO were established. The lines ofcredit are to fund loans and leases until the underlying loan or leaseinstrument is sold back to IFCU or another investor. --Melanie WaddellBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996BRIEFSFed To Issue StudyOn Check Fraud        The Federal Reserve Board has asked financial institutions tocomment on a proposed one-time check fraud survey that will help it fulfillthe congressional mandate to report on the advisability of modifying theExpedited Funds Availability Act.        The changes to the EFAA, which is implemented through RegulationCC, would extend the maximum permissible hold period for local checks as away to decrease losses related to check fraud.        Comments are due to the Fed by Feb. 20. Data collected from thesurvey will cover the period Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 1995.        Congress has also directed the Fed to study:         Whether a pattern of significant increases in losses related tocheck fraud at depository institutions attributable to the provisions ofthe EFAA exists.         Whether an extension by one day of the period between the depositof a local check and the availability of funds for withdrawal would beeffective in reducing the volume of losses related to check fraud.         Whether to make recommendations for legislative actions.        The survey will gather information about the relationship of allfunds availability schedules mandated in the EFAA to check-fraud losses aswell as specific information about the types of check fraud and the causesof check fraud losses at depository institutions.

A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurancecompany--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into theinsurance business.        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British WestIndies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International StandardsGroup Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory auditsfor more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into theinsurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in arecent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit unionservices.        A source within the industry told Credit Union Accountant that ISGis attempting to expand into insurance because it's not making any moneyfrom supervisory committee audits.        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996COURT: MEMBERS CAN'T SHIRK STUDENT LOAN DEBTSAn important legal ruling handed down in Massachusetts could calmfears of credit union CFOs and strengthen the long arm of debt collection.        In the case, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said CU memberscan't use bankruptcy as a method to avoid paying off student loans. TheDecember ruling also is significant because, for the first time, a courtsaid that federal credit unions are "government units" for purposes ofhaving educational loans nondischargeable.        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcyproceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofitorganization.        The ruling stemmed from a suit brought by T.I. Federal Credit Unionin Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case wentbefore the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definitionof both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for theseloans.        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylawsprovided that shareholders get a dividend," Koban said. He won this pointin bankruptcy court.        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its caseto U.S. district court, which ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the"government unit" status, so the case was appealed. The 1st Circuit saidfederal credit unions are, in fact, government units, so it didn't see theneed to address whether it was also a nonprofit.        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning ofthis section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpaymentsare nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifyingas a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor'sloans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters ofeither provision," the 1st Circuit said.        Koban, reached by Credit Union Accountant, asked rhetoricallywhether this ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bankis a "government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested thelaw should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period.This ruling is counter intuitive."        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn'taddress the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress isthe only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, notthe courts.        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.        According to the brief of the case, T.I. federal credit unionadvanced loans as part of its special educational loan program. Thisprogram differs from standard loan programs in that it allows for lowerinterest rates, gives borrowers longer repayment periods and allows loansto be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted underpersonal loan programs. The program also enables borrowers tosimultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balanceson previous loans.        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times forassistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into asingle promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes$32,618.        His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but hislawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely. --Ken ReedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996CREDIT UNIONS AND STUDENT LOANS, A YEAR-END BREAKDOWNOne-third of all credit unions that give student loans offer onlyGuaranteed Student Loans (FFELs), one-third offer only other types ofstudent loans and a third offer both, year-end 1994 CUNA data show.        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage ofcredit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a credit union that lendsFFELs, and 37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lendsother types of student loans, CUNA said.        FFELs are generally preferred because a larger portion of the riskis shared with the government.        A study by the National Association of Federal Credit Unions foundthat, of the 336 member CUs responding to its survey, the average creditunion offering student loans has $240 million in assets while the averagecredit union not offering such loans has $103 million in assets.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996FOCUS ON FASBAcSEC To ExploreBalance Sheet        The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a newproject to determine when various types of securities transactions shouldbe recorded on the balance sheet.        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, inaccordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where thecounterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingenttransactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred toas "to-be-announced" trades.        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types oftransactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date oron the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice asto when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions amongusers of the instruments.FASB Extracts LeasesFrom Hedging Project        The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly thescope of the hedging and derivatives project Dec. 21 when it decided thatleases would not be included.        The project, in its current form, provides the option of markingderivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While otherfinancial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to accountfor leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that itwould expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, aFASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with theissues that most concern hedging and derivatives."        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of theproject, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not toinclude leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to thedifficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the leasefrom the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedgingproject, he said.        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack ofvaluation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicatedissues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in thederivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on thecapitalization or valuation of all leases.        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change inthe value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and thatthe interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earningson a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain ona purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent thatexpense has been recognized for the option premium paid.Comprehensive IncomeTakes Tiny Step Forward        The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how toreport accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments andcumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should bereported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.        The decision represents at least another minor step forward inFASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late falland seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in theincome statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when ittentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive incomeshould be reported in one or more statements of income for financialperformance.        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are byexamining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, ofwhich only the latter is currently included in net income. The matterbecomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported ascumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-periodadjustments in others.        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to developexamples illustrating the three different approaches for reportingaccounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first oneis the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensiveincome strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive incomebroadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excludingaccounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report bothcomprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustmentsbeing displayed as the difference between the two.        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that anyof these three approaches would be workable if they were appliedconsistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quoapproach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistentwith either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-inclusive concept.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CREDIT UNION ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996PRIORITY PROJECTSThese are the top current and potential issues that should be considered bythe Financial Accounting Standards Board based on the 1995 annual agendasurvey.

Looking to further spur transaction volume, which hasincreased by more than 77% over the last two years, networks are expandingtheir direct debit marketing budgets while incorporating non-traditionalvehicles to expand their geographic reach.More regional networks are offering incentives and developing educationprograms to generate activity, while minimizing use of the more expensivetelevision, radio and newspaper advertising.  "The cost for televisionadvertising is way over our budget for effectively communicating in aseven-state region," says Cindy Ballard, senior vice president ofHouston-based Pulse, the sixth-largest network.  "Instead, we're working withbanks to help them market to their merchant customers in all areas."Pulse is focusing on the acquirer side by holding retailer workshops andmaking joint sales calls with independent sales organizations to sign newmerchants to accept on-line cards.  The network switched strategies followinga 1994 TV campaign in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which increased networkawareness but did not change consumer usage habits.Also moving away from media advertising is Chicago-based Cash Station, the10th-largest POS network, which aired television commercials after launchingdirect debit in 1992, but now is working more closely with merchants andmembers to spur activity.Cash Station expects to expand an incentive program it tested at an IllinoisKmart Superstore last year, in which coupons were distributed to consumers fordiscounts when the Cash Station card was used for purchases.  Clerks also weregiven prizes if they prompted customers to pay with the Cash Station card."Television is very effective when a new product is introduced, but awarenessof POS debit in our area already is high," says Cathy Alexander, Cash Stationsenior vice president.  "But there still is an absence of knowledge on thepart of members and merchants."Indeed, even with network POS transaction volumes soaring, hundreds ofthousands of retailers still do not accept debit cards for payment.  Manymerchants that acquire debit transactions, meanwhile, do not adequately marketthe products to customers.  Thus, networks are devising methods to spurretailers to promote debit.Louisiana-based GulfNet, the 14th-largest network, has devoted more than halfof its 1996 marketing budget to POS, up 10% from last year, with most of thefunds being used to expand merchant debit acceptance.  The network wants toexpand distribution of incentive coupons at the point of sale to consumers whopaid for purchases with a check or credit card.  The coupons give cardholders$2 off their next purchase with a GulfNet card.  Schwegmann Giant Supermarketsran the promotion for a month last year and $15,000 worth of coupons werecashed in, says Del Tonguette, GulfNet president."Offering incentives is key because studies show that if you can get people touse the card twice you, might create habitual users," says Ronald Rawson,president of San Francisco-based R.  C.  Rawson Co., a consulting firmspecializing in EFT awareness, education and usage.  GulfNet also will focuson expanding network signage at the point of sale and assisting independentsales organizations in signing retailers.  All but four of GulfNet's 2,000retailers were recruited by ISOs.But while many networks have devised strategies for marketing POS at the locallevel, some still expect to use the media to reach specific markets.Virginia-based Most, the fifth-largest network, which attributes much of its60% increase in POS volume last year to radio and billboard advertisements,will again use the vehicles to emphasize the different applications tied tothe Most card.  "Television is too costly," says Mary Kilby, Most senior vicepresident.  "We believe in supporting a brand across a broad region, but wecan only support TV in one or two markets."Multiple MethodsMost also expects to work with a product manufacturer in distributing savingscoupons to consumers if they buy a specific product with the Most card.  Lastyear more than 5 million coupons were distributed between September andDecember for savings on Haagan Daz ice cream.  The network, which advertisedin a minor league baseball park last year, also is considering expanding itssports marketing activities.  "We have 94% total awareness and 80% POSawareness, but we still have to look at increasing POS usage, which is only40%," Kilby says.Yet, while many networks have diminished their media advertising, some stillhave not abandoned the airways as a prime marketing source.  Florida-basedHonor, the fourth-largest network, will advertise from August to December onsuch cable stations as Cable News Network, ESPN, A&E, TNT, USA and The WeatherChannel.  Honor is concentrating on cable because it is less costly thannetwork television and many viewers have the same demographics as active EFTusers, such as being upwardly mobile and early adopters of new technology.The network will use 85% of its marketing budget for POS this year, up from50% in 1995.  Honor's activities are being financed by the network's 6-centacquirer-paid POS interchange fee.  While 3 cents of the fee is passed on tocard issuers, the network maintains 3 cents for POS promotions.  "POS has thegreatest potential for growth so we promote it more than ATMs," says ElizabethStorm, Honor director of marketing.Also using television in its POS marketing mix is Michigan-based Magic Line,the 7th-largest network.  Magic Line will run POS TV commercials this springand fall in Michigan and Indiana.  The network also will hold seminars toeducate merchants on direct debit, and is considering reinstating an incentiveprogram that ran for eight weeks last year in which merchant acquirersreceived cash awards for each new POS device they deployed.  Of Magic Line's$1.1 million marketing budget, $400,000 will be spent on POS in 1996.Some networks, meanwhile, are distributing their marketing dollars inaccordance with the volume generated by the different applications.  SanDiego-based Star System, the largest regional network, will use 30% of itsadvertising budget for POS.  Star switched more than 25 million ATMtransactions in December and over 12 million POS transactions.Star will promote POS on cable television and radio this year, and expand itsmarketing in Oregon and Washington.  The majority of Star's marketing willfocus on the network itself and not a specific application.Another major player incorporating radio advertising is New Jersey-based NYCE,the second-largest network, which plans to run two 60-second spots for aneight week period across its entire Northeast region.  NYCE also is devising aco-op program with merchants which could include electronic coupons or aloyalty program.NYCE expanded its market when it merged with Connecticut-based Yankee 24 in1994 "Radio reaches our target audience, which is typically younger people onthe move," says Scott Strug, NYCE director of marketing.Other major networks, such as Washington-based The Exchange, Delaware-basedMAC and Massachusetts-based X-Press 24 still are finalizing their marketingplans.  LBack to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996AT&T Disconnects Itself From The Busy Smart Card LinesWhile foreign and domestic vendors are flooding the U.S.  smart card market toposition for an expected chip card boom, a major player is departing.  DebitCard News has learned that AT&T Corp.  is selling its smart card businessunit, which develops and markets contactless card systems.AT&T is reportedly looking for a buyer because the unit did not fit into thecompany's recent reorganization and was not profitable, sources say.  AT&Treportedly will finish its existing smart card contracts, but will not take onnew customers.  An AT&T spokesperson would not confirm the planned sale.The move to sell the smart card unit follows AT&T's 1995 announcement that theglobal telecommunications and technology company is streamlining its operationfor greater efficiencies.  AT&T is creating three distinct companies for longdistance services, technology and systems, and computer hardwaremanufacturing.  The AT&T Smart Cards business unit was created in 1982.Companies using AT&T contactless smart cards include Delta Airlines, which hasa ticketless boarding program for its Northeast shuttle, and New York-basedChemical Bank, which is running an in-house contactless card pilot with 300employees.  Both projects are expected to continue.  Drew University inMadison, N.J., suspended an AT&T contactless card pilot last year, but isconsidering reinstating it.While most payments industry players are gravitating to a contact card systemin which a smart card is swiped through a card reader, AT&T is marketingcontactless smart cards that must be passed in front of, or near, a cardreader.  While contactless cards are best suited for applications wheretransaction speed is crucial, such as persons going through turnstiles in atrain station, the systems are more expensive to implement.  Contactless cardsand terminals are estimated to cost more than twice that of contact cards.Cards range from $10 to $20, and terminals from $200 to $1,000.Change Of PlansAT&T's reported plan to sell its smart card unit follows its announcement lastspring that it would license its contactless technology in hopes of making itthe world's standard for cashless wallets and electronic commerce.  At thattime, AT&T said it was negotiating with three companies in the U.S.  andabroad.  However, Italy-based Olivetti Co.  reportedly was the only company tolicense AT&T's technology, which it used to pilot contactless cards on theAutostrada, Italy's main freeway."When AT&T decided to license its technology to other companies, that was asignal that they were looking for the way out," says an industry observerfamiliar with AT&T.Indeed, a lack of payments industry interest in contactless technology couldhave led to AT&T's decision to sell its operation.  Most observers say AT&T'ssystem was too expensive for widespread use in supporting stored-value cardprograms, which are typically positioned to replace low-value cashtransactions.In addition, more efficient contactless systems already are being marketed.For instance, while AT&T's design requires cards to be brought within inchesof a reader, radio frequency-based contactless systems only require cards tocome within a few feet of a reader.  Analysts believe AT&T's design is toosimilar to swipe technology.  "Contactless smart card technology is great, butAT&T never got any real applicable products off the ground," says JeromeSvigals, a Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.A Brighter FutureBut while AT&T had problems expanding its smart card business, analysts saythere still is a future for contactless cards.  Indeed, some players that haveencountered difficulties with contactless cards still are planning to utilizethe technology.  Drew University discontinued an AT&T contactless campus cardprogram that was being used by about 2,500 students and faculty after a yearbecause the cards were too weak to support high usage.  However, Drew isconsidering reinstating the technology with more resilient cards.Drew's cards were used for identification, stored value and to pay for meals,but problems stemmed from cardholders' mistreatment of the plastic.  "Thetechnology worked fine, but students shove their cards in their book bags andjeans pockets and if it doesn't work, then a student doesn't get a meal," saysHarry Scarpa, Drew University director of purchasing.  Drew is currently usinga mag-stripe campus card.Still, Drew was impressed with the potential for supporting multiple functionson the AT&T contactless card.  Drew's chip cards 3 kilobytes of memory,compared to the one kilobyte of memory in most contact cards.In addition to cost and reliability issues, contactless card acceptance alsois hindered by a smart card industry that still is evolving.  New applicationsthat generate additional fee revenue are needed to support a more expensivecard product,such as contactless cards, says Timothy McNaughton, manager ofpilots and implementation at Royal Bank of Canada.  Royal Bank will issuecontact smart cards for the Mondex electronic purse program that will belaunched in Canada later this year.But while the payments industry is not ready to embrace contactless cards, thetechnology is still expected to find a niche in the transportation sector.The San Diego-based Cubic Automatic Revenue Collection Group, which designsand implements contactless systems, reports that contactless cards permit morethan 72 persons to move through turnstiles in two minutes, compared to about60 with contact cards.Indeed, a number of metropolitan transit authorities, including those in NewYork and San Francisco, are reportedly considering implementing contactlesssystems.  Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority already istesting contactless smart cards for rail, bus and parking services.  More than1,000 employees are involved in the one-year pilot.  The Washington's transitauthority also is negotiating with North Carolina-based First Union for thecards to be used in an open contact environment (Debit Card News, 11/30/95).Easier AccessMeanwhile, enhancements to contact smart card systems are expected to make iteasier for card issuers to upgrade their products for contactless smart cardapplications.  One method under study would be to place card jackets withcontactless capability over contact cards."One reason why the industry decided on contact cards was because it is mucheasier to make a contact card contactless than vice versa," says David Lott,senior associate at Dove Associates, an Atlanta-based payments consultingfirm.And Visa and MasterCard, which are supporting contact smart card programs, saymarket demand could result in hybrid products.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Visa Leads The Canadian Prepaid PushWhen the SmartCash stored-value venture was announced last summer, a majorpayments participant was conspicuously absent from its proposed ownershiplist:  Visa International.  But while SmartCash and its participants, such asMasterCard International, Electronic Payment Services and Chemical Bank, stillare cementing the business plans for their nationwide stored-value business,Visa has taken a lead role in expanding smart card activity in North America.The California-based bank card association recently signed four Canadianinstitutions to pilot its Visa Cash stored-value product.  And with itssponsorship of a smart card program that will be launched in conjunction withthe 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Visa has become the instrumental playerin generating prepaid card activity in the region.But the North American programs are just one piece of Visa's worldwide smartcard initiative.  Visa already is piloting Visa Cash in Australia, and plansto have the product issued in markets around the globe.  Indeed, Visa expectsits chip card activities to expand in six regions this year.  "Visa Cash notonly will grow in various parts of Canada, but it will expand over time ineach of our operating regions," says Gaylon Howe, Visa senior vice presidentof stored value products.However, the most recent Visa activity is occurring in Canada, where TorontoDominion Bank, Scotiabank, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union and Lescasisses Desjardins, will be piloting Visa Cash.  Toronto Dominion andVancouver City Savings went live in December.Toronto Dominion is issuing 10,000 disposable Visa Cash cards to 5,000employees in Toronto, who can purchase cards through a card dispensing machineat bank headquarters for use in a cafeteria.  Up to 15 card readers areexpected to be installed at retail locations over the next several months,including Michel's Baguette, MMMarvelous MMMuffins, and The UCS Groupconvenience stores.Adding IncomeIn addition, Toronto Dominion expects to eventually add other retailers, pilota rechargeable Visa Cash card, add smart card features to existing debit andcredit cards and support a loyalty program.  "We see the stored-value productcreating a new revenue stream for the bank," says Steve Phillips, TorontoDominion manager of access cards and smart card development.  "Visa researchshows consumers are willing to pay a fee to obtain cards, so we wanted to getour feet wet and generate technical and business expertise with a pilot."  Thetest is expected to last six to 10 months.  The bank expects to eventuallyroll out the card to other provinces, Phillips says.Stored-value card activity also is under way at Vancouver City Savings, whichis issuing 1,200 Visa Cash cards in $20 denominations to its employees in theVancouver area.  The cards can be used for purchases at a local McDonald's, aSubway shop, a bank cafeteria, a gift shop at the Science World children'smuseum, and a Starbucks coffee shop.Vancouver City Savings is one of Canada's largest credit unions with 250,000members.  "We compete with larger banks and feel we can get ahead in themarket with stored value," a spokesperson says.  Vancouver City's pilot willrun through the spring.  The credit union plans to eventually roll out VisaCash throughout British Columbia.Still developing its chip card program is Toronto-based Scotiabank, whichplans to launch a six-month in-house pilot in early February at two bank sitesin Toronto with 5,000 employees.  Employees can use the cards at the bankcafeteria, MMMarvelous MMMuffins and Starbucks Coffee shops.  "We want to beready when the market moves," says Bob Lounsbury, Scotiabank vice president ofcard products and marketing.  "But we don't yet see stored-value cards asproviding an opportunity to steal customers away from other banks."Quebec's largest credit union, Les caisses Desjardins, will launch a Visa Cashpilot by March in a yet to be determined location.  The credit union isscouting for an area with a high concentration of stores that deal insmall-value transactions, such as in an office complex.  Program details areexpected to be finalized by the end of the month.Acquirer-paid interchange pricing for Visa Cash in Canada has not yet beendetermined, though each bank will set its own fees, participants say.Consumer pricing has not been set, but employees will not pay extra card feesduring the test.The Canadian financial institutions are positioning to garner a piece of thelarge market for low-value transactions.  Visa estimates that transactions ofunder $10 account for $75 billion annually in Canada.Bank executives believe Canadians will embrace stored-value cards because manyconsumers already are active debit users.  For instance, Toronto-basedInterac, the national on-line point-of-sale network that was launched in 1990,has doubled its POS transaction volume in the last year.More than 7 million Interac cards have been issued up, from 5 million in 1994.Interac had 50 million POS transactions in December, up from 25 million a yearearlier.  Yet, Interac executives do not expect stored-value activity to cutinto on-line volume because stored value is designed to replace cash orlow-ticket transactions.  The average Interac purchase is about $47.Competitive PressuresBut while Visa Cash is expected to operate alongside Interac, the stored-valueproduct could still face strong competition from the London-based Mondexelectronic purse program.  Mondex has signed Royal Bank of Canada and CanadianImperial Bank of Commerce-two of the largest institutions in the country-andHongkong Bank, to issue cards.  Mondex plans to test its product in Guelph,Ontario, during the second half of 1996.  Guelph has 100,000 residents and1,200 merchants (Debit Card News, 11/15).Mondex is positioned as a cash replacement and cards can be loaded with valueat ATMs, bank counters and telephones.  Consumers also can transfer valueamong cards, and send value electronically from the point of sale to the bank."We are looking to get practical experience from an actual market test, whichshows we are moving faster to bring smart cards to the marketplace," saysTimothy N.  McNaughton, Royal Bank of Canada's manager of pilots andimplementation.Though some observers believe Visa Cash has an advantage with name awareness,analysts say both companies face the challenge of getting consumers to try anew stored-value product.  "Visa's brand recognition gives it an edge, butboth products are starting from scratch," says David Lott, senior of DoveAssociates, a payments consulting firm.  "There is ample room in Canada forboth products."Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Another President Departs From Debit Processor Deluxe DataFor the second time in less than three years, one of the debit industry's mostrenown processors, Deluxe Data Systems, is working to keep its course in themidst of a leadership upheaval.  Milwaukee-based Deluxe has named John B.Benton as interim president, replacing James E.  McGowan.  Benton is chairmanand chief executive officer of Benton International Corp., a Torrance,Calif.-based consulting firm which develops processing systems.McGowan exits his position just 28 months after being named president.McGowan replaced Alan G.  Brown, who reportedly was forced out in 1993.  In astatement released by Deluxe, Gus Blanchard, president and chief executiveofficer of parent company Deluxe Corp., said that a number major changes andadditions to product offerings are planned, and "I felt this major expansionrequired new leadership to move us to a higher plane."Deluxe's new growth strategy, which was developed after a six-month analysis,features four major initiatives including enhancing the company's paymentsprotection capabilities and creating larger information data bases.  The aimis for Deluxe to function as a technology partner and act as a link betweenfinancial institutions and their customers.  Client institutions would be ableto electronically hook their customers to a variety of banking application,such as being able to check balances from a home computer.Other initiatives involve restructuring the company's catalog and directmarketing units, and a major cost reduction and asset redeployment program tohelp finance Deluxe's expansion plans.This development of new initiatives and the replacement of McGowan follows arough period for Deluxe.  The company has faced difficult times in recentyears as EFT networks, Deluxe's Data's major clients, have taken theirprocessing in-house.  For instance, New Jersey-based NYCE, the second-largestshared network and a former Deluxe client, began processing its owntransactions in 1992Deluxe also lost a major processing customers in 1990 when Brown Deer,Wis.-based Tyme, the 22nd--largest network, switched from Deluxe to M&I DataServices.  Tyme, however, still is a software customer of Deluxe.Some analysts also say that Deluxe has made some questionable businessdecisions in recent years.  In 1994, the company purchased Louisville-basedFinancial Alliance Processing Services, one of the industry's fastest growingcredit card processors that offers credit and debit services to about 150financial institutions.  Some observers believe Deluxe overpaid for FinancialAlliance.Other observers attribute Deluxe's situation to McGowan's inexperience in EFT.Though McGowan spent 18 years with IBM and was an executive with threesoftware and technology firms, he was new to the electronic payments industrywhen hired by Deluxe.  McGowan has has been placed on special assignment,reporting to Blanchard."I'm not surprised by this because McGowan was in over his head," says DonaldAtkinson, president of Atkinson & Associates, an Irving, Texas-based dataprocessing consultant.  Some observers also were surprised by the suddennessof McGowan's departure and the naming of Benton as interim president.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996NACHA Adds More Pieces To The Nationwide EBT PuzzleSeven months after stating plans to develop national electronic benefitstransfer operating rules, the National Automated Clearinghouse Associ-ation'selectronic benefits transfer council is moving forward.  The council hasdeveloped a set of preliminary rules to clarify the roles of such EBT playersas banks, processors and state governments.  NACHA also has startednegotiations to acquire a logo for a national EBT network.The EBT council, which is working to create a nationwide EBT system, expectsto release the final version of the rules in March.  State EBT consortiums,such as the seven-state Northeast Coalition and the eight-state SouthernAlliance of States, plan to incorporate the NACHA rules in their operatingprocedures."We are trying to create an interoperable environment for EBT so it makessense to incorporate these standards," says Daniel Berry, EBT coordinator forNew York State, which is part of the Northeast Coalition.NACHA's EBT Council consists of representatives from state governments, banks,processing companies and shared regional EFT networks.  The council is workingwith the U.S.  Treasury and the Federal EBT task force to createspecifications for a national EBT program.The NACHA rules are designed to clarify a wide range of EBT issues.  Theystate, for instance, that scrip machines in retail locations can be used todispense benefits as long as the device is treated as point-of-sale terminalsand not ATMs.  Scrip machines dispense vouchers that are redeemed for cash bya store clerk.  Networks have different fee schedules for ATM and POStransactions.While some observers say the EBT Council's operating rules will duplicateexisting EFT operating rules, participants say the NACHA group is helping tosimplify procedures.In addition to developing rules, the EBT council is negotiating with directorsof the defunct Quest shared regional EFT network to use the Quest logo for anational EBT mark.  The deal is expected to be completed within several weeks.Kentucky-based Quest was merged into Delaware-based MAC, the third largestshared regional EFT network last July, but the Quest name is still owned byTransaction Services Co., which represents seven Kentucky-area financialinstitutions.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Blockbuster Has A Casting Call For Its Corporate Prepaid CardOne of The Blockbuster Entertainment Group's newest releases, a prepaid debitcard for consumers, has been re-edited.  Blockbuster has shelved plans toissue cards to consumers and is concentrating on signing corporate customersto distribute the stored-value products.Blockbuster is aggressively working to sign product manufacturers, restaurantsand other merchants to purchase and disperse the prepaid cards to theircustomers as a marketing incentive.  Already, Planet Hollywood and publisherSimon and Schuster have formed alliances with Blockbuster.  Simon and Schusteris including the disposable magnetic-stripe cards in books sold at collegebookstores.  The co-branded cards can be used for purchases at 3,300Blockbuster Video, 520 Blockbuster Music and 330 Discovery Zone children'splay-area locations in the U.S.By targeting the corporate customer, Florida-based Blockbuster has turned itsattention from the consumer market.  Blockbuster began testing its disposableValue Card in Salt Lake City last summer at 25 Blockbuster Video, BlockbusterMusic and Discovery Zone locations (Debit Card News, 9/7).  The companyreportedly invested more than $1 million in hardware and software for theprogram.  Consumers paid $15 for cards that held $20 of value.Yet, despite strong consumer interest in the cards, Blockbuster did not expandthe program outside of Utah.  More than 100,000 Blockbuster Value Cards weresold in three weeks and Blockbuster said last fall that the company wasencouraged by the test.  The card was expected to cut transaction times at thecheckout, increase the average ticket size and generate interest income onunspent funds that are held by Blockbuster.A Blockbuster spokesperson now says the Salt Lake City program was primarilydesigned to test the stored-value operating system and that the company now isputting all its efforts "into the corporate direction."In addition to signing product manufacturers and service companies,Blockbuster is marketing its stored-value GiftCard as a vehicle through whichcompanies can distribute bonuses to their employees.  Blockbuster also ispositioning the cards as a collectible, which can feature designs depicting awide range of themes, such as pictures of hit movies when the films arereleased on video.Most recently, Blockbuster sold GiftCards to consumers during the holidayseason to use as gift certificates.  The Blockbuster spokesperson says using amag-stripe card as an electronic gift certificate cut the company's processingcosts and the vehicle is expected to be used again this year.  The GiftCard isexpected to be marketed internationally.Blockbuster stored-value transactions are processed by Omaha-based First DataCorp.'s Card Establishment Services/NaBANCO unit, the company's credit cardprocessor.  During a transaction, the cards are swiped through the stores'credit card devices and sent to CES/NaBanco for authorization and processing.Cardholders can check remaining account balances at the point of sale.The move to market a stored-value product is just Blockbuster's latestactivity in the card market.  Last spring Blockbuster rolled out a co-brandedVisa credit card with NationsBank.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996California Surchargers Survive A State Sales Tax ScareThe threatened extinction of the surcharge in California has subsided for thetime being.  The state has backed away from a plan to collect sales tax onconsumer fees that are attached to on-line point-of-sale and automated tellermachine transactions.The measure, which was proposed last summer by the California Board ofEqualization after an audit of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Prestige StationsInc.  subsidiary, could have cost companies that surcharge millions of dollarsin back taxes.  The regulation also could have resulted in a decrease inmerchant surchargers, and hefty consumer fee increases to compensate for thetaxes, analysts believe.California determined last year that it was owed taxes from consumersurcharges on transactions generated at 280 Arco service stations inCalifornia.  Prestige Stations Inc.  operates Arco's 400 company-ownedstations in California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Arizona.  Arco chargesconsumers 25 cents to initiate on-line debit POS transactions.  While Arco andCalifornia officials would not state the amount of taxes that were inquestion, which date back several years, observer believes it was in themillions of dollars.The Board of Equalization last month ruled that Arco and other surchargesshould not be subjected to a sales tax because the consumer fee is more of afinancing charge than the sales price of an item, says Dennis Fox, supervisorof audit planning for the California Board of Equalization.The board recently published regulations for EFT fees which state that vendorscould be taxed on surcharges if, for instance, the extra fee is not statedseparately; if the consumer could not purchase the property at a price whichdoes not include the amount of the fee; or if the fee is calculated as apercentage of the sales price.  The provision is expected to become law inabout four months, following public hearings and a comment period.By excluding surcharges from the tax code, California has kept a strongmerchant revenue pipeline in place.  Anaheim-based Carl's Jr., for instance,one of the U.S.'s largest on-line POS merchants with close to 2,000 terminalsin more than 500 outlets, surcharges consumers 50 cents a transaction onpurchases.  Indeed, Fox said the fast-food industry lobbied the state to dropits plan to tax surchargers.While Carl's Jr.  reportedly implemented the fee to discourage consumers frominitiating small purchases just to get $40 or more in cash back, analystsbelieve the fast-food outlet, as well as Arco, is generating strong incomefrom the fee."This removed a significant barrier to the imposition of surcharges inCalifornia," says Eric Bell, vice president of Los Angeles-based FirstInterstate, a leading merchant acquiring institution.  "Most of the surchargerevenue was pure gravy."But while California point-of-sale surchargers might have dodged a major taxbullet, the merchants could be facing another obstacle later this year whenCalifornia-based Visa's Interlink national POS network is expected to ban allmerchants from surcharging transactions.Though the network outlawed surcharging as of November 1993, retailers thatwere surcharging prior to that date are allowed to continue the practice untilthis November.  The Visa board could address the issue this year, analystsbelieve.Back to Headline List CopyrightDEBIT CARD NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 17, 1996Debit-Conscious Australia Says G'Day To Prepaid CardsWhile Australia may be best known for its kangaroos and koala bears, someNorth American payment players might also be equating the country with guineapigs.  For Australia has become a major test site for new and advanced debitproducts that eventually will be employed in the U.S., including smart cards.A stored-value card test is under way on the Gold Coast, a tourist area on theeast coast of Australia, by Visa International.  MasterCard International willlaunch a pilot in Canberra, Australia's capital, in March.  The smart cardpilots will help determine how stored-value programs will be designed andpromoted in the U.S.  and other regions."The Australia pilot will help us leverage what we learn from consumers,merchants and member banks about product positioning and marketing," saysWalter Greenberg, MasterCard senior vice president and stored-value projectmanager.Debit SavvyThe bank card associations are using Australia as a test site because researchfound that the majority of Australian consumers are willing to usestored-value smart cards in lieu of cash.  Australians already have embracedon-line debit cards, with 17 million debit cards issued to the population of17 million.  Last year, Australian taxis began accepting MasterCard's Maestroglobal POS network cards for payment in Sydney.But while both associations are expanding into Australia, they are followingdifferent routes.  Visa's Visa Cash product currently is just distributed as adisposable stored-value card, but a reloadable application is expected to berolled out in February.Meanwhile, MasterCard will offer a rechargeable MasterCard Cash card when itrolls out a stored-value program in March.  "We started with the disposablecard to gain critical mass," says Bruce Mansfield, Visa's head of chip cardsin Australia.  "Because reloadable cards feature bank logos, we didn't wantour banks to compete against each other at the beginning of the pilot."MasterCard, which is marketing its MasterCard Cash product to consumers thismonth via direct mail, will link its stored-value smart card to existingcredit and debit accounts.  MasterCard is not issuing disposable cards for theAustralian pilot.  "Our research shows that consumers want enhancements toexisting cards, rather than have more cards in their wallet," Greenberg says.Targeting TouristsAustralian stored-value activity was kicked off by Visa in mid-November on theGold Coast, an area that attracts nearly 3 million visitors per year.  Thesmart cards are being issued by five major financial institutions:  AustraliaNew Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit UnionServices Corp.  Australia Ltd., National Australia Bank and Westpac BankingCorp.The banks have issued more than 10,000 cards and installed 250 card-readingterminals at an estimated 100 retail locations.  Visa is implementing amarketing campaign which includes print advertisements and billboards.Approximately 150,000 cards will be issued during the year-long pilot.The Visa Cash cards are being sold at about 50 locations, including movietheaters, theme parks, hotels and financial institution branches.  Reloadablecards will be added in February and cardholders will be able to add valuethrough automated teller machines and at the point of sale.Visa also expects to have 1,000 smart card terminals installed by February.Most merchants, which include Kmart, Target, McDonald's, 7-Eleven, Shell Oiland Bond University's book and coffee shop, are situated near two majorshopping centers.  Three theme parks, including Sea World, will accept cardsat about 150 terminals and are expected to go live this month.About a half-dozen card dispensing kiosks also will be tested and the pilotmight incorporate home-based telephones to add value.  An upgrade to allowcardholders to store multiple currencies at sites around the world is plannedfor 1997.  Pricing for reloadable cards could range from 50 cents pertransaction to $10 annually.While Mansfield will not disclose current Visa Cash volume, he projects thatactivity will reach 25,000 transactions per week in March.  Acquirer-paidinterchange pricing will be determined by each bank.Meanwhile, MasterCard is just as aggressive in expanding its Australianprogram.  MasterCard has been signing merchants since October and expects morethan 200 retailers and 300 smart card terminals to be involved in its pilot inBelcommen, a suburb of Canberra.  Retailers are paying for terminalinstallations.Gauging InterestMasterCard Cash issuers-Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, CommonwealthBank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp.  and Standard Charter Bank-will runmonth-long, in-house tests with up to 500 employees to strengthen employeeunderstanding of the product and to test the stored-value operating system.The employee pilots also will test different consumer pricing.  The banksexpect to issue up to 10,000 cards for the nine-month consumer pilot.MasterCard banks began a direct mail campaign this month for MasterCard Cash.Final pricing schedules will be completed by March.  While Australianregulations restrict banks from publicly disclosing consumer and merchantpricing, research shows that customers prefer monthly or annual fees, ratherthan per-transaction fees.MasterCard Cash cards will be distributed through bank branches andcardholders can reload value onto the card's computer chip by transferringfunds from bank accounts at ATMs and at the point of sale.  Futureenhancements could include loading value through home-based telephones.Full-function kiosks also will be installed, where customers can checkbalances and transaction information.In addition to their Australian effort, Visa and MasterCard also expect tosign issuers in New Zealand.

Tampa-based Payment Systems Inc.  reports thatin 1995, 52% of all retail transactions were initiated at financialinstitution branches, down just 2% from 1994.  The total volume oftransactions conducted at a traditional branch increased by 6% between 1994and 1995.Meanwhile, the share of all transactions conducted at automated tellermachines increased from 22% to 26%, with ATM volumes increasing by 32%, PSIreports.  Phone banking's share of total transactions increased from 12% to15%, with a 39% volume increase from 1994 to 1995.Payment Systems Inc.  determined that active ATM users also use phone bankingsystems to transfer funds between accounts or inquire about cleared checks,and use bank branches to initiate deposits.

The service is called CS-Direct Invest andfollows the May 1995 launch of CS-Direct Invest in Switzerland.German clients will be able to carry out investment business via an"account/safekeeping account" in Switzerland. With a minimum investmentof DM10,000 ($7,000), German clients can use CS-Direct Invest to buildup a portfolio from Credit Suisse's Credis Investment Funds.A Credit Suisse spokeswoman confirmed that because the accounts arebased in Switzerland, German customers are covered by Swiss bankingsecrecy laws. Recent years have seen a number of clamp-downs by theGerman authorities on banks for allegedly facilitating customers inavoiding tax through Luxembourg-based funds.Credit Suisse priced its Swiss product high - mainly to avoid losingtoo much business from other areas of its banking service. But theapproach in Germany has been different: "CS-Direct Invest has acompetitive price structure in Germany, but there is a cleardifferentiation from discount banks such as Direkt Anlage, Comdirectand Bank 24," said a bank spokeswoman."Our selling point is not so muchprice as service."The product comes with investment advice and a personal adviser, unlikeGerman competitors Direkt Anlage, which pared costs to the bone by notincluding advice, though it provides information.The German funds market has grown 25 percent a year since 1990, andCredit Suisse expects it to grow at least 15 percent a year until 2000.A spokesman for rival Swiss Bank Corporation said that while it had noplans to launch a similar product in Germany it was closely observingthe market.The project will not involve any co-operation with the Winterthurinsurance company, which CS has linked up with in Switzerland.There are no plans at the moment for PC banking with CS-Direct Invest,but the bank is watching developments, especially in relation toimproving security.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But Signet says the high loan losses arepart of its statistically-driven "cell testing" method and are no causefor alarm.Signet's "loan by cheque" programme is one of the most daringexperiments yet in "branchless" banking. The programme uses databasedmarketing and advanced computer models to generate pre-approvedconsumer loans of up to $10,000. For each pre-approved loan, the banksimply mails out a cheque to the targeted consumer, who can then cashit at his local bank.The new programme relies on the statistical science of "informationdiscovery", an approach first developed by the US credit card industryand used to great effect by Signet's highly successful credit cardoperation, which the bank spun off into Capital One in early 1995.Capital One, which uses information discovery to generate customisednew card offers, increased its accounts by 22 percent and itsreceivables by 42 percent in 1995.Information discovery studies each customer's behaviour and calculatesthe "net present value" of each customer relationship. It thencontinuously analyses customer data to isolate behavioural clustersthat permit the bank to generate customised card or consumer loanoffers. Once these offers are tested and retested among the bank'sexisting customers, the resulting models, or "hypotheses", are used togenerate new offers to non-customers taken from external lists.Signet's cheque-by-mail programme is part of an ambitious bid totransform the mid-sized regional bank, which has $10 billion in assetsand some 250 branches, into a national consumer bank. Since 1993, thebank has used statistical modelling and bought lists to mail out offersfor consumer credits, student loans, home equity products and mutualfunds to tens of thousands of prospective customers, who have only tophone a toll-free telephone number to accept the terms offered.The bank's declared strategy is to take the statistical methodspioneered by the credit card industry and extend them into consumerlending and direct banking. A number of large US banks, including FirstBank and Wells Fargo are using similar methods for national marketingdrives in small business lending and home equity loans, for example,but Signet's effort is the most aggressive and broadly-based."Signet is turning into a cross between a consumer finance company anda regional bank. It could turn into a huge national company," said TomMcCandless, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York. "Many banks aretrying to emulate what they're doing."But the experimental nature of Signet's marketing methods have latelybecome a cause for concern among analysts. Signet's programme ran intotrouble in the third quarter of 1995, when its gross charge-offs roseto $9.3 million, up 63 percent from the previous quarter. As a result,Signet was forced to double its loan loss provisions to $8.7 million,and redoubled them again in the fourth quarter to $18.6 million. Thebank's total net charge-offs jumped 20 percent from the third quarterto $15.6 million.Signet explained that the higher loan losses were the result of twomailings the company made in late 1994 to test how lower acceptancecriteria would affect response and profitability. The two mailingsgenerated $175 million in new loans, but three quarters later they hadcreated an annualised loss rate of 11.23 percent.Signet has responded that the third-quarter losses were the result ofmailings the bank deliberately made to higher-risk segments. "In orderto build more effective models, we had to have some losses, and inorder to get some losses, we had to mail to higher risk segments,"Signet chief operating officer Malcolm McDonald told American Banker.While the bank was expecting a higher loss rate for these mailings, itdid not expect the high response level - and resulting loss levels -that the mailings produced. Earlier mailings, he said, did not produceenough losses to build statistically robust models. McDonald explainedthat each mailing has expected losses built into it, and that Signet'scheque-by-mail programme could sustain higher loan losses and stillgenerate a"positive net present value".But fourth-quarter losses have further highlighted the problems of theloan-by-cheque programme. The loan loss ratio of the programme's twohigh-risk mailings reached a miserable 19.5 percent in the fourthquarter, against 2 percent for the rest of the programme. But Signetstands by the programme, whose loans its hopes to double in 1996. Itexpects high losses to continue in the coming quarters, as high-riskloans decline as a percentage of the total loan-by-cheque portfolio.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The company says the opportunityexists because of the deregulation of the mandatory motor insurancemarket.Balz Hoesly, chief operations officer of Swissline, expects volume togrow to between 10 percent and 15 percent of the non-life insurancemarket by 2000, and expects to make a profit in four to six years.Swissline will initially offer motor insurance and linked products likelegal help and breakdown recovery, but it is hoped that it will expandinto other forms of insurance "fairly soon".Swissline is a stand-alone company, and is legally the underwritingagent for Wintherthur Insurance and Wintherthur Life. It employs 70people."We are aiming to gain lasting competitive advantage in the entirevalue-added process," said Hoesly. He cited motivated staff,first-class service, cost advantages for customers, rigorous costmanagement and a high-tech infrastructure as the basics needed for thesuccess of the direct operation.Swissline says it deliberately waited for the deregulation moves tostart operations.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Banc One's poor results highlight the screenphone'sfailure to achieve any success in the US market in 1995. Several largeinstitutions, including Citibank, withdrew from screenphone pilots lastyear, and many other banks chose to focus on PC banking instead.Banc One launched the pilot in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in September,in partnership with hardware vendor GTE and processor Visa Interactive.GTE's screenphone was priced at $150, perhaps the lowest price on offerin the US, where some high-end models have sold for $700. GTE hoped tosell 2,000 units by the end of 1995, but it sold only several hundred.Most of the buyers were blue-collar men who were older and lessaffluent than expected.Banc One mailed 150,000 screenphone offers to its customers in Texas,but the promotion generated far more inquiries about the bank's PCbanking programme than its screenphone service. (Banc One currentlyoffers PC banking in Ohio through on-line service Prodigy, a programmeit plans to extend to other markets this year.)In its 1996 Home Banking Report, Jupiter Communications in New Yorkestimated that PC home banking accounts in the US at 750,000 in 1995and predicted they would grow to 13 million by the year 2000. But forscreenphones, Jupiter Communications offered a less sanguine view - the19,000 US households using screenphones for remote banking in 1995would grow to 600,000 by the year 2000. Since screenphones, unlike PCs,bear the enormous marketing and hardware risks involved in launching anew consumer device, Jupiter's screenphone projection should be enoughto dissuade most large banks from trying.While the screenphone was widely discussed at the 1994 Retail DeliverySystems conference, it received no attention at all at the 1995 RDSshow, where speeches on PC and Internet banking drew huge crowds. Askedat one 1995 RDS session to name his greatest marketing failure, Keycorpmarketing chief Steven Cone replied,"At Citibank, my biggest mistakewas backing the screenphone, a wonderful device that no one uses."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Time Warner's FSN, the first interactive cable pilot inthe US, has signed up 3,500 customers in Orlando, Florida and nowoffers customers local phone service as well as broadband datatransfer.Barnett's programme, the first US home banking pilot that usesfull-motion interactive television (ITV), will allow FSN subscribers tocombine remote banking with such interactive services as video ondemand, home shopping and video games.Barnett's home banking package, which is free for all FSN customers whoalso bank at Barnett, allows users to check their balances, viewstatements and transfer funds by manipulating displays on their TVswith the help of cable set box. All customer information resides withBarnett, which encrypts and secures transaction information on its ownproprietary operating system.Once the holy grail of remote delivery, interactive cable in the US wascompletely eclipsed last year by the phenomenal growth and popularityof the Internet. Only two operators have introduced interactive cablepilots - Time Warner and regional telco Bell Atlantic, which launchedits service in New Jersey last month.The expense of upgrading infrastructure has delayed the progress ofboth projects and cast doubt on their commercial viability.

The service - Giro Direkt - was launchedin October.The number of accounts in American Express Bank in Germany rose 30percent between April and October 1995.

We saw that there was growing interest outside thecard member base to offer a similar product."We are waiting to see the results of that test, and will then reviewthe situation," said a spokesman.Giro Direkt will be evaluated on, among other criteria, the number ofcustomers and their profiles and usage patterns.It is possible that the company will open a similar operation in the UKor elsewhere, if the German operation is a success. American Expresshas direct banking operations for card holders only in Paris,Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.But a spokesman warned: "There are no plans to do anything in the UK atthis stage. We will look at the banking environment, what consumerinterest there is and then move from there."The project started in Berlin and Hamburg, where the bank says there isa clear reflection of its current customer profile.Giro Direkt customers can bank by phone, fax or letter from anywhere inthe world.

Yet the country's major institutions show marked differencesin their approach. Diarmuid MacConville reportsDUTCH FINANCIAL institutions were among the pioneers of directdelivery, and the Dutch are among the world's keenest users of directservices. At present, about 8.5 percent of retail bank customers usethe telephone, and UK market research company Datamonitor believes thatby the year 2000 almost a quarter of the Dutch population will bebanking by phone.Direct banking in Holland started in 1978, 15 years before bankselsewhere realised that customers wanted more flexibility in banking.Postbank, before its privatisation and absorption into NMB Bank, andultimately ING Group, coined the phrase "Thuisbankieren", which is nowused generically for all home banking.Only cash withdrawals and lodgements required a visit to the postoffice; all other transactions could be carried out at home, usuallyover the phone. Postbank prospered with direct banking: market share ofsavings rose to 17 percent in 1989 from 13 percent in 1978.Three players - Rabobank, Postbank, and ABN AMRO - dominate the Dutchmarket, and account for 80 percent to 90 percent of most types ofbanking business. But smaller players, including insurance companieslike Achmea and Aegon, are starting to nibble at the edges of thedirect banking market. Postbank has been by far the quickest into thedirect market; the other big banks are only slowly starting to adddirect banking services to the main offering.A spokesman for a rival bank said: "That is because for us, directbanking is only one channel of distribution, not the main one, like itis for Postbank."Postbank, part of the ING group, is basically a stand-alone directbank, though it does have dedicated counters in post office branchesaround the country. It started experimenting with alternativedistribution channels in the 1960s, while it was still state-owned.Today, the telephone is its main distribution channel. It claims abanking relationship with one-third of Dutch households, about 6million people.Postbank has 500 staff at four processing centres, all dealing withcustomer queries. The bank generates most of its customer creditinquiries from the post offices (60 percent) compared to 27 percentfrom mailed material, which is also used extensively.Some 800 customer service agents at 11 Postbank call centres deal with8.5 million inquiries. This has been supplemented by Girofoon, anAutomatic Voice Response (AVR) unit launched in 1993. But Postbankmanagers are sceptical about customer acceptance. "We are convincedthat many of our best customers do not yet appreciate it," said HermanHuizinga, Postbank's head of telephone banking. "Because we are not yetconvinced of the full acceptance of the medium, we are not forcingcustomers to use voice response."The bank also has AVR units to reply to questions about share pricesand its mortgage products.ABN AMRO, which also has an AVR unit, started its pilot human operatorphone banking service early in 1996. Clients of 33 branches can use it,allowing them to buy and sell stocks and shares and obtain marketinformation. From February 19, a service line will be available,allowing account transfers and other banking services.An ABN AMRO spokeswoman said that the continuation of manned phonebanking depends on the results of the pilot. The bank wants to focusthe direct banking as an add-on service for branch-based customersrather than as a stand-alone operation. Now employing about 50 people,the call centre is expected to expand to several hundred if the mannedtelephone banking operation goes ahead.Achmea Group came from the merger of Avero Central Beheer Group (AVCB)and Zilveren Kruis Group and started operating at the start of 1995. ASalomon Brothers study put the market penetration of its Dutch directcar insurance service (Centraal Beheer, set up in 1975) on a par withDirect Line, the UK's largest motor insurer.Direct banking, run by AVCB Bank, was started as part of the CentralBeheer direct insurance operation in 1988. It offered consumer creditand started operating as a stand-alone bank in 1992 when it got abanking licence allowing it to offer savings accounts. It now alsooffers credit cards.The bank makes use of the insurance operation's call centre, mostly fornon-clients who call to get information about the bank, often after amail-shot. Existing clients phone the front offices direct to transactbusiness, and staff at the front offices spend most of their timedealing with client calls. Product manager Cobi Weddepohl said very fewclients feel the need to call in person to the bank offices.All banking activities are being reorganised within Achmea; there arecurrently three banks with AVCB Bank selling products under fourdifferent labels. The aim is to have one bank holding company with oneback office and several front offices.Co-operative Rabobank Nederland, which has about 4.9 million retailcustomers, has an AVR unit. This was only set up in late 1994 andallows balance inquiry, funds transfer and information on personalloans.A Rabobank spokesman said its priority is "advisory banking", and thatany telephone services are additional. "Meeting customers face-to-faceis a very important part of the relationship." But the spokesman added:"That could change if the there's a need in the market. For example,our order line for share buying came in due to competition fromothers."Generale Bank Nederland (formerly Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland),while much smaller than its rivals, has dipped into the direct bankingmarket with Direktbank. It offers a limited range of banking services,and its main distribution channel is through a network of independentintermediaries. Sources in Generale have indicated it could turn moreto direct banking to increase market share without the expense ofcreating more branches.VSB Telebank, part of the financial conglomerate Fortis, was started in1990 as a result of an efficiency drive in the VSB Bank. It startedwith five staff and now has 30. Some 18 telemarketing staff man thelines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year- the first Dutch bank to offer this service.Calls doubled after the first year and have grown linearly since then.At the same time, branches are being closed or are reducing theiropening hours.An AVR unit deals with simple queries and standard calculations. Whenmore detail is required on a particular item, telesales staff willarrange a meeting with staff in the nearest branch.The bank strongly believes in tying most customers to their branches,thus overcoming the resentment often felt by established branches fromthe development of a direct banking operation. Branches are creditedwith sales made by telemarketing staff who take commission on it.The bank is careful to point out that it also has stand-alone customersin niche markets; this relates generally to the "upscale marketsegment" where it operates with financial advisers Finles, a companyspecialising in advising professional associations.VSB said that the conversion rate - the number of contacts that lead toa direct sale - is substantially higher for VSB Telebank than forbranch contacts, and said that 70 percent of VSB Telebank sales aresettled on the phone rather than through the post or branch visits.Spaarbeleg, the banking subsidiary of insurer Aegon, believes its lowoverheads allow it to offer some of the most competitive interest rateson the market. Customer numbers have doubled since 1993 to 700,000.Revenues increased by two-thirds to DFL488.5 million ($268.4 million)over the same period. It positions itself as a simple, high-interestalternative in the savings market.One of its two products is a savings account for employees ofcorporations which allow employers to offer their employees a fixed sumof money in a tax-efficient manner at an attractive rate of interest.Aegon thinks that the savings market will continue to grow in responseto the government's policy of encouraging citizens to provide forthemselves.Heinie Hakker, banking analyst at BZW, said that of the insurancecompanies nibbling the edges of the market, Aegon's Spaarbeleg has beenthe most successful, because it offers better interest rates than thebanks and also uses direct marketing techniques.A Postbank spokesman, commenting on the high interest rates offered bySpaarbeleg, admitted it would not be able to compete with this rate onall its accounts, but said Postbank has the huge advantage of a verystrong position in the payments system.The next development in direct banking in the Netherlands is theOctober 1996 launch of a multifunctional chip card. PTT Telecom, theDutch telecom company, has joined forces with ING to create a cardwhich can be used in shops, phone booths and banks. They can be loadedwith money at post offices, telephone booths, and eventually at homewith a special attachment to existing phones. The money added to thecard will be debited from a customer's account.Between them, the phone company and the bank have "access topractically every household in the Netherlands", according to BenVerwaayen, president of PTT Telecom.The system is especially designed to be an open one, and the designershope other retail groups will take part in it. The Dutch partners say aproject on this scale has never been tried before in Europe andpossibly beyond.They did not wait for the consensus that is usual among Dutch banksbefore launching a project. "The speed to market was all-important,"Verwaayen said.A similar electronic purse is being piloted by the other Dutch banks,though it is a less ambitious project than the "multifunctional" cardventure.ABN AMRO and most other banks say they are undecided about joining thenew venture, pointing out that they are already committed to anall-bank chip card project, currently under test in Arnhem.BZW analyst Hakker said: "Both ING and PTT are putting themselvesbehind it, and they are in dominant positions in their markets. It canbecome a big success. The Arnhem card has been badly received by tradeand industry because it is too inflexible and too expensive."Rabobank said it will "certainly not" be involved in the Postbank card.A spokesman said that the combined banks' card would probably beavailable in a few months, before the Postbank card, and that researchfrom the pilot project in Arnhem was very positive."On a scale of one to ten, customers gave it 7.2 and retailers gave it6.9. Retailers don't think it's too expensive. And 58 percent ofretailers would recommend it to others, said a Rabobank spokesman.PC-based home banking is well advanced. For example, Postbank has117,000 customers, including 91,000 retail who subscribe to Girotel,the PC-based home banking service launched in 1988. Subscriptions havetaken off since September 1994 - a three-fold growth was seen after theintroduction of a friendlier home banking system.The service is off-line, so users can complete all the necessary dataand send when they are ready. This has led to cost savings for the bankas well as for customers who do not have to wait for processing to bedone on-line, saving them on the phone bill.Rabobank has 80,000 private customers and 70,000 companies banking viaPCs, and expects this to grow to 200,000 within "a couple of years".The bank's PC banking started in 1992. A typical day would have about150,000 corporate transactions and 35,000 personal transactions.The use of smart phones has met with little success, however. On aPostbank test, while technically successful, customers felt that theadded convenience of banking with screenphones did not outweigh theirhigh costs."At the moment, we draw the conclusion that the coming years will bedominated by the use of the straightforward phone. Rapid penetration ofmobile telecommunication can support this. And in all circumstances wehave to rely on our staff to communicate with the customer," saidPostbank's Huizinga.AVCB Bank is trying out PC banking in 1996, and may go ahead dependingon the results of the pilot.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightDIRECT DELIVERY INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HONG KONG SET TO LEAP-FROG DIRECTA variety of factors particular to the territory mean that thedevelopment of direct delivery is taking an unusual course in HongKong. Andrew Moody reportsHONG KONG, like many centres in Asia, is a major focus for technology.The people, too, are gadget-obsessed. It is therefore somewhatsurprising that this culture of technology has not spread to directdelivery.The lack of development in this area is not because Hong Kong isunsophisticated in banking terms - it is one of the leading financialcentres of the world, and its 400 banks are a key element of thatstrength.But while the corporate banking community is fairly advanced intechnology terms, retail banking appears pretty slow off the mark. Akey reason for this is that Hong Kong is by geographical andsociological accident clumsily suited to the primary forms of directdelivery in banking.Telephone banking often requires huge space but Hong Kong, where landcomes at a higher premium than anywhere in the world, does not havemuch to spare. And in a country where unemployment has until recentlybeen insignificant, no-one, particularly anyone calling themselves abanker, wants to be a telephone operative.Sergio Rial, general manager of ABN AMRO in Hong Kong, agrees that thesteps towards telephone banking in the territory are only tentative."The real challenge and the barrier to phone banking in Hong Kong isthe people. In a place of full employment, no professional wants to bebehind a phone. I don't think they would be able to hold their heads upas a real banking professional," he says.And he adds: "Going through password procedure and paying people'sutility bills would not be anybody's idea of fun. Everybody here wantsto be part of a go-ahead marketing team, not this."So what have Hong Kong banks been doing in terms of direct deliverysystems? The first steps towards telephone banking came in the late1980s and early 1990s, pioneered by the territory's major players,Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered."We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another. Wecan do telephone, we can do fax and we have been looking at the mostcost-effective and customer-receptive forms of direct banking toimplement," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing andplanning for the Hongkong Bank and a leading figure within theterritory's banking community."Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is stilloffered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separateentity such as First Direct."But the services offered in Hong Kong are more primitive compared tomany of those in the west. The standard product is automated so that acustomer speaks to a voice-activated machine which is able to carry outsimple routine transactions. Generally, only AB and high-ratedcustomers get the chance to speak to a person, but that individual maybe someone from their branch who they would normally deal with duringthe course of their conventional banking transactions.High employment and land prices are not the only barriers to telephonebanking. The greater role played by the ATM compared to the west may beanother.In Hong Kong, the ATM is not just something in which you insert yourcard to check your balance and withdraw cash but something much morehighly prized. People can pay their utility bills, swap money betweendifferent accounts and carry out a variety of other functions.In fact, in most streets in Hong Kong the ATM machine seems to be acommunity focal point, like some open air post office, where people canstop and gossip, judging by the crowds they tend to gather around them.Staggeringly, there are 7 million ATM cards in use in the territoryserving a population of 6 million.In part, the ATM has taken over many of the functions served bytelephone banking in the west, and the average ATM transaction coststhe bank one-eighth of what it would cost over the counter.ATMs, however, are still more costly than more modern methods of directdelivery. They don't operate independently of branches. In fact, manyoperate within them, so this halfway house towards full direct deliveryis far from ideal.But the real catalyst for a wholesale change to more sophisticatedforms of banking could be the economy itself. So far, economicpressures on the banks to adopt new methods of technology havecertainly been nowhere near as great as in the west.Retail banking in Hong Kong is as profitable as virtually anywhere inthe world. Much of this has to do with the fact that Hong Kong hasaveraged economic growth rates of between 5 percent and 8 percent forthe last decade. It has also operated an infamous interest rate cartel.Bank customers have, therefore, been getting richer and moremiddle-class. There have therefore been fewer bad debtors, savingsrates have been higher and the bottom line of the banks ever bigger. In1993, for example, the Hang Seng Bank, 62 percent-owned by the HongkongBank, was the most profitable retail bank in the world, according tocredit rating agency IBCA. Consequently, banks have not been forced tocut costs by closing branches, get rid of staff and move more quicklytowards automated methods of banking.This factor, however, is beginning to change. GDP growth forecasts forHong Kong, particularly over the difficult period of 1997 when thecolony transfers from British to Chinese control, look very uncertain.A survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, published in January,points to growth slumping to 1.7 percent in 1997, compared to around 5percent now. If this is the case, retail banking in Hong Kong can nolonger rely on the ever-increasing wealth of their customers to digthem out of a hole.The new harsher economic environment has undoubtedly begun to changethe thinking among senior bank executives within the major banks.Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of the Hang Seng Bank, is inno doubt the banks will have to adapt to the new environment."What is coming will be dramatic and will totally reshape the business.By the end of the millennium retail banking will have undergone majorplastic surgery," he says. "It has become increasingly apparent thatthe future of banking lies in automation and technology applications.With the higher cost of operations, finding a more efficient way todeliver banking services to customers is one of the critical factorsfor financial institutions."ABN AMRO's Rial believes that Hong Kong banks in their evolutionarydevelopment will actually by-pass conventional telephone banking andtake a quantum step from branch banking to PC home banking. "Because ofthe constraints within the market, I can see this happening. There arealso many local factors making it difficult to operate telephonebanking in any meaningful sense, so I would not be surprised if HongKong banks took this peculiar step forward," he says.Some, however, do not quite hold with this theory. Peter Wong,vice-president of global consumer banking for Citibank in Hong Kong,believes there is mileage in telephone banking. From his office next tothe futuristic Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay, hemainly deals with higher net worth customers."We have had considerable take-up of our telephone banking services,and they have gone down well with our customers. We have a satisfactionrating for this service of 90 percent, compared with 82 percent for ourconventional banking," he said.Assuming, however, that the era of telephone banking in Hong Kong issome form of interregnum - a brief stop on the way to moresophisticated systems of direct delivery - what methods do the bankshave in mind?The leading banks are already investing heavily behind closed doorsinto technologies that will make home PC or TV banking a reality.Electronic banking is already available to the corporate market and itwill inevitably spread into the retail market. Consumers in Hong Kongare very computer literate; it is estimated that 200,000 people in theterritory are already Internet subscribers. And it is expected thatwithin just a few years, once banks have developed secure transactiontechnology, there will be a flood of customers wanting to do theirbanking over the Internet.The direct delivery of banking services into people's homes throughinteractive multi-media services may happen even more quickly. A numberof banks are planning to broadcast product information through thistechnology in 1996 paving the way to them conducting transactionbanking through this medium.Electronic cash could soon become a reality in Hong Kong with theimminent introduction of smart cards. The Mondex card is expected to beon trial later this year with a major launch in 1997. How it will takeoff is difficult to judge. It is seen in the west as an anti-crimemeasure but in Hong Kong there is virtually no cash crime.A bank likely to lead the market is the Hongkong Bank, which has beeninvesting heavily in this new technology. "We are not doing homebanking yet but we are coming along with it. We are currently workingwith Hongkong Telecom jointly to do TV banking. All the differentinterfaces which are possible technologically are being looked at,"says Hongkong's Tai.Its sister bank, the Hang Seng, is also a driving force. "In terms oftechnology products in use Hong Kong is still in the early stages oftechnology banking when compared to the western countries," says AlexAu."But although investment in new technology involves huge sums, bankscannot afford not to make the investment. For in the end, technologybanking means - for both external and internal operations - improvedefficiency, higher productivity, better risk control and lower costs."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Thisseems to contradict the general view that these products are toocomplex to sell direct, and require advice and advisers.A major attraction of buying direct seems to be"the positive experienceof the price and service benefits delivered by companies such as DirectLine and First Direct". Six out of ten customers cited value for moneyas their key motivation for wanting to buy this way.Banks were most popular among the mass market while affluent customerstended to see pensions and insurance as more complex matters requiringadvice.Customers cited companies like Marks and Spencer (17 percent), the PostOffice (34 percent), and even the utility companies (16 percent) asplaces where they would buy life assurance, pensions and investments.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Rather thanselling them off as it has done with four of the nine banks to date, itnow plans to merge the banks into two of the leading specialised banks - Polska Kasa Opieki (Pekao) and Bank Handlowy w Warsawie.Under the plan, Bank Handlowy w Warsawie will absorb Pomorski BankKredytowy (PBKS) and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH), while Pekao willmerge with Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy andPolski Bank Rozwoju (PBR).According to Standard & Poor's, "the consolidation would notsignificantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range forzloty-denominated obligations".It added that certain risks would increase in the near term, as themergers would bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio, andthe integration process could be difficult. S&P said that objectionsfrom shareholders of the already semi- privatised banks BPH and PBR, aswell as from regional bank managements "could still scuttle the deal".Recent reports from Poland said the president of BPH claimed she wouldfight the merger with Bank Handlowy w Warsawie if it meant BPH wouldlose its separate identity. And the president of Pomorski BankKredytowy is reported to have said that a takeover of PBKS and BPHwould cause chaos and delay the privatisation process.S&P said that"a more jaundiced view" held by some market players isthat the consolidation strategy is merely a ploy by the government forreasserting control over the banking system, a theory which will beborne out, it said, if Bank Handlowy w Warsawie and Pekao are notprivatised.On the plus side, S&P said the consolidation plan could give the twobanks greater diversity and market share, which could be positivefactors. Bank Handlowy w Warsawie would gain more retail deposits andcommercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution networkand possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertiseof Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokeragestrength.Thomson BankWatch ratings on Hungarian banks                                          Intra-Country  Short-TermFinancial institution                     Issuer Rating  Debt RatingBudapest Bank                             IC-C           LC-2Central-European International Bank       IC-B           LC-1General Banking and Trust Company(Altalanos Ertekforgalmi Bank)            IC-C           LC-2Inter-Europa Bank                         IC-B/C         LC-2Kereskedelmi Bank(Commercial and Credit Bank)              IC-C/D         LC-2Magyar Hitel Bank (Hungarian Credit Bank) IC-C/D         LC-2Magyar Kulkereskelmi Bank(Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank)            IC-B           LC-1Orszagos Takarekpenzar (National Savings and Commercial Bank)   IC-B/C         LC-1Unicbank                                  IC-B           LC-1Source: Thomson BankWatchCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The programme affectsabout 8 percent of the banking sector and will require small banks torecapitalise and reduce their bad debt exposures by the end of 1996.Ekoagrobanka, a small agricultural bank based in Usti nad Labem, northBohemia, was forced into administration by the CNB's BankingSupervision Committee in mid-January and remained closed for more thana week after rumours flared that it was having difficulties, creatingqueues outside its 79 branches.The CNB advanced the bank CK1 billion ($37.4 million) to help cover therush on its demand deposits, and the CNB issued a statement in supportof Ekoagrobanka and its likely recovery. Shareholders agreedreluctantly to a capital reduction by nearly CK600 million to onlyCK1.2 million plus the injection of CK500 million of fresh capital fromKonsolidacni Banka, which becomes the largest shareholder.The CNB stated that Ekoagrobanka depositors should face no limits ontheir withdrawals once the bank opens again for business. Althoughdepositors are insured for 80 percent of deposits up to CK130,000 undera new national scheme, many are nervous following the collapse of threeother Czech banks in the past two years - Kreditni a Prumyslova Banka,AB Banka and Ceska Banka.The CNB had Ekoagrobanka under close scrutiny due to its large level ofoverdue loans, but CNB spokesman Martin Svehla said unlike the threebanks which collapsed, Ekoagrobanka had a realistic plan forstrengthening its capital adequacy and was implementing that planwithin the agreed time.The 1994 annual accounts of Ekoagrobanka received a heavily qualifiedaudit from local firm BDO. The auditors noted that reserves fordoubtful debts of CK266 million should, in fact, be CK1,291 million andprovisions against losses on securities should be raised from CK25million to CK494 million. Total assets in the qualified accountsamounted to CK12,005 million.Short-term deposits amounted to 66 percent. The stated profit was CK63million on CK1,286 million of revenue. The bank had planned to doubleits share capital by issuing CK600 million of shares on the PragueStock Exchange, but there were few interested buyers.The National Bank of Slovakia followed the example of their Czechcounterparts and placed the ten Slovak branches of Ekoagrobanka inforced administration in mid-January.The CNB has not revealed the names of the banks which it has forcedinto its new consolidation scheme, partly for fear of creating furtherpressures at a sensitive time. But it is known that many small Czechbanks are struggling from high levels of bad and doubtful debts and lowmargins compared to the larger banks.Banking analysts consider the Czech Republic to be over-banked,especially with many smaller banks failing to offer a differentiatedservice and thus suffering from a lack of access to low-interest loansand poor quality borrowers.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Central Bankalso restricted the operations of 423 banks and introduced temporarymanagement at five banks.The majority of suspensions happened in August when a liquidity crisishit the Russian banking system, crippled the domestic credit market andbrought the system to a standstill. Many banks were unable to meetobligations on the interbank market (see EEB56). The crisis left fewbanks untouched with many smaller banks in particular being badly hit.The crisis led to a shift in the balance of forces that has affectedeven top banks. It led to a serious shake-up in the banking system withmany of the top banks forging close alliances with each other.Many of the top ten banks reacted to the crippling demise of theinterbank market by forming their own alliance, offering to resumelending to each other in return for mutual access to financial records.In response to the crisis, the Central Bank is planning to introduce inMarch new laws which will determine how banks will be run and funded.It has also set up a programme to identify troubled banks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Unisys claims Sporitelna lacked consistentpolicies and made unreasonable demands outside the terms of itscontracts. Either way, in 1995 the bank cancelled the deals and tookover training and project management, leaving Unisys with a hardwareservice contract. Both claim they are owed millions of crowns by theother.Whatever the truth of the matter, the issue has given Unisys rivals amajor competitive weapon and left the firm scrambling to convincelocals of its capabilities.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It is believed to have been mainly dissuaded by keydiscrepancies in strategy between the two banks.Budapest Bank declared a net profit in 1994 of HUF1.6 billion ($12.2million), mostly due to a capital injection of HUF12 billion secretlymade by the government to shore up losses after the compulsory creationof a HUF21 billion fund to cover bad loans.

The Bank of Lithuania suspended the operationsof the banks and froze their assets, accusing them of insolvency.The two banks which had been set to merge - Litimpeks and theLithuanian Incorporated Innovation Bank (LAIB) - are now at the centreof an insolvency and fraud investigation.The reasons for the insolvency of the Lithuanian Joint-Stock InnovationBank and Litimpeks banks are being investigated. International auditcompany Ernst & Young is performing an audit in these two banks," saida Bank of Lithuania statement.The suspensions and investigation have had a serious knock-on effect onthe rest of the banking sector with fears of a run on bank deposits.On January 9, the government and the Central Bank issued a statementsaying most of the commercial banks were operating normally andadvising people to ignore rumours about the instability of certainbanks. It also urged them not to withdraw deposits from commercialbanks and said that banks were not experiencing difficulties withpayments to customers.Reports in early January suggested that many Lithuanian commercialbanks had started to run out of hard currency as depositors rushed towithdraw funds following the suspension of the two banks. Depositors,fearing a devaluation of the national currency, the litas, queued atmajor banks to withdraw hard currency from their accounts.One report said the demand for US dollars increased tenfold since thecrisis broke, while another said hard currency deposits had dropped by22 percent and individual deposits by 16 percent. But the governmentand the central bank ruled out a devaluation.However, both the Prime Minister and the President promised state aidfor personal and corporate account holders of the two suspended banksand said the government will assume liability for their deposits.The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, passed a law on December 21bringing in a mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investorsagainst lost bank deposits.Lithuanian politics were also thrown into chaos by the crisis when theforeign minister and defence minister resigned in protest against PrimeMinister Adolfas Slezevicius's move to withdraw deposits from hisaccounts in the LAIB just days before its operations were suspended.President Algirdas Brazaukas, however, refused to accept the ministers'resignations. Slezevicius maintained he did nothing wrong and said hewould stay in office despite some calls for his resignation.There were also calls for the resignation of Central Bank GovernorKazys Ratkevicius. His resignation on January 9 was not accepted by thegovernment which felt it could cause more instability in the bankingsector. Ratkevicius rejected charges that the Central Bank had notexercised sufficient control over the activities of commercial banks.On January 12, a joint mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and the World Bank met with the Prime Minister, the finance ministerand the chairman of the Bank of Lithuania.Originally, the aim of the mission had been to evaluate the economicstate of the country. But following the crisis, it is now investigatingthe reasons behind the problems of the two banks. Together withofficials from the Bank of Lithuania, it will prepare a programme toovercome the difficulties in the banking system.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The amendment enablesthe creation of "managerial funds", which may hold majority stakes incompanies. The law, and related investment activity, is spelling a boomfor local investment banks.Voucher privatisation funds can now be converted into more aggressiveand predatory managerial funds, but only if they buy out dissentingprivatisation fund shareholders at a price equal to or above net assetvalue. That may help to reduce the massive discounts of up to 50percent at which most privatisation funds are trading.The amendment, approved by the Czech government in early January, ispartly in response to a sudden rise in mergers and acquisitions in themarket, which CS First Boston head of equity sales Peter Mayer called"a feeding frenzy".Recent corporate raids have included a $200 million shopping spree byBahamas-based US businessman Michael Dingman, with help from leadingCzech fund manager Viktor Kozeny, targeting a handful of blue chipcompanies in late 1995 (see EEB 58). The pair were closely followed bya flurry of stockmarket deals involving Motoinvest, a private firmoperating through Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, both of whichMotoinvest now controls.Motoinvest snapped up millions of discounted shares in theprivatisation funds run by the leading Czech banks, and later sold themback at a substantial profit. Komercni Banka's fund has now swallowed apoison pill to help prevent a similar raid in future. Motoinvest roseto fame by buying up heavily discounted small privatisation funds andselling their assets at a large profit.In December, Motoinvest bought the Czech privatisation fund managementoperations of Creditanstalt, one of the most popular fund managers inthe first wave of voucher privatisation. Other merger and acquisitionactivity in December included a deal by leading privatisation fundmanager Ceska Sporitelna to sell 40 percent of its two voucher funds toBankers Trust for CK6.7 billion ($252 million) - a discount of morethan 40 percent on their net asset value.Tomas Fiala, investment funds analyst at Czech stockbroker Wood & Co,said the level and scope of such financial activity may eventually becurbed by securities legislation which was proposed alongside the newinvestment funds law. The government rejected details of some of theproposals, including provisions to protect small shareholders bysetting ownership limits beyond which corporate raiders would be forcedto make a takeover bid for an entire company. Fiala said the proposalshave gone back to the drawing board but are likely to be approved byparliament after the general election in October.Fiala said the approved changes to the law on investment funds mayimprove the impact of the post-communist privatisation process uponCzech industry, since portfolio investors may now officially takeeffective control of their investments for the first time.Privatisation funds are prohibited from owning 20 percent of any singlecompany and therefore are forced to work together to achieve managerialcontrol of companies and effect operational changes. The concept ofactive management is not universally accepted and stirred controversywhen some fund managers endeavoured to"tamper" with their investments.Even so, privatisation investment funds own the bulk of shares in Czechindustry, and the result has been a slow start to economic reform inthe private sector. Some analysts claim the privatisation funds run bybanks, which are among the largest in the country, are especially toblame for the lack of commercial reform, since many own shares incompanies which are major clients of the banks, and the banks exertpressure to prevent major changes in their clients' activities.The new draft law allows the investment fund managers to manage pensionfunds for the first time. Its most likely impact is to help fundmanagers reduce costs by merging their separate management teams. Afterone year of pensions legislation, the major banks and insurancecompanies and the leading employers have already established 35 pensionfunds. Government authorities expect the total to reach a maximum of 45before shrinking as market forces dictate rationalisation and mergers.All funds will also face more stringent reporting requirements.Penalties for non-compliance are also much stiffer, at a maximum ofCK10 million plus the possibility of suspension, forced administrationand the replacement of management by finance ministry regulators.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Apoll in June by the Factum agency found 20 percent of Czechs wereparticipating in pension funds and a further 21 percent were thinkingabout it. A Social Affairs Ministry spokesman said the number ofparticipants was at the higher end of estimates. The Ministry expectsthe total number of funds to reach at least 45 this year, but due tocompetition and the lack of immediate profitability, the number isexpected to consolidate.Some pension schemes have fewer than 5,000 participants, and the figureof 100,000 participants is exceeded in only three cases: Penzijni FondKomercni Banky, Podnikatelsky PF and Vojensky Otvreny Fond.

Worstperformers are the Commercial and Credit Bank (Kereskedelmi Bank andthe Hungarian Credit Bank (Magyar Hitel Bank).Last July Thomson BankWatch acquired Bank Research Eastern Europe(BREE), a bank rating agency specialising in providing research on eastand central European financial institutions. The Hungarian ratings arethe first BREE ratings to be converted to the BankWatch scale. Intra-country (IC) issuer ratings reflect a combination of pure credit riskand performance risk, and offer a relative indication of the likelihoodof receiving timely repayment of principal and interest as well as anopinion regarding the company's vulnerability to negative events thatmay alter the market's perception of the bank.The ratings use a nine-point scale ranging from IC-A for banks withexceptionally strong fundamentals, representing low-risk, to IC-E forbanks whose viability is in doubt. The nine-point scale is IC-A, IC-A/B, IC-B, IC-B/C, IC-C, IC-C/C, IC-D, IC-D/E, EC-E.Short-term debt ratings apply specifically to local currencyobligations. The ratings range from LC-1, indicating a very highlikelihood that interest and principal will be paid on a timely basis,to LC-4, which is considered speculative. The four-point scale is LC-1,LC-2, LC-3 and LC-4.BankWatch uses a rating methodology which involves a thorough analysisof both financial as well as qualitative factors. Emphasis is placed onmanagement, market position, ownership, the local environment andstrategic initiatives. Extensive on-site due diligence is conducted onan annual basis."For Hungarian banks, the environment has been extremely challengingover the last several years. Delayed bad debt work- outs, under-investment in modern systems and few sophisticated services in anineffective regulatory environment have all hampered the restructuringprocess in the banking sector," explained Ramin Habibi, president ofThomson BankWatch-BREE.As in other eastern European countries, Hungarian state-owned banksinherited a huge volume of bad loans from the old economic system.Major reforms were initiated in 1987 with the introduction of a two-tier system. However, Hungary's massive foreign debt burden held backthe state from cleaning its banks' portfolios as quickly as inneighbouring countries. Since then, state-owned banks have beenrecapitalised along BIS norms, and bad loans have been swapped for long-term state bonds under the Loan and Consolidation schemes initiated in1992 and completed at the end of 1994."While much improved, asset quality remains an issue," said Habibi."The fragmentation of supervisory responsibilities has impededeffective regulations. Hungary's unique situation has given foreign andjoint-venture bonds an unprecedented opportunity to penetrate thedomestic market. Such intensified competition has fostered a newrapidly evolving environment, with local management becoming much moreclient- oriented and responsive to market needs."Overall, much progress has been made to establish a well- functioningfinancial system - one that can operate without the support of thegovernment, but there still is a difficult road ahead."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE PROSPECTS ARE GOODEastern Europe, though still a drop in the ocean in terms of worldinsurance premiums, is a rapidly growing market. In the first part of amajor survey, EEB reports on the state of the industry in countries ofeastern central Europe.AFTER YEARS of reforms the turnaround in the insurance industry ineastern Europe appears to have begun. Despite the fact that the worldmarket share of the region amounts to less than 1 percent and theinsurance industry is still extremely under- developed, the prospectsare good.Clearly-defined rights of ownership and privatisation of the economyare of the utmost importance for the insurance industry, according to a1995 report by Economic Studies Unit of Swiss Reinsurance Company(Swiss Re). An important indicator for progress in this area, it said,is the private sector's share in total production which, in mostcountries, rose to over 50 percent by the middle of 1994.But, it added, insurance penetration - the proportion of income spenton insurance policies - is still quite low throughout the region,ranging from 3.4 percent in Slovenia to just 0.3 percent in Romania.In Slovenia, incomes and insurance penetration stand at around half theEU average, and in the other eastern central European countries atabout one-third. The low penetration could be attributed to the factthat in the first few years of the changeover to a market economy,premium income fell in most countries.The year 1993 appears to have been a watershed for insurers in easternEurope. The falling rates of inflation, the economic upturn and theturnaround to sustained real growth in premium have been having apositive effect on the insurance industry since 1993. The volume ofpremiums in the region increased by an average of 8 percent comparedwith the previous year. Worldwide, growth stood at 6 percent. Premiumvolume continues to grow at a faster rate than on the world market as awhole.The countries of eastern central Europe accounted for 62 percent oftotal premium volume in 1993, with Poland the most important singlemarket. However, in 1994, Russia replaced Poland as eastern and centralEurope's biggest single market. But Swiss Re noted that, apart from inPoland and Slovenia, it has not yet been possible for eastern Europeancountries to make up for the sharp downturn in insurance activity whichoccurred in the first few years of the transition to a market economy.Life insurance has shown the highest growth in most countries. However,it is also exceptionally underdeveloped, accounting for just 25 percentof premium volume in 1993 against the European Union average of 50percent. The decline in economic activity resulting from the changeoverto a market economy affected life insurance more than it did non-lifeinsurance, according to Swiss Re. Only in Poland and Slovenia was thereany increase in the initially very low level of life insurance, itsaid.In 1993, the life insurance sector in eastern central Europe began toexperience strong growth. Provided inflation rates continue to fall andthere are improved investment opportunities on the developing capitalmarkets and tax incentives for private provision for old age, the lifeinsurance sector should also see above-average growth in the yearsahead as levels of prosperity rise, according to Swiss Re.In the non-life sector, motor insurance is expected to dominate. Marineinsurance has also helped to push up growth in non-life business. Butmotor insurance is expected to continue to account for 40 percent-50percent of this sector, in line with traditional developing marketgrowth patterns, until rising prosperity levels make for more diversedemand.General third-party liability insurance is also projected to growsignificantly. Indeed, in contrast to western Europe, it couldinitially outstrip personal accident and health cover, a segmenttraditionally more than twice as large as liability. Agriculturalinsurances, which were very prevalent when reforms began have fallenoff considerably and their importance looks set to decline evenfurther, especially in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.But reinsurance rather than insurance is likely to grab much of thelimelight until eastern European countries are in a position to raiseminimum capital requirements. These are still being kept precariouslylow due to the structural weakness of the insurance sector and the lackof capital.Under these conditions, reinsurance is of the utmost importance forsafeguarding solvency, said Swiss Re, both by providing support to newprivate companies during the process of growth and by helping with therestructuring of the former monopoly companies, which often do not havean adequate capital base.That leaves reinsurers, especially foreign ones, in a strong positionto tap a regional market which hands over 5 percent more than theEuropean Union's average of 17 percent of non-life insurance toreinsurance. Most countries are eager for foreign reinsurers to take onthe secondary insurance market that no local players are willing orprepared to supply adequately.The progress of the past five years has also been helped by the reformsin the regulatory framework of the various countries and the enactmentand enforcement of supervisory laws. Different approaches have beentaken by different countries - Poland's market is highly deregulatedwith emphasis on financial control and Hungary has substantive controlfor all products.It should be noted that regulations in various countries are still in astate of flux with regulations to be passed or laws completed. Thelegislators in the countries of eastern central Europe have beenstrongly influenced by European Union Directives when draftingregulatory legislation.POLANDAlthough replaced by Russia as the region's biggest single insurancemarket in 1994, Poland's insurance sector continues to grow quickly.Economic development, a decreasing level of inflation and theprogressive adjustment of legal regulations to EU directives creategood opportunities for the insurance sector, according to corporatefinance and advisory services firm Ernst & Young in Warsaw.Among the 41 insurance companies licensed to run insurance businessesin Poland, 13 are conducting life business with the remainder runningnon-life business.In 1993, the Polish market represented 27 percent of the total premiumcollected in eastern Europe. In 1994 all insurance companies jointlycollected a gross premium equal to ZL4.15 billion ($1.75 billion) - 33percent more than in 1993.In the first half of 1995 the gross premium collected in the lifebusiness increased by 40 percent more in comparison with the first halfof 1994, while the gross premium of the non-life business was 21percent more.In 1994, almost 70 percent of premiums were accounted for by generalbusiness with the remainder accounted for by life business.At the beginning of the 1990s, the development of the life productsmarket was rather slow due to high inflation, low average real wagesand the marginal size of the middle classes.The majority of the Polish population had one cheap group lifeinsurance with a very limited level of protection. However, Poland'slife insurance industry enjoyed dramatic growth in 1993 and 1994. Lifeinsurance premiums collected in 1994 were approximately 45 percenthigher than in 1993 and amounted to around $0.6 billion.Taking into account that inflation was at 32 percent in 1994, thisrepresents a real increase of about 13 percent. In 1994 the main areasof growth were in group life policies. PZU, the state- owned insurancecompany which still dominates the Polish market, collected premiumsamounting to $500 million, although its market share decreased to 95percent.In the first half of 1995, PZU's market share reduced further to 90.3percent, losing out to foreign insurers Commercial Union (5.2 percent),Amplico (3.9 percent), AGF (0.4 percent) and Nationale-Nederlanden (0.1percent).The continuing development of the life insurance market will depend onthe level of economic growth, inflation trends and changes in thesocial security system and income tax policy, according to Ernst &Young. The following factors will determine the development of the lifeinsurance market in the coming years.1. Unfavourable personal tax treatment of life products. However, theregulation introduced this year allowed the companies to consider lifeinsurance premiums for the first time (paid on behalf of employees) ascompany costs. Life insurance premiums will not be tax deductible inthe short and medium term unless an aggressive lobbying campaign isconducted.2. Further postponement of the social security reform since 1990. InApril 1995, the Council of Ministries presented the draft of the SocialSecurity Act with a new pension system (consisting of a state pension,a social insurance pension and a voluntary pension plan).Realistically, a programme for social security reform could be preparedand approved in 1996. This programme will definitely not be "a shocktherapy", but rather a step-by- step approach, explained Ernst & Young.Regulation concerning close-end funds and pension funds have also beendrafted and will be passed and implemented in 1996. This may startbenefiting the life insurance market by 1997 or 1998.3. VAT on insurance agents' services was implemented in 1995 and had abig impact on agents' incomes. Under pressure from the insurance lobby,tax decreased to 7 percent until the end of 1995. The tax rate for 1996is still unknown.4. The monopoly of PZU and state protectionism. In June 1994, theMinistry of Finance accepted a plan presented by the management of PZUfor its privatisation without turning to the EBRD for a $200 millionloan designated to boost the company's reserves. Under the plan, theMinistry opted to split the PZU into two separate companies. Butfollowing the change in government at the end of 1995, it was decidednot to split the PZU, but to leave the company intact and privatise itin 1996 through the sale of shares to employees, individual investorsand carefully selected institutional investors.5. Low confidence in the financial institutions among the Polishpopulation. Such an attitude was the result of Polish private banks andprivate insurance companies going bankrupt.Ernst & Young said that the economic growth of 1994 points to theresilience of the recovery which was initiated in mid-1992. Theeconomic mechanisms launched a guarantee that the rate of economicgrowth will be kept at 4.5 percent in the 1990s and long-term inflationis showing a gradual downward trend.The annual inflation rate which was 32 percent in 1994 is expected tofall to 10 percent in 1999. Therefore, it can be expected that thedevelopment of the life insurance market will accelerate in the comingyears, said Ernst & Young.Foreign insurers may not open branches in Poland until 1999. However,they may set up separate companies, in full accordance with Polish law,and/or enter into joint ventures with Polish partners. Despite localcompanies facing technical problems, a lack of qualified personnel andlimited solvency, a number of foreign companies are approaching themarket.The most popular distribution channel is the own distribution network,a regional level structure, with branches and sub- branches orrepresentative offices. The number of independent brokers and agents isgrowing, with around 600 brokers now licensed in the country.According to Ernst & Young, co-operation between different insurancecompanies and Polish banks is expected to grow with the increasingacceptance of the idea of bancassurance and the fact that most of theforeign companies created joint-ventures with Polish banks when theyentered the Polish market.A law on insurance activities was passed in July 1990. However, due tothe rapid development of the market, much-needed changes wereimplemented with the Insurance Act in October 1995. Ernst & Young saidthat these changes had the following objectives:* Increase the compatibility to EU directives;* Better protection of the insured by increasing the financialrequirements of companies applying for an insurance licence as wellexisting insurers. In particular, the share capital for insurersentering the market, should equal the minimum guarantee capital(Ecu800,000 for life business or Ecu200,000-Ecu400,000)* Increasing and clearly defining the power of insurance supervisionwhich will control insurers, brokers and agents. An independent Officeof Insurance Supervision (OIS) will be established. At present,insurance supervision is part of the Ministry of Finance.* Re-drafting all the provisions unclear in the former insurance law -in particular, the licensing rules for new insurers and requirementswith respect to actuaries will be described in more detail.* Clearly defining the rights and obligations of insurance brokers.These provisions are based on recent EU directives.The Ministry of Finance must issue a licence for a company to set up aninsurance business. A company may not issue both life and non-lifepolicies. Neither can they engage in other non-insurance business. Theycan only operate as joint-stock or mutual companies.There are strict guidelines regulating reserve capital, contingencyfunds compensation in the case of a lack of compulsory insurance (likemotor vehicle third party liability, fire insurance for farmers' realestate, farmers' civil liability). The assets may be invested only inapproved instruments, with some limitation to the portfolio'scomposition.According to Ernst & Young, the Polish Finance Ministry which, for themoment, supervises the insurance sector, is to press for astrengthening of the capital base of Polish insurance companies. Inorder to prepare domestic companies for direct foreign competition inthe domestic market after 1999, foreign companies who want to enter thePolish market are strongly encouraged to merge with small Polishinsurance companies.HUNGARYThe Hungarian parliament passed a new insurance law in 1995 which cameinto effect on January 1 this year. All newcomers to the insurancemarket must set up separate life and non-life companies. The 14existing insurance companies will not be forced to establish newcompanies but will be obliged to clearly separate accounting andmanagement structures for each sector.Insurance companies will also face new minimum capital requirementswith the introduction of the distinction between organisational andsecurity capital, distinguishing between operational and businesscommitments.The new legislation also modifies the supervisory environment,eliminating the need for permits for non-life products. The existingState Insurance Supervision (ABIF) agency's remit will cover ensuringcompliance with legislation, rights protection for insurance companyclients, monitoring of applications by insurers and supervision ofcompanies' financial status and investment procedures.Life insurance start-ups must continue to obtain permits for theirproducts and have initial security capital of at least HUF250 million($1.8 million). New non-life operations will be required to havesecurity capital of at least HUF150 million and up to HUF70 millionmore for certain categories of product.Although foreign insurers are admitted only by the establishment ofsubsidiary companies or through participation, the market is dominatedby outsiders.Allianz is reportedly in negotiations with state privatisation agencyAPV to sell the German group the remaining 9.2 percent public stake inlocal non-life leader Hungaria. Allianz has already built up a 90percent holding in Hungaria, which own 0.8 percent of its own stock.CZECH REPUBLICThe implementation of a new insurance law has been in the pipeline forsome time as the current law dates back to May 1991. In any new law,solvency regulations are intended to be in accordance with EuropeanUnion directives.Insurance penetration in the Czech Republic is around 2.5 percent andlike other eastern central European countries is growing. Motorliability and occupational accident insurance is compulsory.There are no limits on the establishment of foreign insurers but cross-border services are not permitted. Germany's Allianz and Italy'sGenerali both denied speculation recently that they were interested inbecoming strategic investors in the Czech insurance giant CeskaPojistovna in which private fund manager PPF (Privni Privatizacni Fond)recently bought a 12 percent stake.Both already have domestic Czech insurance operations which althoughmuch smaller are more flexible and able to target the most profitablesectors of the market.PPF bought its 12 percent stake from Ceska Sporitelna, the formermonopoly state savings bank at the end of 1995 and is negotiating withInterbanka, the Hungarian-owned Czech merchant bank, over its 7 percentstake in the insurer.PPF claimed it was a long-term investor and denied it was acting for athird party. But analysts of the insurance industry say PPF is unlikelyto hold its stake for long, but may want to build a sizeable positionand find a strategic investor.Although Ceska Pojistovna is losing market share as the number ofcompetitors swells, it still claims more than 70 percent of the mainsectors such as life and motor insurance, and its revenues are growing.It has raised motor premiums substantially and is lobbying hard for anoverhaul of the compulsory third party sector, in which it is the sole,reluctant provider.Analysts also point to substantial reserves of more than CK64 billion($2.4 billion) and numerous other activities such as fund management aslikely magnets for an investor or strategic partner, either local orforeign.Elsewhere, Czech health insurers were forced to reassess their budgetsin December after most had their business plans for 1996 rejected bythe government.Only five of 27 insurers got a clean bill of health under a tough newgovernment fitness regime. In an effort to spruce up the industry, thegovernment has demanded that health insurers make more realistic incomeforecasts and keep administration costs under 7 percent of revenues.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus estimated that seven of the rejectedinsurers should have no trouble getting in shape by their secondattempt in January, but that still leaves 15 insurers on the criticallist.As a result, a rash of mergers is likely to break out among the smallerfunds. But such mergers will not be easy, due to a list of problemsincluding long-standing debts to hospitals and doctors and difficultieswinning projected volumes of clientele."The system has many childhood diseases," said Frantisek Beranek,general director of insurer Vojenska Pojistovna, referring to the factthat the first health fund was established only in 1993. Vojenska hadits own plans rejected, but Beranek was confident of winning on appealafter its accountants gave it a more thorough check-up.The insurers' woes reflect the dismal state of the Czech healthindustry, beset by increasingly volatile labour relations and blatantover-billing by under-paid doctors. Insurers owe more than CK5 billionto health providers. But even if they can pay their bills, they areoften too busy investigating claims of unnecessary treatment by doctorswho are paid per consultation.Challenging claims is the insurers' responsibility and their onlychance to improve profitability in an industry where both premiums andthe cost of services are set by the government.Czech health sector costs have risen from 5 percent of GDP in 1992 tothe current level of 8 percent and the government is struggling to finda solution. It is considering a range of plans including mandating asingle agency to collect all revenues and limiting the scope of allother insurers to offering only supplementary medical services.If the government does choose radical surgery, the quickest recoverymay be made by the General Health Insurance Company. It was the firstto start business and it now insures 6.7 million people - well overthan half of the country.SLOVAKIAInsurance operations in Slovakia are governed by the insurance law ofDecember 1990 which was implemented in March 1991. Changes to the laware expected to bring solvency regulations in line with EU directives.Branch separation is planned for life and non-life businesses.The minimum capital required to set up a non-life insurer is SK20million-SK30 million ($672,429 - $1,008,640) and SK50 million for lifeinsurers. There have been no limitations on the participation orestablishment of foreign insurers since the beginning of 1992. However,higher deposits are required for foreign establishments. Cross-borderservices are not permitted. Supervision is the responsibility of theMinistry of Finance.SLOVENIAA new insurance law, based on earlier German and Austrian legislation,was passed in October 1995. This succeeded a law which had been inoperation since mid November 1994. However, further changes will beneeded to bring Slovenian law in line with European Union regulations."This law should last for about two or three years, but it must changeto open the market and align it with the EU. But Slovenian insurers arestill not prepared for competition," explained Dr Miro Koncina of ITEOmanagement consultants in Ljubljana.Under the law, a guarantee fund has been established for insurancecompanies consisting of DM1.5 million ($1.04 million) for life insurersand the same for property casualty insurers. Supervision is carried outby the Ministry of Finance. There is no branch separation between lifeand non-life business, although separate accounting is required.Majority participation by foreign insurers is possible, although thisis not the case in reinsurance companies. Foreign insurers must beregistered in Slovenia to operate there and cannot sell products fromabroad into the country.Insurance penetration, while quite low by European Union standards, isthe highest in eastern central Europe at around 3 percent-4 percent orDM800 million-DM900 million in premium volume. The market is continuingto grow strongly, according to Koncina, but needs to reach a premiumvolume of DM1.5 billion.He concedes that the process of changing people's attitudes isdifficult. "The difficulty is that people are still waiting for statesocial insurance," he said."We are in transition. We have a middleclass with money. We must spread this capital and this involveschanging tradition and culture. It is a process and it is changing."The proximity of Slovenia to EU countries like Italy, Germany andAustria is making this process of education easier, he said.Former state monopolies still hold around 60 percent of the totalinsurance market with the rest held by small independent companies andjoint ventures between Western and local firms.In the second part of the insurance survey EEB will report on themarkets of Bulgaria and Romania, and Russia, Ukraine and Estonia.Eastern Central Europe - Premium Volumes (1994)                Premium       Population                volume in     in          Insurance   InsuranceCountry         millions US$  millions    density(1)  penetration(2)Poland          1,806         38.60       46.78       1.91%Slovakia          287          5.35       53.57       2.30%Czech Republic    981         10.33       94.94       2.82%Hungary           885         10.29       86.01       2.09%(1) Premium per capita in US$(2) Premiums as % of Gross Domestic ProductSource: National associations and insurace supervisory authorities;WIIW; Swiss Re.Insurance in eastern EuropePOLANDMarket Structure:       36 companies (26 Non-Life, 10 Life)                        Market share of the 3 biggest companies                        1993 (1994)                        Non-Life:                 86.4%     82.8%                        - PZU                     65.7%     61.0%                        - Warta                   18.1%     19.0%                        - Polisa                   2.7%      3.0%                        Life:                    100%      100%                        - PZU Life                99.2%     95.1%                        - Commercial Union         0.4%      2.9%                        - Amplico                  0.4%      2.0%                        Market share of foreign insurers(2):                        Non-Life:                 <1%       <2%                        Life:                     <1%        4.9%Insurance law and       Law on insurance activities as of 28 Julysupervision:            1990 with various amendments and                        supplementary regulations.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEAST EUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FEELING AT HOMEIt has been a hard five years, but western accounting firms arestarting to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reportsIT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, andonly now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients towestern fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with thelocal Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to dobusiness. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keepingcontrol of that growth and turning it into profits is a differentmatter.Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, withfiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking evencurrently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according tomanaging partner Duleep Aluwihare."We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some ofour more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage tocontinue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run outof investment opportunities."Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one ofthe few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although itplans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice orCracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In orderto set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going tomaintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve inthis marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticketitems," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basicwork, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clientsinclude Poland's finance ministry.Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrandand Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived inPoland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess whenthe firm should start making a profit.Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking last July before returningto the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're not justhere for a financial return on investment, we're here to make sure thatCoopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking atopening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of themarket, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firmhas acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bankand of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successesinclude the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, whichraised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing groupOkocim.PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgetedto start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After fiveyears in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-nationalcompany investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growthis running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where thefirm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clientsinclude Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatisedBank Gdanski.Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some timeare KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche."We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner BillDrysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where weare largely self-sufficient."Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at BarentsGroup, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of newclients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firmrecently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run itsGerman practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have afully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said."Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics groupSiemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polishclients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurancecompanies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices inCracow and Poznan during the last year.At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits getsshort shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm hasalways been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financialsupport from outside, other than very small amounts. All the otherfirms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they haveX amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of itsrivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw andSzczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is aheadache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line."Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It'sdifficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated intoa corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standardsright way."E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as muchbusiness as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when ithired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T."These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speakonly with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Oftenyou'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,all the rest will follow."The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in thePolish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is thesmallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strongposition in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firmtook action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz ashead of the Polish business. Leslaw Paga was head of the PolishSecurities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is surethat Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitelyenhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said."There have been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its positionin Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industriesand service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong positionin financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say wewere latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"he explained.Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bankand of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's 64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in thebanking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk andCracow during 1995.Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four othermid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co- ordinatingpartner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "thesort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging withanother firm.He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name theprospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to anothernetwork. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we arelooking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with aheavy UK or English language capability," he said.Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switchedinternational affiliations from CKL International to Alliott PeirsonInternational during 1995. Baltic Accountants continues to alsorepresent RSM International and GMN International.The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issuefor many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firmslike to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to localclients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing inPolish equity partners than others.Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firmholding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and USaffiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has beengiven the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, whileKPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managedfirm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly-owned by Deloitte ToucheTohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent fromthe start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the localpractices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agreethat fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gapbetween what western firms are charging and what local clients arewilling to pay is narrowing.One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment mustpay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet themarket half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper localfirms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it firstarrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in"strategic situations".Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of awestern-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came intoeffect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accountingprocedures more into line with International Accounting Standards andto move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on taxcompliance.Another area where western accountants are making more encouragingnoises is in relations between the international firms and the localChamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when thechamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted tothe chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners thatPoland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shuttingnew blood out of the profession.Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences beingmended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciaksaid. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of coursethere will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bitfrightening to them."While the situation regarding audit training and exams remainsunacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamberwill rethink its approach.Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous inadmitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems tohave gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably bereviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said."And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all partof the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make surethe chamber is a strong and active body."Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and thatthe growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feelsthat this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We allexperience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."Poland: Key economic indicators                                      1994      1995*     1996*GDP real (% change)                    5.1       6.0       5.0Industrial output (% change)          11.9      12.0      11.0Inflation (% change)                    32        29        22Unemployment rate (%)                 16.0      14.6      14.0Average monthly wages (ZL/month)       460       620       780Trade balance ($/M)                   -836    -1,000    -1,500Current account ($/M)                 -944    -1,400    -1,900Exchange rate (ZL/$)                  2.27      2.50      2.85* Forecast Source: CreditanstaltLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND- FEE SPLIT (%)                                               CorporateFirm                    Audit Accounting Tax   fincance  MAS  OtherArthur Andersen(1)      40     -         20    15        15    10(2)KPMG                    50     -         20(2) 15        15     -Ernst & Young           33    17         33     -        17     -Price Waterhouse        43(3)  -         33(2)  -        24(4)  -BDO Binder              86     2          5     2         4     1Interexpert Poland      25    45         20     -         -   105Arnold Hill             40    20          5     -        35     -Staniszewski & Richter  60     -         30     -        10     -PNA Audit-Union         25    25         22     -         8    20(1) Figures do not include Andersen Consulting(2) Includes legal(3) Includes accountancy(4) Includes corporate finance(5) Includes consultingSource: International Accounting BulletinLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND RANKED BY TOTALSTAFF                                       Number of Number of                   Number    Number    charge-   admini-                   of        of        able      strative  Total                   offices   partners  staff     staff     staff                   1994 1995 1994 1995 1994 1995 1994 1995 1994 1995Ernst & Young(1)     5    6    7    8  139  314   50   58  196  380Coopers & Lybrand    2    2    9   11  127  174   64   66  200  251Arthur Andersen(2)   1    1    7    7  n/a  200  n/a   40  n/a  247Price Waterhouse     1    1    5    6  120  161   54   44  179  211KPMG                 1    3    7    8   97  162   21   30  125  200Deloitte & Touche    3    4    6    6  124  144   20   27  150  177Misters Audytor    n/a    3  n/a    6  n/a   44  n/a   11  n/a   61Sadren             n/a    1  n/a    3  n/a   37  n/a    4  n/a   44TG Consultants     n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a   34  n/a    4  n/a   40Rodl & Partner     n/a    3  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a  n/a   22   36BDO Binder           1    2    3    4   15   20    6    7   24   31Moore Stephens - RIR Revision        1    3    1    2    4   26    1    2    6   30Potworowski Kinast   1    1    2    2   16   24    3    3   21   29Interexpert Poland   1    1    5  n/a   18  n/a    3  n/a   26  n/aBRA Salustro Reydel            n/a    1  n/a    1  n/a   17  n/a    2  n/a   20Arnold Hill          1    1    1    1   12   12    2    3   15   16Tax-Audytor        n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a    9  n/a    3  n/a   14Baltic Accountants and Consultants     1    1    1    1    9    9    2    2   12   12Staniszewski & Richter           n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a    4  n/a    1  n/a    7PNA Audit-Union    n/a    1  n/a    1  n/a    2  n/a    1  n/a    4(1) Figures refer to Sep 94 and Sep 95(2) Figures do not include Andersen Consultingn/a = not availableSource: International Accounting BulletinLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND- WHO'S WHOArnold Hill (HLB)ul.

Sources predict non-discriminatory ATM surcharges will be thebanking issue of 1996 as financial services providers try aggressivelyto reap profits from alternative delivery methods.     No national EFT network allowed its members to surcharge prior to1996.  However, 14 state legislatures passed laws prohibiting suchrestrictions.     Visa's PLUS ATM network will allow its members to surcharge onApril 1, 1996, and many regional EFT networks have lifted theirsurcharge bans.      MasterCard's Cirrus network has not lifted its surcharge ban anda company spokesperson said it does not plan to change its position.     The Wilmington, Del.-based MAC EFT network, the second-largestregional network in the  country, said last month that it will allowsurcharging in 1996.Competitive Pressure     Many financial institutions and other third-party ATM owners suchas Plano, Texas-based EDS and Dallas-based Affiliated ComputerServices, claim they cannot support the cost of placing ATMs in low-volume transaction areas without a surcharge.  However, consumergroups say surcharging is just another means for banks to add to theirrecord profits.     The networks receive no money from the surcharge.  Surchargerevenue goes directly to the ATM owner.  Banks claim they needsurcharges to compete with third-party ATM owners such as EDS andAffiliated Computer Services (ACS), which negotiate contracts withcasinos and malls.       Some bank executives said EDS and ACS can outbid financialinstitutions for these contracts because they offer the retailers acut of the surcharge.     "A lot of pressure is on banks to surcharge even if they arephilosophically opposed to it," said Joseph Pendleton III, senior vicepresident of electronic banking for Wyomissing, Pa.-based MeridianBank.  "If they don't [surcharge], they will not be able to manage anoff-premise program with significant value."Who Wants the Surcharges?     The non-financial ATM owners are not so sure financialinstitutions are really opposed to surcharges.      One ATM owner suggested banks may be hiding behind the third-party ATM owners to avoid public outrage.     "We are in favor of surcharging and believe it will give us theability to deploy more ATMs," said T.A. "Kip" Hyde Jr., a director ofEFT development for ACS.  "As far as people like us and EDS pushingit, that is not entirely true.  Banks are learning that in off-premiseATM sites, there is only a certain [limit] to the expenses you canbury in marketing costs."    ACS surcharges range from $.50 at convenience stores to $2 atcasinos in its 4,100-ATM MoneyMaker Network.  EDS charges from $.25 to$1 at approximately 10 percent of its 5,800 ATMs, according to companyspokesperson Carol Winters.    Consumer interest groups don't believe the claim that remote ATMscost too much to run.  "Banks are already able to save billions inteller and branch costs with ATMs and they are already generatingbillions in fees," said Janice Shields, a banking researcher for theWashington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of Responsive Law (CSRL). "Now, we are just adding more profit to the top."    According to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) -- anaffiliate of CSRL -- ATM transactions generated more than $2.55billion in fees, while saving banks $2.34 billion in teller costs in1993, the last year for which such figures have been compiled.  TheCFA claims more than $.78 in profits was generated for every dollarcollected from consumers for ATM services.    With consumers being charged for using an ATM not owned by theirbank and then having a surcharge added on top of that, shouldn't theindustry be concerned that transaction volumes will decrease?    The majority of the machines with surcharges exceeding $1 will beplaced in areas where the consumer desperately needs the money andwill pay for convenience, ATM owners said.  For example, highway restareas and casinos present prime surcharging opportunities.A Transaction Drop?    New Orleans-based GulfNet EFT Network has allowed its members tolevy surcharges because the Louisiana and Mississippi legislaturesoverruled the mandate of the national networks.  However, DelTonguette, president of GulfNet, said transaction volume has not beenaffected by the surcharges.     Nearly 87 percent of GulfNet's 4,000 ATMs carry member surchargesand Tonguette said pricing has not been an issue.  He claims setting afair and equitable surcharge is easily determined by the consumer. ATM owners who charge too much will quickly lose transaction volume.    "I am gratified to see at least Visa has seen the light.  Oneprediction that I can make is that MasterCard and all of itssubsidiaries will follow suit," said Tonguette, who has been a staunchproponent of surcharging.    The MAC Network, which is owned by Wilmington, Del.-basedElectronic Payment Services (EPS), admits it is not exactly sure whateffect surcharging will have on transaction volume, but it does notbelieve it will inhibit growth.    "A lot of discussion and consideration [went into our decision],"said Barbara Link, an EPS spokesperson.  "It is difficult to sayexactly what surcharging will mean.  Certainly, the banks would liketo have a lot of say [in determining whether surcharging is prudent]."    Reston, Va.-based Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA)has not taken a position on surcharging because it claims members aredivided on the topic.  Consequently, the EFTA has not lobbied any ofthe national or regional networks to lift the surcharge bans.   However, Kurt Helwig, executive director of the EFTA, said EDS hasvocally supported surcharging, while other financial institutions haveopposed it.  Helwig understands both sides of the argument:  "This isyet another issue we cannot take a position on.  [However,] to date,studies have shown consumers are willing to pay for convenience ...[But] ATM owners have to be smart about pricing because the consumer isgoing to decide this marketplace."Government Intervention    As banks begin to learn how much consumers will pay for theconvenience of remote ATM services, it appears ATM owners will nothave to worry about scrutiny from Capitol Hill.  According to Shieldsof the CSRL, "consumers don't exactly have a good Congress for[surcharge reform] now.  It is not a good legislative climate to tapATM fees."    The CSRL is working with representatives in Washington to draftlegislation that would require disclosure of fees before a transactionis completed.    Despite the push for surcharges, fees are not the only answer toincreasing ATM installation and maintenance costs.  EDS's Winters saidATM owners can lower their costs by offering more services, such asstamps, event tickets, calling card vouchers and travelers checks. These services can require the bulk of the surcharges, while ATMactivity is left relatively untouched.  (Kurt Helwig, EFTA, 703/435-9800; T.A.

Back to Headline List CopyrightEFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996PROPRIETARY SMART CARD PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE STEADY GROWTH IN 1996Smart cards will continue to gain market share this year, but theirgrowth still will fall short of the explosion enthusiasts seek. Millions of smart cards will be issued this year; however, themajority of them will be used in closed systems such as collegecampuses or large business headquarters, according to Basil Bromberg,president of Dallas-based smart-card consultancy Smart Cards USA.    "The big open systems are all waiting for a bank to issue [smart]cards," said Bromberg.  "Niche systems will develop more quickly. After that, the shared smart card will [arrive].  For instance, atransportation industry may link with a school [identification card]where the [bus company] can buy some of the memory on the I.D. and thekids can use the card to pay for the bus."Sports Stored Value    The eyes of the financial services industry will be on theVisa/First Union smart card pilot at the Atlanta Summer Olympics thissummer.  Visa and First Union plan to launch more than 1 million smartcards in an open system pilot.    Bromberg called the pilot a glorified closed project.  "It isonly a large- scale show, really," said Bromberg.  "It is an accesscard.  It is nice.  It is no great brainstormer.  The trouble is thatonce the Olympics are over, all you have is a souvenir."    It is easier for the banks to see the profitability of a closedsystem at this point in the smart card's development.  The bank wouldmake money in a proprietary system by sponsoring the transactionhandling and money transfer.    The specialized sport stored-value card, as employed by theNational Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars, will continue to gainmomentum.  The Jaguars have issued stored value cards that can only beused inside the stadium to purchase refreshments or souvenirs.    "That is going to take off like a rocket," said Joseph PendletonIII, senior vice president of electronic banking at Wyomissing, Pa.-based Meridian Bank.

Back to Headline List CopyrightEFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996NYCE ATM NETWORK BUILDS HOME BANKING PLATFORMThe NYCE EFT network said it is ready to expand into home banking andtake advantage of the largest single opportunity for EFT transaction-building.  As a result, it could pose a challenge to industrymainstays MasterCard, Online Resources, Servantis and Visa.    NYCE, the largest EFT provider in the Northeast and a subsidiaryof Hackensack, N.J.-based Infinet Payment Services, invested at least$2 million in creating a bank-branded home banking and electroniccommerce services platform, according to NYCE President and CEORichard Yanek.    The main goal of the platform is to create a single interface forNYCE members to access customer financial institution information fromany personal financial management (PFM) software product and anyaccess device.    Without NYCE or another commercial interface, if a bank wants toallow its customers to use PFM software from Intuit's Quicken, Meca'sManaging Your Money or Microsoft Money, the institution must build aseparate interface to each vendor.  NYCE will manage the interfacesand act as a translator so the bank's customer information will lookthe same regardless of the customer's means of access.    Three to four institutions of various sizes will begin pilotingthe NYCE product in the second quarter of 1996, Yanek said.  Theproduct should be commercially available to NYCE's 1,200 memberinstitutions by the end of 1996.      "We tend to think of this [product] as a transporter translator,"said Yanek.  "What comes through to the bank [is the same no matterwhat the PFM software].  We already have the pipeline [to the banks]. And, very importantly, think of the cost of implementing such asystem.  We are spending a substantial amount of money.  But it isminuscule compared to what an institution would have to spendindividually."    NYCE is negotiating with "all of the providers on the markettoday," Yanek said.    New York-based MasterCard, Reston, Va.-based Online Resources,Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis and San Francisco-based Visa startedsimilar home banking "translation" software in the last 12 months. However, Yanek claims NYCE's system will be the only one to be bothon-line and interactive.A Change in Branding Philosophy    All NYCE EFT products carried the NYCE brand prior to homebanking.  Yanek said NYCE has decided to allow the institutions tobrand their home banking offerings.    "With services of this kind, the consumer is operating within thebank.  They are working directly with the bank," said Yanek.  "Hence,there is no need for the NYCE logo.  That contrasts with what existson the marketplace today.  When you sign on with Quicken, you see aroster of all of the Quicken banks.  It is counterproductive.  Whencustomers sign on, they want to see or hear the name of their bank."    What NYCE loses in name recognition, it could gain in transactionvolume and licensing fees.      Yanek predicts that home banking transactions will buildgradually, and by the end of the century, each home banking householdwill complete approximately 24 transactions per month.  Currently,each ATM cardholder performs an average of one transaction per month.    In addition, NYCE plans to license and offer equity in theproduct to other large EFT networks.  Yanek said preliminarydiscussions have begun, but don't expect small networks to join thehome banking mix just yet.    "Small networks will not venture unless it is free-ride," saidNew Orleans- based GulfNet EFT Network President Del Tonguette. "Offering home banking is fine with me as long as [someone else] paysfor the expensive startup."    Omaha, Neb.-based bill-payment provider SmartPay paid all of thecommunications and hookup costs to link GulfNet member banks HancockBank and Jefferson Guarantee.  The increased transaction volume atthese two banks has been negligible, according to Tonguette.     Tonguette, however, believes home banking will be a very smallpiece of the action through the rest of this century for his company's277 financial institution members.    The future of home banking could be here for large networks likeNYCE.  Before creating the home banking platform, NYCE surveyed itstop 25 banks in addition to 125 other members of various sizes, askingthem to set their priorities from a list of 27 possible productofferings.    Home banking and bill payment services were highest on therequest list from the top 25 banks and second on the list for theremaining banks surveyed.  At the top of their list was enhanced ATMservices.    Financial institutions also want their customers not only tocomplete conventional home banking transactions but also to haveaccess to financial periodicals and the Internet.    "The reality is that [consumers and banks] are desiring somethingmore than home banking," said Yanek.  "A better term is 'electronicfinancial commerce.'  We see a need for something more than a simpleset of transactions."  (Del Tonguette, GulfNet, 504/643-5070; DickYanek, NYCE Network, 201/488-6111.)  Back to Headline List CopyrightEFT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996DIEBOLD EXPANDING INTO ATM MAINTENANCE     Diebold no longer sells only automated teller machines (ATMs). The Canton, Ohio-based company is producing and selling ATM managementsoftware to avoid any loss of revenue if the ATM market becomessaturated and profits flatten.     Many EFT sources predict new ATM sales could decrease sharplyover the next 5 to 10 years.     Interbold, Diebold's ATM joint venture with IBM, holds 55 percentof the U.S. ATM market.     Diebold took its first step into the ATM software managementarena at last month's Bank Administration Institute (BAI) RetailDelivery Conference (RDC) in Atlanta.  Diebold and its partner,Optical Data Systems of Richardson, Texas, have created a newnetworking solution for client-server systems.     The local area network (LAN) hub and ATM-driving software allowsbanks to download programs and change ATM screens in seconds, saidHarry Bosch, Diebold business development manager.     The system can help banks increase uptime because ATMs will nothave to be down as long for changes.  It also can save bank personnelcosts because it eliminates the need to change programs and screens by"sneakernet" -- employees visiting each machine to load software, hesaid.    Additionally, banks can improve marketing efforts because thesystem allows targeted screen changes, Bosch said.  For example, if abank wanted to run a promotion involving a certain chain of grocerystores, the 50-or-so ATMs at that chain can be loaded with aspecialized screen, he added.    In the security arena, Diebold also released an event managementsystem.  The software will identify ATM device failures, analyze thesituation, open a trouble ticket and determine the proper course ofaction without human intervention.  It sends faxes to the owner-bankor beeps a service representative, Bosch said.    InterBold displayed many of its updated machines at the RDC.  Themachines can read and cash checks, print courtesy amounts and givechange.  Updated ATMs also can dispense checkbooks, stamps andtickets.  Interbold's most advanced technology was demonstrated in itsMicroBranch, a sit-down kiosk with touch-screen monitors, dualtelephone handsets and videoconferencing.  The outside walls of thekiosk change from clear to cloudy when occupied for privacy.    Diebold has the right idea in enhancing and expanding its ATMproduct line, said Megan Robertson, a Smith Barney analyst:  "ATMs arecommodity products, so this is a value-added product.  That's theright stuff."    Competitor Fujitsu ICL offers similar enhancements and AT&T'snewest machines offer coupon-printing capabilities. DIEBOLD AT A GLANCEDiebold 5995 Mayfair RoadP.O.

CONTINENTTSB BANK, the UK's eight largest retail bank, has concluded contractualarrangements with Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and Banque Francaisedu Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), which will give the German and Frenchbanks access to the UK clearing system, for low-value cross-borderpayments. Developments are already under way to make the link two-way.Manus Fullerton, head of TSB International, said the deal will allowWestLB and BFCE to make payments to British beneficiaries, whilecomplying with the proposed EC directive on cross-border payments."We are able to fulfil this contract using our existing technology,which is seen by our European partners as offering significant benefitsin building a pan-European payments network," he said. "The otherfactors which came into play were service levels and price . . . Thecombination of TSB's proprietary systems and SWIFT's solution for bulkdata transfer (IFT) has allowed us to develop an innovative andattractive product."WestLB, in turn, has been nominated by the German savings banks astheir agent for sending payments to the UK. At the moment, TSB has seta limit of #10,000 ($15,600) for transfers to the UK, while WestLB hasa limit of DM5,000 ($3,200) for payments to Germany.Alan Gibson, international services manager of TSB's Edinburgh- basedinternational division, said: "There are some technologicaldevelopments taking place to establish our links, so I would not liketo say how much it will cost. We are happy with the investment made dueto the service benefits for our customers and the steps we are takingtowards meeting EU legislation.""We see an expansion of cross-border payments, both within the EU andfurther afield. The proposed EU directive on cross-border payments,which will insist on small payments being made more cheaply and faster,is a challenge which we have anticipated for some time," Fullertonsaid.TSB is discussing similar arrangements with a number of other banks inEurope and further afield. "The cross-border payments system iscontinuing to evolve. This process will develop and gain momentum.Customers will see benefits in terms of improved levels of service,greater product choice and reduced cost", Fullerton added."We are happy with the transfer arrangements", Wolfgang Grauer, managerof international payments at WestLB, told EPI. "We chose TSB becausethey are a well-known bank and we have already worked with them ininternational payments. Since mid-December we have been sending masspayments and it works. Volume is slowly growing."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED STATES:  FEDWIRE TO UPGRADE IN 1997THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors has expanded the format forFedwire funds transfers to be more compatible with the comprehensiveformats used outside the US. It has also pushed back implementationdeadlines to the end of 1997, a year later than previously discussed.In addition to a longer timetable, the Fed last month opted forstaggered-date phase-in, with separate deadlines for send and receivecapabilities. The Fed rejected having all banks switch on the same day,fearing that with 11,000 banks the risk of disruption to the system wastoo great. "We did not believe it was practical to do a one-daycut-over due to our large size," said Louise Roseman, associatedirector of the reserve bank operations and payment systems division.The Board ruled that all banks must be ready to receive the new formatby May 1997 and to send by the end of December. A small number of bankswill be authorised for same-day change over.Expanding the format was first recommended by a task force of theAmerican Bankers' Association, though bankers acknowledged that thecosts of conversion will be very high. The greatest disagreement hasbeen over how and when to implement the changes. The expanded formatwill permit banks to include the names and addresses of transferoriginators and beneficiaries, which are also required under newTreasury regulations.As a result, the format of Fedwire transfers will be more consistentwith those used by the Society for Worldwide Interbank FinancialTelecommunication (SWIFT) and the Clearing House for Interbank PaymentsSystem (CHIPS), operated by the New York Clearing House. From anoperations standpoint, US banks will able to increase automation andfacilitate more end-to-end processing of international transfers."The new format will allow banks to facilitate mapping of transmissionsfrom other transfer systems. It will make Fedwire more consistent withSWIFT and CHIPS, and will allow for more automated mapping without theelimination of any critical payment information," said Roseman.Roseman said some of the highest-volume banks will be authorised tocomplete a same-day change over in June 1997. Smaller banks will havean easy transition since the Fed-provided software will be upgraded forthem. The expanded format was supported by the country's largest banks,particularly those which transact business outside the US through othersystems. "This format will effectively make the Fedwire system morecompatible with other payment systems - SWIFT as well as CHIPS," saidSy Rosen, vice president of payment systems at Citibank."More importantly, it defines fields now that would allow one toeffectively, more directly, translate format messages from othersystems. From the viewpoint of efficiency and automation, it really isa plus," he said."When you have this smaller format, sometimes, when you map from onesystem to another, you can't necessarily map one for one," Rosen said.But with the new, expanded format operations staff will be better ableto translate messages field by field, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED STATES:  PAYMENT BY FAX MADE SECURETWO COMPANIES have developed systems that use computer fax technologyfor secure funds transfer over public telephone networks. The systemtransforms a fax machine into a front-end device for access toautomated clearing houses and financial wire services.MoneyFax, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, holds US and internationalpatents. Parties initiating a transfer are registered with the MoneyFaxsystem and draw a unique item number for each pay order, much like apaper cheque. Transmissions are encrypted and paperless, so theelectronic documents can be stored efficiently.The MoneyFax system, which can be set up at banks or processor datacentres, offers such amenities as image scanning and interactive voiceresponse. It also notifies the sender and receiver by fax whentransmissions go through. MoneyFax is ready for delivery, according topresident William Benton. It is being piloted in a Canadian bank, whichhe would not identify.As well as talking to banks and third-party processors, MoneyFax isseeking approval from US and Canadian governments that would allow thesystem to be used for electronic tax payments.CONNOTECH, based in Montreal, has a patent pending for a payment-by-faxsystem. Its president Thierry Moreau said that over the last two yearshe has developed a cheque-replacement technology that allows computerfax-users to send data and images securely over fax lines.This system ensures protection against misdirected calls, as well asconfidentiality so that only the intended party sees the document,Moreau said.CONNOTECH is currently negotiating with partners in the US and Canadato install the system, which will be ready for field trials in ninemonths.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995SINGAPORE:  NETS HIT BY BREAKDOWNSSINGAPORE'S NATIONAL eftpos system, run by the Network for ElectronicTransfers (NETS), is showing signs of strain. Recently, the systembroke down four times in two weeks.The breakdown in service affected the whole of the island and occurredduring the pre-Christmas shopping "rush hour". The breakdowns do notusually last more than half an hour, but the latest incident lastedthree hours, just three days before Christmas. Shoppers who depended onNETS for payments were furious at the system's failure.The breakdown was blamed for longer queues at the check-out counters ofmany retail outlets, because customers did not realise that the NETSsystem had broken down, and check-out staff did not know when theservice would be restored.NETS attributed the recent spate of breakdowns or "system down-time"to the surge of users trying to transact at the same time. A NETSspokesman said the system, which is usually configured to handle fivetransactions a second, was reconfigured to handle twice the volume inanticipation of the demand of the festive season and peak-hour shoppingactivities. Apparently, the system failed when actual transactionsexceeded 10 per second during peak hours, causing the breakdowns.This has raised concerns about the system's ability to cope withincreasing volume during peak hours. Interestingly, while trying toincrease the capacity of its system to handle more transactions, NETScaused similar breakdowns in service on several occasions during thesame period in 1993.NETS has since assured the public that it has "rectified the hardwareproblem" and is "fine-tuning the system to handle the sudden surge intransactions". It has also decided as part of a longer-term measure toupgrade the eftpos system to meet a higher transaction demand.In the mean time, to address public concern about the system and toenhance its response time to another breakdown, it has set up acustomer hotline service.On a separate issue, NETS has announced that the pilot phase of itsnational electronic purse project, CashCard, has been delayed for thethird time. This follows similar postponements in July and in the finalquarter of 1994.NETS said the pilot implementation of the CashCard, which is to takeplace at two locations, was delayed by the final technical test, whichis still on-going. It stressed that the pilot can only proceed afterthe final technical test is completed, because security issues andfeatures which"cannot be compromised" have to be resolved first.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED STATES:  PROCESSOR ENABLES BANKS TO PRODUCE CARDS INSTANTLYFIFTH THIRD Bancorp's transaction processing subsidiary, MidwestPayment Systems (MPS), together with Atalla Corporation, are selling acard activation system that would allow banks to issue debit cardsinstantly in the branch.Atalla's Card Activation and PIN Selection (CAPS) 2000 System allowsbanks to issue debit cards, replace lost or stolen cards, and rewritethe magnetic stripe of damaged cards.It also has the customer service benefit of letting depositors choosetheir own PIN code. Financial institutions can perform most of thesefunctions in the branch that previously required outside providers,reducing costs and waiting times.According to the agreement, MPS installs CAPS. It also markets thebranch terminals which are the size of POS card-swipe devices, to itsclient banks. The system is capable of driving up to 240 terminalsdistributed through branches.MPS, a Cincinnati-based transaction processor, claims it is the onlyone to offer the service. Smaller banks can now offer the serviceavailable at larger banks without the expense of buying the centralcomputer, Atalla explained. Client banks would pay MPS a fee for everytransaction. The amount of the fee was not disclosed.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UK SHARES TRADE TO GO LIVEA UK BANK is to launch an electronic share dealing scheme available toany personal computer owner before the end of September.Jack Lang, technical director of Electronic Share Information (ESI),the Cambridge-based company behind the new share-trading market, toldEPI it was "well down the line in discussions with two leading banks toprovide an interest-bearing account for customers to use on-line".Although its main use will be to facilitate rapid payments for shares,Lang said the account would also offer other banking services. He wouldnot disclose which banks were involved, but said the project would golive either in June or September, following the summer holiday season.He expected developments of the service in due course, with furtherbanking services and home shopping.The company is the brainchild of a group of electronics and computerspecialists, chaired by Hermann Hauser, founder of Acorn Computers.They believe ESI will revolutionise share dealing, in much the same waythat general insurance was transformed by Direct Line. "It will reducecosts by an order of magnitude," said Lang. "Flotations will be about atenth of the cost of floating a company on the London Stock Exchange,and share dealing will be considerably cheaper."ESI will specialise in flotations and dealing in the shares of smallcompanies, challenging the London Stock Exchange and its AlternativeInvestment Market (AIM), which will be launched to replace the unlistedsecurities market.By using a personal computer to buy and sell shares via a modem, thecompany expects to dramatically reduce the cost to small investorsgetting involved in the market. "If you take some of the mystique awayand reduce costs to say a #10 ($15) dealing fee, you can offer arealistic return on a #200-#300 investment", says Lang.Speed will be a key attraction. The software, developed by TCAMSystems, a UK-based software supplier, will allow customers to log on,pass through security procedures and buy packets of shares from ESI'spublic order board. The bank would then transfer the fundsautomatically from the account of the buyer to the seller. Langestimates an average transaction will take seven seconds."We needed tofind banks which have immediate money transfer systems, rather thandoing it overnight".There are 9 million shareholders in the UK, almost half of them holdingshares in government-privatised firms. By providing affordable, directaccess to share dealing many of these may be tempted to play the marketregularly.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995UNITED KINGDOM:  FIVE BID FOR PO CONTRACTA CONTRACT for an electronic stop-list to clamp down on benefit fraud,which costs the UK government #220 million ($340 million) a year willbe awarded shortly.This will offer short-term protection against fraud before acomprehensive overhaul of the benefits payment system takes place.Benefit order books will possibly be replaced by smart cards. At themoment pensions and other payments are made using a personalisedbenefit order book issued to each claimant. Although they are alreadybar-coded, copying and theft of books is commonplace.A Senior Post Office Counters spokesman said: "given the need to combatorder book fraud, we hope to finalise things as soon as possible".Five technology companies, including ICL Enterprises and Gemplus, aretendering for the initial contract, which will develop a combinedbar-code reader and electronic stop-list. It will be tested"in about1,500 post offices in a large metropolitan area," said Wilson. Withexperience of the fraudsters' ability to adapt to and beat anti-fraudsystems, the Post Office is concerned that as little information aboutthe reader and the test location (which is likely to be London) isreleased. If successful, the system will be rolled out to all postoffices.Two contracts which apply to the automation of the UK Post Offices willbe awarded. The larger contract for revamping the entire paymentssystem is expected to be announced before the end of the year (see EPI92).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995PORTUGAL:  NEW BARCLAYS SYSTEM AIMED AT COMPANIESBARCLAYS BANK has launched a "global cash system" to replace itstraditional electronic banking system in Portugal. According to thebank's marketing director, Gloria Brito, the new system is "aimedprimarily at businesses hoping to cut accounting costs, although it isopen to anyone who wants it".The system involves a computer link-up between a customer and the bankand is broken down into three components - cash management, cashpooling and cash express.Cash management allows for cash movements within the country, and forup-to-date information on money and exchange markets. Cash expressallows international cash transfers to be carried out on the same day."In effect, it is as if the customer were linked to the internationalSWIFT network," explains Brito.Cash pooling is aimed at centralising customer's accounts. "A customerwith several accounts can consolidate his various accounts on a dailybasis, thus increasing his positive accounts or reducing hisoverdrafts." The system, says Brito, also means that a customer canmake predictions on their accounts in conjunction with the cashmanagement programme.Brito says it is difficult to evaluate the investment made by the bankin the new system. "Most of the necessary software already exists inEngland, although we have had to modify it slightly for the localmarket. This includes making a translation of the software intoPortuguese, something we are working on at the moment. It should all bein place by the early part of next year."The system is already available to some 50 customers in Portugal, mostof them large companies who have swapped it for the old electronicbanking system.Barclays says it is not worried about whether or not the system can payfor itself."Its real aim is not to directly make money, but rather toincrease our customer portfolio and to increase the movements of ourexisting customers,", Brito told EPI.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995IBOS SIGNS UNIBANKTHE INTERBANK On-line System (IBOS), set up by Royal Bank of Scotlandand Banco Santander in Spain, has signed Unibank, Denmark's secondlargest bank, to the network.Unibank becomes the seventh financial institution to join thereal-time, cross-border payments network. It is also the first bank inScandinavia to become involved, and brings an extra 440 domesticbranches to the IBOS network, increasing the number in Europe to 3,800.According to Jorgen Christian Andersen, first vice president ofUnibank, discussions with IBOS had been on-going for about six months.He said Unibank decided to join in order to compete with larger bankswhich have a global presence."It is a good way of getting a branch network all over Europe withoutthe costs," Andersen told EPI. Andersen said it should be ready to golive in the second half of this year.Unibank plans to offer the service only to corporates with regularcross-border payment needs. It will not be offered for one-offpayments; they will be sent through the normal SWIFT channels, he said.The other members in IBOS include: Banco de Comercio e Industria inPortugal; Credit Commercial de France; Kredietbank in Belgium; andFirst Fidelity Bancorp in the US.Economies of scale have proved elusive for IBOS, which is essentiallycompeting with the giant message carrier SWIFT, despite protestationsto the contrary. IBOS's future was secured last year following thedecision by US-based technology company EDS to buy a stake in thecompany.The cost of joining IBOS, said to have been a deterrent to joining, issaid to have dropped following the purchase by EDS of a stake in IBOS.According to Andersen, the most expensive element is adapting Unibank'sback office systems to be compatible with the IBOS software.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995GZS SETS UP SUBSIDIARYGESELLSCHAFT FUR Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the bank-owned German paymentssystem, has set up a subsidiary for payments transfers which, it says,will allow cross-border bulk payments in Europe to be made in three tofive business days, compared with seven to fourteen days at present.The new operation, known as Bank fur Zahlungsservice or BZS, willhandle smaller-denomination payments of up to  Ecu 2,000 or DM5,000($1,600-$3,200).Payments may be routed from any of the German banks that are members ofGZS. They include all major institutions.According to GZS, the rationale for the new bank is to realise quickand low-cost transfers of funds within the European Union in line withthe European Commission's Green Book recommendations of 1990.BZS will be the German link in the chain of automated clearing houses(ACHs) which should eventually extend to all European countries. Memberbanks will be charged a fixed price per transaction and are expected topass on any cost benefit to customers.A GZS spokesman said that each member bank would have to calculate itssavings individually, but acknowledged that Germany's major bankinggroups might still find it cheaper to operate their own systems.The co-operative banks' TipaNet system, for instance, offers flexiblearrangements for cost-sharing between the sending and the receivingbank and should eventually deal with substantial volumes.BZS will make transfers to ACHs in other European countries and to itsmember banks on a bulk basis. At present, the system can handleeurocheques only. While GZS hopes to extend the service to bank chequestoo, no final decision has been made on whether to offer that facility.BZS is not yet in a position to operate a pan-European system. Thepilot system set up with Belgium has gone into operation immediately,and the link should be extended to the UK, Austria and Italy in thecourse of this year.Frankfurt-based BZS will be headed by Detlev Buchal, the chiefexecutive of GZS, and Gerhard August Stern, who was previously head ofpayments systems at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995CANADA'S INTERAC DOWN, BUT UPINTERAC DIRECT Payment, Canada's national on-line debit network,weathered its first Christmas season as a fully-deployed system,handling volumes that were almost three times higher than December1993.Several bankers gave the debit card system glowing marks for itsperformance. However, the system suffered a set back during the heightof the Christmas shopping season when local and wire news mediareported that HMV Canada, a major chain of record stores based inToronto, complained that the system caused "frustrating delays."Interac general manager Fred Harris told EPI the system experienced nosignificant downtime in December, while other defenders dismissed thecomplaint as an isolated case. In addition to problems within themerchant's system, longer transaction times could be attributed tosystem-clogging volume: a peak 1.2 million transactions passed throughthe system on Christmas Eve, he said. He did not expect that Interacwould be modified as a result of the complaint."If that is the case, then I would suggest that there was a systemfailure," said Mel Fruitman, president of Retail Council, anassociation of Canadian retailers, adding that a debit system shouldwork quickly and accurately no matter what day it is. "Even ten secondsis an infinite amount of time when people are waiting. If a system ishaving these delays, it is not meeting customer needs," Fruitman said.Interac features a distributed system, Harris explained. When onebank's card is used at a "foreign" POS terminal, the transaction ispassed to the issuing bank for authorisation and clearing. Interacmaintains no central switch, except for a central diagnostic facility."We did not see any degradation or problems with the core network,"Harris said. With the distributed architecture of the system, heexplained, transaction delays could be traced to any number of steps inthe cycle. Of 26 million transactions made with Interac cards, 18million to 19 million went through the core interchange backbone.According to Harris, 5.5 million cardholders used the system 26 milliontimes in December, generating C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) in sales - amore than 50 percent increase over August's C$892.5 million in sales.And compared to December 1993, when 2.5 million customers generatedC$500 million in sales, system volume last month almost trebled."We think it will double again this year," Harris predicted. Thegreatest system growth took place after April, when Ontario was linkedto the system. Ontario is also the province where most national chainsare centred.In other news, Harris said the Bureau of Competition is stillscrutinising the network. Earlier in 1994, it was revealed thatregulators were investigating Canada's only EFT network after itreceived complaints of excessive fees and charges.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995US FED HITS `SHOULDER SURFING'THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors took aim at "shoulder surfing,"a technique used by criminals at ATMs, by eliminating the requirementthat banks print a consumer's account number on every ATM receipt.According to an interim rule approved last month, banks are no longerrequired to "uniquely" identify the consumer's account or card numberon ATM receipts.Previously, Regulation E, which governs electronic fund transfers inthe US, specified that banks print a consumer's number so that atransaction could be clearly identified. It is presumed that banks willtruncate the account number to three or six figures out of a 12 numberaccount, enough so that a transaction can still be identified.Criminals can often videotape or photograph people entering their PINs,which they then combine with receipts that are often disposed at theATM. Criminals are then able to counterfeit cards and access accountswith the PIN codes.Losses due to counterfeiting are conservatively estimated at $25million to $40 million, according to Tami Ishida, a senior researcherat Dove Associates, a Boston-based consultancy. She agreed the interimchange would help to slow fraud losses.While issuers will win out in the long term by denying counterfeiterscritical data, converting terminals to accommodate the new rules willcause some expense, she observed. Acquirers will have to re-programmesome 400,000 POS terminals and 109,000 ATMs.Industry reaction was positive. A spokeswoman for the Star System, oneof the largest EFT networks in the US, said her network was pleasedwith the change. "This will significantly help curtail the size of theproblem caused by shoulder surfing," she said.However, she added that the interim rule is vague and the industrywould be better served with uniform standards."It allows too much roomfor interpretation. We're urging them to be more specific so theindustry has better guidelines," the spokeswoman said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995INFINET BOSS SAYS REGIONALS WILL PROSPERREGIONAL NETWORKS may face pressure from neighbouring regionals,national brands and non-bank processors. But there are substantialopportunities, even as customers demand increasingly sophisticatedservices, according to InfiNet Payment Services chief executive RichardYanak.In a December 21 speech before the Electronic Banking EconomicsSociety, a professional association in New York, Yanak described hisvision for the future of the newly-created InfiNet and for other bankEFT networks."People value their time even more than they value money," he said,listing the first among absolutes that rule today's payments industry."We need to deliver those services whenever and wherever they arewanted."Until now, Yanak said, shared networks were limited to transactionswitching, terminal driving and other aspects of maintaining ATMsystems, such as card authentication and embossing. In the next yearand beyond, networks will introduce remote banking, electronic billpayment, off-line debit, and electronic purses, he said. And as banksface pressures to reduce costs, InfiNet could serve as a bank-owned,third-party service provider to the virtual bank, Yanak said. Bankershave to examine if they need a data centre or back office. Yanak warnedthat past in-house efforts have not shown success. Chemical Bank andHuntington Bank both have launched bill payment systems to no avail, hesaid.Providing new and expanded services will help to generate new revenuefor member banks. Yanak told the EBES attendees that InfiNet willexplore developing in-house services, buying other enterprises andforging business alliances. "Every service can generate a fee incomefor our members. If priced properly, consumers will pay," he said.Yanak said InfiNet is looking at creating a terminal leasing business.The network would strike deals with manufacturers, buying large numbersof units at lower prices and leasing machines to banks. By partnering,he said, "InfiNet would guarantee manufacturers substantial orders at aprice lower than is available to any individual bank. Participatingbankers, who would pay a monthly rate, would be sure to always receiveupdated ATMs."Yanak questioned Visa and MasterCard's apparent direction of late, andsuggested the traditional division of territory could be jeopardised."Are the regional networks superfluous? Under the right circumstances,they wouldn't be needed," he said. But banks have turned to regionalnetworks to remain competitive. "A substantial fraction of the paymentsbusiness has moved to non-banks, in part due to the policies set out bythe associations."This year, Yanak observed, the creation of Visa Interactive remotebanking and MasterCard's purchase of the BankMate network in St Louisposed tangible threats to regionals. While advising a wait-and-seeapproach, Yanak said the nationals should be watched. "If competitionbetween the national and regional networks increases, regionals willhave no choice but to implement universal interchange," he said."Both associations say they support the bank brand in its relationshipwith the customer. The difference between them and us is that webelieve it," he said. For the good of the banks, in the battle for thehearts and minds of consumers, Yanak called for a national brand to beplaced on the back of cards.Member banks face continuing erosion of their relationship with thecommunity due to the growing dominance of the national marque, Yanaksaid."When national brands are put on the card, it usurps the localbrand and it sounds the death knell of the depository account business.We have to come to grips with that reality," he said. Depicting a worsescenario, Yanak said a powerful corporation, such as General Motors,might create a GM National Bank and offer deposit access services viathe national systems.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995FIRST NATIONAL SWITCH/AUTHORISATION CENTREAPPLIED COMMUNICATIONS (ACI) the US-based EFT solutions company, hasannounced it has signed an agreement with CSG Card Services, the US'slargest card processor for credit unions, to form the first nationalswitch/authorisation centre that is owned and operated by the CreditUnion System."This agreement allows us to offer credit unions a complete EFTpackage," said Elizabeth Taylor Quilliam, CSG vice president ofsales/EFT services."We can now provide a single point for authorisationservices, whether to Visa, MasterCard, a national or regional ATMnetwork or a shared branch network.

The ninth Payments Institutewill be held from June 17-23 at the University of Colorado in Boulder.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995HUNGARY:  GIRO PROCESSING TIME CUT TO 24 HOURSHUNGARY'S BANKING system has taken a giant leap forward with theintroduction of an inter-bank giro system. The new giro facilitatesovernight electronic domestic money transfers among the country's500-plus bank branches.Before the launch of the system, bank-to-bank transfers routinely tookdays and even weeks, representing a major obstacle to the country'stransition to the free market.After extensive training of thousands of employees in every bank branchin the country, the system's architects managed to convert from anantiquated network to the new X-25 packet switching system betweenFriday November 18 and Monday November 21, 1994. Under the old system,magnetic tapes and disks were delivered round the country by train."The effort was no small peanuts," said Peter Braun, president ofGiro's board of directors. "We didn't get much sleep before thelaunch."Braun is also the deputy chief executive of Orszagos Takarekpentzar(OTP), the national savings bank, and the country's largestdeposit-taking bank with 365 branches. Giro, the system's legal owner,is held proportionally by all of the commercial banks who are obligedby the National Bank of Hungary to belong to the system. OTP holds thelargest stake at 22 percent.The overnight X-25 system is itself intended to be a back-up system toa realtime giro due out later this year. The network runs on a seriesof Intel Pentium-based PCs, linked via satellite and microwavetransmitters, with further back-ups made on floppy disks.Transfer orders are sent in the late afternoon from branches to theGiro headquarters in Budapest, where they are sorted overnight fordispatch early the next morning. The pending real time system, madepossible by a World Bank grant, will be administered on a Bull DPS7000mainframe.One reason for launching the overnight back-up system before a realtime system was to determine whether the back-up system was functioningproperly, according to Pal Kerekfy, software director for IDOM, adomestic information technology company which administered thetransition to the X-25 exchange.In addition, the Bull network has been delayed for more than two yearspending the central bank's newly-defined system of liquidity controlamong commercial banks. Now, the National Bank sets a liquidity limitfor each bank daily. The X-25 network's software was developed from thebeginning to accommodate the liquidity limits, while the Bull systemstill has to be modified accordingly, Kerekfy said. IDOM, which wastaken over by Deloitte & Touche last year, also won the tender toadminister the installation of the Bull system.Before the projects are completed, all commercial banks will have toadopt a new system of client account numbers. At the moment, the banksuse as many as 40 systems of keeping track of client accounts, saidKerekfy.The National Bank has devised a new system, also to be implementeduniversally this year, but it has decided to delay the new accountnumber system until after the launch of the Giro as"it was consideredtoo much of a shock to modify both systems at the same time", Kerekfysaid.In more than a month of operation, the new giro system has functionedwithout a problem, apart from the occasional human error among clients.The margin of error is within the 1 percent to 2 percent internationalnorm, said Braun.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995FRANCE:  SELF-SERVICE EXTENDS TO STOCK TRADINGIF A new series of tests succeed, self-service banking may be extendedto include stock exchange transactions. The tests are being undertakenin two branches of CIC-Paris (Credit Industriel et Commercial), and maybe extended to other banks and branches where sufficient demand exists.The CIC-Paris experiment is being undertaken in partnership with theSociete des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which manages the French stockexchange. It is scheduled to run through June 1995. During this period,CIC-Paris and SBF will analyse results based on quantitative andqualitative considerations. These include: the number of users; what itis used for; and clients' suggestions. A decision on whether or not toextend the service will then be made.The test terminal, known as the "Borne-Bourse", consists of aspecially-equipped Minitel (part of the French national videotexsystem) with a colour screen, a keyboard and a smart card reader called"LECAM". Initially, there will be one terminal in each of the two testsites.Users of the service simply put their bank card into the card readerand enter their PIN code. This gives them access to the CIC-Paris stockmarket videotex service. Menu-driven software guides them through thesession.At the moment, the service includes three offerings: personal portfolioinformation (by value, rubric, settlements, and taxes); generalinformation on various stocks and the market, on privatisations and onCIC-Paris mutual funds; and order placement for buying, selling,cancellation or amendment. For reasons of security, clients mustconfirm any orders they pass by entering their PIN a second time. Underthe present experiment, clients must use terminals only at brancheswhere they have an account and a portfolio.SBF made the decision to run this trial last year, following thesuccess of its"Points-Bourse" information terminals. The Points-Bourseprogramme, which was launched in 1992 in partnership with variousbanking networks, provides clients with up-to-date SBF stock exchangedata using a system called Chronoval.The programme has grown dramatically since October 1992, when thenumber of these terminals located within branch offices totalled 45 insix banking networks. By the end of 1994, there were 263 terminals usedby 28 partner banks. SBF officials hope for similar success with thenew venture.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List CopyrightELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1995PAYMENTS COME OF AGEPreviously the poor relation of the banking industry, payments areincreasingly seen as the most interesting and profitable area of thebusiness. Electronic Payments International looks back at some of thedevelopments of the past year which have shaped this thinkingIF 1993 was the year when eftpos took off, then 1994 was the year ofthe smart card. The issue of rising telecommunications costs, coupledwith the problem of fraud, forced banks to move away from traditionalmagnetic stripe technology and look at the alternatives. Without doubt,1995 will see a continuing migration to chip card technology.Smart CardsEncouraging results from France's Cartes Bancaires smart card system,prompted banks in other countries to begin investing in the technology.Cartes Bancaires' decision to replace magnetic stripe cards with chipcards was criticised by local banks and dismissed by the internationalbanking community as an expensive folly.However, events in 1994 vindicated Cartes Bancaires' decision. Cardfraud in France dropped by 50 percent between 1992 and 1993, fallingfrom 0.08 percent to 0.04 percent of all transactions. This translatesinto losses of Fr207 million ($40 million) at the end of 1993, asopposed to Fr472 million in 1991. Interestingly, though, CartesBancaires abandoned its electronic purse project being developed withLa Poste, the French postal service.In January, National Westminster Bank in the UK announced the imminentlaunch of Mondex, arguably the most ambitious smart card scheme. Thecard, which includes an optional wallet, is being developed inconjunction with British Telecom (BT), the UK's main telecom supplier.Midland Bank, a subsidiary of the giant HSBC corporation, alsoannounced its involvement in the scheme.Due to go live this year in a pilot in Swindon, Mondex allows users totransfer funds between their bank accounts and their cards through BTtelephones and adapted NatWest and Midland ATMs.Tim Jones, senior executive of IT, strategy and policy at NatWest, andthe man behind Mondex, said the scheme differs from other electronicpurse schemes in that Mondex aspires to replace cash, with no audittrail. Cardholders can transfer money between wallets and can lock itwith a PIN-code. If the person loses the wallet, the cardholder haslost the money.Despite, or perhaps because of, its technical sophistication, Mondexhas been severely criticised by industry sources. At the InternationalSmart Card Conference held in Frankfurt in February, Tim Jones cameunder fire from speakers from Banksys, Belgium's national paymentsorganisation which has developed its own electronic purse scheme, andfrom others who questioned Mondex's security and economic viability.Armand Linkens, director of marketing and sales at Banksys, said theteam developing the Belgian pilot looked at Mondex and concluded that,because it leaves no audit trail and because it is an "open", ratherthan a "closed" system, the potential for fraud was considerable.However, Mondex does have its proponents. Jerome Svigals, a US-basedsmart card consultant, said NatWest has taken a bold step in the rightdirection. Firstly, it increases productivity at the bank and theretailer because it eliminates cash handling. Secondly, the banksbenefit from the float created by a prepaid card.In fact, the industry became increasingly divided into two camps: thepro-Mondex banks and the closed system banks.A further division within the smart card industry was created by thecard associations, Visa and MasterCard/Europay. In December 1993, Visaand MasterCard/Europay agreed to co-operate on chip cardspecifications. The decision was greeted with enthusiasm by theindustry, but failed to hide the fundamental differences between thecard associations approach to smart card applications.Under the leadership of Charles "Chuck" Russell and with Roger Peircein charge of delivery systems, Visa was less enthusiastic about smartcards than MasterCard. Although this philosophy changed with theirdeparture - Russell left as president and chief executive officer atthe end of 1993, while Peirce left in March 1994 - Visa is stillunconvinced that smart cards should be implemented as a replacement formagnetic stripe cards. MasterCard, and particularly Europay, havecommitted themselves to migrate to smart cards within an ambitious timeframe.At Europay's annual members' meeting in Bergen, Norway, theassociation's board agreed to invest Ecu1 billion ($1.2 billion) toimplement smart cards. It expects its members to begin introducingsmart cards by 1996. Understandably, the decision was dismissedas"headline-seeking" by Visa.Europay claimed that members would see a return of $2 billion within aseven-year period as a result of a reduction in fraud. Visa, meanwhile,replied by saying these figures were only relevant to Europay, sinceits fraud was higher than Visa's. This is because Visa had reducedfraud as a result of its Card Verification Value (CVV) technique.It was not long after the Europay board's decision that MasterCardannounced it too was fully endorsing smart card technology. Thedecision was made in tandem with Europay's decision, but MasterCardwould not say how much money it was committing to the project. It didsay, however, that it would be converting terminals to accept chipcards by 1996.Visa, aware it was becoming branded as the anti-smart cardorganisation, sought to counter this with some high-profileannouncements. In March, it said it was planning an electronic purseproject which would rival the Mondex scheme.In order to develop such a scheme, Visa linked with two groups ofindustry specialists to develop specifications for a purse. The firstincludes banking groups working on electronic purse projects: Banksysin Belgium; Cartes Bancaires in France; Taiwan's Financial InformationSystem Centre; Sociedade Espanol de Medios de Pago in Spain; SociedadeInterbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) in Portugal; Denmark's Danmant;Electronic Payment Services (EPS), NationsBank and Wachovia - all fromthe US.The second group included technology companies, such as Gemplus andVeriFone. These were contacted to help develop the specifications foran electronic purse scheme, while the first group were responsible forensuring technical compatibility across the various schemes.One notable exclusion from the first group was Mondex. The significanceof this was played down by both groups. Mondex said it was followingstandards set by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and theEuropean Commission's working group (CEN), but would not say if it hadbeen contacted by Visa.Europay was sceptical about the Visa initiatives, sticking to itsfigures on fraud. Neither organisation said Visa's working groupsjeopardised the joint specifications committees, although Europayprofessed disappointment that it had not been made aware of theconsortia.However, despite their differences, Visa and MasterCard/Europay didannounce the completion of their joint specifications. On November 8,the third and final part of the standards, which determine how smartcards and POS terminals would process financial transactions, cardapplications, and provide for contingencies were announced.As the associations battled it out for the upper hand, individual smartcard initiatives continued during the year. In February, Banksysannounced the towns to be involved in its electronic purse trial. Thecard, later called Proton, was developed to replace cash at the pointof sale. The trial, due to go live in December in Leuven and Wavre, wasone of the most ambitious purse schemes. Given the centralised natureof the country's payments system, the electronic purse was expected tomigrate to general bank cards in the future.In July, NETS, the national payments organisation in Singapore,expanded its CashCard electronic purse project by linking with a localuniversity and Singapore Telecom. The CashCard scheme announced anaffinity programme with the National University of Singapore. It wasadapted to the needs of students and university staff for payments onthe campus. The Telecom deal opened up 25 adapted telephones toCashCard holders.Meanwhile in August in Portugal, the SIBS-backed purse announced it wasto go live in the third quarter of the year, several months early.Unlike other pilots, it was controlled in the branch of one of themember banks, Caixa Geral de Depositos.Danmont, the first major electronic purse scheme, celebrated its secondanniversary in September. Transaction volume grew 108 percent in thefirst quarter of 1994, compared with the last quarter of 1993.In the US, one of the few backers of smart cards, EPS, announceddetails of its electronic purse pilot in September. It is due to golive in the fourth quarter of this year. Due to involve 10,000customers, the trial will take place in a five-mile corridor inDelaware.South Africa also backed smart cards that month. Six of the country'smain banks are involved in the project, called the South AfricanElectronic Purse. The pilot, which went live in September, involved 100merchants and 12,000 customers in Alberton, a suburb of Johannesburg.Finland became the next to announce the launch of an electronic purseproject. Called Avant, the scheme was backed by the Finnish centralbank and came in two forms, a prepaid phone card, and a reloadableelectronic purse. About 40,000 cards were expected to be in issue bythe end of last year.Mondex received a considerable boost near the end of the year whenHongkong Bank signed to the scheme. It agreed to become a franchiseefor the scheme in the Asia region. The agreement was a natural resultof Hongkong Bank's association with Midland Bank, one of the banksbehind Mondex.Finally, the Dutch banks announced the details of its electronic pursescheme, to be launched in October 1995. The scheme, called Chipknip,will be piggy-backed on to the banks' eurocheque cards. Interpay, amerger of Eurocard Nederlands and BeaNet, will manage the scheme. Itexpects up to 20 million smart cards to be in issue in three to fouryears.Cross-border paymentsLow value, cross-border payments continued to dominate discussionsduring the year, with various payment clubs emerging. One of the firstpayments networks, Interbank On-line System (IBOS), launched by RoyalBank of Scotland and Banco Santander in 1990, continued to sign newbanks during the year. The system transfers money, on-line, real timeto and from any branch of its members, which include, Credit Commercialde France, Banco do Comercio e Industria in Portugal, Kredietbank inBelgium and First Fidelity Bank in the US.Although IBOS is keen to play down the potential conflict with SWIFT,the international financial message sender, many see it as operating incompetition rather than as complement to SWIFT. Critical mass remainsan elusive goal for IBOS. The company says that 20 members would makethe system viable.In February, the first signs that the European Commission (EC) waspreparing to take stern action against banks emerged. At theInternational Electronic Payments Conference in Frankfurt, PeterTroberg, head of DGXV, the directorate in charge of financial services,warned banks that, unless improvements were made to the quality of lowvalue, cross-border payments, a directive would be proposed.The financial community rallied together against the Commission,accusing it of unrealistic expectations, saying that low value,cross-border payments represent less than 5 percent of all payments.Improvements, they said, could not be made since it could not bejustified by the volumes involved.Despite the protests, various payment clubs went live during the year,partly in response to the EC's threats. In April, B.epsys, a consortiumof seven of the largest Belgian banks, went live with its low valuesystem. It began processing payments between Belgium and Germanythrough an arrangement with Geselleschaft fur Zahlungssysteme (GZS),the bank-owned payments organisation. The system operates similarly toan automated clearing house, with domestic transactions routed forinternational clearing.In that month, NatWest announced that the group in its payments club:Commerzbank; Societe Generale; Banco Central Hispano, was to beexpanded. Unlike IBOS, which uses SWIFT message standards but does notuse the SWIFT system, the NatWest group used the international network.In December, the bank rumoured to be joining was Banco ComercialPortugues.It was in December that the system went live with its first transactionusing SWIFT's Interbank File Transfer (IFT) service. It claims to cutthe transfer time down from eight to three working days.Meanwhile, in July, Banque Nationale de Paris and its strategic partnerin Germany, Dresdner Bank, launched a cross-border payments service.The service is designed for payments of up to Ecu2,500 ($2,800),charging a fee of Fr140 ($7).In September, TipaNet, the cross-border payments initiative set up bythe co-operative banks in France and Germany was adopted by Bankers'Trust in the US, Swiss Bank Corporation and Austria'sRaiffeisen-Zentralbank. Like the NatWest system, TipaNet uses SWIFT'sIFT system for transfer of payment messages.Despite these initiatives, the European Commission dealt a blow to theindustry in October when it proposed a directive to improvecross-border payments. The decision was met with dismay from thebanking industry, but the Commissioner for DGXV, Raniero Vannid'Archirafi, was adamant the banks were given adequate time to improvethe situation.The proposal came after a second study was undertaken for theCommission which showed that double charging occurred in 36 percent ofpayments, while at 46 percent of branches, no written information wasavailable.Banks criticised the quality of the research in the report and the EC'sinterpretation of its findings. They said that in most instances thebanks were within the Commission's parameters. The average cost of atransaction had fallen from Ecu22.39 to Ecu19.80 since the last survey,while the time for the transfer of payments, 4.8 working days, was wellwithin the EC's recommendations.Other developmentsATMs continued to be adapted to deliver extra services. In Brazil,Tecnologia Bancaria (TecBan), the Brazilian company which runs theBanco24Horas ATM network, revamped its machines to allow for billpayments. An initial 30 Pagamento Eletronico terminals went live inMarch in Sao Paulo for paying electricity and telephone bills. TecBanexpects 500 to be installed by the end of this year, with otherutilities, such as gas and water companies coming on-line.In Thailand in May, Bangkok Bank began selling mutual funds through its400 ATMs. The system was launched in conjunction with BBL AssetManagement, a subsidiary of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.La Caixa in Spain also offered extra services through its ATMs. CalledServicaixa, the system dispenses concert, local transport and airlinetickets, provides for the payment of taxes, and pay for universityfees.The service was expanded in February 1994 by installing a further 400machines, bringing the total to 800 and could be accessed by all thebank's Sistema 6000, Visa and Eurocard cardholders.The USThe US electronic payments marketplace showed signs of maturity in1994, as government regulators alerted the banking industry that itpromised to pay closer heed to competition issues.The pace of regional EFT network consolidation slowed slightly, thoughthere was no shortage of merger discussions. In November, theMissouri-based BankMate network was purchased by MasterCard, a movethat confirmed the worst fears of regional executives, who suspectedthat the national associations want to be more than just gatewayswitches.The only major merger to succeed was between Yankee 24 and NYCE. Theymerged as equals in October, creating the third-largest network in theUS. The MAC network continued westward when its members, which acquiredowners of the Quest network in Kentucky, absorbed the network into MAC.Local jealousies in Colorado, however, sparked a spin-off as small,independent banks formerly affiliated to the Rocky Mountain BankcardSystem created their own network. There was reportedly great strifebetween the independent bank and First Bank Systems, which recentlypurchased the owners of the Rocky Mountain network.Talks, were broken off between Cash Station of Chicago and Magic Lineof Michigan in May, both parties citing philosophical and culturaldifferences. The perennial discussion of a merger between the Honor andMost networks, in the southeast US, also bore no results.State and federal watchdogs caused the greatest stir in April when theUS Justice Department brought anti-trust charges against ElectronicPayment Services, parent to the owners of MAC, the largest ATM networkin the US. The Justice investigation resulted in EPS signing a consentdecree that said EPS must open the network to third-party processors,reversing a long-standing network policy.EPS management said the consent decree, which is not an admission ofguilt, made no difference because EPS earlier changed its bylaws. Theconsent decree accelerated the timetable for opening up the network.Justice complained that MAC policies left banks, particularly smallinstitutions, vulnerable to higher fees and charges. Competing EFTnetworks said this action was inevitable, with the rising importance ofATMs in the consumer banking industry, but also added that MAC'srestrictive policies were unique in the US.US Congress also entered the fray, with several consumer groupslobbying the House Banking Committee. A subcommittee headed by JosephKennedy took bankers to task, questioning the wide variety and therising cost of service fees in the last few years. No further actionwas taken after the public hearing.The US Government, in an effort championed by Vice President Al Gore,supported the development of systems that would deliver federal andstate benefits via the electronic payments system. With limited runs inTexas, Maryland, California and Ohio, EBT programmes performed well.However, the Federal Reserve Board created a storm with its decision toextend Regulation E to stored-value cards, including EBT cards. EBTproponents criticised the Fed action, claiming Regulation E will stymieprojects because of the heavy liabilities that would be transferred tostate governments and onerous reporting requirements.MasterCard, at the end of 1994, sparked a new round of competitionconcerns when it unilaterally declared that its national on-line debitprogramme, Maestro, would not prohibit duality. A few years earlier,MasterCard and Visa were rebuffed by the National Association ofStates' Attorneys General for trying to launch Entree, a joint debitcard programme.MasterCard submitted its proposed rule change to the group for comment.When the group responded that it was not filing suit, MasterCardexecutives proceeded with the change. Visa and other industry observersnoted that the Attorneys' opinion, while not against the proposal, washardly an endorsement they emphasised that the group had reserved theright to bring suit in the future.Americans showed that they have warmed to electronic payments. Visa's72 million cards in circulation generated 35 million in sales volume asof second quarter 1994. Officials from regional networks, Visa, andMasterCard report that debit volumes are starting to rise, claiming alarger share of total spending. MasterCard reported that ATM usage hadbegun to carry over to debit.Perhaps most unsettling was the sudden realisation that computersoftware and telecommunication companies are poised to play a verysignificant role in payment systems. Assuming the role of bankers'worst nightmare, Microsoft and its outspoken president, Bill Gates, waswidely credited with awakening bankers to the urgent need to adapt tochanging times. Bankers also learned about software and technologycompanies, such as Intuit and Netscape Communication.Several companies shook up the industry by plying alternative deliverychannels, such as banking by telephone, screen-phone and by personalcomputer. Visa in July established Visa Interactive when it bought mostof Virginia-based US Order. Interactive billed itself as a bank-ownedsolution for banks that wanted to offer home banking and bill paymentservices.Non-banks were very active. US West, Electronic Data Services (EDS) andFrance Telecom Intelmatique formed Interactive Transaction partners(ITP) and quickly signed such sizeable clients as Comerica Bank Texas.Visa trumped MasterCard when it signed a deal with Microsoft inNovember. It agreed to develop software that would allow consumers tomake payments securely and transact business over computer networks.This and other software will open up the worldwide web to commerce. InDecember, First Data Corporation, the largest transaction processor inthe US, signed a deal with Netscape Communications that could routecredit card transactions over the Internet. MasterCard finally followedin January when it launched its own programme with Netscape.In ACH news, bankers turned long-standing grievances against Fedwireinto action this year with the formation of the Private Sector ACHExchange, or PAX. Visa USA, the New York Clearing House, and ArizonaClearing House agreed to link up, allowing banks to route ACH paymentsoutside the Fed. At the moment, the federal reserve, which plays therole of both regulator and competitor, controls 80 percent of thebusiness. In its first year, Citibank NA and Chemical Bank joined thenew system, while PNC Bank moved more of its business through Visa ACH.The private sector scored another victory when lobbying, led by theNational Clearing House Association (NACHA), spurred the FederalReserve to drop its bid to process corporate tax payments to the USTreasury, a programme expected to add $1 trillion in payments to thenational ACH volume. ACH executives also had feared that the governmentcould have exceeded its authority by controlling such a significantpiece of business.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications LimitedBack to Headline List WT03-B38-23IA059-000325-B024-312http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi42.html 205.156.212.5 19970115010401 text/html 48353HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:02:12 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:12 GMTContent-length: 48164Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi42.html Sample Issue Copyright EMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNet January 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES PAYBACK TIME FOR MEXICO?

The sovereign easilyraised DM 1 billion Monday with its first ever 7-year DM issue, equal to$690 million. The state bank Nafinsa raised $100 million Wednesday and theimport-export bank Bancomext issued $300 million in commercial paper.        But top Mexican financial officials denied that the country isusing the sovereign cash expressly to make any of the $1.3 billion inpayments due Jan. 29 on short-term swaps drawn from the U.S. Treasury andthe Fed.        "People might think it is for the IMF or the U.S. Treasury, but themoney does not have a specific purpose," insists Daniel Martinez, advisorto Martin Werner, Mexico's director general of public credit."The money isjust being used to refinance short-term debt and improve the debt profile."        Market sources, however, disagreed and seemed amused with Mexico'scurious response.        "They have some money to pay back to the U.S. Who are theykidding," wonders a syndicator.        Chemical Bank analysts suggest that Mexico will almost surely repaythe half due to the Fed, for legal reasons, but that payment on theTreasury's half is less certain. There's been "some hint" that the Mexicangovernment has been seeking to roll over the debt, says the research groupin a Jan. 8 analysis. But, "given the politically charged environment inthe U.S., we believe this will be a hard sell," Chemical says.        Martinez  refused say when Mexico would issue next. Perhaps thecountry will follow Argentina to Japan--Mexico has certainly mimickedArgentina before. The Argentine government is said to be leaning towards ayen deal, maybe as soon as this week (see page 8).        Deutchemark deal fever shows no sign of abating--the likely drop inGerman interest rates should stoke even more issuance. Mexico was thesecond Latin American country to lengthen a DM tenor to seven years. Co-ledby CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the issue carried a 10.38%coupon, 1/8% higher than the 10.25% coupon that Argentina's seven-year dealcarried two weeks ago.        A syndicate source says the Mexican issue's higher coupon makes itslightly more attractive than the Argentine seven-year bond, and has soldbriskly with German and Swiss retail investors. Mexico last tapped the DMmarket in October with a five-year DM 1 billion deal for 9.38%.--Dan B.LevineBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996DEBT RESTRUCTURING TICKING ALONGWith the holidays over, the commercial debt restructuring deals ofPeru, Panama and Slovenia are seeing renewed progress toward completion.There have been no reports of significant snags or delays in any of thedeals; the original timetables seem to be substantially on track.        As it promised, Panama has refrained from asking for a rebalancingof options choices in its $3.5 billion Brady, even though the choices werefar from the balanced breakdown the country the country had sought. Withnearly all the debt spoken for--and no indication of any major renegadesamong creditors--the overwhelming majority of orders came in for interestreduction bonds, covering 81.9% of the debt by Panama's count. Pars bondswere chosen for only 13.6% of the debt, and discounts only 4.5%. Nary acreditor chose new money.        "There is nothing at this point that would hold the deal back,"said a banking source. Panama is still reviewing the final documentation.No signing debt has been set, but the two sides are still hoping forsigning in this quarter, and a closing in the next.        The aggressive timetable for Peru's $9 billion Brady has slipped alittle. Bank creditors handed their version of the term sheet to Peru inearly December, right on time, but it hasn't yet come back. The Peruvianssay they want a first quarter closing, but it looks now like both sideswould have to work like lightning to accomplish that. There has been nofurther movement on specifying more closely the debt's participation indebt for equity swaps; apparently the term sheet will say only that theBrady debt can't be excluded from any such scheme the country puts forth.        Slovenia's bank advisory committee was last week awaiting waiversfrom creditors that would free Slovenia's share of the ex-Yugoslavia's debtand allow Slovenia to begin paying off about $800 million in obligations atLibor + 13/16. Creditors holding at least two-thirds of the debt mustapprove the country's exit from the joint and several liability for ex-Yugodebt. Bankers have not expected a problem, but the New York blizzard andthe fact that some French banks reportedly didn't get the documents untillast Tuesday could create some slight delays. Slovenia hopes to close thedeal within 70 days from waiver approval. -- MDBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996THINK TANK CHIEF FORESEES CUBAN BLOODSHEDDespite some Cuban economic modernization and a tentative openingtoward non-U.S. foreign investment, Cuba and the United States are unlikelyto move toward eliminating the long-standing U.S. economic embargo againstCuba in the near future, predicts Leslie Gelb, president of the Council onForeign Relations.        In fact, Gelb foresees something much darker: the possibility of abloody civil war "as awful as Bosnia" in the coming years, with thetransition away from a Castro regime.        Cuba "could be on the edge, in three years, or 10 years, of realcivil war," Gelb suggested last week during a talk at the Americas Societyin New York, shortly after returning from a week of talks in Cuba that theCouncil on Foreign Relations arranged with the Cuban government.        Gelb, a former Pulitzer-prizewinning New York Times journalist andU.S. diplomat, participated in a series of meetings with top Cubanpolitical and economic officials during his November visit, which includedfive hours of talks with Castro.        His conclusions are bad news for investors who hope forregularization of Cuba's defaulted $4 billion debt to Western banks. Whileoffshore and other non U.S.-registered funds have taken small positions indefaulted Cuban loans (the Emerging Markets Traders Association recordednearly $1.2 billion face value in trades of Cuban instruments last year,$652 million of that in loan trades that averaged less than $2 millioneach), and there are several funds collecting money in wait for betterportfolio investment opportunities on the island, the main impetus forappreciation of such investments would be the lifting or softening of the35-year-old embargo.        Liquidity would improve dramatically, as U.S. investors now bannedfrom holding the debt would be allowed to participate. War, of course,could wipe out such positions altogether. Cuban debt now trades in the lowto mid 20s.        Cuba has a team of well-trained economic managers, which Gelbequates with the teams Mexico has sported in the last dozen years. However,their initiatives would presumably be overshadowed by the thrust U.S. -Cuban diplomatic relations.Both Sides Take Hard Line        Pressured by anti-Castro Cubans in the United States, PresidentClinton is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. stance toward Cuba in therunup to the Nov. 1996 U.S. presidential elections, Gelb points out. But,for reasons of its own, the Castro administration isn't particularly eagerto see sanctions lifted now, either.        Despite a 40% plunge of the Cuban economy after the collapse of theSoviet Union, and a desperate need for U.S. investment, Castro seems tofear that the end of the embargo also might mean an end to his regime.Cubans could become further disillusioned with their president if theyconclude that domestic problems typically blamed on the embargo persistafter it is lifted.        "My sense is that Fidel Castro is not interested in the next yearor two in making any significant concession to the United States," Gelbsays.        Gelb advocates gradually lifting the embargo, to avoid shocking theCuban economy, and calls for increased diplomacy via U.S.-Cuban militarycontacts and a strengthening of the trend to encourage U.S. NGOs to operatein Cuba.        But he doesn't think the present situation can last too long,partly because of the great pressure of an alluring American society 90miles away.        "I don't think the situation is long-term stable," Gelb says. Cubahas begun to grow again, but the 2.5% growth expected this year--perhaps 4%later on if the sugar harvest is good--is far too slow to be meaningfulafter a tumble that was far worse than the United States suffered duringthe Great Depression.        "I just don't think the Cuban situation will continue to evolvepeacefully," he says. He reports that Cuban officials are "very concerned"about how to create a transition from the rule of Castro, who doesn't wantto leave. Under one scenario, the Cuban military could end up disbanding,Miami Cubans could return en masse, and the island could find itself thrustinto a civil war.--Mary D'AmbrosioBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NY FED'S E-MARKETS CHIEF: IT'S NOT A CRACKDOWNThe New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be stronglyfocused on information gathering and policy recommendation--and wasn'tcreated to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,the chief of the effort stresses.        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smackpeople in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named tothe new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.        Checki, 50, becomes the New York Fed's eighth executive vp. The jobis intended to consolidate various pieces of emerging markets research andsupervision that had been scattered across different departments, he says.His top priority, he adds, is to be sure Fed policymakers know what's goingon.        While it seems logical to take such a step after the solution toMexico's Dec. 1994 peso crisis landed squarely and expensively on the U.S.government's doorstep, and the Daiwa Bank trading loss debacle appeared tocatch the New York Fed failing to act on information it had for years, Fedofficials said creation of the group was neither expressly the result ofthese issues, nor a signal of stepped-up or changing regulatory practices."We're not doing anything now that we haven't done before," Checki said.        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge ofinternational banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDCexpert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDCdebt crisis in the 1980s, functioning as ex-NY Fed chief Gerald Corrigan'stop international troubleshooter and then taking on the same role forcurrent NY Fed chief William McDonough.         But Checki doesn't see his role as limited to U.S. commercial orforeign bank supervision. Instead, he expects to maintain information tieswith all of the players and influences driving emerging markets--keepinginformed about the initiatives of investment banks and funds, trackingpolitical, economic and financial trends, and consulting with other centralbanks.         His priority is to get emerging markets information to McDonough,preferably "before it emerges," and make policy recommendations, he says.        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure bettereconomic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing themajority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in thewake of the Mexican crisis.         "I think we need to see that the information is as available aspossible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that theIMF "should not be in the business of assembling information for theprivate sector," he does think the Fund has an important role to play inmaking sure good financial information is procured from borrowingcountries.        His advice to those thinking of participating in emerging marketsfor the first time: "Tell them to be sure of their ability to swim," hesays, "and to understand how deep the water is."--Mary D'AmbrosioBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996TELEBRAS RATED TO SOVEREIGN CEILINGMoody's has assigned an initial B1 rating to Brazil'sTelecomunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras).

In Ecuador, asluggish economy and a divided congress mean May 1996 elections areunlikely to usher in economic improvements.        Those are some of the conclusions that the Syracuse, New Yorkanalytical firm Political Risk Services presents in its January forecast.        Romanian President Ion Iliescu's supporters are unlikely to win amajority in September's Parliament elections. But both Egyptian PresidentHosni Mubarak and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori are seen as secure intheir positions.        Venezuela's considerable problems remain due to an overdependenceon oil exports and a lack of fiscal discipline, in the opinion of theseanalysts, in a climate of high inflation and no growth. Inflation isprojected to climb to 75% in 1996, from 46.9% last year. Caldera's populiststance is not making the country's situation easier either, and leftistCausa R may benefit in the 1998 elections. Causa R's presidential candidateAndres Velasquez finished second to Caldera in 1993.        In China, despite some forms of private enterprise, there is muchconcern over the business climate. Some government groups are discussingthe removal of foreign tax breaks. Another potential problem is the growingaggressiveness of the Chinese military in the South China Sea. Pressurefrom the U.S. over the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, trade policy andhuman rights could also threaten foreign businesses, analysts say.        In Ecuador, prospects are slim that President Sixto  Ballen'sadministration can implement necessary economic reforms to stimulate theeconomy. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1.8% in 1996 after reaching 3.6%this year.        The economy is also at risk because of increased violence and thethreat of a military coup. But the May 1996 elections are unlikely toresult in a regime any more capable of improving the economy.        Romania's Iliescu is favored to win September's presidentialelections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a parliamentary majority.Despite opposition, Iliescu remains popular as he moves the economy towardsintegration with the EU.        Budget cuts and market reforms are being implemented to qualify forassistance from the IMF and the EU, but not enough to greatly improve thebusiness climate. But, inflation is projected to fall dramatically to 28%in 1996 from 161.5% last year and GDP growth is expected to rise to 4% thisyear from 3.6% shrinkage in 1995.        In Egypt, Mubarek's willingness to use force, mixed with politicalliberalization, has kept the opposition off balance and solidified hiscontrol in Egypt. Some progress has been made in reducing foreign debt,controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth,but essentialprivatizations have yet to occur.        Peru's Fujimori also shows no signs of losing control, standinghigh in public opinion polls. Peru's economy is healthy by South Americanstandards, and Fujimori presided over the country's debt-restructuringdeal. A question for the long term is finding a presidential successor.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LEGAL NOTESLegal Notes is prepared by James Leavy and M. Cecilia Gaviria of SerraMichaud & Associes, Paris based on information produced by law firms fromLatin America. This is part one of their monthly report. Part two willappear next week.BrazilMeasures to strengthen the financial systemThe government and the Central Bank have adopted a series of measures tosupport the financial system, parts of which have come under strain asBrazil moves to a low-inflation monetary system.a) PROERA package of measures concerns a special program created by the CentralBank and known as PROER (Program for Encouraging the Restructuring andStrengthening of the National Financial System).Created by Resolution 2208 of the Central Bank, PROER consists of thefollowing major elements:i) a special line of financial assistance linked to securities or otheroperations of the National Treasury or Federal Government entities, tolosses arising in the process of reorganization of financial institutions,to the costs of restructuring and modernizing operational systems and tomobilization of assets of the participating institutions. (Circular 2636 ofthe Central Bank sets out the principal conditions applicable to operationsusing this financial line);ii) availability of resources arising from compulsory deposits orcontributions, linked to acquisition of bank CDs issued by entitiesparticipating in PROER;iii) greater flexibility in reaching operational limits required offinancial institutions;iv) deferment of costs related to restructuring and modernizing offinancial institutions.In connection with this program the Government adopted a provisionalmeasure providing for several tax concessions to entities taking part inPROER, including the following:a) where an entity is incorporated to take over a failing institution, itmay treat the institution's difficult loans as losses ("difficult loans"are defined in Resolution  2210 of the Central Bank);b) the incorporating entities may treat as a financial cost, the differencebetween the purchase price of their investment and the book value of theirinterest in the acquired entity;c) for tax purposes, the losses described in a) and amortized costsdescribed in b) (up to a limit each year together with tax losses carriedforward from previous years, of 30% of gross profits) can be offset againstgross profits.Central Bank Circular 2633 specifies that access to the PROER program willbe decided on by the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis and is limited torecognized financial institutions which acquire the control of another suchinstitution or whose control passes to such institution or which assume therights and/or obligations of such an institution. The Circular specifiesthat admission to PROER does not diminish any criminal or other liabilitywhich the directors of an entity taken over might otherwise have.b) Other MeasuresProvisional Measure 1.182 applies the rules of existing legislation onquarantine of property ("indisponibilidade de bens") to that of the personscontrolling a financial institution which is the subject of intervention,liquidation or temporary special administration. It authorizes the CentralBank to take special measures such as injecting additional capital,transferring control or corporate restructuring for the purpose ofsafeguarding the public interest (including the interests of depositors)where a financial institution is in serious difficulty. It sets out thetypes of measures which can be taken with the prior authorization of theCentral Bank when a financial institution is subject to intervention,liquidation, as well as the measures which can be taken in respect of thedirectors of the affected institution.Resolution 2.212 of the Central Bank strengthens the capital adequacy andprudential requirements of financial institutions, particularly in thecontext of a change in the control of such institutions.Resolution 2.211 of the Central Bank approves the by-laws and regulationsof the Credit Guarantee Fund, which is designed to guarantee deposits andother credits against financial institutions in case of bankruptcy,insolvency or similar situations. Financial institutions contribute monthlyto the Fund an amount equal to 0.025% of the balance of accounts guaranteedby the Fund.(Source: Walter Douglas Stuber, Amaro, Stuber & Street, Sao Paulo)ColombiaPrivatization legislationFollowing a decision of the Constitutional Court, Congress has adoptedlegislation to regulate article 60 of the national constitution and thusprovide a general legal framework for privatizations. The new legislationprovides that privatizations must be carried out in accordance with aprogram approved the Finance Ministry and the relevant Ministry to whichthe respective entity is attached, which program must be notified toCongress.Each privatization must be carried out in a context which permits widedispersion of share ownership, protection of public resources and (whereapplicable) continuity of the public service which is provided by theprivatized entity.Current and former employees of the entity would be given preferred statusin the allocation of shares, as would, labor unions, employee pensionfunds, investment funds and similar entities.Shares in the relevant entity must be offered at a price which reflects thevaluation carried out under the authority of the relevant ministry. Offerscan only be made when arrangements have been put in place to enable thosehaving preferred allocation rights to exercise those rights, includingspecial lines of credit (minimum term 5 years: security interest on sharesbeing purchased). Those receiving preferred share allocations may berequired to retain their shares for up to 2 years and limits may be placedon the amount of shares allocated to senior management of the entityimmediately prior to privatization.The new legislation specifies that privatizations of financial institutionsare subject to the special legislation governing the financial sector andthat no privatizations of certain entities in which the State telecomcompany has an interest may be carried out before Jan. 1, 1998.(Source: Vincent Trevisani, Cavelier Abogados, Santafe de Bogot )MexicoAdjustments to financial institutions legislationA recent congressional decree has made some adjustments to the legislationgoverning banks, securities markets, insurance and guarantee companies andspecialized financial institutions. Among the changes are the following:i) provision is made so that the shares held by foreign financialinstitutions or insurers in their Mexican subsidiaries are clearlyidentified. At least 51% of the shares in the subsidiary must be held in aspecial category reserved to the foreign controlling entity (or its holdingsubsidiary). Those shares can only be disposed of with the priorauthorization of the Finance Ministry;ii) the limits on individual holdings of shares in insurance or guaranteecompanies can be exceeded where such a company is being converted into alocal subsidiary of a foreign entity;iii) financial institutions must establish systems for dealing with clientsinquiries and complaints and a system of arbitration is provided for beforethe National Banking and Securities Commission where a dispute persistsbetween a financial institution and its client;iv) special provision is made for recovery of claims owed to the nationalgovernment and generally for carrying out treasury activities in respect ofassets held by or belonging to the national government, including funds andsecurities.(Source: Antonio Prida, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, Mexico D.F.)Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SOVEREIGN FUND SEES VALUE IN VENEZUELA AND BULGARIADiego Aramburu, manager of Atlantic Security Bank's Atlantic SovereignFund, thinks Venezuelan and Bulgarian bonds will help him build on the23.06% gain the $26 million fund achieved last year.        The Cayman Island-registered fund, held by the offshore securitiesarm of Banco Credito de Peru, performed slightly behind the J.P. MorganEmerging Markets Bond Index Plus, which returned 26.78% in 1995. ButMicropal ranked the fund third out of 23 Latin American regional debt fundsthrough last November.         The fund is 100% emerging markets debt, and Aramburu, who investsmostly in Bradys and some sovereign Eurobonds for yield and liquidity,touts bonds of Venezuela and Bulgaria as values this year.        "We understand the risks in Venezuela. We think there arefundamental changes in the policy that will make Venezuela attractive,"says Aramburu, who works out of Lima and Miami. Though he is critical ofPresident Rafael Caldera's populist stance, he supports the government'srecent devaluation and thinks an IMF deal is coming soon.  He is alsocounting on banking, social and tax reforms to cut the fiscal deficit.Gasoline price hikes are also likely as part of an IMF deal, but the fundmanager differs from many analysts in believing that social unrest will notresult. "The population is understanding better that some measures need tobe taken. They are going in the right direction," says Aramburu.  But hepredicts that Caldera won't be reelected in 1998.        Aramburu recently bought options on Venezuelan DCBs, bringing theportfolio's Venezuelan holdings to 5%. "The fact is the market gave usrelative value with those," he says.        Aramburu also argues that Bulgarian Bradys, which make up 10% ofthe fund, are undervalued compared with Poland's. "There is not a bigdifference between those countries," he insists. "Bulgaria's financialnumbers are not the best, but they are improving." Aramburu thinksBulgarian IABs, yielding around 14%, are one of the most undervaluedinstruments available today.        The remainder of the fund's portfolio includes a heavy 10% positionin Peru, a standard 25% stake in Brazil, 15% holdings in each Argentina andMexico, 7% holdings in Nigeria and small positions in other Latincountries, such as Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.        The fund started in Oct. 1994 when the company merged the bank'sLatin and Growth funds. Aramburu had established the Latin Fund in 1990,shortly after joining the bank, and set up the Growth Fund two years later.But, "both funds had similar objectives so it didn't make sense to have thetwo separate," he says.         Fund products cannot be sold in the U.S. The Sovereign Fund paysdividends twice a year equal to six-month Libor + 1% of the value of thepurchase price of the fund's shares. Latin American private investors arethe typical clients,  and they purchase shares with a minimum investment of$50,000.        Aramburu, 34, is a total return investor who uses bottom-upfundamental analysis when making investment decisions. He also followspolitical situations closely, but acknowledges his worst mistakes have beenthose made primarily based on news from various newspapers around theglobe.        "The political part of analysis is very difficult to quantify, andwe are very much interested in quantification," says Aramburu, who holds aPh.D. in international economics from the University of Miami. Aramburufollows a model that establishes a relationship between the values ofassets against a country's fundamentals.        Aramburu generally holds assets for at least three months, buttrades part of the portfolio heavily once a month to find high yields. Thefund is now fully invested, compared to the 40% cash it held at thebeginning of 1995.         Aramburu maintains a 25% stake in Brazilian holdings because hefinds excellent values among DCBs, Exits and EI's.        Argentine FRBs and discounts make up the bulk of the 15% Argentinaposition. Aramburu says Argentina is being unfairly correlated with pre-peso devaluation Mexico; he thinks the country's stronger export sector andreserve position leave it in superior shape. Aramburu expects Mexico tostruggle mightily during the first half as fourth quarter 1995 numbers arereleased, but foresees improvements later in 1996.              One countryhe won't invest in is Russia, despite the $32 billion debt reschedulingagreement. "The problem with Russia is the lack of financial numbers," hesays. "It's like investing in a company that you don't have the financialsfor. I still don't have a grasp on what Russia's numbers are. --Dan B.LevineBack to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996BRAZIL BUYBACK TALK STOKES LDCSThe LDC debt market gained for the second straight week, despiteconcerns over the U.S. budget negotiations, rising about one point on theweek to Thursday.

ELM's three-year deal, joint led by ING and J.P. Morgan, wasoversubscribed two to one and enlarged from $100 million. ELM was to launchthe deal last November but backed out due to a difficult marketenvironment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia andEurope.        "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds,"says Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It wasrelatively attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and iswell priced and valued."        Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELMissue last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was lured back by thechanging sentiment towards Mexico.Nafinsa Gets Aggressive        Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro viaSalomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive andaggressive. The three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 bpover U.S. Treasuries. The deal, which carries a 144A option, was popularwith European retail investors, but some in the U.S. were not impressed.        "I think it's expensive for the investor. You can get Nafinsa paperwith the same spread for shorter maturities," says one.Argentina Weighs Yen        Argentina, fresh off of a DM 500 million ($347.8 million) deal twoweeks ago, is receiving bids for another issue, and may launch asubstantial yen deal this week, according to a yen source. "They'vereceived a number of different structures, but a yen deal looks good," thesource says. Argentina may launch either a five-year, 50 billion ($476.8million) deal with a 6% coupon or a three-year, 30 billion yen ($286million) issue with a 4.5% coupon, the source says. Nomura, Daiwa and Nikkoare in the running.        But Argentina may instead issue in Italian lira again to get abigger deal, according to the source.

Price talk is not available, but a source says it will besimilar to the 7% that Celulosa Arauco's $300 million Yankee carried lastDecember. "Chilgener is a better credit than Celulosa Arauco. It is betterrated and is a utility while Celulosa is in the forestry industry," thesyndicate source says.Brazilian Samurai Mandate Expected        Brazil is expected to award a mandate for a Samurai bond worth 30billion yen ($286 million). Nomura has been rumored to be named lead, butyen sources say it may not be a done deal. "Nomura has been backing off,"says one. "I think they believe their relationship with Brazil will beenough to get them the deal." The issue is expected to be for five yearswith a coupon of between 6% and 6.25% and may launch at the end ofFebruary.BBA Leads Brazilian Banks        Banco BBA Creditanstalt is expected to launch a DM 100 million($69.5 million) issue for three years this week via Banque Paribas. Thedeal is expected to carry an 8.63% coupon for a yield of 470 bp over thebund.

However, in a report by the Institute for InternationalFinance reviewingthe IFC changes, the banks cautioned that there are areas where the IFCneeds to be more clear about its efforts to avoid displacing private banks.        The banks expressed concern about the IFC continuing to participatein financing in countries that would have no trouble attracting privatesources, and should have been graduated from the IFC program by now, amongthem Chile, Colombia, Turkey and Thailand.        The IFC has left this "graduation" up to private banks, and has notset a clear criteria for staff to judge whether a company or country shouldbe treated as off limits. Often companies that have a long-standingrelationship with the IFC are inclined to return there in the future, evenwhen they could find private capital sources.        In these cases, the IFC should only become involved in exceptionalcircumstances, and limit participation to countries that could nototherwise find financing, the report stated, although it added the provisothat a country's graduation should be reversible, so that the IFC could re-enter if needed.        "In Latin America and Asia the private sector is capable of doingthe job, if not single-handedly, than at least predominantly," while thereis much more need for the IFC in Africa, said Donald McCouch, groupexecutive of Chemical Bank, who participated in preparing the report.However, McCouch said the IFC should be given credit for trying to adapt toa changing world.        The IIF report, which focuses on nine areas of the new IFCguidelines, in general was in favor of the changes. "We believe the IFC istaking important steps towards increasing its effectiveness and increasingits ability to catalyze private finance for developing countries," saidCharles Dallara, managing director of the IIF.        "It will help focus the efforts on places where it is most needed,and greatly reduces if not eliminates the displacement of private sector,"Dallara told reporters, adding that scarce IFC resources should not be usedon a project that could be financed wholly with private funds.        The report also recommended the IFC limit its activities insecurities underwriting and equity participation to exceptional cases whereit is clear the transaction would not be completed without IFCparticipation.        The value of IFC participation in underwriting international issueshas been limited, since it has worked with well-known companies indeveloping countries that could have been underwritten by privateinvestment banks. However, IFC has scaled back its operations in this area.        There also were concerns about a conflict of interest when the IFCacts as a lender, particularly in a B-loan syndication, in a company inwhich it has equity interest.        The report praised the IFC for deciding to refrain from competingin bidding for privatization advisory mandates, but said the IFC shouldcontinue to scale back its advisory operations, and stay out of any biddingfor such programs. It should concentrate on establishing regulatoryenvironments necessary for privatization, model privatization transactionsin countries like Russia and the Ukraine, and focus on those where there isnegligible private sector interest, such as Haiti.        Bankers stressed that in no instance should the IFC link financialsupport to obtaining the advisory mandates, which Dallara said he has seenhappen many times in the past.        The report also recommended the IFC increase its use of guaranteesto leverage private financing, continue its efforts to diversity sources ofco-financing for B-loan syndications, use private sources more forappraising, arranging and managing project financing, and put in place anappeals procedure for institutions concerned about displacement.Back to Headline List CopyrightEMERGING MARKETS DEBT REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996PEOPLEThe next two weeks will be nervewracking for Chemical Bank andChase Manhattan emerging markets division employees,  as Chemical/Chase co-emerging markets heads Daniel Canel and Jorge V.

Canel and Jasson named 13 top managers last month for the newcapital markets division: seven from Chase and six from Chemical. Chasehead Brady trader George P. Grunebaum and Chemical managing director RaulPonte become head traders in the U.S., while Barry J. Hoffner and Brian C.Lazell, each of Chemical, hold the same positions in London. Chase researchhead Lawrence J. Brainard maintains the same position in the consolidatedgroup, with Chemical research chief Thomas J. Trebat as deputy. Chase headof syndication Cynthia Powell also keeps her spot, Chase's Federico L.Amadeo is responsible for Latin America origination and Chemical's GabrielG. Politzer will cover Latin America local markets and external debt.        Also, Chase's John P. Colligan has been tapped to handle U.S.sales, while Chase's Gustavo M. Dominguez is responsible for derivatives,structured products and arbitrage. Rounding out the appointments areChemical's Anette L. Kolenda, named business manager, and Chase's RachelleC. Keller, who was selected as Kolenda's deputy.        Noticeably absent from the list is Chemical syndication head JuanLacroze, who helped engineer Mexico's $1.5 billion Eurobond last December.Lacroze is remaining with the new Chase--just not in the syndicationdepartment.

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996COMMISSION INVITES COMMENT SECOND BANKING DIRECTIVETHE DECEMBER issue of European Banker, in the article Freedom orfallacy?, discussed some aspects of the Commission communication oninterpretation of the Second Banking Directive, highlighting differentMember State interpretations of the Directive and quoting some initialreactions to the communication by national banking associations. EUFinancial Industry Monitor readers may be interested in more details onthis text of major importance.The Commission published its text, strictly speaking a DraftCommunication entitled "Freedom to provide services and the interest ofthe general good in the Second Banking Directive", in the OfficialJournal No C 291 of 4.11.95.An introductory passage states that the Draft is "the Commission'scontribution to the discussions under way on the problems associatedwith freedom to provide services and the interest of the general good"under the Second Directive. It points out that the discussions have sofar been restricted to the Member States in the Banking Advisory Groupand the Working Party on the Interpretation of the Banking Directives.The Commission, however, "takes the view that the broadest possibleconsultation should be held on its interpretative work" and so invitesinterested parties to submit comments on the Draft by 4.3.96. Afterconsideration of any such comments, the Draft will, if appropriate,become a Commission interpretative communication which will give banksan idea of how the Commission will view particular problems brought toits attention.This is a most unusual step. First of all, it is very rare for theCommission to issue interpretative communications on directives. It hasdone so in the case of several of its own regulations, for example inthe competition policy field, but very seldom in the case of Councildirectives since they have to be implemented through national law.Secondly, although the Commission has certainly consulted interestedparties in the past on the interpretation of EU legislation, it hasnever published a draft interpretative document with an invitation tothe world to comment on its intended interpretation.The reason for taking this unusual step is very honestly stated in theintroduction to the Draft Communication:"In the course of its contacts with numerous economic operators, theCommission has come to realise that continuing uncertainty with regardto the interpretation of basic concepts, such as freedom to provideservices and the interest of the general good, has seriously underminedthe workings of the machinery set up by the Second Directive and issuch as to deter certain credit institutions from exercising the veryfreedoms which the Second Directive sets out to promote."It is also worth emphasising that this Draft Communication may be onlythe first in a series. The Commission has tipped off the specialised EUpress that it considers it premature to issue such Drafts for the"third generation" insurance directives and the Investment ServicesDirective but that it is already reflecting on the problems ofinterpretation of these measures and is committed to the coherence ofthe positions adopted for all financial services.This is hardly surprising, given the great reluctance of certain MemberStates to open up their insurance and securities markets to servicesprovided cross-frontier and their alleged use of the general goodprovisions of directives to make life difficult for institutions fromother Member States.The Commission's approachOnly the European Court of Justice can give a final, definitiveinterpretation of EU law. The Commission, therefore, makes it clear inits Draft Communication that the contents are without prejudice to anyEuropean Court of Justice interpretation of the Second BankingDirective.What the Commission has done is to restate the principles laid down bythe Court of Justice in giving judgment in cases involving the freedomto provide services and the interest of the general good in other areasof EU law and to examine the application of these principles to theSecond Banking Directive.In a key passage which is implicitly revelatory of the restrictiveposition of some Member States, the Commission states that itsinterpretations of the Directive "do not necessarily represent theviews of the Member States" but then makes a threat:"However, in accordance with its duties as guardian of the Treatyreserves the right to exercise the powers vested in it by the Treaty(Article 169)."In other words, the Commission is warning the Member States that,although they may not agree with how it interprets the Directive, ifthey go against that interpretation the Commission will not hesitate tostart Treaty infringement proceedings against them. The DraftCommunication takes up thirteen-and-a-half Official Journal pages andis both discursive and legalistic.Freedom to provide servicesUnder the single licence system, a bank authorised in a Member State isentitled to provide services without an establishment in any otherMember States after going through the sole formality of notifying itshome Member State regulatory authorities of its intention to do this.The Commission's Draft Communication addresses:1) the services covered by the Directive, 2) commencement of theprovision of services.The first of these is sub-divided into: a) nature of services; b) formsof provision of services; c) provision of services; and d) nature ofthe notification.Nature of servicesArticle 20(1) of the Second Banking Directive states that:"Any credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provideservices by carrying on its activities within the territory of anotherMember State for the first time shall notify the competent authoritiesof the home Member State of the activities on the list in the Annexwhich it intends to carry on."This makes it clear that only the "core banking activities" listed inthe Annex to the Second Banking Directive are covered by the freedom toprovide services. It is equally clear that the notification procedureonly applies where services are to be provided for the first time.Article 23(2) of the Directive explicitly states that rights acquiredby credit institutions which provided services before the Directivecame into force are not affected.The Draft Notice then examines the questions of: 1) whether the factthat an activity has only been carried on once or a few times beconsidered enough to confer acquired rights; and 2) how far back intime should one go to find evidence of past activity.For the Commission it would be "absurd to set a quantitative limit . .institution has acquired rights if it provided a service at least oncein another Member State, regardless of when. However, the Commissionadds that:1) this activity must have been carried on lawfully, that is, inconformity with the law in force in the host Member State at the time;and2) the institution must be able to provide, if necessary, evidence ofits past activity.It also adds that institutions with acquired rights cannot be subjectedby their home Member State authorities to more onerous procedures thanwere applied before the Second Directive came into effect. For example,they will not have to notify the authorities of their intention tocontinue providing the services under Second Directive terms. Thenotification procedure only applies to services to be supplied for thefirst time.Forms of provision of servicesArticle 20(1) of the Directives requires notification for services tobe provided "within the territory of another Member State". On thebasis of European Court of Justice interpretation of the Treatyprovisions on freedom to provide services, the Commission DraftCommunication addresses the provision of services when there is"movement" and also addresses rules on advertising.The bank providing a service may move, in the sense that staff may goto the other Member State for the purposes of providing the service.The Commission considers that this situation is "undoubtedly" coveredby freedom to provide services.Conversely, the receiver of the service may be the person to move, thatis, he/she comes to the Member State where a credit institution isestablished without this being the result of canvassing by theinstitution. No notification to the home Member State authorities isrequired in that situation.Nevertheless, an institution which before the Second Banking Directivecame into effect and only provided services to clients from otherMember States in that way, would have to notify if it intends to startseeking new clients through canvassing in other Member States or bytravelling to them.The third situation is where the service itself moves, that is, wherethe service is provided by post or by modern communication method suchas telephone, fax, telex, electronic mail. In this case, the Commissionmakes a distinction between whether the service is provided at thecustomer's initiative or whether it follows canvassing by the creditinstitution. In the first case, the institution is exempt fromnotification but, in the second, the canvassing is proof of anintention to provide a service in another Member State and notificationis, therefore, necessary.It follows that the notification procedure should be completed beforethe credit institution and its customers establish "commercialrelations". The Draft Communication points out that, where a creditinstitution subsequently wishes to offer services not covered by itsinitial notification, an additional notification would have to be madefirst.Advertising in another Member StateWhen does advertising amount to an intention to provide services inanother Member State and so create the obligation to notify? TheCommission's starting point is that:"It is only where, by its very nature, the advertisement constitutescommercial canvassing, ranking as an actual invitation, issued at adistance, to enter into a contract, or where it precedes a physicaljourney by the supplier, that it constitutes an intention to provide aservice within the territory of another Member State, within themeaning of Article 20."Two scenarios then arise. The first is where the bank which places anadvertisement does not intend to go subsequently to the consumer'sMember State of residence. In this case, the Commission considers thatnotification of the intention to advertise is required when twoconditions are both met:1) the advertisement contains sufficient information for the consumerto make up his mind (for example, interest rate, duration, cost); and2) the contract can be concluded at a distance, that is, by reply slip,letter, telephone etc, without the bank and the customer having tomeet. If, however, the contract cannot be concluded without theconsumer going to the Member State where the bank is established,notification is not required.The second scenario is where the bank intends to go to the consumer'sMember State of residence to conclude a contract for a service whichhas been advertised. Notification is required in this case. There maybe difficulties of classification. The Draft Communication takes theexample of advertisements in Europe-wide publications or TV channels.The Commission considers that notification would only be necessary ifsuch an advertisement were directed at a specific Member State, forexample, if it appeared in a national edition of an internationalnewspaper.Provision of services compared to establishmentThe case law of the European Court of Justice makes a cleardistinction. When a service is provided in a host Member State, thepresence there is temporary. Establishment, in contrast, implies theexistence of permanent premises in the host Member State.The Court has also ruled that, in the case of an activity carried outtemporarily but frequently, the Member States may apply their rules forinstitutions which are established there if an institution invokes thefreedom to provide services abusively, so as to avoid the local rulesfor established institutions.The Draft Notice then considers some cases where it is difficult todraw the line between provision of services and establishment -electronic machines, recourse to independent intermediaries and thepermanent presence of the institution's own staff in another MemberState.Electronic machinesElectronic machines capable of performing Second Directive core bankingactivities may be covered by the concept of establishment.A machine is unlikely to be a credit institution's only place ofbusiness in another Member State. In the normal course of events, amachine would be attached to a branch, agency or some other form ofestablishment and so would not be "an entity in its own right". As aresult, it would be subject to the rules applicable to theestablishment to which it is attached.In the unlikely event of an electronic machine being a creditinstitution's sole presence in another Member States, then, in theCommission's view, the machine would be deemed to be a provider ofservices. As such, it would have to be notified, subject to the "firsttime" rules already described.As a provider of services, a machine would be subject to the generalgood rules of the host country. In that respect, the DraftCommunication gives as an example the need for a machine to show atelephone number in the host country.Independent intermediariesIn its discussion of whether an intermediary used by a creditinstitution to do business in another Member State is or is not to beregarded as a permanent establishment, the Commission's DraftCommunication quotes extensively from the case law of the EuropeanCourt of Justice. It concludes that the links between a creditinstitution and an independent intermediary in another Member Stateamount to the institution having a branch in the second Member Statewhen the intermediary meets three cumulative criteria:- he has received an exclusive brief from that credit institution andfrom no other;- he is empowered to negotiate on the credit institution's behalf andto bind it;- he operates on a permanent basis.This raises the question of the intermediary who acts on behalf of morethan one credit institution and here the Commission distinguishes twoscenarios.Where the intermediary acts exclusively for a group of creditinstitutions which have jointly called on his services, all of them aredeemed to be established in the form of a branch, assuming that theother criteria are met.The other situation is where the intermediary acts for a number ofcredit institutions which have not jointly called on his services. Inthat case, the first of the branch criteria - receiving an exclusivebrief - is not met. Therefore, the instructing credit institutions arenot established in the second Member State and are providing a servicethrough an intermediary. Notification is required.The Draft Communication then examines the situation in those MemberStates which require intermediaries to be given mandates by the creditinstitutions for which they act.Without giving explicit answers, the Commission states that it wouldhave to examine the extent of the mandate, the credit institution'sability to control the intermediary, the possibility for theintermediary to commit the mandating credit institution.Finally, the Draft Communication considers the situation where theintermediary is itself a credit institution. If the intermediary offersits customers the products of another credit institution, the latterwould have to notify its intention of exercising the freedom to provideservices in its intermediary's Member State unless, of course, it iscovered by the acquired rights provision.If, on the other hand, the intermediary provides accommodation to abranch of the other credit institution, there would have to benotification of the intention to exercise the freedom of establishment.Permanent presence of staffUnder this heading, there are two situations - either a creditinstitution's staff in another Member State carry on a banking activityor they do not.If they do carry on a banking activity, they constitute a branch. Since1.1.93, a branch start-up has required prior notification under theSecond Directive. If it was operational before that date with anyauthorisation required by the host Member State's legislation, itenjoys acquired rights under the Directive and so notification is notrequired. If it was operational before that date but without thenecessary local authorisation, it requires notification as it had notstarted operations "in accordance with the provisions in force in (its)host Member State".The presence in another Member State of a credit institution's staffwho do not carry on a banking activity - in other words arepresentative office - does not, in the Commission view, constitute abranch and so does not require notification. That does not, however,prevent the host member State requiring the institution to inform it ofthe opening of the office and to go through "a registration procedurethat would have to be a mere formality". The host member State wouldalso be at liberty to carry out "a simple, unsystematic check toascertain whether the office is not, in fact, engaged in bankingactivities".Nature of the notificationThis is dealt with very simply in the Draft Communication. For theCommission, the Second Directive's notification procedure:"pursues a simple objective of exchange of information betweensupervisory authorities and is not a consumer protection measure."The Draft Communication continues by stating that notification cannotbe considered "a procedural condition underlying the validity ofbanking contract". In other words, a bank which has not fulfilled anotification requirement can be penalised for this failure but thecontracts it has entered into the second Member State cannot beannulled on the grounds of non- notification.In the Commission's view, that would be contrary to the Community lawprinciple of proportionality and would negatively affect the legalcertainty of contracts entered into in good faith.Commencement of the provision of servicesArticle 20(2) of the Second Banking Directive states:"The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, within onemonth of receipt of the notification mentioned in paragraph 1, sendthat notification to the competent authorities of the host MemberState."The Draft Communication contrasts this provision on the freedom toprovide services with the corresponding provision on freedom ofestablishment. The latter (Article 19(5) of the Directive) requires thecredit institution to wait for receipt by the branch of a"communication" by the host Member State authorities.In the absence of any such communication after a period of two months,it can start operating. The Draft Communication points out that whenthe proposed Directive was being examined in Council the idea ofapplying that rule to both freedom of establishment and freedom toprovide services was rejected.The Draft Communication continues: "In the Commission's opinion, the re-introduction, by way of interpretation, of formalities which the MemberStates did not wish to see in the definitive version of the textadopted by the Council is neither desirable nor in keeping with thespirit and letter of the Second Directive."In other words, a credit institution can start exercising the freedomto provide services in another Member State once it has notified itsintentions to its home Member State authorities, which have one monthin which to notify the host country authorities. The credit institutionmay well ask the host country authorities to confirm receipt from thehome country authorities of the institution's notification but thatconfirmation cannot be a prior condition for starting to provideservices. Making confirmation a pre-requisite "is unacceptable andconstitutes an infringement of the Second Directive".The general good in the second banking directiveThe general good part of the Draft Communication discusses firstly thenotification of conditions to be met in the interest of the generalgood and, secondly, the applicability of rules adopted in the interestof the general good.Notification of conditions to be met in the interest of the generalgoodThis section of the Draft Commission discusses the interpretation ofArticle 19(4) of the Second Directive which provides that:"Before the branch of a credit institution commences its activities thecompetent authorities of the host Member State shall, within two monthsof receiving the information mentioned in paragraph 3, prepare for thesupervision of the credit institution in accordance with Article 21and, if necessary, indicate the conditions under which, in the interestof the general good, those activities must be carried on in the hostMember State."It appears that uncertainty has arisen regarding the words "ifnecessary". Some Member States have considered that this imposes anobligation to indicate the general good conditions to a branch. Othershave read the words as merely giving an option or a "moral obligation".The Commission considers that it is an option. Its principal reason forstating this is that the text says nothing about the form and contentof notification of general good conditions. That being so, it would beimpossible to verify whether the "obligation" had been complied with.In addition, there is no detailed, harmonised definition of "thegeneral good". It may vary from one Member State to another and may notapply in the same areas in host and home Member States. Also, "there isno way of knowing in advance what the credit institution wants toobtain".In conclusion, it is up to a credit institution which wishes to operatein another Member State to establish the situation, either by its ownefforts or by asking the host Member State authorities.Even if these authorities were to refuse to give the information, therewould be no breach of Community law, although any harm suffered mightbe subject to a remedy under the national law.Applicability of rules adopted in the interest of the general goodServicesThe case law of the European Court of Justice has already laid down anumber of requirements on the national provisions which may be appliedto undertakings exercising the freedom to supply services. These mustnot only be in the general good but also be:- non-discriminatory;- objectively necessary; and- proportionate to the objective pursued.In addition, the interest of the general good must not be safeguardedby rules to which the service provider is already subject in the MemberState of establishment (non-duplication).Finally, any restrictions on the grounds of the general good must be infields which are not the subject of EU-level harmonisation.Harmonisation by Directive has already established what the Commissioncalls the "Community general good". Thus, for example, nationalmeasures on own funds, the solvency ratio, deposit guarantees or largeexposures cannot be justified on general good grounds because of theDirectives on these issues.The Draft Communication then states that the Second Banking Directiveadds nothing new to this case law as far as freedom to provide servicesis concerned.EstablishmentThe European Court of Justice case law is essentially the same in thefield of establishment, with the additional rule that a nationalprovision which is discriminatory against branches of institutions ofother Member States may be justified on the grounds of public policy,public security and public health.The case law has recognised a number of areas as being covered by theconcept of the general good. Those relevant to the financial servicessector are:- protection of recipients of services;- protection of workers;- protection of consumers;- preservation of the good reputation of the national financial  sector;- the prevention of fraud;- social order;- protection of intellectual property;- the cohesion of the tax system.This list could be added to by the Court of Justice.Measures in these areas would have to be justified on the grounds ofthe interest of the general good and also respect the principles ofCommunity law already cited under services, that is, non-discrimination, non-duplication, necessity and proportionality.There then follows a rather theoretical and legalistic discussionleading to the conclusion that:"depending on the circumstances, the same restriction applied in theinterest of the general good could be adjudged proportionate in respectof a branch, but disproportionate in respect of a service provider."That is followed by a long and equally legalistic passage on the linkbetween rules governing the interest of the general good and lawapplicable to banking contracts.By determining the law applicable to a banking contract, it is possibleto establish the law applicable to the service proposed by the bank.This raises the relationship between the mutual recognition provisionsof the Second Banking Directive and the rules laid down in the 1980Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.There is, of course, an important issue here. If the Rome Conventionhas the result that the law applicable to a banking contract is that ofthe home Member State, can the host Member State then apply its generalgood rules to the bank's operations on its territory, as it should beable to do under the Second Directive?The Commission's answer to this is that the Directive's mutualrecognition principle should be given effect through a three- stageprocess:- the law applicable to a banking contract should be established on thebasis of the Rome Convention;- it should then be established whether the result of that first stepconstitutes an obstacle to mutual recognition;- if there is no obstacle, then the host Member State law would applyto the banking contract without further ado. If there is an obstacle,the host Member State law would only apply if that can be justified bythe general good and if the European Court's criteria for applicationof general good measures are met.ConclusionsThe Draft Communication ends with three conclusions.Firstly, the Commission does not believe that a banking activity can becarried on under the same conditions in home and host Member States,whatever the circumstances. Host country civil, criminal, tax or labourlaws will apply to the branch or foreign service provider as these arenot affected by the Second Directive.Secondly, non-discriminatory restrictions applying to the serviceitself must, however, satisfy the general good test (and theaccompanying principles of proportionality etc) regardless of whetherthe banking service is provided through a branch or from another MemberState under the freedom to supply services.Here, the Commission makes specific reference to restrictions applyingto:1) the intrinsic features of the service such as cost, interest rates,duration, contractual terms and conditions;2) the underlying financial techniques; and3) the way the service is marketed, such as advertising, canvassingetc.Finally, application of the proportionality principle to measuresjustified in the interest of the common good will produce varyingresults for credit institutions operating in another Member State underthe freedom to supply services or through a branch.Draft Commission Communication: Freedom to provide services and theinterest of the general good in the Second Banking Directive: OfficialJournal C 291 of 4.11.95.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

FINANCIAL INDUSTRY MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MORE DETAILS ON NEW APPROACHES TO THE HARMONISATION OF ACCOUNTINGTHE NOVEMBER 1995 issue of EU Financial Industry Monitor reportedcomments by Commissioner Mario Monti on the possibility of adopting anew approach to accounting standards. Since then, he has obtained fromhis Commission colleagues approval for a Communication entitledAccounting harmonisation: a new strategy vis-a-vis internationalharmonisation. This is essentially a discussion document, although itsets out fairly clearly what the Commission intends doing.The Communication starts by setting out the reasons for a new strategy:- the known shortcomings of the existing EU legislation. Thederogations and Member State options which have detracted fromharmonisation under the basic Fourth and Seventh Directives - oncompany accounts and consolidated accounts respectively - have beencarried forward into the Bank Accounts Directive and the InsuranceAccounts Directive;- the absence of progress on harmonisation since these measures wereadopted and the unlikelihood of new legislation. The Communicationreports that a conference in 1990 brought out a clear preference fornot adopting new legislation in the near future;- the problems faced by large European companies seeking capital on theinternational markets. In particular, companies seeking capital on theNew York Stock Exchange have to draw up separate accounts according toUS Generally Accepted Accounting Practices since accounts drawn upaccording to European standards are not accepted in the US, althoughthe reverse is the case;- the importance of the international harmonisation process and thedanger that in the present situation Europe can contribute little tothis process and then face problems of compatibility between itsstandards and international ones.After setting out these problems, the Commission Communication brieflycites several solutions which have been aired with the Member States:amending the Directives so as to exempt large listed companies and letthem follow other rules, negotiating a mutual recognition agreementwith the US, setting up a European Accounting Standard Setting Body.All of these are rejected for one reason or another.The Communication then sets out the Commission's proposed approach,which will have to gain the explicit support and agreement of theMember States. It emphasises that this new approach does not involvethe EU abandoning the field of accounting harmonisation but, on thecontrary, strengthens "its commitment and contribution to theinternational standard-setting process, which offers the most efficientand rapid solution for the problems of companies operating on a world-wide scale".The Commission's proposed approach consists of four steps.Checking the conformity of existing international accounting standardswith the accounting directivesThis is a priority, given the urgent issue of European companiesseeking listings on international capital markets.The Contact Committee on the Accounting Directives, set up by theFourth Directive, would examine the compatibility of the IAS with theDirectives. Conformity is an essential first step if the Member Statesare to allow their large companies to prepare accounts on an IAS basis.The Communication points out that the Member States would have to gothrough the same exercise for their national laws because of theoptions in the EU Directives. An IAS could be compatible with theDirectives but not with national law.Inconsistencies between the Directives and IAS would have to beexamined case-by-case so as to resolve conflicts. The InternationalAccounting Standards Committee could be asked to change the standard inquestion (the IASC executive has expressed its willingness to considerchanges) but, if necessary, the Commission would propose changes to theDirectives. To that end, the Commission believes that seriousconsideration should be given to an accelerated procedure for amendingthe Directives by a committee.European contributions to the work of the IASCTo ensure EU input to the IASC, the Contact Committee should examineIASC Exposure Drafts and try to reach agreed positions on them. Theagreed positions would be sent to the IASC. In this way, the Commissionbelieves that the EU can build up a position of influence, possiblyeven extending to IASC agenda fixing.This would involve enlarging the role of the Contact Committee and theCommission favours the setting-up of technical sub- committees.Priority would be given to consolidated accounts for two reasons.Firstly, it is those companies which prepare consolidated accountswhich are most exposed to the problems described in the Communication.Secondly, a general approach covering individual company accounts wouldbe more likely to raise problems with the Member States because of thelink between company accounts and taxation.Improving the comparability of accountsThe Contact Committee should increase its efforts in this area bydealing with practical problems in the application of the Directives.For its part, the Commission will co-operate with the Contact Committeewith a view to improving coordination among the Member State bodiesinvolved in standard-setting.The Commission might, for example, incorporate the advice of theContact Committee in interpretative communications or recommendations.Where appropriate, it would publicise the work of the ContactCommittee.The Directives under the new approachThe new approach can only operate within the limits laid down by theDirectives. Therefore, if it proves necessary, the Commission willpropose amending directives, although it would clearly prefer to avoidthat course and hopes that legislation can be avoided in most instancesby "effective technical co- operation" in the Contact Committee.To that end, it is essential that all institutions involved inaccounting standard-setting are involved in Committee's work.Similarly, the Commission considers that there should be co- ordinationbetween the Committee and the Accounting Advisory Forum, whichrepresents users and preparers of accounts and which at present ispurely consultative.Contact Committee members could attend Forum meetings and the Forum'sexpertise could be "associated" with the Committee's technical work.The Communication ends with a conclusion that"The Union needs to movepromptly to offer the users and preparers of accounts a clear prospectthat companies seeking listings on the US and other world markets willbe able to remain within the EU accounting framework and that the USGAAP, over which they and their governments can exercise no influence,is not the only option".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It published an invitationto tender for a study to this end in the Official Journal C 233 of 7September.The invitation to tender, in its description of the proposed study,states:"Some banking services which were in the past apparently free of chargefor consumers are now explicitly charged and some are becoming ratherexpensive. On the basis of information from several Member States, theprice of these services is increasing faster than the rate ofinflation. The introduction of a single currency will also imply a newcost structure for some of these services (for example, cross-bordertransactions)."DG XXIV, therefore, aims to create an instrument to compare MemberState price structures and to follow their evolution. The instrumentwill be set up before the end of this year and updated annually. Itwill cover the management of consumer bank accounts and relatedoperations in all 15 Member States.The first stage of the study will be to determine for each of theMember States the typical use of a bank account by the consumer orgroup of consumers and to establish the average cost to these consumersof the typical use.Since national habits vary - the relative use of cheques, banktransfers, debit cards, credit cards, etc - the study will have toensure comparability of study results.All costs borne by consumers will be covered by the study, includingannual administration charges, transaction fees, interest lost throughdeferred value dates, consumer credit linked to credit cards andoverdrafts.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

With between 120 and 150 partnersbelieved to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000per partner.The action related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADTfor Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million forBritannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had beenaudited by Binder.Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profitswere #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assetswere less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT waseventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit againstBinder in 1992.The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its auditof Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADTbecause of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off onthe accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop wasasked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accountsgave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishopreplied that he did.Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted aduty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for anyadvice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which heldthat auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties regardless ofwhether they are negligent.Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it willsucceed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparoprinciples apply," a spokesman said. The appeal, which will not beginuntil next year, could take a year or more to run its course.BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of thefirm, which still uses the Binder Hamlyn name, joined the ArthurAndersen Worldwide Organisation (EA 49). Bishop is still with BinderHamlyn in London.Most of Binder's regional offices merged with Stoy Hayward (EA 46),which subsequently became BDO's UK member firm, while some partnersjoined other accounting firms or went into industry.

Since then, a further 70 consulting staffhave jumped ship.The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, are a blow tothe firm's consulting business, which reported revenues of Pta2.67billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times that of E&Y.According to a C&L spokesperson, the consulting practice had justreturned to profit after several difficult years during Spain'srecession.Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director ofE&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managingdirector. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have beenmade partners at E&Y."This was part of a plan we started a couple of years ago when I camefrom the US, and that was to increase the size of E&Y in Spain," McKaysaid. "It became clear to us that to achieve the growth, we needed tobecome a competitive force. We couldn't do it through internal growth,we needed external resources at a senior level. That included bringingin as managing director a Spaniard who would run the practice."E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but didnot specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the former C&Lpartners were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & YoungConsultores is a separate firm with its own profit pool.The raid is not E&Y's first attempt to build a strong consulting arm inSpain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a consulting divisionwhen Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in 1989 and the 1993establishment of E&Y Consultores with financial backing from E&Y in theUS - were not as successful as the firm would have liked.Although head-hunting is not rare, the scale of E&Y's raid isunprecedented and has been perceived by C&L as a direct attempt tosteal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the firm. C&Lis reported to be taking legal action against E&Y and the formerpartners.It accuses E&Y of breaching Spain's fair trade laws and of inducing C&Lstaff to break their legal commitments to the firm by offering themfinancial compensation to leave without giving the required 15 days'notice.McKay denied this. "We believe we have acted in accordance with thelaws and contractual obligations of all the people," he said. "Thepeople who have joined us have joined of their own free will andexercised their professional rights in the marketplace."E&Y also denies trying to steal C&L's business and has offered to`lend' C&L its former consultants to finish work already in hand, anoffer which C&L described as cynical and not worthy of consideration.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

MRI has alsosigned up a correspondent firm in Finland.The new firm, to be known as Revision Noraudit & Co AS, will haverevenues of roughly NKr160 million ($27 million), a figure which willgive it sixth place in the local rankings ahead of Price Waterhouse andbehind the other Big Six affiliates. The staff figure totals around250, including 48 partners, and the new firm will operate out of 17offices.The merger was "purely" driven by national considerations, according toKjetil Rivelsrud, chairman of the new firm and formerly executivechairman of Noraudit. "We'd made a decision that we had to make amerger in Norway to strengthen our coverage," he said. "We talked withRevisorGruppen about a merger and the result was that we had to chooseone of the [international] groups. RevisorGruppen had more referredwork for Norway than Nexia, so we decided that MRI was the betterchoice."Rivelsrud said the merger is a good strategic fit. His firm is strongin Oslo and the northern part of the country, while the MRI affiliateis well represented in Bergen and Stavangar in the west of the country.RevisorGruppen, the smaller of the two firms, comprised a network of 11offices, two of which - Molde and Horten - have opted out of themerger. Those practices accounted for revenues of between NKr10 millionand NKr15 million, Rivelsrud said.Revision Noraudit's fiscal 1994 revenues totalled NKr119 million. Oneassociated firm, with revenues of NKr5 million, has opted out of themerger, while Nexia Consulting AS, which is partly owned by theauditing firm, is also remaining independent of the new firm.Noraudit previously represented Deloitte Haskins & Sells, but opted outof the global merger with Touche Ross in 1990. It joined forces withNexia in 1992, and last year changed its name from Deloitte Norauditfollowing a legal dispute with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Internationalover the use of the Deloitte name. Rivelsrud said the two sidesresolved the dispute through an out- of-court settlement.Noraudit's defection naturally leaves Nexia with a gap in its Europeancoverage."They felt they had to do a merger locally," said NigelHodges, Nexia's executive director. Hodges admitted that Nexia does notrefer much work into Norway and said the group will use the services ofOla Petter Hopp, a former senior manager at Noraudit now operating as aconsultant, until a new member can be found.Meanwhile, in Finland, MRI has linked up with Tilimerkono, a two-partner Helsinki-based firm with revenues of $500,000. The firm, whichhas nine staff, was recommended by MRI's Danish member, City RevisionA/S, and will help MRI expand into the Baltic countries, according toJohn Cox, the network's executive director. The Helsinki practice waspreviously unaffiliated.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It will be debated by Jersey legislators in the firstquarter of 1996 and, if approved, will then go to the UK Privy Councilfor sanctioning. The measure is expected to become law before the endof the year.Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the Jerseyproposal. Solicitors, architects and surveyors will also be able toestablish partnerships on the island, as could practices from othercountries.Under the proposed law, which was devised in consultation with PW andE&Y, the LLP would remain totally liable for all the firm's debts, butindividual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligentact would have their personal assets protected from debts arising fromthat negligence.Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and allLLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP wouldbe required to put up a #5 million ($8 million) bond for judgmentsagainst the partnership."We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liabilitypartnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Ysenior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number ofclients and all of our partners have produced a very positivereaction." Privately, E&Y sources said the firm plans to move to LLPstatus as soon as possible."At the moment, if you're found to be liable for negligence, thenyou're liable for everything, no matter what your contribution to thatnegligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of CharteredAccountants in England and Wales in trying to get the government tochange the UK legal principle of joint and several liability. "Thiscan't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things take time and timeis not necessarily on our side." In the meantime, the firms need a wayto protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law forpartnerships, which was created in 1907, as "not relevant to moderntimes". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primarylegislation would be needed to change it, he said.The proposal allows E&Y and PW to maintain their partnership culturewithin the UK and there will be no change to their UK taxationarrangements. The Jersey option is claimed to be cheaper than theincorporation route chosen recently by KPMG (EA 60). A senior partnerat one of the firms estimates the saving could be as much as 10 percentof pre-tax profits compared with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.However, some KPMG sources raised doubts over how effective the LLPoption will be in preventing potential litigants in the UK frompursuing a partnership registered in Jersey through the British courts.KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman declined to comment on the legaladvice his firm had received. "When we made our decision to incorporatewe were aware of the Jersey option and we discounted it," he said. "Fora number of reasons - one of which was the degree of security we werelooking for - we elected to go the route we have."(See page 8 for more analysis)Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Manchester-based company, which wasowned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin Harrison, was mainlyinvolved in leasing cars, property and computer equipment.Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a duediligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate financeadvice in connection with the transaction.In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations andadvice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceedwith the acquisition."It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition,Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the wayit was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position beenrevealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not haveproceeded with the acquisition."In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions ofSch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing and, in 1992, forced theresignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of itsUK operations.However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted areal due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said thefirm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisitiontook place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuationat the time of the purchase."We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defendthem," Hainsworth said.The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The casecould take two years to be heard.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CODE DEMANDS SCRUTINY OF HIGH-RISK CLIENTSNEW REGULATIONS in Germany have introduced a Big Six-style  approachthat requires all of the country's auditors to adopt a risk-basedapproach to their work.The new requirements have been jointly issued by theWirtschaftspruferkammer (WPK), the state auditing body run by thefederal minister of economics, and the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer(IdW), the private professional body that represents Germany's 6,000accountants.In future, all statutory auditors will have to analyse their clients'operating environments, assess the influence of general risk factors,make a provisional judgement about inherent business risk, and evaluateinternal control procedures.The risk-based approach, long used by the Big Six in Germany andelsewhere, has now become part of the official guidelines which statethat "the high-risk audit areas should be given greater weight in theaudit process".The new guidelines form part of a revised code of conduct on auditquality. The code, which was last amended in 1982, has been updated inan attempt to dissuade the justice ministry in Bonn from introducingtougher legislative controls on auditors. For the first time, theprofession's quality guidelines cover voluntary audits, tax advice,consultancy and expert advisory work, as well as statutory audits.Outgoing IdW president Dietrich Dorner said the profession remainsstrongly in favour of self-regulation. "We don't want to wait until theauthorities and the government take the reins," he said. "We don't wantstate regulation." But he acknowledged that recent controversies aboutaudit quality in Germany have led the justice ministry to considertougher regulation of the profession.WPK president Gerhard Burret acknowledged that there had beenshortcomings in all of the practice areas covered by the new rules. Inparticular, the rules are stricter on auditor independence; auditorsare required to disclose financial, personal and shareholder links withtheir clients.The rules require auditors to ensure that their work is reviewed by asuitably-qualified colleague (the so-called double-signatureprinciple). Dorner said the principle was equally binding on solepractitioners. "These accountants usually have links with otherpractitioners and I expect they will use them to fulfil thisrequirement," he said.Separately, Dorner commented on the growing acceptance of InternationalAccounting Standards (IAS) by German companies. The IdW recentlyproduced a dual-language guide to IAS for members of the profession andtheir clients. Dorner believes IAS will inevitably become generallyaccepted in Germany even though they contradict some of the main tenetsof the country's commercial code. "Our principle of prudence is a soundone, but it is evident which way things will go," he said. "We won't beable to avoid IAS."Yet Dorner does not agree that the German profession would be able toexert more influence on the formulation of IAS by having an Anglo Saxon-style standard-setting body. "I'm not optimistic that [such a body]would be any better than what we have at the moment," he said."It wouldpronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effectwould be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GOVERNMENT WARNS PROFESSION ON SELF-REGULATIONTHE GERMAN government has served notice on the local accountingprofession that it must vastly improve its self-regulation if it is notto have practice rules imposed by law.Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingenin early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting standards atthe Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputychairman of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).Biener was dismissive of the profession's new quality standards,introduced just a few days earlier (see story above). Even under thenew rules, he said, German accountants are still not obliged toactively seek out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts."The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said."Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The lawallows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obligedto argue things out with the company."Biener also criticised the IdW's main practice committee for its latediscovery of shortcomings in the switch to International AccountingStandards by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger Zement for their 1994accounts. Gross countered that it would have been unfeasible for thecommittee to intervene any earlier, but that the changes suggested bythe committee would be incorporated in the companies' 1995 accounts.Biener acknowledged that the leading accounting firms in Germany areworld-class, but expressed concern about the rank-and-file of theprofession. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise toaudits which are just average; rather they should allow accountantswith an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which isup to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died outbecause they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession hasgrasped that message."German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regainpublic confidence, particularly as a result of the bad publicitysurrounding Daimler-Benz's accounts. As the only German company with aNew York listing, Daimler is obliged to publish not only German-styleaccounts, but a reconciliation to US GAAP as well. That has resulted inhuge discrepancies between the two figures, particularly in thecompany's 1993 accounts."Our audits have become suspect," Biener said. "Sooner or later Germanaccounts will no longer be accepted by the international community."Companies' accounting departments, rather than accounting firms, shouldprovide the impetus for the regulation of accounting practice, saidBiener. Accounting firms have their own commercial interests toconsider, and may be reluctant to push for change. He thereforesuggested that German, and in turn European companies, set up aregulatory body modelled on the Financial Accounting Standards Board inthe US.In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea. "Iwon't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] bodyoperates in a sensible fashion," he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Combined auditing revenuesfor 1996 are expected to total L15 billion ($9 million).The alliance was approved by Consob, Italy's bourse watchdog, at theend of September and will formally take effect early in 1996. The firmwill operate as Grant Thornton Italia, although it was the partners ofHodgson Landau Brands, the HLB International affiliate, who made thefirst move.The new firm's partners will own 90 percent of the shares, while theremaining 10 percent will remain in the hands of Centrobanca,Italaudit's owner. Recent legislation obliged Italian banks to reducetheir shareholdings in auditing firms to below 50 percent by the end of1995.Lorenzo Penca, managing partner of Hodgson Landau Brands, will bepresident of the new firm while Claudio Muollo, the head of Italaudit,is moving to lead Grant Thornton's consultancy arm -in Italy, the twodivisions have to be kept legally separate.Penca said the merger will enable the firms to keep pace with thecompetition. "This was an opportunity we could not pass up," he said."Auditing firms in Italy that do not grow will find it increasinglydifficult to survive. With this merger we have established a highly-professional auditing body with a solid base and a recognisedinternational name which will distinguish us from the smaller firms inItaly. Our view is that there will eventually be only ten auditinggroups [authorised to audit listed companies] in the country and thisis our way of ensuring that we are one of them."Previously, Hodgson Laundau Brands was ninth in the rankings, with feeincome of L7.5 billion, while Italaudit was placed 12th with revenues,including consulting, of roughly L6 billion.The firm will have more than 70 staff with 11 partners. Clients includeItalian dairy producer, Parmalat, two leading football clubs, anItalian drugs company, publishers, fashion houses such as GianfrancoFerre, and a clutch of Italian banks."We may not be able to compete with the Big Six on size, but we cancertainly match them for image and professionalism," Penca said. "Thereare only a small number of groups in Italy whose accounts GrantThornton Italia would not be in a position to audit, which leaves a lotof potential business. The trend for smaller companies to seek stockmarket listings is very encouraging and we will be looking to exploitthe situation to the full."The merger is a blow to the HLB International network. The Italian firmwas HLB's 15th-largest member and referred out "a reasonable amount" ofwork, according to Peter Frost, the group's London-based chiefexecutive. "The move was driven by their desire for a merger atnational level," Frost said."We are looking at one or two alternativesat the moment."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Assirevi had come to beregarded as almost exclusively a Big Six organisation since the smallerfirms broke away to form Aire in the late 1980s.Vittorio Salvi, head of Milan-based Sofiresa, which recently quit Aire,cited two reasons for firms returning to the fold. "It has happenedpartly because of the growth of international affiliation among Italianfirms, but also because Assirevi carries more weight with banks andConsob," he said. "The reasons for starting Aire for Italian auditingfirms have been overtaken by events." Sofiresa is a member of SummitInternational.Hodgson Landau Brands, which recently merged with Italaudit to formGrant Thornton Italia (see above story), was one of the few mid-tierfirms not to join Aire. Dino Mangiarotti, senior partner at the newfirm and a director of Assirevi, is convinced of the value of Assirevimembership. "Firms wishing to audit listed companies in Italy benefitgreatly from the international name and the status of being part ofAssirevi," he said. "It distinguishes these companies from the other,smaller firms."Aire president Fausto Vitucci does not dispute the differing roles ofthe two associations but is convinced that Aire still has an essentialrole to play for auditors in Italy."The listed company audit market is limited in Italy and anexceptionally high number of non-listed companies will request audits,"he said. "The problem is how this market is divided. Smaller firms arebetter suited to auditing smaller companies, particularly in terms ofcosts. It seems unreasonable that the largest firms seek to imposetheir brands on this end of the market because it raises fees to anunacceptable level for many small companies."Vitucci said the Italian market is different from others in severalways. The stock market is small relative to the size of the economy andaudit work is more seasonal than in other countries. The big firms, heclaimed, are forced to seek work at the lower end of the market to keeptheir partners busy all year round.Recent legislative changes have required all auditors to officiallyregister with the authorities - more than 65,000 have since done so. Onthe other hand, there is no clear regulatory authority for the non-listed market unless the work is performed by a Consob-authorised firm.Vitucci said Aire can provide support for smaller audit firms andensure that standards are maintained at the lower end of the market.Vitucci's firm, First Professional Audit, is applying for Consobauthorisation, a step which, he said, improves auditors' status even ifthey do not plan to audit listed companies. Sofiresa, for example, isalso Consob-approved although it currently has no quoted audit clients.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Namesthen sued the auditor for negligence, claiming that the syndicates'accounts had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value oftheir investments. The Names said they would not have invested in lateryears had they known of the losses.The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent inauditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed tofuture investors at Lloyd's. The Names are expected to appeal thedecision.The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wideout-of-court settlement of all the litigation that has dogged themarket for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for theestimated #11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988. Thereis now less pressure on the auditors to contribute to the proposed #2.8billion settlement fund (EA 56).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Although it previously coveredthe entire island for ACPA, an increase in outside investment into thenorth, particularly from the US, has created the need forrepresentation there."The peace process has set it all in motion," said McGrath managingpartner Tom Kavanagh. "We've already seen a rise in inward investmentand this can only increase."McGrath was attracted to MTF because of its specialty in mergers andacquisitions, an area which the Dublin firm is not particularly strongin.McGrath reported revenues of IR#1.75 million ($2.8 million) in 1995.Kavanagh estimates MTF's 1995 revenues at about IR#750,000. Combinedfee income at both firms is expected to reach IR#2.7 million in 1996.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Rather than appointing a new senior partner immediately,the supervisory board asked its chairman, Hans Havermann, to step intothe breach for an interim period of two years. Havermann was previouslysenior partner between 1985 and 1991 and chairman of KPMG Internationaluntil September 1995.Separately, KPMG Germany said it expects gross revenues in 1995 to rise5 percent to about DM1.17 billion ($800 million). Profits will alsoimprove, the firm said, without giving details. This growth was largelythe result of "initial successes" in KPMG's efforts to put greateremphasis on consulting work, it added.Meanwhile, provisional figures from C&L Deutsche Revision indicate thatthe Coopers & Lybrand member has drawn almost level with KPMG as thelargest accounting firm in Germany. Partner Horst Goldbach told EA thatgroup fee income expanded by 9.5 percent to about DM1.14 billion in1995. Although fee income was up in all divisions, growth wasparticularly strong in consultancy work, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"The intention always was that the [London firm] would joinus at some stage," he said.Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certainethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have mergedwith Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. "We are actively seekingfurther acquisitions over the next year," McDonnell said. GrantThornton is in preliminary talks with a number of local firms, none ofwhich are linked to a national network, he said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The prosecution hopes toprove that the former executives carried out fraudulent papertransactions - worth billions of marks - between Balsam and Procedo andthus caused the collapse of both companies. Muscat, who advised bothcompanies, is accused of "deliberate involvement" with the allegedfrauds.Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his caseagainst PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partnersacted intentionally, rather than just negligently. But he is unwillingto delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a prolongedadjournment. The court was scheduled to reconvene on December 19 tomake a final decision on the adjournment, after both sides hadconsulted with their clients.The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of"intentional misconduct"in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approvingthe accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added anew claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval withoutactually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

ICAEWchief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible asa result of the inevitable duplication of services currently beingprovided by the two.Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. Heexpects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEWis currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 ($210) annualsubscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110currently charged by CIMA.However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behindthe merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," hesaid. "We are promoting this because the environment for the professionis becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests ofaccountants better by being bigger."The new body will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at thosetraining in public practice, who will continue to be known as"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,who will bear the title "chartered management accountant".There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of twofoundation levels, an intermediate stage and a final level. Studentswill be time barred if they do not pass their final exams within sevenyears of starting the foundation course. Students will be able toaccumulate exam credits at all levels except the final one.The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be droppedin an attempt to give the new body a global image. "This is notmarketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a high-qualityqualification around the world," Colquhoun said. "They will have tomeet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think there is amarket out there for our qualification."The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each ofwhich will be able to elect six members to the new council: three fromindustry and three from practice. The exception will be London whichwill elect 14 members.There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in othercountries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa. Members of bothinstitutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal in April or May.Meanwhile, CIMA has gained Privy Council approval for its members touse the individual description of "chartered management accountant"with immediate effect. According to a statement from CIMA, the newdesignation"should enable the members of both bodies to consider themerger proposals on their true merits, as there would be no change oftitle for the members of either body".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

He also repeated his demand for the ACCA president and vice-president to be elected by the association's members. "Basically, thepeople who are leading the organisation need to be mandated," he said.The plan to disband the current London-based council and replace itwith a federal structure was put forward by ACCA chief executive AntheaRose at a council meeting in early December. The proposed structuredevolves power to a number of new regional councils, which will in turnreport to an international committee. Sikka has argued that theassociation's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent of the total - areeffectively disenfranchised.A discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCAmembers on December 15.An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structuredmakes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if theylive on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose someform of devolution with a federal structure."The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.These could include direct dealings with regional governments and theissue of guidance and advice on local auditing, accounting and taxationmatters. It is unlikely that the regional councils will have anycontrol over ACCA's examination syllabus.As for Sikka's call for direct presidential elections, the ACCA is notruling this out. But a change to the current practice of having thepresident elected by the council is not part of the latest proposals.Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Associationof Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the PrivyCouncil, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation'sRoyal Charter.In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of theword "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with theuse of the term "chartered".In submissions to the council earlier this year, the Institute ofChartered Accountants in England and Wales argued that the name changewould cause confusion with the certified public accountant designationused in the US. Another vocal critic of the ACCA, Labour Member ofParliament Austin Mitchell, argued that the association did not actsufficiently in the public interest for it to merit the title"public".The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects toput forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996A SOLUTION TO THE LITIGATION PROBLEM?UK accounting firms may have found a partial solution to the problemsof litigation without the expense of incorporation. William Gleesonlooks at the implications of two firms' plans to register as LLPs inJerseyTHE "ACCOUNTANCIES" - the collective noun that some UK newspapers havestarted using for accountancy practices - have announced that, for thetime being at least, they are putting their hopes for salvation fromrogue litigants in the hands of the 600-year- old Jersey Parliament.Or, at least Ernst & Young and Price Waterhouse are.The Finance and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey - as theisland's Parliament is called - is proposing a new limited liabilitypartnership (LLP) law, to be debated in the first quarter of the newyear.If the legislation comes into being, the UK's largest accountancy firmswill be able to re-register in Jersey and, should they be successfullysued, the personal assets of the partners not directly involved in thealleged wrongdoing will be protected.Both E&Y and PW have said the Jersey route is their preferred way tolimit liability. It has the advantage of preserving the partnershipethos of the firms, and is cheaper than incorporation. The change frompaying national insurance contributions under the rules for the self-employed to the rules applying to those employed by a company wouldmean, in effect, partners would face higher tax rates.The basis for assessing taxable profits would change as well, withAccounting Standards Board rules applying to the incorporated entity.This particularly applies to work in progress which would be given ahigher value, making the income of the practice higher.But serious question marks hang over the proposals. It is by no meanscertain that the laws will have a smooth passage through the States ofJersey. This body is not a traditional Parliament, and there are nopolitical parties. Instead, there is an assembly of individuals whocome from a wide cross-section of the community. Current members of the54-strong body range from a retired stockbroker to a green activist.Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the Finance and EconomicsCommittee, said: "This is not in anyway like a party political system,where you know you have a majority before you start . .very meaningful."Horsfall's seven-man committee has to persuade the other 47 members ofthe States of the merits of the case for the new law during one stand-up debating session.In the autumn, a bill proposed by the States education committee toreform the way school pupils are streamed at the age of 14 was thrownout, forcing the committee to resign.But limited liability for partnerships should be less of an emotiveissue for the Jersey Parliament than local education. Also, there is alot in it for the local economy. Passing this legislation will bringcloser ties between the island and prestigious financial sectorbusinesses. Of Jersey's 43,000 workers, 9,000, or just over 20 percent,are employed in the financial services sector.Whatever happens, the answer will be obtained quickly. Once the processhas passed through the States it must then await the approval of the UKPrivy Council, an honorary body whose role it is, by and large, torubberstamp the States' proposals. E&Y has said it hopes to become anLLP sometime in the second half of next year.But even if the proposed bill gets through in its current form, doubtexists as to whether the new law will afford the protection beingsought.KPMG has received legal advice that the UK courts may refuse torecognise that Jersey's laws take precedence to UK laws. In essence,the firm has been advised that if the accountant being sued works andlives in the UK and signs his audit report "KPMG, London" and theplaintiff is based in the UK, it seems perfectly reasonable to arguethat the re-registration in Jersey is nothing more than an artificialruse to escape the UK courts' jurisdiction.Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: "This law doesn't existyet, it is a proposed change. When we were considering it we were awarethat the States of Guernsey was thinking of revising its partnershiplaw and aware that the States of Jersey was considering doing so. Wehave an English law solution to an English law problem which gives usas much protection as we need."Indeed, it transpires that KPMG has taken a long hard look not only atthe Channel Islands but at other European jurisdictions - not just theobvious ones like Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, but France, Germany andSpain as well.But there are plenty who hope the cynics are wrong, not least the otherfirms - Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross - which are currently sittingfirmly on their hands waiting for some progress.It is undoubtedly wrong that all the responsibility for corporatefailure is borne by the auditors, with the failed company's managementgetting away scot-free.The firms feel time is against them. The campaign to reform liabilitylaw in the UK is not likely to bear fruit for several years.The same is true of UK partnership law. The Department of Trade andIndustry is said to be sympathetic to the needs of the accountancyprofession, but it is currently not high on the list of priorities ofeither the government or the main opposition parties, especially with ageneral election to be held sooner rather than later.But in the end, this move is not about economic or legal realities. Itis about the psychology of poker players. Potential litigants will nowhave to ask how much stronger will off-shore re-registration make thehand of the accountancies in negligence claims?As yet, nobody has sued partners in a firm for their homes and theshirts from their kids' backs - and possibly no rational litigant everwould. The fear is of the potentially irrational "rogue" litigant. Infuture, if the Jersey law goes through, should any person ever think ofbeing a rogue, they will have to ask"is this worth it, now that thedeep pockets motive has gone?"Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EARLY SIGNS OF UPTURNDanish accounting firms are predicting sustained growth over the nextfew years thanks mainly to an improvement in general economicconditions. Sally Roden reportsALTHOUGH FEE income growth is still quite modest, Danish accountingfirms believe they have turned a corner after recent years ofrecession.Demand from clients is on the increase, although few partners expectauditing to drive the recovery. "Competition is still quitesubstantial, but the economic recovery is beginning to influence theprofession in a positive direction," said Frank Jakobsen, internationalcontact partner with Grant Thornton Denmark/Grothen & Perregard."For the first time in several years, we are experiencing a lack ofskilled labour, indicating that firms are beginning to feel a rise indemand."That said, the latest batch of fee income figures are unlikely to setpulses racing. Only two of the top ten firms reported revenue increasesof more than 5 percent, and one of those, BDO ScanRevision, said its14.2 percent growth rate was partly the result of a merger."The economy has been improving in general but - at least among thebig, international firms - the audit market is affected byrationalisation and technological changes, and in some areas is stillaffected by keen price competition," said Torben Haaning, managingpartner of Coopers & Lybrand.KPMG C Jespersen is still the top firm in Denmark with 1994 revenues ofDKr668 million ($120 million), a rise of 3.4 percent on the previousyear. For 1995, the firm estimates revenues will rise a further 2.5percent to DKr685 million.The 1995 figures will have been boosted by the merger completed at thestart of the year of KPMG's offices on the island of Funen with localfirm Edvin Munk. The merger gave KPMG a presence in three more towns onthe island and doubled the size of its office in Svendborg.Among KPMG's major audit clients are shipping, manufacturing and retailgroup AP Moller, electrical machinery maker Danfoss and in the bankingsector Den Danske Bank and Unibank.Second-placed Deloitte & Touche, which changed its name from Schobel &Marholt on January 1 of this year, reported revenues of DKr651.2million for fiscal 1994, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier. D&T'smajor audit clients include insurance company Topdanmark, for which italso provides consulting services, and food and beverage producerDanisco.In third place in the rankings is C&L with 1994 revenues of DKr525million, up 1.9 percent from a year earlier, followed by Ernst & Youngwith fee income of DKr358 million, a rise of 3.2 percent.The E&Y figures do not reflect two mergers which the firm completedthis year. On May 1, it teamed up with Borg og Green, an auditing firmbased in the northern Zealand area. The merger boosted the number ofpartners in E&Y's Hillerod office to seven and increased its totalstaff there to 52. Then on July 1, E&Y merged with RIO Partner, a four-partner firm in Odense with annual revenues of DKr50 million.E&Y managing partner Teddy Wivel said the firm has experienced a lot ofgrowth in management consulting and tax services and expects this tocontinue in the current year.Price Waterhouse/Seier-Petersen took fifth place with revenues ofDKr300 million in the year to June 1995. Morten Iversen, a partner atthe firm, said PW was not involved in any mergers during the year andthat its growth rate of 11.1 percent was entirely organic.He said much of the revenue increase came from a rise in informationtechnology consulting and tax consulting business. "We have a verystrong tax practice and there has been a general increase in demand foradded-value tax services."Among PW's major audit clients are pharmaceuticals group Novo Nordisk,Tele Danmark, insurance group Trygg-Baltica Forsikring, and the localsubsidiaries of computer group IBM and oil giant Shell.The highest revenue increase of any of the firms surveyed came fromsixth-placed BDO ScanRevision, with fee income rising 14.2 percent toDKr297 million in the year to September. The firm said the impressiveincrease was partly the result of a merger with auditing firm JRI,which has offices in Aarhus, Skanderborg and Auning. Managing partnerJens Rye said the merger doubled BDO's presence in Aarhus, a port onthe eastern side of Jutland.Rye added that BDO has experienced some growth in the audit sector overthe last year. He said this was because the firm deals mainly with themedium-sized corporate sector where price competition is less severe.BDO has also begun diversifying into consulting. "Clients are morewilling to pay [for consulting services] because they see results,which is not always the case in the audit sector," Rye said.Arthur Andersen remains in seventh place, with fiscal 1995 revenues ofDKr234 million, a rise of 4 percent on the previous year. The firm'saudit business contributed 44 percent of revenues, while AndersenConsulting accounted for 47 percent.Andersen's country managing partner Torgny Pahle said tradingconditions in Denmark in the last year were characterised by a "veryweak audit market with no growth, fierce competition and a soft outlookfor the future". The consulting market, on the other hand, is growingacross the board, he said.Most firms agreed with Pahle that competition in the audit marketremains strong. More and more audits are being put out to tender, andclients are stepping up their demands for value for money, they said.Wivel said E&Y has also noticed price competition spreading from theaudit sector into the consulting business, particularly from other BigSix firms with strong consulting arms.The poor outlook for the audit market is unlikely to be helped if thegovernment goes ahead with plans to drop the rule obliging listedcompanies to appoint joint auditors. The government believes the jointauditor system places too heavy a financial burden on the companiesconcerned.Although the proposal is still being considered, Bjarne Fabienke,senior partner at KPMG, expects an amendment to the law beforeChristmas. If it goes ahead, "the total audit market will be reduced",he said.As a result of the rule, the Big Six currently share many of Denmark'slargest companies as clients: brewing group Carlsberg is audited byKPMG and PW; Bang & Olufsen, the electronics company, is audited by C&Land PW; and the national postal service, Post Danmark, is audited byAndersen and PW.PW's Iversen believes the government is considering changing the jointaudit rule because Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe withsuch a requirement. "In terms of the EU, it's a bit unusual," he said.Last October, a law was passed which said no one audit client should beallowed to contribute more than 20 percent of a firm's fee income.Twelve months later, the general consensus among firms is that thelegislation has had little real effect.Fabienke said the law does not apply to big firms in reality since oneclient would never contribute 20 percent of total revenues. However,problems might arise for smaller firms with lower overall fee income.The aim of this legislation was to boost auditor independence, an issuethat was under the spotlight in recent years but now seems to havemoved off the agenda. "The profession's reputation was tarnished in thelate 1980s and early 1990s when there were a number of collapses and itwas automatically drawn into the debate," Iversen said. "That period isbehind us. The profession has regained its credibility."Alongside the ongoing improvement in the Danish economy, the joblessrate has fallen over the last year from over 12 percent to just above10 percent. With this, some firms have reported problems findingsuitable staff. "When the market is growing it is inevitable that someshortages arise," said Iversen at PW.Wivel said E&Y has had problems recruiting in the Copenhagen area. Ithas been doing presentations in the universities to encourage younggraduates into the firm with some success.A more serious problem for the big international firms is insurancecover. Legislation was introduced earlier this year requiring firmswith more than ten certified public accountants to take out nationalinsurance cover of DKr20 million. All the bigger firms already haveinternational insurance policies but the Danish authorities no longeraccept this. "We foresee extra cost to fulfil the nationalrequirements, even though we have international insurance with a moreextensive cover," said Haaning at C&L.Denmark's traditional links to the Baltic have resulted in a number ofDanish accounting firms establishing a presence in the former easternbloc. KPMG, for example, at the request of the international firm,established a practice in Lithuania. KPMG's Swedish and Finnish membershave set up practices in the other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,respectively.BKR International's RIR Revision owns a firm of the same name inPoland, although earlier this year the Polish firm dropped the BKR linkand signed up with Moore Stephens.

Deutsche Post wanted to keep 40percent of the capital and divide the rest between the other twobidders (see EB 118). Schroders has put Postbank's current market valueat between DM4 billion and DM5.1 billion.Wolfgang Botsch, Minister for Post and Telecommunications, whosupported this hostile bid, seems to like Schroders's idea so far, buthas not made a definitive statement. Postbank is adamant that the stakeshould be between 15 percent and 20 percent. It would not accept a 25percent stake unless"certain conditions (not defined) were met", aspokesman said.Schroders has recommended that Postbank get rid of its 80 specialisedoutlets in post offices, carry out marketing jointly with Deutsche Postand sell its products over the post office counters. This would openthe way for recruiting other financial services partners, Schroderssaid.No doubt Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re would want a piece of this action,along with the partners that Postbank sought out for a counter attack -BHF Bank and Volksfursorge, the insurance group.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

SE-Banken stated that the Luxonen losses werecovered by SKr1 billion provisions made in 1994 and that restructuringthe group would strengthen rather than weaken its position.In the first six months of 1995, however, SE-Banken made furtherprovisions of SKr2.9 billion to cover Luxonen losses. First halfprofits dropped from SKr2.2 billion to a mere Skr19 million (see EB117).The stock exchange disciplinary committee has imposed a SKr2.14 fine,corresponding to two annual listing fees.SE Banken admits that it was not fully aware at the time ofthe"complicated construction" of the swap contracts held by Luxonen,which caused much of the loss, a spokeswoman said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This will give CreditNational "the means to assert itself as one of the top Frenchinstitutions", according to the bank's chairman Emmanuel Rodocanachi.In itself, the deal is likely to have only a limited impact on thebanking industry. Credit National and BFCE have small branch networksand are involved in sectors where commercial banks barely tread. CreditNational, for example, focuses largely on long-term corporate loans tolarge and medium-sized companies, capital markets and equity financingbusiness. BFCE's activities are concentrated on the corporate sector;international trade financing and cash management services.The true significance of the deal lies in its symbolic value. Theproposed merger is, in fact, the first such operation of consequence inFrance since the merger of Banque Indochine and Banque de Suez et del'Union des Mines to form Banque Indosuez in 1975. It is testimony ofthe French banking industry's willingness to contemplate the type ofconsolidation that has become common in Europe in recent years.The second significant event pointing toward long-overdue consolidationwas the news that GAN, a major insurance company, is to sell a majoritystake in its banking subsidiary Groupe CIC as part of itsprivatisation. Groupe CIC is the seventh-largest bank in France sothere are likely to be suitors aplenty although, like many Frenchbanks, CIC is barely profitable. It has an abysmal cost-to-income ratioof 80 percent.Societe Generale and Credit Mutuel have already expressed an interest,although banks from outside France (possibly the Dutch bank ABN AMRO)may also be tempted to add CIC's network of around 1,300 branches totheir empires.The ardour of some suitors may, however, be tempered if it is decidedto sell the different regional CIC networks separately. The acquisitionof consumer finance specialist Sovac by giant US conglomerate GeneralElectric Capital (GE Capital) at least shows a revival of foreigninterest in investing in those parts of the French financial industrythat remain profitable.Foreigners' interest in making an important banking acquisition inFrance has long been frustrated by various kinds of unavowedprotectionism. At the beginning of this decade, for example, DeutscheBank's international division was able to show journalists 36 fatfiles, each one representing an acquisition target in France that hadto be ruled out for a series of reasons.Now, in one fell swoop, a major international company has become one ofthe major consumer credit providers in a market that has beentraditionally divided between a handful of national competitors and thesubsidiaries of the big commercial banks.The acquisition, the third significant event in French banking inrecent months, has had the effect of a bombshell on the French retailfinancial services industry and may herald a period of intensemanoeuvring. Already, rumours are rife that Banque Sofinco (anotherconsumer finance specialist and subsidiary of the troubled Suezconglomerate) could come on the market, as may Credit du Nord, the weakretail banking subsidiary of the Paribas group.The fourth and final event demonstrating a new openness in the Frenchbanking sector is the decision to end Credit Foncier de France's quasi-monopoly over the distribution of subsidised housing loans, calledPAPs. This may be a sign that the state is beginning to contemplateending other privileges reserved for a number of state and quasi-statebanks.Likewise, the decision to replace these PAPs with interest-freemortgage loans that are open to all banks to distribute is anindication that the authorities are conscious of the serious problemsfacing the French financial industry.That said, French banking remains ridden by a host of specialprivileges accorded to some banks and not to others. The commercialbanks (members of the Association Francaise des Banques) periodicallymount campaigns to have the same right to flexible opening hours as thesavings and mutual banks and the post office. For a number of years,they have also been striving to obtain the same access to fiscallyadvantaged products as the mutual and savings banks. It remainsunlikely that, in this respect at least, French banking will changeradically in the near future.The sudden increase in the tempo of change in French banking in 1995follows a lot of soul searching among the financial industry, at theroot of which is a series of events, including bail-outs (mostspectacularly that of Credit Lyonnais) and the collapse last year ofBanque Pallas-Stern. The failure of the latter bank is especiallysignificant in that, for the first time in memory, a bank'sshareholders did not respond to the Bank of France's "invitation" tohelp refloat their investment. This spells an end to France's much-vaunted banking solidarity and points to the growing vulnerability ofsmall banks.In addition, the AFB estimates that its members' net banking incomefell by 10 percent in 1995, having already dropped by 8 percent in1994.French banks in general can only look with envy on their "Anglo- Saxon"cousins which, on average, have operating margins and returns on equitythat are two or three times higher than theirs. In the latest annualsurvey of bank profitability undertaken by rating agency IBCA, the mostprofitable French bank (Credit Immobilier de France) ranked only 84thout of 300 institutions in the world.In the words of one Paris analyst,"whereas French banks used to be ableto take justifiable pride in their quality of service and technologicalprowess, now they have had to become seriously worried with the morebasic themes of low profitability and how to survive in a frighteninglycompetitive environment".Perhaps even more telling in the current upheaval is the growingrealisation that banks' real estate problems (which some analystsestimate could cost a cumulative Fr100 billion-Fr200 billion by the endof this decade) are not going to go away soon.Here, too, a sea change can be detected. In 1994 and the first half of1995 the Suez group, a financial and industrial conglomerate, took thecourageous step of writing down the massive real estate losses itsvarious subsidiaries had accumulated in previous years instead ofposting provisions that do not necessarily take into account possiblefurther falls in market values, as all Suez's domestic rivals havedone.This provisioning effort cost Suez a total of Fr11.7 billion in the 18months up to mid-1995 and contributed largely to the consolidatedlosses of Fr8.8 billion in the same period.At least this exercise should ensure that the much-troubled group seesthe light at the end of the tunnel fairly quickly. This may not be thecase for a number of other unfortunate institutions in France.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

In fact, SalomonBrothers's only proviso on a buy recommendation on Lloyds is that thebank's shares have passed the #8.25- #8.50 price mark.Both the C&G and TSB purchases fit the Lloyds criterion for asuccessful financial institution of widening the gap with otheroperators: C&G for its low-cost production in the mortgage market,strong image-based technology and turnaround skills; and TSB for thepotential integration savings it offers as well as general insuranceskills that Lloyds has up to now had to buy in.Salomon Brothers is particularly enthusiastic about the UK, despite thefact that shares rallied so strongly in 1995. Buy Barclays, Lloyds,NatWest and HSBC Holdings, Salomon Brothers advises, with a hold onAbbey National. The favoured buy is HSBC, because the shares havelagged the recovery in UK bank shares.Salomon is less enthusiastic about other markets. In France, where itconsiders the banks are not particularly good value in relation toearnings, it has a hold recommendation on the major banks, althoughpreferring the quality of Societe Generale.Italian banks, although cheap on book value, are expensive on anearnings basis, Salomon argues, and better share performance will onlyhappen in the (currently unlikely) event of an improvement in politicaland economic conditions. Top Italian choice is Istituto MobiliareItaliano (IMI) (see page 6).Despite the fact that Salomon Brothers is bearish about operatingconditions in the Spanish market, it has upgraded its recommendation onArgentaria to buy from hold in the light of the mounting speculationabout mergers and acquisitions. Salomon argues that the Spanishgovernment has no real interest in keeping any investment in Argentariain the medium term. Argentaria's break-up value is a lot higher thancurrent market capitalisation and the likely change of government in1996 will allow a rethink of the privatisation agenda, the reportpredicts.Salomon Brothers has also kept a buy recommendation on Bank BilbaoVizcaya, another bank which focuses on shareholder value. Luis Bastida,chief financial officer of BBV, told Salomon Brothers' GlobalConference that BBV has established ROE objectives of about 15 percentfor all main business lines. The bank will repurchase more stock ifmarket price falls below adjusted book value and is continuing tomaximise cost cuts from the 1998 Banco Bilbao/Banca Vizcaya merger.In Germany, the favoured bank shares are Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.In Switzerland, Salomon Brothers has downgraded its only buyrecommendation - Swiss Bank Corporation - to hold and cut the estimateson the other three major banks, citing stagnant domestic bankingconditions and poor credit quality.Salomon Brothers considers the Nordic banks, particularly ChristianiaBank, as among the best buys in Europe.Global bank share performance, absolute and in dollars,1991 - YTD 1995                   Absolute bank performance                   1991    1992    1993    1994    1H 95   YTD 1995US                 55.2%    28.3%    6.5%   -7.2%   24.8%   51.6%Canada             39.0    -10.1    26.0    -5.3     7.6    14.8UK                 16.8     28.7    54.7   -16.1    10.7    42.1Spain               6.7     -8.3    39.7    -8.8    -1.2    11.0Australia          45.9    -24.5    58.0   -13.3    14.9    31.2Switzerland        21.8     10.1    62.3   -22.6     5.6    16.4Germany             5.0      1.4    42.4   -15.7    -2.6    -2.3Japan              13.8    -22.2    13.4     0.0   -21.9     0.5France              7.8     16.9    42.2   -26.4   -14.6   -15.0Mexico              7.8     -7.2    62.8   -52.2   -31.6   -21.9                   Dollar bank performance                   1991    1992    1993    1994    1H 95   YTD 1995US                 55.2%    28.3%    6.5%   -7.2%   24.8%   51.6%Canada             38.9    -17.9   -20.4   -10.5    10.2    18.2UK                 13.0      4.4    51.2   -11.2    12.8    40.1Spain               5.3    -22.7    12.2    -0.9     7.7    18.9Australia          43.8    -31.5    55.6    -0.9     5.1    25.0Switzerland        15.0      1.7    60.2   -12.2    20.4    30.3Germany             3.5     -4.9    32.7    -6.1     9.9     5.6Japan              23.7    -22.0    26.5    11.9    -8.0    -1.1France              5.9      9.9    33.1   -18.6    -5.8    -8.8Mexico              6.0     -9.3    63.3   -69.8   -46.0   -49.7Source: Salomon Brothers Inc.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Thosethat met the requirements were the UK, Ireland, Denmark, theNetherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.The main thrust of the ISD is to create a "European Passport" for non-bank investment firms to carry out activities such as order collecting,dealing and portfolio management more easily across borders.Under the terms of the directive, any institution regulated in one EUcountry can operate in all of the others without having to comply withadditional requirements.The British Banking Association "warmly welcomes" the directives,because they reinforce the basic right to cross-border financialservices, according to Peter Vipond, assistant director.As in the case of the Second Banking Directive, the Association isconcerned that the interpretation of the ISD should not be conservativeor ambiguous (see EB 120).Larger banks, already present in more than one EU country, can expectlower costs as a result of the ISD but the directive will not have asignificant impact on their cross-border activities, predicted JohnLeonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. Although somemember states have been strict on foreign players in the past, mostlarge banks have been free to operate where they choose."The ISD will have no effect whatsoever on our business, as we alreadyhad the passport," said Dominique Hoenn, member of the board ofmanagement at Groupe Paribas, France's second-largest banking group."It is a bit of a non-event for banks."Smaller players operating in countries which have no regulations forsecurities traders will, on the other hand, find themselves needingauthorisation for the first time.The costs of keeping up with regulations may be too much and firms andbrokers could become overshadowed by the bigger investment banks whichwill find it easier to adapt, Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury andcapital markets at Price Waterhouse, forecast.One market observer suggests that in terms of increased cross- borderactivity US investment houses, such as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanleyand Goldman Sachs, will be particularly keen to avail of theopportunities presented by the ISD. Their authorisation in London willallow them to spread out further into Europe.A second objective of the ISD is to open up stock exchange membershipin all member states to all types of investment firm, whether bank ornon-bank entities. It will allow them to choose between indirect accessto membership through a subsidiary company or direct access through abranch.The ISD will lead to a surge in "remote membership" of stock exchanges,according to market analysts, as it permits regulated markets operatingwithout a physical floor to provide terminals to investment firms andbanks in other member states.This move will boost continental exchanges which have dramaticallymodernised recently, said Jean-Pierre Paelinck, secretary general ofthe European Federation of Stock Exchanges.Indeed, the London exchange is on shaky ground at the moment after itschief executive Michael Lawrence was forced to resign on January 4because the board "lost confidence" in him. The board insists that thishas nothing to do with Lawrence's push for reform of trading on theexchange this year. Few are convinced by the argument and a selectcommittee of the House of Commons has launched an inquiry into thedismissal."Our objective is to be a market of choice," said John Kemp- Welch,chairman of the board, who has taken over the chair of the executivecommittee until a new chief executive is found. "To achieve that, wehave a large programme of work in train and this will be pursuedvigorously."On the same day as Lawrence's departure, the board announced theformation of a steering committee, which will oversee the decisiontaken at the Stock Exchange Board meeting of November 30, concerningmarket structure and regulation. The decision provides for theExchange's service to include full electronic trading and ordermatching.UK stockbroker NatWest Securities added fuel to the fire on January 2,when it started to trade on the Swedish stock exchange from its officesin London. It was the first leading UK market- maker to questionpublicly the London Stock Exchange's function as a centre forinternational trading.Before the ISD came in, UK firms wanting to trade continental stockshad to set up offices in other countries and apply for membership oradvertise their prices on Seaq International, the London Exchange'selectronic bulletin board for international dealing.In Germany, Gruppe Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock andderivatives markets, has reacted to the ISD by installing "accesspoints" in London and Zurich to link to its systems and harmonising thecommunications fees abroad with those at home, facilitating access tothe German market for foreign entrants.Deutsche Borse plans to extend its electronic network to othercountries in the future, with the aim of bringing down all roundtelecommunications costs.Investment banks are likely to feel the effects of the Capital AdequacyDirective (CAD) most, although the Directive also covers non-bankinvestment firms. Under the directive, investment banks are requiredfor the first time to examine market risks when allocating capital.Under the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive of 1993, banks cancarry out securities-related activities in addition to core bankingbusiness, which means that banks and non-banks can be in directcompetition with each other in this area.The CAD distinguishes between a bank's "trading book" and the rest ofits business (its investment portfolio and loans portfolio). It appliesbroadly similar rules to the trading book as apply to the securitiesbusiness of non-bank investment firms in defining regulatory capitaland rules relating to the measurement of risk.The rest of the bank's business is still subject to the requirements ofthe Solvency Ratio Directive, which sets out an 8 percent minimumcapital requirement in respect of weighted credit risks.Another element of the CAD is that banks and investment firms mustmonitor risks at all times, keeping a close eye on large exposures.Trading exposures to a single client will have to be restricted in mostcases to less than 25 percent of the capital base, for instance.Analysts agree that market risks have been neglected in the past."Considering that Swiss banks make 29 percent of their total revenuesfrom trading, and the Barings collapse, it is clear that there arerisks there that should be dealt with," said Mark Rubenstein, Europeanbanking analyst at BZW. "Banks will have to sit down and look morecarefully at the capital they need."Banks have had two years to prepare for the CAD so on the whole theyare relatively unshaken by its arrival. The overall effect on holdingcapital will be neutral and won't make much difference to banks,according to Ian Linnell, investment banking analyst at Standard &Poor's."The CAD will give a good kick to the market," he said, "but as a riskmanagement tool, it is not a magic silver bullet, it's too cumbersome".Linnell suggests that investment banks themselves delegate risk controlin a much more efficient way than the CAD, a view held by many of thebanks themselves. Paribas is a case in point. Its own risk model uses250 points of observation. "It is not clear whether we are permitted tocontinue with our internal model," said Hoenn. "It would be stupid tohave to invest more in developing a new system just to comply with therules."Indeed, the CAD will require increased expenditure on upgradingtechnology, as it is a systems-based approach. "Everyone is investinglots of money in systems, because they have one additional set ofcalculations that has to be done concurrently and accurately," saidLeonard. IT investment among Europe's top banks ranges from as littleas 0.5 percent of asset value, according to a 1995 review of the top100 largest spenders on IT by Spikes Cavell, the market intelligenceproviders. Three banks appeared in the top ten spenders: Barclays wasnumber three spending $1.3 billion; ABN AMRO was number five with $960million and Deutsche Bank ranked ninth with $814 million.Smaller players may be crippled by the new overheads brought on by thedirectives. At the end of the day, this factor, along with otherhandicaps, such as lack of controlling models, will mean that theincreasingly "global" European market will become a stomping groundmainly for big investment banks and investors."Larger banks can exploit their muscle on a wider front, and thedirectives offer significant re-engineering opportunities," saidAggarwal."The odds are definitely tilting towards larger players."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996POLAND:  MERGER PLANS VIEWED WITH SUSPICIONPOLISH BANKERS are less than enthusiastic about the government's newapproach to restructuring the banking sector.The government has decided to merge seven state-owned banks into groupsled by Bank Handlowy y Warszawie and Polska Kasa Opieki (Bank Pekao).Pekao is to take over Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy and the Treasury's 63 percent stake in the Polski BankRozwoju (PBR). Handlowy would take over Pomorski Bank Kredytowy and theTreasury's remaining 46.6 percent stake in Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy(BPH).Until now, the government has sold off four of the nine regional banksone at a time - Bank Slaski, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, BankPrzemyslowo-Handlowy and, most recently, Bank Gdanski. At the end oflast year, it sold a domestic tranche of 35.8 percent of the Gdanskishares, and foreign investors bought all 25 percent of shares on offerabroad. Poland's eleventh- largest bank, Bank Iniciatyw Gospodarczych(BIG) bought 24.07 percent of the bank.Privatisation of the institutions remaining in state hands is expectedin late 1996 or in 1997. Although the new strategy of grouping thebanks could simplify an eventual privatisation "a more jaundiced viewheld by some market players is that the consolidation strategy ismerely a ploy for reasserting control over the banking system, a theorythat would be borne out if Bank Handlowy and Pekao are not privatised,"points out rating agency Standard & Poor's.Shareholders of BPH and of PBR, as well as the management of theregional banks, have raised objections. The plan can only succeed ifthe two banks are free of political influence, Handlowy presidentCezary Stypulkowski has said.Standard & Poor's also argue that the consolidation "would notsignificantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range forzloty-denominated obligations".The rating agency points out that in the near term the mergers wouldbring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio and thatintegration could be difficult."However, longer term, the greater diversity and market share could bepositive factors. Bank Handlowy would gain more retail deposits andcommercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution networkand possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertiseof Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokerstrength."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE UNWANTED DISTRACTIONWhile Italian banks are keen to grow, in recent times they have beencutting back on foreign expansion. Now the smaller, more flexible banksseem to be in the best position to exploit opportunities quicklyTHE ONGOING troubles of Italian banks as they come to terms withderegulation, privatisation and a more open and competitive market havebeen well documented. A less well-publicised aspect of the large-scalechanges underway has been the quiet scaling down or even completewithdrawal from operations abroad.Most of the Italian banks' foreign expansion happened in the 1980s, onthe back of a buoyant economy at home when politically- controlledbanks could afford prestigious offices in major capitals and branchnetworks in the more important markets. More recently, though,recession and the arrival of private investment have brought morepressing concerns at home and foreign expansion appears to have becomean unwanted distraction.IMI, the Rome-based bank privatised last year, was one of the moreactive and successful of the Italian banks abroad. Determinedlyindependent from political interference, it became an efficientoperator in international investment banking and capital markets.In 1993 Massimo Amato, managing director, of IMI International inLuxembourg, echoed the bank's president when he said optimisticallythat "IMI is a truly international bank and our intention is to becomea European institution of the highest calibre".The bank certainly had the right credentials for satisfying theambitions of its management and may well have achieved their objectivesbut for one costly mistake - the acquisition of the US investment bank,Mabon Securities, for around $20 million in 1991. Little is known ofexactly what went wrong, but only two years after the purchase the bankwas said to be looking for a buyer. Problems appear to have beenconcentrated in the subsidiary, Cedar Street, particularly in London,where management walked out en masse to join a rival.In September 1995 IMI announced that it was restructuring itsinvestment banking operations so that it could concentrate on Italianmarkets and its lira-denominated products. It also revealed that IMICapital Markets, the sole owner of Mabon Securities, was to have $30million injected into it. Little over a month later Cedar Street wassold to a US securities dealer, MKI. There has been no mention oflosses and little coverage in the Italian press, although IMI's balancesheet could be L60 billion ($38 million) the worse in 1995 and MabonSecurities faces liquidation.The mistake severely compromised IMI's other foreign operations and thebank also closed its Frankfurt-based venture, leaving the Luxembourgbank as the only serious foreign-based bank. Even Luxembourg's role wasdowngraded and Massimo Amato returned to a high ranking position with amedium-sized bank in Italy last year.Banca Nazionale del Lavoro has also had well-publicised problems in itsforeign subsidiaries and has reduced its once large US operation to itsNew York offices.Other groups have suffered from market pressures. Comit, the bankinggroup containing Banca Commerciale Italiana, is looking to cut itsoperation in France. Comit entered the French market at much the sametime as IMI was beginning its foreign expansion programme, buying BancaSudameris France. Losses in the French operation have forced the bankto look for buyers of most of the 19 branches.Banco di Napoli may also be looking for buyers in France. The Naplesbank had record losses last year and other Italian banks have bailed itout on condition that it implements an effective restructuringprogramme. This will almost certainly include the disposal of foreignoperations in France and Luxembourg.Another casualty of the tough French market was the bank owned byOlivetti owner Carlo De Benedetti, Dumenil Leble, which after L900billion losses over the last five years will be put into liquidation atthe end of January.In many cases, the purpose behind withdrawal has been to concentrateresources on the home front where, ironically, foreign banks arebecoming increasingly active. Leaner foreign banks are increasinglylooking to exploit weaknesses in the cumbersome Italian banking system.One of the major recent problems is the rift between Italian industryand its banking counterparts over lending rates. The needs of smallerexporting companies for competitive rates are quite clearly not beingmet. All leading banks in Italy raised their lending rates by O.5percent to 0.75 percent in November leaving industrialists dissatisfiedand rebellious.Mario Carraro, head of the Veneto region's industrial association, haslittle doubt that foreign banks are exploiting the rift and Italiancompanies are responding."Working with strong currencies we can get loans at 8 percent," hesaid. "Our [local] economy is primarily based on exports . .Republic or Poland we need advice and support from banks."The largest Italian banks appear to be the ones finding this sort ofservice more difficult to offer. Often it is the smaller banks withstrong roots in particular regions that are now exploiting theopportunities presented abroad. For example, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino, which bought the Swiss Banque de Depots et de Gestionin 1994, says that foreign expansion is limited to creating a networkin the areas that have strong links with the home base in Lombardy.Similarly, the Banca Popolare di Verona group, which is based in theeastern region of Veneto, has opened offices in eastern Europe"becausethat is where our clients are going for their work".The new approach to international expansion is much more pragmatic andoften the players are the second-tier banks. This creates something ofa contradiction for the industry. On the one hand, Italy's banks arekeen to grow, with even the biggest groups small by internationalstandards. On the other hand, it seems to be the smaller flexibleoperators which are better able to exploit openings quickly.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Theother Landesbanks would be well-advised to follow suit, EB reportsTHE RECENT co-operation agreement between Westdeutsche Landesbank(WestLB) and Bank Austria has created a three-way alliance betweenGermany's largest Landesbank and its counterparts in Austria and Italy,where Cariplo forms the third point of the triangle.The strategy marks a further departure from the Landesbanks'traditional business profile, although it is still too early to saywhether these co-operation agreements will generate significant newbusiness.It is some years now since WestLB moved beyond its original jobdescription as local banker and lender of last resort to the publicsector in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As competitive pressuresgrew on the local savings banks (Sparkassen), which buy their wholesalebanking services from WestLB, the Landesbank found it needed to offerbetter products and services and to earn more than their traditionallow-interest municipal lending business could offer.That way of thinking led WestLB to move into corporate business andthen, as a natural consequence, into capital markets and internationalcommercial banking. WestLB has since grown to become Germany's third-largest bank and is currently bolstering its London investment bank,known as West Merchant Bank, into a significant rival to private-sectordomestic competitors, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank.Under the terms of the German bank's agreement with Bank Austria, whichwas signed just before Christmas, each becomes the other's"preferredpartner" for cross-border financial transactions, particularly inforeign commercial business, international payments, currency clearingand securities business.Bank Austria's experience in eastern Europe will be invaluable. WestLBhas established branches in a number of central and eastern Europeancapitals but does not have the broad network that the Austrians havealready established.The German's other partner is Cassa di Risparmio delle ProvincieLombarde (Cariplo), the Italian bank. WestLB's ultimate aim is toconstruct a network of partner banks in all the main European markets.WestLB's aspirations in investment banking have taken up plenty of timeand resources over the past year and the man with chief responsibilityfor the new alliances with Cariplo and Bank Austria is Hans-HenningOffen, deputy chairman of the board of management and one of the twoboard members responsible for investment banking. Bank sources say itwill take a good year before any substantial progress can be announced,although quicker results might be achieved in cross-border payments.It is clear that WestLB, the wholesale banker and umbrella for 150local savings banks in the Rhine and Ruhr region, has chosen to rely onalliances with other savings bank institutions. Bank Austria is asavings bank sector institution and, like WestLB, has grownprodigiously. Cariplo comes from the same roots and is often referredto as the world's largest savings bank.These upper-tier banks choose to co-operate with one another becausethey understand the difficulties of convincing local savings banks tomarket new products to customers rather than being able to approachcustomers directly. The structure of the savings bank sector in almostany European country usually means delays and it sometimes results inpainful, politically charged compromises.Other state-owned banks understand that the German Landesbanks areobliged to take on some unrewarding business, such as low- interestcredits or the administration of subsidies, for local authorities.Since they understand each other better than private sector bankswould, the alliances between WestLB, Cariplo and Bank Austria have abetter chance of success.WestLB's recent activities in the capital markets suggest that theLandesbanks are still wary of liaisons with private sectorinstitutions. West Merchant Bank in London is being fashioned into acompetitor for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner/Kleinwort Benson.Possibly because there is no savings bank institution with sufficientexpertise in investment banking, WestLB has chosen to go it alone. Eventhe domestic competition was ousted: Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, aminority shareholder in West Merchant Bank, was bought out so thatWestLB could avoid internal competition from German or foreign bankswith similar constituencies.As for Bayerische Landesbank, NordLB, Helaba and the other GermanLandesbanks, it is a fair bet that their future strategy will beinspired by that of WestLB, which has long been the largest and mostinternational of the 13 Landesbanks.Bayerische Landesbank, in particular, is investing heavily in otherEuropean markets. Over the past two years, chief executive FranzNeubauer has purchased shareholdings in the Hungarian Foreign TradeBank, the Czech Savings Bank in Prague, the Sudtiroler Sparkasse inItaly - and now the Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft in Vienna.Others are more tardy. One reason is that their energy is being sappedby problems and challenges at home - and by the constant effort ofexpanding in order to keep level with WestLB. Norddeutsche Landesbank,Helaba and Bayerische Landesbank are negotiating a far-reaching co-operation on everything from edp systems to international strategy.NordLB has already bought a stake in BGB.Traditional banking alliances are still being made with banks inemerging markets. Bayerische Landesbank has just signed an agreement onthe financing of German exports to Russia with Inkombank, the country'slargest commercial bank. But the Bavarians are not taking any risks:all the long-term deals concerned will be covered by the German exportguarantee agency Hermes; others will be guaranteed by the RussianMinistry of Finance or covered by barter deals. Indeed, Bayern LB hasbeen sensible enough to keep its initial objectives modest.But the other Landesbanks will have to move quickly into more strategicalliances if WestLB, Cariplo, Bank Austria and whichever new partnernext emerges are not to steal away their regional business. AlthoughWestLB is still formally committed to the Rhine/Ruhr region, it nowacts for corporate customers all over Germany.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) is displacing thetraditional bank deposit. The volume of assets held in MMMFs nowexceeds the cash held in call or demand deposits. Conventional mutualfunds are winning market share in the longer-term savings market.Overall, around 30 percent of US households own mutual funds.In the UK, however, mutual funds have failed to arouse the same depth -and breadth - of interest. Indeed, in some respects the UK mutual fundsector lags behind that of mainland Europe.Unit trusts, the UK equivalent of the open-ended investment fund, havehad their moments, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.More recently, the sector experienced a minor boom in 1993 on the backof rising stockmarkets.In the intervening periods, however, the unit trust has failed toexcite the British punter. The number of unitholder accounts reached apeak of 2.4 million in 1970 and declined throughout the 1970s, reachinga trough of 1.72 million. Interest in unit trusts recovered during the1980s on the back of booming stockmarkets but it was not until 1985that the 1970 peak was exceeded.Interest subsided following the crash of 1987 before moving onto newhighs during the 1990s. Currently the Association of Unit Trusts andInvestment Funds (AUTIF), the sector's trade association, estimatesthat there are 6.58 million unit trust accounts, with total assets of#109 billion ($168 billion).Since investors typically hold units in more than one fund, the overallnumber of unit trust holders is probably much less. In 1993 AUTIFestimated that there were only around 1.5 million individual investors - around 3 percent of the total population.There are a number of reasons for this situation. The fact that UKbanks have tended to pay interest not dissimilar to money market rateson bank deposits has diminished the attraction of MMMFs. Unit trustshave had to compete on an unfavourable basis with the attractions ofalternative long-term savings products such as life assurancecontracts. Until the advent of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP), mutualfunds were not in receipt of any form of fiscal privilege. By way ofcontrast, until 1984 tax relief was offered on life assurance premiums.The relative attraction of life assurance contracts was enhanced by thefact that they were a preferred way of funding residential mortgages.For a significant part of the post-war period residential property hasbeen perceived by the average Briton as the investment par excellence.From the manufacturer's point of view, life assurance contracts offeredother attractions. The fact that the investment value of a lifeassurance policy was relatively opaque - investors just assumed thatthey would receive a large sum of money when the contract wasterminated - obscured the risks associated with this type ofinstrument. More pertinently, in an age of non- disclosure, it openedthe way for high costs and fees to be passed directly to the customer.Unit trusts were more transparent. Investment losses or poorperformance quickly came to light. Costs were also much more visibleand off-putting. The nature of the contract permitted only limitedopportunities for realising commission income. In contrast to theirpeers in the US, the UK mutual fund companies seemed incapable ofcoming up with anything that would positively enhance the unit trust'simage.In fact, they often seemed intent on the reverse. Loads and annualmanagement charges were allowed to creep up. UK companies even turneddown the UK government's invitation to introduce legislation permittingthe introduction of open-ended investment companies (OIECs), a mutualfund structure which has become the norm elsewhere.There is at last evidence, however, to suggest that the tide may beturning, irrespective of the behaviour of stockmarkets (always animportant factor as far as the public's appetite for unit trusts isconcerned).A key element in this respect was the decision by the UK government tomake qualifying unit trusts fully eligible for inclusion in PEPs.Investors can now shelter from both income and capital gains tax up to6,000 of unit trust investments per annum. For the first time, unittrusts have a more favourable tax status than life assurance contracts.The relative attraction of life assurance contracts has been underminedby a combination of factors. The scandals associated with the way inwhich these and other long-term savings contracts such as personalpensions were sold, the advent of disclosure and the inflexibility ofthese contracts have all impeded their sale.More importantly, competition has finally arrived. There has been anexplosion in new products, especially"life-style products" such as unittrust savings plans linked to school and college fees, mortgagerepayments and pensions. Price competition has also picked up. No-loadfunds, with very low annual management fees, are becoming increasinglycommon.As is often the case, when the history of the UK mutual fund sectorcomes to be written, credit for these changes will probably beattributed to an outsider: Virgin's Richard Branson. His launch of alow-cost index tracking fund in early 1995 was an important catalyst.Close on Branson's heels, HSBC, River & Mercantile, Legal & General andFidelity Investments have all introduced low-cost index trackers.Indeed, since the index tracker appears to have captured the public'simagination, other suppliers are set to join them in the near future.Will the UK be converted to the merits of the mutual fund? Thesituation is certainly much more promising. The arrival of the OIEClater this year, low-risk corporate bond trusts, low costs, lowinterest rates and (hopefully) booming stockmarkets, coupled withgreater marketing awareness on the part of the fund companies, shouldprovide the basis for take-off. As usual, however, time will tell.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But, if demand isweak, banks could be left holding the stock themselves for months oreven years.By that simple logic, it seems self-evident that the banks will tryevery tactic and ruse to encourage investors to buy the nation's firsttelecoms shares. That is what the German government hoped when itdecided last year not to create new tax breaks on share ownership inorder to encourage the German public to buy Telekom stock.Instead, the government and Deutsche Telekom's own management haveappealed to the banks to invent (and pay for) whatever incentives theythink necessary to make the new shares attractive.By placing the ball so firmly in the banks' court, the Germangovernment is perpetuating the old belief that banks are not justcommercial organisations which aim to maximise profits for theirshareholders but also have a duty to offer financial support todeserving parts of the economy.It is a curious reflection of the German consensus model that banks tooare regarded as official sponsors of economic and social change.Banks may rage about this outdated view but the Telekom debate has putthem in a difficult dilemma. All of the major banks were so eager towin places in the Telekom issuing syndicate that they were driven tomake extravagant promises.Deutsche Bank, one of the global coordinators, and Dresdner Bank,coordinator for the German market, are said to have made a personalpledge to German chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Telekom issue would bea success at all costs. And the government's favour is all-importantfor banks which want a prominent role in future privatisation issuessuch as Deutsche Bahn and Postbank.In January 1996, just weeks before the marketing campaign begins for amammoth placement that cannot be postponed any longer, it is nowevident what responsibility the banks face. That burden restsparticularly on the shoulders of Dresdner Bank.Unless the banks forgo bank charges, they may not be able to sellsufficient stock to establish investor confidence. And if demand isweak the banks will be blamed - and will end up forced to buy theunwanted shares. Indeed, outsiders may never find out how much genuinedemand there really was for Telekom stock.We can only speculate what the results of the Telekom issue will be. Ifbanks do have to provide special incentives for private investors, thatwill set a trend for all future privatisations and could have a radicaleffect on bank charges in Germany.It will also create a new interdependence between the retail bankingand capital markets division of the big German banks. That will beunwelcome at institutions which are trying to create more autonomy ineach division, but it may be unavoidable.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CHANGES IN GERMAN MARKETRETAIL BANKERS in Germany have been confronted by dozens of innovationsover the past 18 months: discount broking was followed by directbanking, dual-branded credit cards, free banking and now Internetbroking.But before any home grown innovators, such as the pioneer discountbroker Direkt-Anlage Bank, could find the time and the money to reachout to foreign markets, German brokers have found themselves defendingtheir crumbling market from foreigners. Credit Suisse, for instance,recently launched a direct brokerage in Germany.The appearance of foreign competitors is nothing new. US-basedinvestment banks created a stir in the late 1980s when they establishedoperations in Frankfurt and began to attract capital markets businessaway from German institutions. The expertise they brought to Frankfurtpropelled German banks into acquiring the same experience themselves.With hindsight, German bankers agree that the foreign investmentbankers have been beneficial for the Frankfurt marketplace.They are still classified as"foreign banks" and few belong to themainstream Association of German Banks, but in fact institutions likeSalomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Swiss Bank Corporation now pursuemuch the same objectives as domestic banks. That recognition is the keyto the successful development of Finanzplatz Frankfurt in future.All 135 foreign banks in Frankfurt - even the branches which simplyadminister commercial business for clients from home - are concernedabout the minimum reserve requirement, the supervision of derivativesbusiness, the new electronic systems of the Frankfurt Stock Exchangeand the improvement of international payment systems.Although the financial legislation of 1994 introduced some reforms,notably the establishment of a securities trading supervisory office,both Germans and foreign banks complain that the changes have not yetgone far enough. The finance ministry in Bonn is being lobbied byvarious banking groups which hope to see a number of changes in theforthcoming Third Financial Markets Promotion Act.Ideally, the banks would like to see abolition of the minimum reserve,rapid implementation of the capital adequacy directive and immediateissue of short-term government debt.With the finance ministry still smarting from the decision of the bigGerman banks to shift important capital markets operations to London orNew York, it is important for the banking community to present a unitedfront. That will be enormously beneficial in persuading both thefinance ministry and the Bundesbank that a free-market and not aprotectionist approach will best secure a promising future forFinanzplatz Frankfurt.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Thegroup's net profit went up to Sch2.2 billion ($215 million) in 1995from Sch1.9 billion a year earlier. Its operating result rose to Sch5.9billion, up 4 percent and 40 percent higher than that of the domesticoperation Creditanstalt- Bankverein AG.Domestic business suffered from weak credit demand, a shift to low-interest, short-term loans and pressure on the interest margin, GuidoSchmidt-Chiari, group chairman, said on January 9. Earnings fromindustrial holdings were up but provisions for loans to domesticcustomers were up to Sch3.1 billion, from Sch2.7 billion in 1994.In its recent Banking System Outlook for Austria, Moody's rating agencyexpressed concern about the country's poor banking returns. AfterBelgium, Austria is the most overbanked country in the European Union -at end 1994 one bank or bank branch served only 1,384 people.Unlike Austria's bankers, Moody's is not sure that the thin returnswill deter foreign entrants. This might, Moody's believes, "(a) only betrue during the near-term, and (b) hold only for the more plain vanillabanking products and services".Creating shareholder value has not been an overriding strategicobjective for Austrian banks. The politicised system has not onlycontributed to the delay in selling the government's 49 percent stakein Creditanstalt and 20 percent of Bank Austria but means that it willbe difficult for banks to improve their cost structure, Moody's argues.Inherent competitive cost advantages "may enable more efficient foreignentrants to compete against domestic institutions with some success",the report says. It predicts that the country's financial markets willbecome more exposed to domestic asset and savings disintermediation andto cross-border competition "that is likely to focus on niche marketssuch as mutual funds, lease finance and credit cards".Faced with pressure at home, Creditanstalt, like Austria's otherleading banks, has been turning its attention to eastern Europe. Inthis region, where Creditanstalt has to date invested Sch1.9 billion,the bank's accumulated operating result rose from Sch330 million toSch366 million.Moody's warns that competition may, in the medium term, make bankingactivities in eastern Europe less attractive than they lookedinitially. It also cautions that the extent and volatility of risk isdifficult to quantify.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

At that time, the companies set up two jointcontrol and development holdings: Midi Participations, which is 60percent owned by Finaxa and 40 percent by Generali; and Generali MidiExpansion (GME), which is 60 percent held by Generali and 40 percent byAXA.Under the new agreement, Midi Participations will be dissolved andGenerali will buy back AXA's 40 percent reciprocal stake in GME. Thegroups have also agreed to finalise a shareholder agreement by February15, reaffirming their intention to seek joint development opportunitiesand "barring unforeseen circumstances" to maintain their shareholdingsat current levels.Generali observers have been speculating about possibly heavier Frenchinvolvement since June last year, when Eugenio Coppola di Cazanostepped down as Generali chairman and chief executive for healthreasons. He was replaced as chairman by Antoine Bernheim, generalpartner of Lazard Freres, the Paris financial group which owns 4.7percent of Generali's equity.At the beginning of that month, Generali had signed an agreement tofuse its French subsidiary with La France group, indirectly controlledby Lazard Freres, creating France's 11th-largest non- life insurer,Generali France Holding.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The European Commission in Brussels is shortly dueto spell out clearly how the bank is to proceed in selling off 35percent of its commercial banking assets abroad, including 50 percentof those in Europe outside France, before the end of 1998 - the pricethe bank has had to pay for its massive state bail-out (see EB).This would mean dismantling the French banks' expensively acquiredbranch network, with the exception of BfG Bank in Germany, the largestand most profitable of Credit Lyonnais's European units and the one itmost earnestly wants to keep.But this would also seem to be in contradiction of the assertion byPhillippe Cloes, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, that hisbank was "not on the list of sell-offs" and a similar statement made bymanagers at Credit Lyonnais's Swiss unit.The protocol signed between the Commission and the French state whichstipulates that the 1998 deadline can be extended if the sale of assetsleads to "large losses" or "forces the main shareholder [the state] togive fresh financial support". The bank's own board of directors hasstated that it will be "very careful that future disinvestments do notlead to a decline in the bank's financial standing".Credit Lyonnais has also announced the opening of a branch in theNetherlands, designed to serve the bank's corporate customers. Thiscomes just a few months after the sale of the scandal-ridden CreditLyonnais Bank-Nederland to the Belgian Generale de Banque as part ofthe rationalisation of its non-domestic network.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It closed nine ofits 46 branches and let go 30 of its 280 staff in late December lastyear in a bid to halve these losses by the end of 1996."The branches were simply unprofitable and had too few customers." saidLothar Lanz, board member at HSB. So far Hypo- Bank has invested aboutDM50 million in HSB, which currently has 110,000 customers and abalance sheet total of DM1.5 billion.Deutsche Bank has built up a network of 400 branches in the new FederalStates in two-and-a-half years and plans to maintain it, a spokesmansaid. "It makes sense to build up a branch network, although not allare profitable," he said. Germany's number one bank acquired 120 ofthese offices through a joint venture with Deutsche Kredit Bank,formerly an exclusively east German bank. It currently has 90 branchesin west Berlin alone.Bayerische Vereinsbank has a widely spread network of over 100 branchoffices, built up since reunification. The bank expects corporatebusiness to get riskier in the coming years because a lot of stateschemes will peter out.It also expects margins to narrow in the retail sector becausecompetition will be largely price-based and, for this reason, ispromoting phone banking and on-line banking.Dresdner Bank, which has 250 branches in the new federal states, sees"no need for cuts".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Sorcha Corcoran reportsOFTEN DESCRIBED as the only true pan-European retail bank, Citibank,the banking arm of US multi-finance group Citicorp, now generatesnearly one-third of its total revenues in Europe. Germany continues tobe Citibank's European shining star but the bank is also pushing itsglobal strategy of providing services "anywhere, anytime, anyhow", inBelgium, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and, most recently,the UK.There have been rumours that Citibank will reorganise its Europeanretail operations in view of former head of retail banking VictorMenezes' recent promotion to corporate finance officer at Citicorp. Adecision on reorganisation will be made in the next couple of monthsbut no comment is available yet.Up to now, Citibank in Europe has stuck closely to its global retailstrategy, pursued in 41 countries worldwide. This is to provideupscale, premium financial services, with a multinational servicenetwork, through a minimal number of branches, supplemented withtelephone and ATM service."We aim to deliver private customers the same bank services in the samebranches across Europe," Folkert Mindermann, managing director ofCitibank Privatkunden AG, the German consumer bank, told EB. "It is aregion where we expect considerable growth in revenues."The bank's considerable success in the lucrative European consumermarket is largely due to the fact that its niche strategy minimisesfrontal attacks, argued a recent study of the Citicorp organisation,Citicorp Europe - Refashioning Itself for the Nineties, published byanalysts Salomon Brothers.Citibank has defined its retail target as "internationally aware,performance demanding and located primarily in large populationcentres". The middle-income market needs most attention in the nearfuture, Mindermann said.Excluding the card business, Europe contributed $1.5 billion toCitibank's total consumer revenues in 1995, representing 30 percent oftotal revenues, Mindermann said. There are 500 consumer branches inEurope, nearly half the world total of 1,200, and the bank employs7,000 people in the region. Assets came to $50 billion last year.The consumer business is as much a marketing company as a bank. Theaim: to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Colais to the soft drinks industry. All European branches now sport theCitibank label and Citibank has introduced the "model branch" concept,in which the same signage, architecture and operating systems are usedin Citibank branches around the world.In these branches, consumers have access to Customer ActivatedTerminals (CATs), an advanced touchscreen system that recognises fromthe customer's PIN what language to use. Every Citibank customer has aCiticard, which can be tied to several accounts, even with differentcurrencies.An important feature of Citibank's Euro-attack is its integratednetwork, Mindermann said. The bank moved nine consumer banking datacentres scattered around Europe to a single location at Meerbusch,Germany in 1994. All European branches now have access to accountinformation on line."Citibank is the only European bank with one integrated system,"Mindermann said. "For this reason it is the highest ranked in Europe interms of consumer orientation."The integrated electronic data processing system improves cost andcontrol and allows Citibank to roll out new products more quickly,Salomon Brothers notes. The bank need simply transfer "existingsystems, products and methodologies using infrastructure, experienceand language skills available elsewhere in the network", the reportpoints out.One key business area in Europe is cards. Citibank had 1 million creditcard accounts in 1995 and by the end of the millennium this should growto 5 million, predicted Roberta Arena, head of cards in the US andEurope. To minimise unit costs, the bank is transferring Europeantransactions across the Atlantic to Citibank's processing centre inSioux Falls, South Dakota.Citicorp started its regional credit card effort in 1989, beginningwith four countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain. In fiveyears, the card base had grown to 500,000. The bank has become thelargest issuer in Greece since then and is now opening accounts in twonew countries each year.Establishing cards businesses was a "gruesomely expensive" five yeareffort, Arena said. High entry costs will, however, benefit Citibank bydiscouraging other players from entering its selected markets, sheforecast.Arena expects Citibank to be the number one card issuer in Germanybefore long. At the end of 1994 it ranked fourth and was within 50,000cards of Deutsche Bank.In a move which alarmed traditionalists, Citibank has launched a co-branded card with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. The dual-brandingoffer allows holders of the Bahncard rail discount card to add a Visaor Electron payment function at no additional charge.A legal battle ensued as the German competition authority, Zentrale zurBekampfung des unlauteren Wettbewerbs, opposed the deal, deeming itunlawful. Citibank won the case in November and now claims that itsBahncard has the potential to revolutionise the cards industry in amarket viewed by many observers as still underpenetrated. There arealready 3 million Bahncard holders in Germany, and their numbers areset to rise to 5 million over the next couple of years.Indeed, Germany stands out for Citibank in more ways than one. As thelargest and oldest retail bank (founded in 1926), Citibank PrivatkundenAG generates over 50 percent of European revenues. Of the 500 Europeanbranches, 300 are German, and 4,000 of the 7,000 employees are locatedthere.At end-September 1995, the balance sheet total of Citibank PrivatkundenAG came to DM15.9 billion ($11 billion), up from DM15.2 billion at theend of 1994. It now serves 2.5 million customers with 4.4 million bankaccounts, insurance policies, Citibank Visa cards and home savingsagreements.Mindermann attributes much of Citibank's German success to theacquisition of Kundenkreditbank in 1974. "Kundenkreditbank was verystrong at that time, with a good branch network," he said.Although among the highest returning banks in Germany for many years,the bank was traditionally a blue-collar-oriented company with limitedgrowth. Citibank revamped the bank in 1989, establishing a more upscaleimage through enhancing service and marketing.Unique to Germany so far is CitiPhone Direct Banking, a full bankingand financial service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with personalservice by telephone. Citibank, as the pioneer of telephone banking inGermany in 1989, started the new service in October 1995.Previously only cash transactions were possible over the phone. Now,customers use a personal password and identification number fortelephone handling of savings-account, investment, securities, creditand insurance business. Only one signature is needed for all accounts."CitiPhone Direct Banking has got off to a very good start," saidMindermann. "Already we have reached more than 3,000 new customers, andare receiving an average of 1,500 calls a day. Most people areinterested in all the services offered."Citibank plans to use the Aachen-based telecentre for CitiPhone DirectBanking to target customers in other European countries. Aachen is wellsituated for this purpose in the German, Dutch and Belgian bordertriangle, close to France and within easy reach of the UK, so thatstaff with mother tongues can easily be recruited.In order to tap new market potential in Germany, Citibank entered inDecember into an extensive collaboration agreement with HDIHaftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie, the country's seventhlargest insurance group.HDI is taking over the entire insurance operations of the CitibankGroup in Germany through the purchase of all shares in its insuranceholding company, Citifinanzleistungen GmbH. This company holds all theshares in Citi Lebensversicherung, set up in 1985 and in CitiVersicherung, set up in 1992. A purchase price has not been disclosed.Under the agreement, Citibank will integrate the products of HDI intothe marketing channels of its banking operations - both the branchnetwork and telephone banking channel - and HDI will, in turn, offerits private clients the banking products and services of Citibank."HDI's 1.8 million private insurance customers will provide us withvery good cross-selling business,", Mindermann said.Citi Leben, whose product range covers individual, whole life and riskinsurance, had total sum insured by end-November 1995 of DM16.7billion, up 4 percent on 1994. HDI notched up consolidated premiumincome totalling DM8 billion in 1994 and a net profit of DM134 million.This kind of co-operative agreement will be important for Citibank inEurope in promoting its concept of a "multi- finance service in bankingoperations", Mindermann said. In linking up with HDI, Citibank iscontinuing along the path already taken in offering home financing(together with Rheinboden), home savings agreements (with mh) andhealth insurance (with Barmenia) in order to optimise its own financialservices business by exploiting "intercorporate alliances".The most recent European market Citibank has targeted with its consumerservices is the UK. During 1995, it opened five branches, all followingthe same strategy as elsewhere on the globe."We simply rolled out what's been happening in Germany, France andSpain," said Mike Dennehy, consumer banking and marketing director forthe UK. "The UK is such a mature and sophisticated market that we hadto be sure we got the formula exactly right before starting a consumeroperation."Account structures differ around Europe but the UK has adopted variousfeatures from other Citibank markets. For example, if a customer has abalance of over #2,000 on all of his/her accounts, there is no bankingcharge, a feature of the Belgian operation.The UK has also taken on the Greek policy of instant credit cardissuance. Customers can receive a card on the spot, if they fulfil allthe requirements, simply by filling out a form.The biggest obstacle to setting up a retail operation in the UK was thefact that Citibank was so well known as a corporate bank, Dennehy said.In the UK since 1902, Citibank now employs 3,000 people, 400 of whichare now in the consumer business. The bank has been offering mortgagesfor 25 years. Dennehy stressed that Citibank in the UK is only after aniche market - clients earning #30,000 ($46,418) and above with an"international element to their lives"."We're not looking for hundreds of thousands of customers, but tens ofthousands," he said."They could be someone who works in Belgium oneweek out of four, or has a house in France, for instance."Citibank Germany - Key Statistics 1990-1995 (DM million)                                                       to Sep to Sep                           1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995Total Assets               10,881 12,683 14,394 15,158 15,190 15,854Net Incomea                  69.3   62.9   97.4  170.0      -      -Return on Assets             0.64%  0.53%  0.72%  1.12%     -      -Return on Equity             12.1%  10.5%  14.8%     -      -      -Customer deposits           8,637  9,878 11,187 12,139 12,344 13,000Lending volume              9,305 10,769 11,933 12,089 11,924 11,971Insurance in force         11,197 13,321 15,002 15,673      -      -Number of policies in force 2,021  2,331  2,577  2,795      -      -Number of accounts          2,965  3,274  3,578  3,658      -  4,400Visa Cards (000s)             170    202    260    302    342    383Total customer relationships              3,264  3,620  4,012  4,173      -      -Number of customers (millions)                   1.9    2.1    2.3    2.4      -    2.5Number of branches            303    304    303    304      -    300Number of employees         3,331  3,444  3,714  3,870      -  4,000Source : Citibank and Salomon BrothersCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

According to reports, Citibank'sFrench subsidiary is attempting to sell its small and medium-sizedenterprise portfolio and its small branch network in the provinces inorder to concentrate on its consumer banking business in the Parisarea. Among the possible candidates set to take over this portfolio isthe Banques Populaires group.The rumours, on which Citibank would not comment, come hard on theheels of news that prestigious names such as Banca Commerciale Italiana(Comit), Barclays Bank, La Caixa and American Express are all in theprocess of lowering their retail banking ambitions in France.Comit, for example, is thought to be discussing the sale of part of its19-branch network (most of which is on the Cote d'Azur, apart from fivebranches in Paris) to Banques Populaires. The Italian bank lost Fr495.8million ($100 million) in France in the period 1992-1994, mostlybecause of its involvement in speculative property loans.Less prominent names such as Banco di Napoli, ASLK-CGER Bank of Belgiumand the Banque Franco-Portugaise have also announced lay- offs anddecisions to refocus their businesses.The news also comes shortly after the release of figures by theAssociation Francaise des Banques which suggest that the chances ofsurvival of small niche-based retail banks (many of which are owned bynon-French institutions) are extremely slim. These suggest that netbanking income and operating profits have continued to fall steadilythrough the first half of 1995.As foreign banks in France generally lack the critical mass towithstand this downward pressure and increasing competition, theirattempts to carve out a branch-based business have been frustrated.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

(454 words) A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS (150 words) CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993PORTUGAL BEATS GERMANY TO TOP LEAGUE OF SAVERSThe Portuguese appear to be the thriftiest people in Europe, accordingto OECD data.The surprising figures push Italy and Germany into second and thirdplaces in terms of household savings as a proportion of disposableincome.In absolute terms, the Germans save more than any other Europeans -simply because there are more of them, each with more money at his orher disposal than the majority of other Europeans.The reunification of the two German republics in October 1990 makeshistorical comparisons and projections in the area of personal savingsproblematical.But in round figures, German households could put away something likeDM150 billion (Ecu 77 bn) this year in long-term financial investments- including life assurance and occupational pension funds.Besides being among Europe's heaviest savers, the Germans also have thedistinction of being the steadiest.In comparison with other states they show a batch of remarkablyconsistent savings ratios:  total savings (including investment inhousing) as a percentage of disposable income;  financial savings as apercentage of total resources available for investment; or long-termfinancial savings in relation to short-term - all follow aconspicuously regular pattern.Another distinguishing feature of German households is a low level ofindebtedness, particularly compared with the French and the British.Although there is evidence that in Germany (as in the United Kingdom)consumers regard borrowed money in very much the same way as income, aspart, in other words, of their normal budget, a recent survey showedthat nearly half the adult German population still feels uneasy aboutthe idea of having to take out a loan.Higher consumer confidenceAccording to the OECD, from  data supplied by the Ministry of Financeand the Bank of Portugal, Portuguese households save a greaterproportion of their income than anyone else in Europe.Throughout the 1980s the personal savings ratio, as defined above,averaged 25.9 per cent.The ratio reached a peak of 28.3 per cent in 1985, but declined bynearly six percentage points over the next three years.Although real disposable income grew at the record rate of 6.5 per centin 1990, its rate of increase has since eased to 2.8 per cent in 1992.At the same time, the savings ratio has also continued to decline, andin 1992 was 21.6 per cent.The decline was probably due to a number of factors.  The slowing downof consumer price inflation, with its positive impact on households'net worth was one.Added to this were higher consumer confidence, the progressive relaxingof liquidity constraints, expectations of higher permanent incomes asfuture employment prospects improved, and (until 1991, at least) thenotably sharp rise in retirement pensions.But a household savings ratio of 21.6 per cent of disposable income isstill well above the ratios of the other OECD countries, and a numberof social and economic factors are at work to maintain such a highrate.It is estimated that there are some 4.3 mn  Portuguese living abroad(one million of them in other EC countries), compared with a residentpopulation of 10.4 mn.Remittances from emigrant workers, although showing a decline in 1992,have made and still make a substantial contribution on current accountto the Portuguese balance of payments, and although no data areavailable to allow one to distinguish this specific flow of funds,these remittances may be assumed to give a significant boost topersonal sector savings.A comparatively high proportion of the resident workforce is self-employed, and motivated by the consequent volatility of income andcomparatively low social protection to maintain a fairly high level ofprecautionary saving.A further element in personal saving is probably intended to maintainor restore the net wealth of households subject to erosion  by a rateof inflation which, although falling since 1990 is still the secondhighest (after Greece) in the European Community.Finally, the relatively under developed consumer credit market may alsoplay a part in Portugal's high household savings ratio, as it certainlydoes in Italy.Italy has the highest household savings rate of all the major OECDcountries -  in recent years even above Japan by between one and twopercentage points.Although the rate has declined steadily since its peak around 26 percent in the 1960s and early 1970s, in the last three years it hasaveraged more than 15 per cent, compared with just over 8 per cent inthe United Kingdom and 12 per cent in Germany.The fact that Italy's savings rate is so high is at first sightsurprising, and probably not consonant with what many people outsideItaly take to be the national temperament.  But the causes of such ahigh rate are not immediately cultural, but technical.Low development of capital marketsIn a paper1 presented to an international conference on savingsbehaviour held in Helsinki in 1991, a team of Italian economists foundthat the low development of Italian capital markets was the main reasonfor three conspicuous characteristics of the Italian savings rate(whether national or private): its high level; its substantialreduction in the past three decades; and its strong correlation withthe growth of the national economy.The authors of the paper showed that Italian credit and insurancemarkets are considerably smaller, relative to GDP, than those of othercomparably developed countries.Credit finances a trivial share of household consumption andinvestment, Italy's small credit market being explained by the terms ofconsumer credit (high down payment levels; a wide spread betweenborrowing and lending rates) rather than by demographic or culturalfactors.One consequence of these technical factors is that the Italian mortgagemarket is one of the smallest among OECD countries, and expressed as apercentage of private consumption expenditure, only a small fraction ofthe average of the seven major (G7) countries.  This factor alone,according to Sig Guiso and his co-authors,  may account for some two orthree percentage points in the aggregate savings ratio.Italians still buy little life insuranceItalians still buy very little life insurance, in comparison with thecitizens of other G7 countries, particularly.  Life assurance premiumincome is now increasing rapidly (by 22 per cent in 1991, compared with19 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany), but the level oflife assurance per inhabitant is still only a fraction (between  20 and25 per cent) of the level in those other two EC countries.The authors of the Helsinki paper give reasons, however, for supposingthat credit market imperfections outweigh imperfect insurance marketsin explaining the behaviour of Italian households.They also discount any special bequest motive in explaining the highpersonal savings rate, arguing that the rate at which the elderly shedtheir assets is actually greater in Italy than in Japan or the UnitedStates.`The  evidence,'  they conclude, `suggests that Italians are notdifferent in any major respect from other OECD citizens;  rather, it isItalian capital markets that are different.'1  Luigi Guiso, Tullio Jappelli, and Daniele Terlizzese, `Saving andcapital market imperfections: the Italian experience', Helsinki, May1991.Financial saving and borrowing of Italian households1990-1992 (L'000 bn)Current savings            1990        19913       1992Cash                        1.5         6.3         8.4Sight deposits             33.6        41.9        -5.7Other deposits             54.9        37.1        46.1Short-dated securities     29.0        17.1        57.5Medium- and long-dated securities                55.5        71.9        30.1  of which: Treasury bills and bonds (46.0)      (53.1)      (24.3)Investment funds            0.8         5.3         0.7Equities                   15.2         5.0         6.4Foreign assets              4.0        16.2        17.5Other financial assets, incl. claims on insurance companies       22.0        25.9        39.8Total savings1            216.7       226.7       200.8Ecu bn equivalent2        142.2       147.9       126.5BorrowingShort-dated debt           10.2        10.8         7.2  of which: debt with banks           (9.7)      (10.7)       (7.1)Medium- and long-dated debt                      18.6        20.2        11.5  of which: debt with banks           (7.1)       (9.4)       (4.8)  debt with special credit  institutions             (8.6)       (9.0)       (7.3)Other financial liabilities incl. consumer credit            2.5         5.8         7.8Total borrowing            31.3        36.8        26.5Ecu bn equivalent2         20.5        24.1        16.71 Discrepancies due to rounding2 At annual average rate of exchange3 Change in methodology in 1991 makes earlierfigures not always strictly comparableSource: Bank of Italy}}Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993RATIONALE OF THE RATIOSIn spite of their importance to national economies, household orpersonal savings are defined by official statisticians essentially as aresidual item.Savings from their point of view are simply that portion of anindividual's income that he or she refrains from spending.  They'rewhat's left, in other words, after consumers have stopped consuming.Official statisticians also like to refer to `disposable income', bywhich they mean income, from whatever source, after taxes have beenpaid and social security payments or receipts have been netted out.Flows of personal savings are calculated in effect as the surplus ofcurrent income over current expenditure, and disposable income isallocated for the purposes of national accounts entirely between savingand consumption.Consumption is estimated from a variety of data, and simply deductedfrom income in order to arrive at savings.The figures on savings are supposed to be checked against otherindicative data, but this enterprise tends to show up some prettyglaring discrepancies, which official statisticians seek to correct byfalling back on conveniently undefined `balancing items'.In any case, household savings, as featured in national accounts,include investment in housing, both in house or apartment purchase andhome renovation or improvement.In some countries, spending on consumer durables is also sometimescounted as saving.Realistic measure of savingsFinancial savings, which are mainly what this newsletter is concernedwith, are therefore only a part of household savings, as habituallydefined.But if the numerator in the household savings ratio is too broad toindicate the magnitude of purely financial savings, the denominator istoo narrow to determine households' financial resources.Because apart from actual income, derived from salaries, wages andinvestments, householders (which in practical terms include millions ofindividuals who do not actually hold a house) also often borrow money,and perhaps not quite so often, inherit it.For this reason, more and more analysts of savings trends in a numberof countries are focusing attention on the financial resourcesavailable to households, rather than on income as usually defined.The practical implications of what may seem to be conceptual nuancesare enormous.From the point of view of financial services, as pointed out by DrDavid Fleming in his paper, Time for a realistic measure of savings1,,`a high-savings, highly-borrowed market is very different from a low-savings, lightly-borrowed market, even if the net savings level is thesame in each case.'Why bother, then, with the traditional household savings ratio?The only answer to this is that for the time being it is the most fullydocumented and consistently estimated savings indicator available.  Andit is the only savings indicator so far to form any possible basis forcomparisons not only between different countries, but between oneperiod of time and another.1  Cadogan Management Limited, Discussion Paper No.3, London, 1990.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993ITALY:  SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION REGIME APPROVED - FINALMENTEAfter something like 18 years of argument, and in the face of a barrageof heavy criticism , the Italian government finally approved alegislative decree on supplementary pension funds.Finally approved - but such is the nature of the legislative process inItaly, that the government can still amend the decree by the end ofthis year, with the result that the debate continues with undiminishedvigour.Two more decrees on the funds' establishment procedures, contracts withtheir managing bodies, and investment criteria will be issued over thenext six months, and the intention is that the schemes will becomeoperative in 1994.The new pension funds - fondi pensione complementari or integrativi -are `supplementary' in the sense that membership of them is open topersons already contributing to state schemes.This will take some of the burden off the state pension system in acountry with an ageing population and a notoriously large and stillrising public sector deficit.As it is, state pensions are now less generous than they were in thepast.Most workers and managers earning more than L50 mn (Ecu 28,000) a yearare already covered by voluntary plans, so that the main market for thenew funds will be  employees and self-employed individuals with incomesbelow the L50 mn level.As about 80 per cent of the working population fall into this category,the market is potentially a large one.But it's an entirely open question how many will decide to participatein the new pension funds instead of putting their savings into high-interest Treasury bills (buoni del Tesoro - BOT) or private insurance.The new pension funds will be legal entities, established throughcompany contracts or workers' agreements promoted by trade unions thatare signatories to national labour contracts.Employees, whether in the public or private sector, grouped bycategory, company or public body, may institute defined contributionplans with a guaranteed rate of financial return.  These funds may beconstituted within the assets of an individual company.Self-employed workers and tradesmen and free-lance professionals,grouped by trade or profession or territorial sector, or by their tradeassociations, may constitute defined benefit plans.The benefits, the size of which will be determined by the statutory andcontractual choices made at the act of constitution of each pensionfund, will be paid in the form of income (rendita), though members mayreceive a lump sum (capitale) equivalent to 50 per cent of the currentvalue of the amount accrued.Length of service benefits will be paidMembers who have contributed to the new funds for at least five yearswill be eligible for old age pension benefits when they reach thepensionable age laid down in the compulsory system.Length-of-service benefits will be paid to individuals who have beenmembers of the funds for at least 15 years, and who are not more thanten years younger than the age envisaged in the compulsory system(which will be raised gradually from 60 to 65 years for men, and from55 to 60 for women).Fund members for whom severance pay (trattamento di fine rapporto -TFR) has been accrued for at least eight years may be granted advancepayments for medical treatment or for the purchase of a house as first-time buyers.For tax purposes, employers may deduct contributions up to 50 per centof the quota taken from the TFR.Members' contributions will benefit from a 27 per cent tax deduction onamounts up to a maximum of L3 mn.This applies to all contributors, whether they are employees (for whomcontributions are also made by their employers and from the TFR) orself-employed (for whom such contributions are not paid).The L3 mn limit also includes other deductions that may be made for thepayment of life policy and health premiums.The contributions made out of the annual allocation to the TFR are nottaxable, but when the TFR is liquidated, these quotas are taken intoaccount in determining the amount of tax to be paid.All payments into the fund will be subject to a withholding tax of 15per cent per annum, but members are allowed a tax deduction of 17.6 percent on the income or capital they eventually receive.Company payments are subject to a 10 per cent `solidarity contribution'to the national institute for social security (Istituto nazionale diprevidenza sociale - INPS).The supplementary pension funds are not allowed to undertake insurancecommitments directly.Their assets may be managed under agreements concluded with threedistinct types of entity.The first is the so-called SIM - societe di intermediazione mobiliare,a type of company instituted in December 1990 which as well as carryingout brokerage, dealing, market making and underwriting operations mayalso manage assets.Banks rank with SIM for this purpose, as well as other ECintermediaries that perform the same activity and that have obtainedmutual recognition.The second category of pension fund asset managers comprises  insurancecompanies authorised to handle life assurance and capital redemptionpolicies.  Indeed, plans with defined benefits and guaranteed rates offinancial return are allowed to manage their resources only throughcontracts with these insurance companies.Financing by workers and employersFinally, fund assets may be managed by entities already managingcompulsory pension schemes (principally the INPS).With the permission of the anti-trust authority, the INPS may concludeagreements with the supplementary pension funds for the collection ofcontributions and the disbursement of benefits.`Open' (as distinct from defined group) pension funds may be institutedby the intermediaries authorised to manage ordinary pension funds(brokers, banks, insurance companies, social insurance institutions) aswell as by the companies that manage investment funds (fondi comunid'investimento).Membership of open pension funds is available only to workers coveredby the compulsory pension system and employed by companies that havenot established complementary pension schemes, and to workers who havelost the requirements for participating in the group schemes to whichthey would normally belong.Financing the complementary pension funds is the responsibility of theworkers and the employers.No one may contribute more than 10 per cent either, in the case ofemployees, of the annual wage taken as the basis for determiningseverance pay, or, in the case of the self-employed, of annual income.The government is expected to make some changes to the decree,particularly concerning its tax provisions, perhaps changing the 15 percent withholding tax and introducing instead a 15 per cent obligatoryinvestment in convertible bonds to encourage privatisation.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  RECLASSIFICATION OF SICAVS AND FCPSThe French stock market supervisory body, the Commission des operationsde Bourse  (COB), has revealed details of its plans to change theclassification of all managed funds operating in France.All Sicavs and fonds communs de placement (FCPs) sold in France will beaffected by the new classification, due to take effect from January 1,1994.The new system involves five descriptive categories and three sub-categories, and replaces an out-of-date 13-category classificationintroduced in 1985 before derivative products became an important partof funds, and before Sicav monetaires took off.The new categories are designed to inform savers more clearly whether afund is invested in equities, bonds, or monetary instruments, whetherit has a guarantee, or whether it involves potential currency exposure.For investors this is expected to give a better appreciation of riskthan the old system which, while giving an idea of equities, bonds andshort-term investments, divided these into several sub-sections withminor differences.The COB says that the new system will also help multi-service groupssuch as banks and financial intermediaries determine theirresponsibilities in relation to investors and their depository bodies.France is the only European country to have an obligatory fundclassification system that has such an impact on the day-to-dayoperation of funds.The new classification requires an equity fund to remain at least 60per cent invested in equities at all times.  A monetary instrument fundis restricted to a maximum of 10 per cent investment in equities.Funds holding convertibles must declare whether their convertiblesbehave more like an equity or more like a bond.Fund managers now have four months to decide which categories theirfunds fall into, and to make any necessary adjustments to managementaims and techniques.The COB will then give its approval to the self-declared allegiance, orsuggest a recategorisation.Any fund managers who disagree with COB recommendations can move to thediversified section, which covers all funds not eligible for `pure'categories.Although the new system of classification was not prompted by the ucitsdirective, it is expected that French funds will remain compatible withit.Foreign funds sold in France are unlikely to have to change theirmanagement practices, as they fall straightforwardly into the foreignequities, foreign bonds, or foreign monetary categories in the case ofsingle-instrument products or, for mixed funds, into the catch-alldiversified products category, which will also include all funds underdiscretionary management, as well as funds invested in convertiblestocks.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993SPAIN:  FIRST PROPERTY FUNDS LIKELY BY AUTUMNProperty investment funds - fondos de inversion inmobiliaria - are thelatest arrival on the investment scene in Spain, under a royal decreeissued last month.The concept of such funds has existed in Spanish law since 1964 but itwas not until July last year that a new law specifically laid out theframework for an instrument that is well established in many other ECmember states.And only in May this year, with the issuing of royal decree 686/1993,was the earlier framework fleshed out with the detail needed for thecreation of the first property funds, which may be launched as early asthe autumn.One of the benefits that Spanish officials hope to reap from this newsavings instrument is a stimulus to the housing market, at present deepin the doldrums.Property investment funds tend to flourish in a relatively deep andwell-developed property market, where they may boost its developmentand enhance its stability.Opening the way for small savers to enter the housing market via fondosinmobiliarios will mean `new financing for the property market',according to a top executive of the Groupe Pelloux.Spanish officials also hope that the new funds will fill a specific andimportant market gap: that of rental housing, which is scarce in Spain.The July 1992 law clearly referred to the role it is hoped the fundswill play by calling them in the preamble `a component of thegovernment's housing policy.'  But some experts say this narrow focusis a weak point of the 1992 law.A needed long-term investment vehicleAnother great benefit of property investment funds in Spain is thatthey will provide a new and much-needed long-term investment instrumentin Spain.According to the same Groupe Pelloux spokesman, the funds will fill agap in Spanish capital markets, which at present have only 10-yearTreasury bonds as long-term instruments, whose volume is still quitesmall.The 1992 law specifies that property investments may not exceed between70 and 80 per cent of the fund's assets.  The remainder can be investedin tradable securities, either equities or bonds.A new fund must have assets of at least Ptas1.5 bn (Ecu10 mn).It must have at least 100 participants, and no individual investor mayhold more than a 25 per cent share in the fund.Property assets will be valued at least once a year by assessorsregistered with the bank of Spain.Another feature of the law is that it aims to encourage medium-and long-term investment by tying tax benefits to a minimum four-year period ofownership of property by the fund.Still to be defined by the Ministry of the Economy are the rules to beapplied to the diversification of funds' real estate holdings, to avoidthe risks inherent in undue concentration in a single property.The Ministry must also decide what types of property will be open toinvestment by the funds - whether, for example, building lots can alsobe included.Limits will also have to be set on the amount of outstanding loans thata fund may contract.But although these details have still to be clarified, an official ofthe Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), the stock marketregulatory body that will supervise the funds, claims that there isalready more than one candidate waiting to be the first on the market.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  SHARE OWNERSHIP SET TO REVIVEThe first quarter of the year showed Sicav managers increasing theirexposure to equities.With only part of the increase attributable to the strength of thestock market, the value of shares in their portfolios rose by FF90 bn(Ecu13.7 bn).French fund managers increased the proportion of the CAC-100 indexaccounted for by Sicavs from 5.88 per cent to 6.36 per cent, accordingto the Dealers' Book.That is a tiny fraction compared with their counterparts across thechannel, but an increase in the funds' exposure to equities is anecessary condition for the success of the privatisation programme.But there may still be a lot of resistance to overcome.Spectacular fall in equity fund ownersAccording to a study conducted by Sofres, the polling agency, on behalfof the Bank of France, the number of private individuals holding shareshas dropped by some 900,000 to 4.5 mn since April 1991, the last timethe survey was conducted.The number of people owning equity funds dropped even morespectacularly, from 7.5 mn to 3.2 mn, but the numbers owning moneymarket funds rose from 4 mn to 5.6 mn over the same  period.Of the approximately FF1,000 bn (Ecu150 bn) held in Sicav monetaires,some FF700 bn (Ecu135 bn) is invested by private individuals, and therest by companies that use the funds as short-term means of cashmanagement.The Bank of France and the Societe des Bourses francaises  (SBF - theexecutive authority governing the day-to-day operations of the stockmarket) remain optimistic, however, that share holding will rise again,as historically privatisation programmes have been major periods ofincrease, when young persons particularly are tempted to invest inequities.The managing director of the Commission des operations de Bourse (COB),M. Pierre Fleuriot, predicts that employee share schemes and the tax-favourable equity savings scheme introduced in September 1992 (the pland'epargne en actions - PEA) will also have the effect of lifting shareownership.The importance of small investors is shown by the fact that over halfthe people in France owning equities have a portfolio worth less thanFF50,000 (Ecu7,600).Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993GERMANY:  GERMAN EQUITIES BRING GREATER REWARDS...Mr Ralf Conen, head of quantitative capital markets analysis atDeutsche Bank, has recently completed a study of stock market yields inGermany covering three historical periods  1876-1913; 1924-1941; and1949-1992.In each of these periods the average annual yield from equities wasconsiderably higher than the yield from fixed-interest securities, themost striking yield gap appearing in the period since 1949.Since 1949, according to Mr Conen, equities have shown an average realpost-tax return of 12.08 per cent a year, while bonds have shown anegative yield of 0.09 per cent.In another computation, the Deutsche Bank study claims that a Germaninvestor  who started in 1949 to put DM10,000 every year into equitieswould have been a millionaire in constant 1949 terms by 1977.But his next door neighbour who put the same amount into bonds eachyear would not be a genuine 1949-vintage millionaire until the year2059.Mr Conen is evidently making some pretty bold assumptions about thecourse of German taxes and consumer prices over the next 66 years, buthis general conclusion that the long-term German investor is paid apretty hefty risk premium for investing in equities seems unassailable. One of the more detailed findings of the study  is that, the longerthe time-span under consideration, the greater the probability that aninvestment in equities is more rewarding than one in bonds.If single years only are considered, equities were more profitable in56 out of the 97 years covered by the research.If periods of five years are taken as the basis of comparison, however,in 62 out of 85 possible runs, equities were more profitable; and inten-year periods, 54 out of 70.In percentage terms, this means that equities were more profitable in58 per cent of one-year periods, in 73 per cent of five-year periods,and in 77 per cent of ten-year periods.When periods of 20 years or more are taken as the basis of comparison,equities are found to have scored from 83 per cent up to 100 per centof the time.In spite of the higher performance of equities, however, the Germanpublic still show a marked preference for  bonds, at least when itcomes to putting money  into investment funds.Last year, for example, bond funds (both German and foreign) attracteda total of DM53.4 bn (Ecu27.3 bn) new money, equivalent to no less than86.5 per cent of the total inflow into German funds.As it happens, over the last year German bond funds have performed onaverage better than German equity funds, benefiting both from highyields on the bonds in their portfolios and from bond price risesresulting from the lowering of interest rates.But over the last ten years, for example, German equity funds haveoutperformed German bond funds by a considerable margin.According to the Bundesverband Deutscher Investment-Gesellschaften BVI(the German Investment Fund Association), German equity funds showed anaverage rise in unit value of 163.6 per cent in the ten years to theend of March, 1993, with the top-performing fund, SMH-Special-Fonds 1,registering an advance of 254.9 per cent.Compared with this, the best performance shown by German bond funds wasa 113.9 per cent gain by Universal's BERENBERG-UNIV.-RENTENFONDS (thefund which also turned in the best performance over 20 years).The average of the 28 funds in this sector to have a ten-year or longertrack record was a 98.2 per cent increase in unit value - a mere 60 percent of the equity fund average.This persistent preference for bond funds can only be based on short-term considerations.In any given year since 1949, bonds showed a minimum yield of 2.6 percent, whereas while the highest average yield of equities reached 47.2per cent in one year, there was a year in which investors saw anaverage loss of 14 per cent.But if the risk of losing money persuades German investors to forego thechance of enjoying more substantial returns, it also apparently focusestheir attention mistakenly on current values to the neglect of theerosive action of inflation , which in West Germany, though less thanhalf the EC average, has averaged nearly 4 per cent a year in the last20 years.`If you want to eat well, buy shares,' runs a German saying.  "If youwant to sleep well, buy bonds.'There may be something in that, but if consumer prices are rising whileyou sleep, your dream of a bond-invested nest egg could well turn intoa nightmare.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993UNITED KINGDOM:  PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE USED AS 'SOFT SELL'Although private medical insurance (PMI) is not in itself a savingsproduct, its development in the United Kingdom is linked to trends inthe broader savings market.It appears that life companies - especially those that operate throughtheir own direct sales forces - are getting into the PMI market as asoft way of prospecting clients for more lucrative business, such asprivate pensions.The tied sales agent must have a full range of products to offer inorder to prevent the client from going elsewhere for one particulartype of product, and then perhaps being seduced by a new company intobuying savings products as well.A newly-launched product is easier to sell, and health insurance hasproved attractive to an industry ever hungry for new products.Branching out into PMI offers the agent a pretext  to visit customersto see if this area of their financial planning is covered, when theroutine annual updating visit may have lost its sales pull.In recent years, tied agent companies such as Allied Dunbar and LloydsAbbey Life have entered the market, as well as major composites likeNorwich Union, Sun Alliance (through its purchase of Mutual of Omaha),and the guaranteed bond specialist General Portfolio.Allied Dunbar added PMI to a range which already comprised criticalillness cover (first offered in 1989) and permanent health insurance(1985).  Allied Dunbar make their own underwriting arrangements onthese two contracts through their life funds.  Their PMI contract isunderwritten by Lloyds syndicates.Allied Dunbar claim that one in five of all critical illness plans inforce in the United Kingdom is theirs, though in the PMI market theyare not yet a significant force, with only 20,000 contracts inexistence.Norwich Union made a major entry into the PMI market in 1990, settingup a new division which at the end of March 1993 claimed 375,000clients, an estimated one-third share of all new and switched businessin 1992, and a 6 per cent share of the total market.The managing director of Norwich Union Health Care, Mr David Cavers,says that PMI was seen to be a market capable of rapid growth,dominated by a couple of provident institutions (British UnionProvident Association - BUPA - of London and Private Patient Plan - PPP-  of Tunbridge Wells), only one of which has put a lot of money intomarketing.Norwich Union Health Care expects premium income of close to #100 mnthis year.The only link between Norwich Union's PMI product and other savingsplans is the distribution chain - both are sold largely throughintermediaries.Mr Cavers sees PMI as an under developed product for the intermediary.Brokers had not been selling it actively until the last four or fiveyears, when specialist advisers began to appear.`Intermediaries have now woken up to the fact that they can sellmedical plans to savings customers,' says Mr Cavers.The effect of such competition has been to make heavy inroads into themarket share of the leading companies, BUPA and PPP, with BUPA downfrom 80 per cent of the market to less than 50 per cent over the lastfive years.Continental firms enter the UK marketThe most recent development in the PMI market has been the link-upbetween the French healthcare mutual Strasbourgeoise and Clinicare, theUK specialist health insurer.Strasbourgeoise entered the British market in 1990 with a plan offeringa number of features not available in standard UK plans, but probablybecause of its high cost the plan did not attract a large market share.A standard view of the PMI market is that in the current economic andpolitical climate, it is bound to grow.But in practice, the market has disappointed expectations in recentyears.About seven million persons in the United Kingdom currently have healthinsurance.  The industry hopes to see 18 million insured by the end ofthe century.But rising claim rates and rising medical costs have hit insurers hard,and premiums have had to be increased by more than 10 per cent a yearfor several years.In 1992, so far from growing, the market is estimated to havecontracted by between 6 and 10 per cent.In spite of this, more companies are entering the market.  The DutchPMI company OHRA entered the United Kingdom market in March.A new joint venture between Cornhill Insurance and DeutscheKrankenversicherung AG is in the process of development, and its launchis expected in the next few monthswith a full range of products specialising in the hospital sector.No more major UK insurers are expected to launch PMI products, thoughit is thought that both Royal Life and the Prudential have been lookingat the market.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993UNITED KINGDOM:  SCOTTISH EQUITABLE GOES DUTCHPolicyholders of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life assurancecompany, will vote at the end of this month on a deal whereby the Dutchinsurer Aegon will buy a 40 per cent share of Scottish Equitable's unit-linked business.With-profits policyholders with Scottish Equitable will continue to own100 per cent of their fund.Scottish Equitable's rise has been meteoric in the independentfinancial adviser pensions market.In 1981, premium income was #105 mn.  By 1992 it had grown to #1,004mn.Recent comment suggests that Scottish Equitable has been a victim ofits own success: further expansion will be difficult without aninjection of capital, which is made more difficult by the company'smutual structure.Aegon - one of the top ten insurance groups in Europe, with 1992revenues equivalent to more than Ecu7.5 bn (nearly two-thirds of itrelated to life assurance) - will pay #200 mn into the Scottishcompany's with-profits fund, and a further #40 mn to capitalise the newholding company, which will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profitsfund and 40 per cent by Aegon.This arrangement has been arrived at because it is estimated that fulldemutualisation would have cost Aegon as much as #700 mn.Scottish Equitable and Aegon are waiting for confirmation from the ECCommission that the proposed deal is not anti-competitive, as well asfor the approval of policyholders.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993UNITED KINGDOM:  SECOND-HAND DEALERS FLOURISHPolicy Portfolio, the North London-based market maker in second-handwith-profits endowment policies, announced last week its intention toseek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.The move will make it the only second-hand policy market maker to belisted in its own right.Recession in the United Kingdom has seen a surge in the fortunes ofdealers in second-hand policies.According to the managing director of Policy Portfolio, Mr Isaac Rubin,more than 50 per cent of with-profits policies taken out in the UnitedKingdom are surrendered before they reach maturity.Owing to clawback of commission and other effects of policy charges,surrender values can be poor, even after the policy has been in forcefor several years.Policyholders can get a better return by selling the policy on toanother investor, who then collects the final policy value on maturityor the death of the original owner.Policies `overvalued'Several market makers are now in business in Great Britain.  Oneinvestment trust has been set up by Kleinwort to hold second-handpolicies, and two further investment trusts are planned, one fromBarclays de Zoete Wedd market maker Beale Dobie, and the other frommarket maker Gerald Edelman.Insurance companies offering the original policies fear that they maybe overvalued and that the market is not big enough to support all theplayers at present in it.The Kleinwort fund, launched in July 1992, raised #30 mn, of which lessthan half has so far been invested, because of a shortage of suitablepolicies.The Financial Intermediaries', Managers' and Brokers' Association(FIMBRA), one of the United Kingdom's self-regulating organisations,recently introduced a ruling to make market makers modify their claimsfor the projected values of the policies being sold.The leading with-profits company Standard Life has also causedcontroversy recently by writing to holders of second-hand policies tosay that only the normal policy benefits will accrue to such policies.The company has been quoted as saying that prices `have been bid upbeyond reasonable levels'.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  BIG GROUPS TO BE PRIVATISEDWhereas some 50 conservative deputies either abstained or voted againstthe law to give the Bank of France greater independence, the unveilingof the list of state enterprises that are candidates for privatisationcaused far less contention among the government's supporters.Most commercial and industrial companies are considered privatisable,and it appears that the government has no intention of holding on toeither the three state-controlled insurance giants (AGF, GAN and UAPwhich between them account for about 28 per cent of new life assurancebusiness in France) or banks like Banque Nationale de Paris - BNP andCredit Lyonnais, which do not look particularly attractive buys at themoment owing to their exposure to small companies, entertainment andproperty.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR POSTE AVENIRLa Poste, the French post office, is giving a huge publicity spin(television ads in prime time and inserts in every TV listingsmagazine) to its already established Poste Avenir savings and lifeassurance contract.Managed by the state-controlled Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP),France's leading life assurer, Poste Avenir is guaranteeing 8 per centnet of management fees for sums (minimum FF3,000) invested before June30.As this is a life-related product, it also gives rise to useful taxbreaks - reductions of FF1,000 per adult and FF250 per dependent childin the family.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993INSURERS LOSE OUT TO BANKSThe longer institutions are involved in bancassurance, the wider thescope of products and services they aim for, with banks getting themost benefit from integration.This is one of the key findings of a paneuropean survey, Makingbancassurance work, published  by Coopers&Lybrand and based oninterviews with senior management of 54 leading players inbancassurance in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and theUnited Kingdom.As an example of what they mean by `integration` the authors of thesurvey cite a move from a marketing agreement between a bank and aninsurance company to an exclusive arrangement involving joint training,product and sales development.Similarly, a merging of a bank's insurance subsidiary's marketing orinvestment management department into one group-led department alsorepresents more integration.According to Mr Angus Hislop, a consultant with C&L's financialservices group, banks have gained much more from bancassurance thaninsurers. With life products in particular, they have succeeded inreaching many more of their own customers.UK institutions the exceptionWhile over two-thirds of all the institutions interviewed for the C&Lsurvey stated that a major integration had either already been appliedor was planned for at least one of five business functions (salesforce/distribution channels; marketing; service departments;administration; and senior management), seven out of the 11 UKinstitutions were not planning any integration at all.In other words, the UK institutions show the inverse of the trend amongthe continental institutions surveyed.This, suggest C&L, may be due to a traditionally more short-termorientation; greater opportunities for early reduction of the unusuallyhigh distribution costs without integration; and a more scepticalattitude towards the achievement of economies of scale in distributionand operational functions.In contrast to the continental institutions, half of the UKinstitutions do not plan to realise scale effects in sales anddistribution.But 30 out of the 43 continental institutions plan to integrate theirdistribution channels and sales forces, and 32 of them plan tointegrate marketing functions.The reasons for developing bancassurance cited most often by thesurvey's respondents were factors such as recognising changes inclients' needs, such as, for example, the demand for more personalwealth management; building closer ties with clients; and serving themat all stages of their lives.This last factor was singled out by all the institutions planning orapplying major integration of business functions as a driving impulsebehind bancassurance.Defensive and offensive strategyDefending their customer base is another major driving factor,especially for institutions integrating their market approaches andstructure.The survey cites the example of a large French institution whoseprimary goal is to sell life assurance.  If the client does not want tobuy at a particular moment, savings products are used to maintain therelationship with the customer.A few years later this client will be approached again for lifeassurance, and bancassurance is therefore implemented to protect thecore insurance business.  (We might add, however, that the distinctionbetween life and savings products is not so clear in France as in otherEC countries).A similar approach has been used by French banks that have successfullyoffered money funds to their clients to discourage them fromtransferring to other institutions.In Italy, more than one institution indicated that life assurance, witha link to a current account, is an effective way to tie the client infor the medium term.Seen in this light, bancassurance is as much a defensive strategy toward off threats to an institution's client base as an offensive one toexploit opportunities made possible by integration of businessfunctions.Further information on the survey is obtainable from: Angus Hislop,Coopers&Lybrand.

These loans now amount to closeto DM3 bn, equivalent to 1 per cent of the banks' domestic mortgageloans.Most of the credit granted abroad has been to German clients, and theUnited Kingdom, France and Netherlands are the main countriesconcerned.The mortgage banks have loans to foreign local authorities to a totalof DM7.5 bn on their balance sheets, equivalent to 2.4 per cent oftotal local authority loans.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993GERMANY:  LIFE INDUSTRY PYRAMID SALESMEN UNDER ATTACKNew life assurance contracts to the tune of DM 400 billion were writtenin Germany in 1992, and pyramid sales companies probably accounted formore than one-fifth of that colossal total.The Strukturvertriebe, to give them a name which they do not alwaysacknowledge, have been the German life industry's success story of thelast decade.They first appeared on the scene in the aftermath of the IOS debacle,and after a comparatively slow start could still claim only about 8 percent of total new life business by 1985.But their share of the market more than doubled in the next five years,and although its rate of growth has slowed down, it is still expanding,and by the end of the decade on present form could well be nudging 25per cent of the total.A hierarchy of eight levelsNot only have the Struckis - as the pyramid salesmen are colloquiallyknown in Germany -  been capturing a rapidly increasing share of themarket, but the total market is itself growing apace.To take one indicator, since 1980 life assurance gross premium incomehas increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 9 per cent,and in 1992 amounted to a massive DM69.4 billion.More recently, however, the rate of growth has been accelerating, andin the last three years it has averaged more than 12 per cent.In part this acceleration is due to the accession in October 1990 ofthe former East German Lander, where a population of 16 million couldnot boast a single life assurance policy between them beforereunification.Significantly enough, the Struckis have been particularly active inthese Lander, where it is claimed they may have as much as 30 per centof the market.A Strukturvertrieb consists of a number  of teams reporting upwardsthrough a hierarchy of as many as seven or eight levels.Senior managers (typically known as regional directors) owe theirposition entirely to the constant generation of sales income by thosebelow them in the structure.Recruits are usually drawn from outside the financial services sectorbut, prompted by their companies, they tend to call themselvesFinanzberater or Vermogensberater (literally, wealth or assetsadvisers).And if these self-styled advisers often prefer not to be known asinsurance salesmen, the companies, too, would rather be known to thepublic as Allfinanzvertriebe, and like to get the word Beratung(`consultation') into their registered name.Officially, indeed, such a company is likely to be registered as anindependent sales force (eigenstandige Aussendienst), while beingwholly or partly owned by an insurance company.But a Strukturvertrieb's independence may be genuine to the extent thatit does not sell exclusively own-house products, but a fairly widerange of insurance and investment products from a number of suppliers.In the former East Germany, one product that has been particularlypopular is a short-term savings contract taking advantage of a Stateincentive and designed to release capital for house purchase orrenovation.Companies selling their products through Struckis have to pay highercommissions than they offer to brokers or to their own tied agents(considerably higher in the latter case).An excessively high lapse rate for policies sold by Struckis - reportedto be as high for some as 18 per cent, or four times the rateexperienced on average by other sales methods - adds significantly tothe acquisition costs of pyramid sales.Salesmen thoroughly trainedA necessary feature of the system is that commissions received by theStruckis are never passed on intact to the salesmen..As much as one-third may be deducted immediately for company overheads,and the balance then percolates through the structure in everdecreasing percentages, so that a junior salesman usually receivesbetween 1 and 1.5 per cent.An established insurance company agent, by comparison, receives acommission of 3.5 per cent.The Strukturvertriebe give new salesmen a thorough training not only inselling financial products, but in recruiting new potential salesmen.One of the leading Strukturvertriebe, Bonn Finanz Vermogensberatung AG(100 per cent owned by the insurance company Deutscher Herold, recentlybought by Deutsche Bank), mounts a 12-week training course.This consists of three five-day residential seminars backed by workexperience, for which the aspiring salesman has to pay DM2,500.In general, however, the demands of a system that requires the newrecruit to force through as many sales as he can in the shortestpossible time and to persuade other people to work for him lead to anexceptionally high dropout rate.In fact, it is claimed by critics of the pyramid sales  system thatonly about one recruit in five survives the first year of selling.But that is probably the mildest criticism levelled against theStrukturvertriebe.The main objections are raised against the Struckis' high pressureselling methods.Legally obliged to give good adviceBrokers belonging to medium and small firms, particularly (the largefirms not usually being concerned with mass personal lines insurance)feel themselves at a disadvantage, because unlike the Struckis they arelegally obliged to give their clients good advice (not yet `bestadvice'!) about the growth prospects of investments and protectionagainst risks.The Struckis benefit from the fact that in Germany the emphasis in thesupervision of insurance is on products, the design and pricing ofwhich have to conform to strict guidelines.Distribution of products, on the other hand, is comparativelyunregulated.  There is, for instance, no provision under law for thelicensing or testing of insurance intermediaries, whether they work ascompany tied agents or in the independent sector.One man who has mounted a vigorous campaign to have tougher rulesapplied to independent financial intermediaries is Hans-Wolff Graf, thechairman and chief executive of the Munich-based financial servicescompany efv-AG (Erste Finanz- und Vermogensberater Aktiengesellschaftin Deutschland).Mr Graf began his own career with IOS and then continued with two ofthe largest Allfinanzvertriebe before setting up his own company, andhe brings the missionary zeal of a religious convert to his  campaign.`To sell a pork cutlet in Germany,' he says, `you have to study forthree years and then work constantly under the vigilant eye of the law.`Nothing like this is required from anyone selling financial contracts,including life assurance policies.'Mr Graf has submitted a draft law governing independent financialintermediaries to the authorities and has set up a registeredassociation to pursue his cause.Embarrassed by sales techniquesOne of his more startling claims is that unqualified salesmen, or`pseudo-consultants' as he calls them will have received more than DM10 billion in commission last year from new contracts that will sooneror later be cancelled prematurely.So far Mr Graf has received little encouragement from Bonn, but theBerlin-based supervisory authority, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur dasVersicherungswesen, is said to be embarrassed by the Struckis'aggressive sales techniques and the flamboyant public image of some ofthe leading figures in the sector.But while these misgivings may be shared by the life assurance industryin general, many insurance companies have lost members of their tiedagent force to the independent sector, and in the process have becomeheavily dependent on Struckis for their new businessSome companies have bought majority or even total share holdings in aStrukturvertrieb, and although stricter requirements may one day beimposed on the training and professional standards of the pyramidsalesmen, a system bringing as much as DM 15 billion a year in premiumincome is bound to have some keen champions even among the older Germanlife assurance companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993PYRAMID POWER ON THE WANE?While the authorities may be slow to tighten their supervision of thepyramid salesmen, the Strukturvertriebe may become the victims of theirown excesses.According to a recent article in manager magazin (published in Hamburg), Germany's second largest Allfinanz- or Strukturvertrieb is faced witha number of problems.Objektive Vermogensberatung GmbH (OVB) was founded in 1970 by OttoWittschier, one of the most senior former IOS salesmen still active inGermany.  The company's principal shareholder is Deutscher Ring, butOVB sells a variety of insurance and savings products on behalf of asmany as 18 companies, including Equity & Law, American Express, andDeutsche Bank's DWS investment fund company.Data for such items as sales forces are always given in suspiciouslyround figures for Strukturvertriebe, but a figure of 15,000 salesmen(nearly one-third of them recruited in the former DDR) is frequentlyquoted for OVB.  But many of these salesmen are reported to becurrently doing little or no business.Selling mainly life assurance, investment funds, and house purchasecontracts, OVB's salespersons raised the company's turnover from DM4.4bn in 1989 to DM12.7 bn in 1990, and then to DM15.4 bn in 1991.  But in1992, turnover plummeted by an ominous 19 per cent to DM12.5 bn.One reason for the fall in new business appears to be a drying up ofthe east German market, where OVB had scored some of its most strikingsuccesses.  But there are also difficulties between Mr Wittschier andhis two co-founders and the parent company.Under a contentious agreement between the two, Deutscher Ring has tobuy the founders out if they so demand, but Deutscher Ring is reportedto be unwilling to do this.Further problems are being created by the departure of key personnel atthe top of the company's hierarchy.  One former OVB salesman, MrCarsten Maschmeyer, left while still in his 20s in to found his owncompany, Allgemeiner Wirtschaftsdienst, in 1988, and the possibility ofnew rivals (one's own former star salesmen, as likely as not) appearingin such an unregulated field must always threaten the establishedcompanies.One casualty of OVB's present plight is its ambitious plan to extendoperations to other European countries.  After, according to managermagazin, spending half a million marks on studies and analysis, it hasput its intended Italian operation on the back burner.  In Austria,where OVB established itself in 1991, the level of business has beendecidedly modest, and in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, onlythe legal formalities have been completed.  OVB was also reported tohave had plans to start up in the United Kingdom, but if there everreally were such plans, they seem to have been dropped.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORSApart from demographic changes, the single factor to have most impacton future savings trends in Germany will be the growth of personalincomes.

According to estimates made by banks, this generation ofGermans will have aggregate assets of DM 2,500 bn, and their attitudestowards investments will be vastly different from that of previousgenerations who experienced hyper-inflation coupled with economic andpolitical turmoil.

Politicalconsiderations have already hit an ambitious plan to sell minoritystakes in the country's 16 gas and electricity distribution companies(eight of each), which has been postponed indefinitely. In the weekbefore Christmas Roman Ceska, head of the National Property Fund, thestate holding company, said there would be no further strategicprivatizations before the election.The action, however, is likely to be elsewhere. The last quarter of1995 saw what many feel could be the start of a new trend - a series oftakeovers, some of them hostile, and large investments by foreigninvestors. Among the most notable are Bankers Trust's $250 millionpurchase of stakes in two investment funds from Ceska Sporitelna (seepage 4), and the acquisition of stakes in seven leading industrialcompanies by Stratton Investments in partnership with Viktor Kozeny'sHarvard fund management group.Michael Dingman, the Bahamas-based US millionaire who owns Stratton,has made much of the ground-breaking aspect of his investment company,with some justification. Stratton's alliance with Harvard allows apowerful and rich entrepreneur to team up with an equally powerfulentrepreneur with a good reputation for innovation but with littlefinancial firepower.Stratton's strategy appears so far to be paying off. Daniel Arbess, asenior Dingman associate, acknowledges that its original investment isgreater than the $140 million initially mentioned, and is "closer to$200 million". But he says the stakes, before recent increases in twoof them, are now worth $240 million. Stratton and Harvard have alsogained control of Sepap, the paper group, and the glass holding companySklo Union, through boardroom reshuffles.Bankers Trust's acquisition is the biggest deal yet on the Praguecapital markets. Although the opportunity was relatively rare - CeskaSporitelna was under pressure from the Czech National Bank and itsauditors to reduce the stakes it owns in the funds it runs - fundmanagers are increasingly taking the view that this type of developmentis both inevitable and desirable.As an investor, Dingman says he sees less risk in the Czech market thanin a Dow Jones index above 5,000. Whether other investors feel that waywill depend on several issues that should be clarified in 1996.The first is whether an amendment to the securities law is approved.Tomas Jezek, author of the amendment and a proposed chairman of the PSEfrom next summer, is proposing substantial reform of the market thatshould offer greater protection to small investors, establish clearrules for takeovers, and make the stock market more transparent.But Jezek's proposal is ground down in parliament, which is not likelyto debate it until February, at the earliest. It is facing oppositionfrom fund managers anxious to preserve the secrecy that currentlysurrounds share-dealing. Stratton and Harvard were able to exploit thissecrecy and lack of disclosure to the hilt in developing their allianceand short term strategy for the companies they targeted. Jezek says heis confident of having his amendment approved but does not yet knowwhen that is likely to happen.The second crucial influence will be the attitude of the bank-run andindependent investment funds to the new wave of foreign money cominginto the market. Ales Barabas, director of capital markets atZivnostenska Banka, says fund managers have no objection in principleto ceding control of their funds to new managers. But he doubts whetherthe market is mature enough to ensure that the process is orderly.He cites the example of Motoinvest, a financial conglomerate thatemerged in November when it made hostile takeovers for some bank-runfunds. Motoinvest's campaign was characterized by secrecy and elementsof greenmail, and its intentions are still not entirely clear.Executives at the financial group strongly deny greenmail charges andpoint out that the promise of more active management they offer hassimply caused larger fund managers to freeze them out.Barabas says recent developments suggest that, far from being ready forthe next phase of development as a more mature market, recentdevelopments show the PSE still in "a privatization phase", where banksare still keen to exert control of assets. There is the potential forthe so-called "third wave" of privatization, he believes, but not thewill among the main shareholders in the market.Further pressure on the shareholding structure inherited from massprivatization is likely to be exerted by a third factor that will comeinto play in 1996 - Czech membership of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development. Analysts suggest that one of the firstresults of membership will be a re-rating of the country as aninvestment location, which could spark a fresh wave of capital forlonger term investment. Both Stratton and Bankers Trust are beingtouted as examples of this development.This in turn leads to a fourth consideration - of what action the CzechNational Bank takes on the koruna's exchange rate against the dollarand deutschemark. Economists say they expect a move early in the NewYear to widen the band against which the koruna fluctuates - currentlyhalf a percentage point either side of parity - to perhaps five pointseither side. This could lead to an early but temporary revaluation, tobe followed by a more gradual move towards devaluation, perhapsencouraged by the monetary authorities ahead of the election to boostexports.The Czech market is clearly at a turning point, with pressure buildingon several fronts for more consolidation, a freer currency, and greatertransparency in its operations. Policy makers will have to play adelicate balancing act between the demands of the market on the onehand and political considerations on the other in what will be a truetest of the country's maturity as a grown-up member of the club of richnations.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ANALYSTS BULLISH ON 1996 PROSPECTSCentral Europe watchers think the Czech economy is poised to surgeahead this year, building on the dynamic growth of 1995.Industry has boomed, pushing third quarter 1995 GDP 6.3 per cent higheryear-on-year, mostly on the back of strong home demand. Analysts areconfident of further gains in 1996. "We should see growth of 4.7 percent in the light of the [1995] third quarter results, and [in 1996] itwill probably be between 5.0 and 6.0 per cent," says Pavel Sobisek ofZivnostenska Banka. Real GDP for the first nine months of 1995 stood at4.8 per cent, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU).Scott Riedel, treasurer of Citibank in Prague, also expects strong 1996growth but says the country is far from emulating levels seen in theAsian Tiger economies. "We're looking at around the five per cent levelof 1996 and that's probably conservative. But this economy is quiteyoung still, and it's a long way behind Far East countries likeMalaysia in terms of sustainable high growth," says Riedel.While the Czech Republic stands at the higher end of the East Europeangrowth table, it has yet to attract the sort of huge foreign investmentthat sparked rapid growth in Southeast Asia. To close the gap with therich Western economies more rapidly - something that many in Easternand Central Europe see as a primary goal - investment must accelerate,analysts say. "It is necessary, but I'm just wondering whether we'llsee sustainable increases," says Riedel. The Asian tigers continue todevour much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) earmarked foremerging markets.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus hopes the feel-good factor arising from thebooming economy will win his centre-right coalition government anotherterm in office in this summer's elections. The Czech reform process hasbeen considerably more stable than in other former Soviet bloccountries, with year-on-year inflation at eight per cent in Novemberand unemployment standing at 2.8 per cent. But official figurescompiled by the EBRD in its transition report for 1995 showed sharpfalls in real GDP in the first years of reform.The EBRD recorded a 14.2 per cent drop in real GDP in 1991 followed byfurther, but less spectacular, declines in the next two years, beforean upturn in 1994 when growth hit 2.6 per cent. Even with EBRD-projected growth of five per cent in 1995, the organization put 1995real Czech GDP at just 85 per cent of the level before the fall ofcommunism in 1989. It warned, however, that such comparisons should betreated with caution because of conceptual and data collection problemswhen comparing market and planned economies.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996STRATTON MOVES INTO MEDIAStratton Investments, owned by the Bahamas-based investor MichaelDingman, has made a further push into the Czech market with anagreement in principle to buy a 15 per cent stake in Premiera TV, acommercial television station.Stratton said on December 6 it would buy the stake from Investicni aPostovni Banka (IPB), one of the main commercial banks. If the purchaseis approved by the state broadcasting council IPB's stake in Premierawill fall to 30 per cent. The bank has been seeking a buyer for thestake for several months."The deal launches Stratton's investment in the media industry inCentral Europe and CIS countries. We look forward to working togetherwith IPB on this and hopefully other investments in the future,"Stratton said. Terms were not disclosed.It is also a departure for Dingman, who stormed into the market inOctober, buying stakes in seven industrial companies from ViktorKozeny's Harvard fund management group. Premiera is the firstacquisition from a local investor other than Harvard.Stratton said it was ready to provide Premiera access to "all world-wide programming resources" and with "foreign experts with a high levelof broadcasting knowledge." Premiera currently reaches less than halfthe nationwide audience and is seeking to expand in the teeth of fiercecompetition from Nova TV.Nova, majority-owned by Central European Media Enterprises, which is inturn controlled by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, became easternEurope's first commercial TV station in early 1993. It has captured ahuge slice of the local advertising market with a successful mix ofimported mass-market series.Earlier this year IPB was reportedly in talks with companies connectedto Turner Broadcasting and Capital Cities/ABC, the US media giants.Scandinavian Broadcasting System, which is partially owned by CapCities, has also been mooted as a buyer.Separately, Stratton bought additional stakes in two of its originalseven investments from the fund management arm of Ceska Sporitelna, thesavings bank. These transactions took its stakes in PrazskaTelparenska, the heating utility for Prague, and in glass industryholding company Sklo Union to 43 per cent and 66.5 per centrespectively. The stakes are held jointly by Stratton and Harvard.Stratton and Harvard have also taken control of the entire managementboard of Sklo Union, appointing seven representatives of Harvard at ashareholder meeting on December 5. The move is similar to the takeoverof the board of Sepap, the paper group now controlled by bothinvestment companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996EBRD SELLS COKOLADOVNY STAKEThe EBRD has sold its 12.07 per cent stake in the confectionery companyCokoladovny to Copart, a joint venture between Nestle of Switzerlandand Danone of France that already owns 56 per cent of the chocolate andbiscuit maker.Terms were not disclosed but the EBRD said in a statement on December 6that the sale and price of the shares to Copart was agreed at the timeof the privatization of Cokoladovny in 1992, when the EBRD firstacquired its stake. The stake has a market value currently of about $35million.Guy de Selliers, deputy vice president of banking at the EBRD, said inthe statement that the Cokoladovny stake represented the bank's mostmature investment in the country, and was also its first divestment.Describing Cokoladovny as a successfully transformed company able tocompete and succeed in its markets, de Selliers said the sale was "anatural departure for the EBRD." The bank expects the proceeds of thesale to be used for other investment purposes in the Czech Republic asits focus shifts to investing in post-privatization industry.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996LIST OF BIDDERS FOR GSM GROWSTeleDanmark and Telenor, of Denmark and Norway respectively, are tomake a joint bid for a 49 per cent stake in a GSM mobile telephonelicence, one of two being awarded by the government. The companies saidon December 20 that they would be "equal partners" in their jointventure but that TeleDanmark would have a majority stake to abide byrules of a tender for the stake.Separately, the electricity generator CEZ said it would be making ajoint bid for the licence stake with RWE Telliance of Germany. A thirdpartner may join that consortium, but TeleDanmark and Telenor said theywould not be seeking a local partner.The two alliances join a growing list of domestic and internationalbidders seeking to win the stake in the licence. The domestictechnology group Ceske Radiokomunikace, which operates television andradio signal transmission in the country, will own 51 per cent of thelicence.The licence will cost about $15 million but developing a nationwide GSMnetwork is set to cost "several hundred million dollars," said HaraldGrytten of Telenor, the dominant Norwegian telecoms provider. Industryanalysts have put the cost of a new network at between $300 million and$500 million. Most of the finance to develop it will be provided by theselected partner.A second GSM licence is being awarded to EuroTel, a joint venturebetween the national operator SPT Telecom and the US groups BellAtlantic and US West. EuroTel was the first Czech/foreign joint venturecreated after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and has been providingmobile services since 1990 using low-frequency NMT technologythroughout former Czechoslovakia.Other groups and consortiums bidding for the stake in the licenceinclude AirTouch of the US, France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom,Mannesmann of Germany in partnership with the engineering group SkodaPlzen, and a consortium of domestic energy distribution companies in aprobable alliance with Telecom Finland.Bids for the stake, setting out development plans and a timetable forcreating the GSM network, are expected to be sought by the end ofJanuary.

It will pay forthe stakes by issuing five-year zero-coupon notes to the savings bank.During the life of the notes Sporitelna will retain all dividends onthe shares and retain the voting rights on three quarters of eachstake.Bankers Trust will repay the notes in cash or shares or a combinationof both, depending on whether it has been able to sell the shares inthe funds on to new investors. If it retains any shares in the fundsafter five years these shares will be returned to Sporitelna to pay offthe notes.Sporitelna has been under pressure from its auditors and the CzechNational Bank for some time to reduce the stakes it holds in its owninvestment funds.  Under current legislation a bank cannot own morethan 10 per cent of any non-banking asset, including investment funds.The bank acquired the shares when thousands of its clients defaulted onloans it issued using individual shareholdings in its funds ascollateral following a slide on the Prague stock exchange during 1994.Bankers Trust has been developing a relationship with Sporitelna forseveral years and is understood to be planning an issue of globaldepository shares for the savings bank as part of a long-term strategy.But Sporitelna is regarded as the weakest of the big four Czech banksbecause of its failure to diversify sufficiently away from its coresavings business.Sporitelna is the biggest lender on the Prague interbank market and hasbeen hit hard by the instability of some of the country's smallerbanks. It has been exposed to two recent collapses; those of AB Banka -which it subsequently acquired - and Ceska Banka, which is inliquidation after collapsing in the autumn. The disposal of the stakesin its investment funds should enable it to strengthen its balancesheet.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996POLITICAL JITTERS FOR STOCK EXCHANGERecent political events have taken their toll on the Warsaw StockExchange. Its main WIG indicator has slipped by 7 per cent since thelast session on November 17, when investors were still confident thatLech Walesa would win the presidential election.The news that former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski had won by anarrow majority took 3.8 per cent off the WIG and the market's slowrecovery in the weeks following was ended by another 3.5 per cent fallon December 20 in the wake of a public accusation that prime ministerJozef Oleksy was a Russian agent.The setback, against the background of low morale on the stock exchangedating back to before the summer, has caused companies hoping to profitfrom stock exchange listings to have second thoughts. Examples includeForte, a Polish-German furniture producer, which delayed its initialpublic offer sine die, and chemicals producer  Boryszew, due to openits IPO of 600,000 shares priced at Zl 15 at the end of November, butwhich has now postponed it until January 10.January will also see the public offer of 3 million shares in the OceanCompany, a fledgling retail chain, and Lodzka Drukarnia Akcydensowa,which specializes in printing for packaging, will be offering between625,000 and 1.7 million shares priced at Zl 5. The issue by thecompany, which has been owned by its management and employees since1991, has been underwritten by Polish Development Bank (PBR) and theLodz-based Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy (PBG), which have agreed to take300,000 shares for a 5 per cent fee.Polisa, the private insurance company which came to prominence duringthe presidential campaign when it transpired that the wives of bothKwasniewski and Oleksy hold its shares (see FEE 5:23) has seen theplacement of 1.2 million of its shares in a public offer of between800,000 and 3.2 million shares priced at Zl 8. Reportedly thepurchasers of around 60 per cent of the shares placed were Bel Leasingand Forin, two companies controlled by Bank IG, which seems to beplanning to add an insurance arm to its group.In another development Bank Handlowy has taken a 13.1 per cent stake inthe Wolczanka shirt producer. The stake comes from the bankrupt BankPrzemyslowo Handlowy (BHK) in Katowice, which is currently being woundup. The securities commission has given Heineken permission to purchaseBHK's stake in the Zywiec brewery, increasing its stake from itspresent 24.9 per cent to 31.8 per cent. The Zywiec stock price hasfallen by 10 per cent recently in the wake of an announcement by AdamLoewe, the brewery's chief executive, that he would be resigning in thenew year.Bank Handlowy's move in taking a larger stake in Wolczanka reflectspart of a wider strategy towards the textile sector. Recently the BHannounced that it would be part of a consortium including Wolczanka,Prochnik and Vistula which aims to bid for the DT Centrum chain of citycentre department stores which are to be privatized this year.

Critics say Polishprivatization has so far supported efforts by the former Communistnomenklatura in gaining control over the economy. This argument has nowgained some credibility after President Walesa's electoral defeat.Deputies from the governing Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) have howevervoted through parliament a number of additional questions to be askedin the referendum. These include a query on the extension of the MPP byadding more companies (the SLD's coalition partner the Polish PeasantParty (PSL) was opposed on the grounds that the scheme should be giventime to prove itself before it is expanded). Other new questions dwellon whether state assets now worth an estimated Zl 75 billion should beused to capitalize pension funds envisaged under welfare spendingreforms as well as to compensate government employees and pensionerswho suffered unlawful wage cuts at the hands of the administration in1991 and 1992. Finally the opposition Freedom Union (UW) managed toforce through an amendment which specified that privatization couldinclude "coupons", which helped to define the enfranchisement questionoriginally put forward by Solidarity and backed by Lech Walesa.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BUDGET LOOKS FOR $720M OF STATE ASSET DISPOSALSDisposals of state-owned corporate assets in 1996 are expected to raiseZl 1.8 billion ($720 million) according to the draft budget for theyear. This is slightly more than the Zl 1.7 billion raised last yearfrom sales of treasury-owned companies or 13 per cent more than thefigure written into the 1995 budget target.At the same time the government intends to continue to squeezeprivatization advisory costs which ran to 5 per cent of revenues lastyear down to 4 per cent of this year's inflows. This suggests that theprivatization ministry will continue to favour local companies intenders for advisory work.However it can be expected that the sale of a minority stake in thegiant copper producer KGHM Polska Miedz SA will see the appointment ofa foreign adviser. A tender has been announced and bids have to be inby January 23 for what could be the largest sale of the year throughboth GDRs and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.Other major sales will be DT Centrum, the state-owned chain ofdepartment stores which controls a series of city centre sites in thecountry's largest towns and Ruch, once the all powerful newspaperdistribution network. PHS, which is what remains of the state'swholesale network is to be another "infrastructural" sale in 1996.In all privatization minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek hopes to dispose ofaround 90 companies to local and foreign investors. These will includebreweries in Tychy and Zabrze in southern Poland and Lezajsk in thesouth east. A start is also to be made on the heavy chemical sector,with three bidders shortlisted for two chemical producers,  Janikosodyand Soda Matwy. These are RhOne Poulenc, Brunner Mond and state-ownedchemicals and pharmaceuticals trader Ciech. Other sectors which willsee disposals according to Kaczmarek are cement, furniture and meatprocessing.The minister has also outlined a number of possible public offers whichcould include the Celuloza paper works in Swiecie, three fertilizerproducers in Pulawy, Tarnow and Kedzierzyn Kozle. Also included areZelmer, a white goods producer in Rzeszow and Polar, which specializesin washing machines and cookers in Wroclaw.The list could be supplemented by any one of the three tobaccoproducers in Krakow, Poznan or Lodz which the ministry still has onoffer after receiving unsatisfactory bids from investors who includePhilip Morris and Reemstma.Impexmetal, the still state-owned metals trader which has purchased theKonin aluminium mill and has plans to swap its debts for equity in theZawiercie steel mill, is also expected to be listed this year.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BANK GDANSKI IPO A SUCCESSBank Gdanski's privatization, which saw the first use in Poland ofGDRs, drew to a successful conclusion just before Christmas with 60.06per cent of the equity in private hands and a slight upward trend onthe Warsaw Stock Exchange following the bank's listing at its initialpublic offer price of Zl 24.However the sale was only saved thanks to Bank IG, which took two-thirds of the domestic tranche and ended up with a 24.07 per cent shareof Gdanski's equity. It was the first time that one of the new smallbanks has forged a strategic link with one of the, larger, regionalbanks hived off from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in 1989.Hitherto private sector banks have concentrated on buying up smallerinstitutions to extend their branch network.Bank IG's move, initiated by its founder and chairman Boguslaw Kott, a46 year-old former finance ministry official, meant that 527,518 shareswere moved from the foreign to the domestic tranche leaving 7 millionshares or 35.7 per cent of Bank Gdanski's equity in local handsalongside the treasury's 37 per cent stake.The reduction in the foreign tranche which HSBC Investment Services,the government's adviser for the sale, had originally set at between5.9 million to 6.5 million shares (30 per cent to 33 per cent of theequity) still saw foreign demand for the BG shares falling short ofsupply. In the end HSBC and Daiwa Europe, who acted as joint leadmanagers, and were backed by Schroders and Creditanstalt actingtogether with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBC Warburg and MC Securities,guaranteed a mere 4.8 million shares, which ended up with Bank of NewYork as the security for the GDRs.The underwriters took a 4 per cent fee for the service and havereportedly placed the stock with institutions in Europe and NorthAmerica.

Themost domestic-ally oriented consortium seems to be the third, led bythe Petrochemia Plock oil refinery and includes KGHM, the domesticcopper conglomerate, PSE, the Polish Power Grid Company, and TeleDanmark. Foreign partners are limited by the terms of the tender to nomore than 49 per cent of the equity in each group.But problems and recriminations remain. France Telecom Mobile lookslikely to take the government to court, joining Ameritech, which hasalready gone to arbitration to wrest one of the licences from theauthorities. Both companies are basing their claim on a letter writtenby the government in 1991, when they won a tender to develop an NMTmobile telephone system, promising them the GSM licence when therequisite frequencies became available.Under the conditions of the tender winning consortia will have to payan initial ECU 100 million licence fee augmented by annual payments fora set period thereafter. The total investment costs of each project areestimated at $1.2 billion. One factor which is worrying prospectivebidders is that the tender documents do not specify the size of theinterconnect fee the mobile operator will have to pay TP SA, the state-owned land system operator, for connections with land-basedsubscribers. This, according to the tender, will be negotiated with TPSA once the winners of the bid have been chosen.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996LUCCHINI IN MODERNIZATION PROJECT FOR HUTA WARSZAWALucchini, the Italian private steel maker, which took over the HutaWarszawa steelworks in Warsaw three years ago, has embarked on a three-stage ECU 161.1 million modernization project for the works.Lucchini's modernization project, which is financed by the IFC, theEBRD and a consortium of Italian banks, has been delayed by problemswith establishing the tenure of the land on which the Huta Warszawa islocated. However the group expects to report an around Zl 20 millionnet profit for the plant for 1995 following a Zl 1.5 million net profitin 1994 and a Zl 2.7 million loss the year before. The ECU 65.2 millionfirst stage will see the steel mill refurbished using equipment fromDanieli of Italy.In all the modernization programme which will be completed in theautumn of 1998 will increase the plant's capacity to 1 million tonnesof steel a year. Last year Huta Lucchini Warszawa produced 380,000tonnes of steel products and this will rise to 400,000 tonnes thisyear.Meanwhile Stalexport, the listed steel trader, which was forced lastOctober to withdraw a new share issue which would have raised betweenZl 30 million and Zl 150 million, has completed the construction of aZl 155 million modern mini mill at its Labedy works in Silesia. Thiswill give the mill $30 per tonne savings in energy costs on an annualoutput of 350,000 tonnes of semi finished castings. Labedy, whichStalexport plans to take over when the steel sector is privatized,specializes in supplies for the Polish coal mining industry.The equipment for the mini mill was supplied by Mannesman-Demag as wellas Concast Standard from Switzerland and was 28 per cent paid for withsupplier credits as well as a loan amounting to 40 per cent of the costfrom Poland's Environmental Protection Fund (NFOS). The remaining 32per cent came from Stalexport and the Labedy works.Stalexport's prospects for a return to its planned new share issueremain dim. Major existing shareholders like Bank Handlowy and thePioneer investment fund who paid Zl 34 per share at the initial publicoffer are insisting that any new issues should be priced at around thislevel. Meanwhile the company's current share price is languishingaround the Zl 24 per share mark and shows little sign of rising in thenear term. The share issue was to have included a placement abroadthrough GDRs with HSBC Investment Services acting as an adviser toStalexport.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996FRENCH PURCHASER FOR TOBACCO WORKSThe state-owned Radom tobacco works, which control around 13 per centof the domestic market, has been sold to Seita, the recently privatizedFrench cigarette producer. The sale follows the purchase of theAugustow works by BAT Industries and leaves the government with afurther three companies in Krakow, Lodz and Poznan still on offer.Seita has agreed to pay $64 million for a 33 per cent stake in Radomwith the option to purchase a further 32 per cent of the equity for anominal fee after completing a $40 million investment programme overthree years. Earlier BAT agreed to pay $88 million for a similar stakein Augustow, which controls 12 per cent of the market and promised toinvest $70 million in the plant.Market shares however are changing following a pre-privatizationgovernment decision to have the country's cheaper brands, which wereonce made throughout the industry, located in Radom and Krakow. Plantsin Krakow, Poznan and Lodz are the other three producers currently onoffer.This decision means that Radom's market share will rise to around 24per cent, according to a text in the Rzeczpospolita newspaper writtenby the head of Burston Marsteller, a PR company retained by PhilipMorris which is bidding for Krakow. Krakow will also see its preallocation share of 35 per cent rise slightly although its expected netprofit of $26 million for 1995 is expected to fall to $24 million as aresult of the decision. The greatest loser, however, is Poznan whose28.5 per cent market share will be hit and whose pre-allocation netprofit of $9.2 million will fall to around $6.4 million. Reemstma ofGermany is thought to be interested in taking Poznan over.So far the government has judged offers for the three remaining plantsfrom bidders such as Philip Morris and Reemstma to be inadequate.However the Burston Marsteller text would suggest that Philip Morrisvalues the Krakow works at between $286 million and $327 million andthus would be willing to pay around $200 million for a 65 per centstake. The same text, written before the Radom deal was struck withSeita, valued the Radom works at between $83 million and $78 millionwhile the price Seita paid valued the works at $98 million. Thissuggests that the government will try to hold out to get PM to improveits offer by around 10 to 15 per cent.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996IMF DEAL IN SIGHT, BUDGET PASSEDHungary reached the basis of an IMF agreement on a much-delayed 18-month stand-by loan at the end of a mission in mid-December.However - much to the anger of the trade unions and social securityofficials - the agreement is conditional on parliament's passingsatisfactory budgets for the two state social security funds whichhandle health and pensions payments. Parliament is not expected to passthe budgets of the semi-independent funds before late February.The unions and fund administrators say they are being blackmailed intoagreeing with finance ministry suggestions for the 1996 fund budgets asotherwise they will be blamed for scuppering the IMF deal. Economistssay the IMF's condition should at least encourage an early solution towhat has been a highly contentious issue. The funds and the financeministry have been locked in discussions over spending plans for 1996for some time.Leslie Lipsitz, head of the mission, said the government and IMF hadagreed on the key economic targets until end-1997 and that he was veryhopeful an agreement could be reached and approved early next year. Hesaid another mission would not be necessary and that the loan could goto board approval within a couple of weeks of parliament passing thesocial security budgets.Ever since a Socialist-led coalition took office in July 1994, Hungaryhas been keen to secure an IMF stand-by to boost its standing oninternational markets and with foreign investors. Central banksofficials have said that Hungary, which recently repaid some of itsearlier IMF loans ahead of schedule, may not even draw on the presentplanned stand-by likely to be worth $300 million.Lipsitz said Hungary aimed to bring down inflation to 20 per cent bythe end of 1996 and to 15 per cent by late 1997. GDP is forecasted torise by 2-3 per cent this year and by more than 3 per cent from 1997onwards, up from an estimated 2 per cent in 1995. The budget deficitfor this year is put at 4 per cent and is due to fall to 3 per centnext year.

Matav becomes thefirst national telecoms operator in the region to pass to majorityforeign ownership.In late December, Magyarcom, the consortium formed by the two companiestwo years ago, agreed to pay $852 million for a further 37 per cent ofMatav, bringing their total stake to around 67 per cent. The sale,together with the US-German consortium's purchase of a 30.3 per centstake for $875 million in December 1993, is the region's largestprivatization to date and the largest foreign investment in Hungary.However, the deal - the culmination of a spate of year-end sales by APVRt, the state privatization agency - nearly fell through at the lastminute. Ron Sommer, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's management board,and Walter Catlow, Ameritech vice-president, flew into Budapest to signthe purchase contract only to run into an eleventh-hour hitch requiringfurther negotiations. The deal was finally clinched after delays ofseveral hours.Sources said the Hungarian side failed to include all the consortium'scontractual rights in the purchase document and also sought guaranteesthat Magyarcom would not exit its investment within a fixed period oftime.APV Rt said the consortium, in which Ameritech and Deutsche Telekomhave equal shares, had undertaken to float the company and reduce itsstake from 67 per cent to 50 per cent plus one vote by the end of thecentury.The state is due to retain a 25 per cent plus one stake in Matav, oneof Hungary's leading blue chip companies, while management andemployees are to be offered up to 2.7 per cent. Hungary was advised onthe sale by CS First Boston.In the summer, when Hungary appointed CSFB as adviser, most analystsdoubted Hungary would sell a majority stake to Magyarcom. Stateofficials also indicated they would prefer to bring in institutionalinvestors and float the company in line with a government policy toboost the Budapest Stock Exchange through privatization when possible.But the consortium consistently argued against an early public offer onthe grounds that the company would fetch more once it had completed athree-year Ft 210 billion ($1.5 billion) investment and restructuringplan begun last year. An offer at a lower price than the consortiumpaid would also have forced Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom to writedown their investments at a loss.Magyarcom also wished to have full control of the company. Although itgained significant management control in 1993, including a power ofveto over some decisions, it frequently had to spend much timenegotiating issues with its Hungarian partners. It took several months,for example, for the two sides to agree on a new managing director inearly 1995.At the signing ceremony, Sommer said the consortium was committed todeveloping further Hungary's telecoms infrastructure and to makingMatav, the region's leading telecoms company. As part of its successfulbid in 1993, the consortium agreed to make Matav an internationaltelecoms hub and to increase the number of telephone lines by 15.5 percent annually - a target it exceeded by some eight percentage points in1995.Matav has a monopoly on national long-distance and international callsuntil 2001 and will also be the exclusive operator in 39 out of 54local network regions during this time. In addition, it has majoritystakes in two out of three local mobile telephone companies.Catlow said the company had decided to increase its stake in Matav asthe Hungarian telecoms sector was the most attractive for investment inthe region. Ameritech is in dispute with the Polish government which italleges has reneged on a promise to grant it a digital mobile telephonelicence.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996SERVIER ACQUIRES MAJORITY OF EGISServier, the privately-held French pharmaceuticals company, formed astrategic alliance with and acquired a 51 per cent stake in Egis, oneof Hungary's leading pharmaceuticals producers, in late December.Servier, France's third largest pharmaceutical supplier, acquired 30per cent of the company from the EBRD and the balance from NatWestSecurities.The purchase price was not disclosed. However, the company's marketcapitalization at the end of trading on December 15, the last daybefore the purchase, was $184 million. Peter Reiniger, joint head ofthe EBRD's Hungary team, told FEE  that the bank, which paid $45million for its stake in late 1993, had made a profit on thetransaction. He said the value of the deal reflected the company'sshare price as well as a premium for the purchase of a controllingstake.Egis, Hungary's second largest pharmaceutical company after RichterGedeon, was the leader on the local market in 1994 with a 13 per centmarket share. Exports accounted for 44 per cent of total sales. Thecompany, which went public in June 1994, made a profit of Ft3.8 billion($31 million) on turnover of Ft14.4 billion in the first nine months of1995.Last summer the state's remaining 28 per cent stake in Egis was sold toNatWest Securities at a price of Ft2,550 a share, compared to Ft3,275in December, making the company the first of the country's largepharmaceutical companies to become 100 per cent private.The sale to NatWest, however, caused considerable controversy after itemerged that the EBRD had urged the government to sell its shares toNatWest - whose corporate finance division had been appointed to adviseon the sale - rather than to rivals including CS First Boston.Brokers say the sale to NatWest without a proper tender for the shareswas in contravention of Hungary's new privatization law, passed lastMay. However, the EBRD insisted on the sale to a "friendly party" onthe grounds that its 30 per cent stake would be worth less unless soldin tandem with the government's remaining stake. EBRD officials toldFEE they had initially urged the government to sell its stake lateronce a strategic partner had been found but that APV, anxious to raiseprivatization revenues, had insisted on divesting its stake in thesummer. Only then had the EBRD stepped in and ensured the two stakescould still be sold together.The sale is one of only two "exits" made by the EBRD - earlier inDecember it sold on its stake in a Czech chocolate maker. Officialssaid the two sales reflected the growing maturity and stability inHungary and the Czech Republic and were also textbook examples of therole the bank was set up to play. In both cases the bank got involvedin the companies' privatizations, acting as a "bridge" between thestate and private buyers.Analysts said the sale also reflected Hungary's leading role in theregional pharmaceuticals industry. The deal came only days after thelaunch of a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a medium-sized privatedrugs producer (see following article), and just weeks after the saleof 78 per cent of Biogal, another former state-owned pharmaceuticalcompany, to Teva of Israel for $26 million (FEE 5:22). Sanofi of Franceowns a majority stake in Chinoin while Richter Gedeon has been floated(FEE 5:22) and is now majority-owned by institutional and localinvestors.The Egis acquisition is Servier's first in central and eastern Europe.Servier officials said they had negotiated the purchase in just sixweeks and had not yet decided whether they would increase their stakefurther.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BRISTOL-MYERS LAUNCHES OFFER FOR PHARMAVITBristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the US pharmaceuticals giant, has launcheda $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a rapidly expanding localpharmaceutical company, set up in 1988. The offer, which is for 100 percent of the company, is Hungary's first public takeover of a companylisted on the Budapest Stock Exchange and one of the first suchtakeovers in the region.BMS said it had already reached agreement to buy 77 per cent of thecompany from its majority owners Dr Imre Somody, Pharmavit chiefexecutive and founder, and Genericon Pharma, an Austrianpharmaceuticals company. Its offer to both majority and minorityshareholders is to be at the same price even though Hungary has fewregulations governing takeovers and ensuring minority shareholderprotection.BMS has offered $62.35 per share or $12.47 per global depository share,each representing one fifth of a share - a significant premium over thecompany's stock market price. GDSs were trading at $7.25 in the LondonOTC market the day before the offer was announced in December, downfrom an offer price of $57.5 when the company went public in June 1994.BMS said its offer which closes on January 26 was conditional on itgaining 90 per cent of Pharmavit and that it intended to withdraw thecompany from the BSE. The vast majority of the 23 per cent stake notowned by the majority shareholders is held by foreign institutionalinvestors.BMS is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK investment bank,together with Creditanstalt Securities Budapest - the same team whichthis year advised on the flotation of OTP, the national savings bank,and on the placement of a further tranche of Richter Gedeon, Hungary'slargest pharmaceuticals company.Pharmavit made pre-tax profit of Ft632 million ($5.7 million) onturnover of Ft4.1 billion in 1994, up from Ft533 million on turnover ofFt2.4 billion in 1993. It is Hungary's leading producer of vitaminpills - mainly through its Plussz effervescent tables. Most of itssales are in Hungary but the company also has sales subsidiaries in theCzech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.The company is one of a growing breed of eastern European companies,set up at the beginning of market-led changes, which are nowsufficiently mature to attract the interest of a multinational company.Since 1990 the company has also produced generic drugs and over-the-counter medicines. Its main pharmaceutical product is Diclofenac, ananti-inflammatory drug developed by Ciba-Geigy.Before setting up Pharmavit, Somody, 37, was a director at Chinoin, thelocal drugs company now owned by Sanofi of France. He will stay on ashead of BSM in Hungary - although Pharmavit is to retain itsindependence. BSM intends to use Pharmavit, its first acquisition inthe central and eastern Europe, to expand further in the region.Somody recommended that minority shareholders accept the offer.

The deadline wasset in late 1994 when the government agreed to transfer Ft12 billion instate securities to the bank - to make it more attractive ahead ofprivatization - on condition it was sold by December 15 1995. In theend, the deadline had to be extended for two weeks while the deal wasfinalized. Senior GE and EBRD officials, including ChristopherMacKenzie, GE Capital's chief executive in Europe, flew into Budapestwith the expectations that a deal would be signed by the 15th only toleave empty-handed. A technical hitch appeared which could only beresolved by finance minister Lajos Bokros, who was away at the time. Itappears that liability for at least one court case involving BudapestBank had not been fully resolved in the sales contract, causing a three-day delay in the signing.Under the terms of the agreement, GE Capital, which will take a 27.5per cent stake, will assume operational control of the bank. Togetherwith the EBRD, which has a 32.5 per cent, GE has an option to increaseits stake by 22 per cent within five and a half years. Until the salethe state held an 82.6 per cent stake in the bank.Hungary was advised on the sale jointly by Salomon Brothers and LehmanBrothers. Salomon initially won the adviser's contract but was obligedto share it with Lehman after much of its banking team left to joinLehman.The sale is a significant boost to government efforts to sell off statebanks, many of which have borne the brunt of the country's difficultpost-communist transition and have proved hard to privatize. The dealis only Hungary's second sale of a large commercial bank to a Westernstrategic partner. It follows the sale of a 25 per cent plus one votestake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank, the foreign trade bank, toBayerische Landesbank in mid-1994.GE Capital, which is expanding aggressively into Europe through astring of recent acquisitions, entered the bidding for Budapest Bank,Hungary's fifth largest commercial bank, relatively late. It was notone of the three companies which tendered for the bank in late 1994.Then, Credit Suisse was named preferred bidder ahead of ING and AlliedIrish, only to withdraw abruptly in March after conducting duediligence.GE Capital and the EBRD signed a letter of intent to purchase the bankin October and subsequently conducted due diligence. The buyers areunderstood to have initially offered around $100 million but scaledback their offer to $87 million after due diligence. Like other banks,Budapest Bank has suffered from bad loans and in the middle of lastyear had to make 15 per cent risk provisions. The bank has assets ofaround Ft215 billion and 74 branches.GE Capital, whose parent company is one of the biggest investors inHungary, said it would bring in new financial products and moderntechnology. It is expected to keep on Bela Singlovics, the bank's chiefexecutive.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996POLITICAL FEARS KEEP INVESTORS AWAY DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMYFor 1995, Slovakia should achieve the second-highest growth rate amongeast Europe's emerging markets behind Albania, with gross domesticproduct rising by 6 per cent. Economists expect a similar growth ratein 1996 as key industries such as chemicals and steel continue tobenefit from booming export markets and as domestic demand grows.Whether this rosy scenario leads to a reassessment of the country bydomestic and foreign investors will depend crucially on whether theprime minister, Vladimir Meciar, is prepared to settle his damagingconstitutional row with President Michal Kovac. It is this powerstruggle more than anything that has caused Slovakia to lag behind itspeers in the Visegrad group of countries - the Czech Republic, Hungaryand Poland - in the eyes of foreign observers, to the detriment of itsreputation abroad.There appears to be little likelihood of an early reconciliation, anddiplomats in Bratislava say they can see no way out of the deadlock."Meciar must make the first move, and he does not appear willing to doso," one diplomat said before Christmas. Until he does, the diplomatadds, Slovakia will remain in limbo.So far, however, the political row has not had an adverse impact on theeconomy. Indeed, there is much progress on all fronts, includingprivatization, which has speeded up considerably since the governmentabandoned coupon sell-offs early in 1995 and replaced them with an adhoc series of sales to a narrow group of owner/managers. The keyquestion in 1996, as privatization reaches a climax, is: What next?There were good reasons for abandoning coupon privatization. It is slowand can be an administrative nightmare. It results in widely dispersedownership and to be truly successful it requires the immediateimplementation of rules to protect small investors (which are not yetforthcoming in, for example, the Czech Republic).On the other hand, it has a measure of transparency and fairness inthat all adult citizens can participate, making it politically popular.The government's main argument for abandoning the coupon plan was thatdispersed shareholdings meant there was no clearly identified owner.There was also the unstated fear among the nationalists that the backdoor would be opened to foreign investors to pick up assets on thecheap.Critics argued that these were excuses for abandoning privatizationaltogether. In fact, the reverse has happened. The adoption of"standard methods" of privatization has quickened the paceconsiderably, with hundreds of sell-offs in the second half of thisyear with an estimated book value of $1 billion.  These range fromsmall factories to a big chunk of the Slovnaft petrochemical group .The speed of the sell-offs is admirable. About 65 per cent of grossdomestic product is now generated by the private sector, according toofficial estimates. The vast majority of these sales have been made toexecutives and workers at the enterprises involved.Meciar defends the methods used to reduce state ownership: "Variouslobbies say our methods are undemocratic. We think they are necessaryand inevitable," he says.Yet there are clear signs of a wider agenda in the current bout ofprivatization fever. Assets are often sold at knock-down prices andbuyers have 10 years to pay for them. If the enterprise is deemedimportant enough, a controversial and ambiguous law on strategicenterprises enables the state to retain a golden share that allows itto wield influence long after the stake has been sold.Most contentiously, critics say assets are sold only to those deemedloyal to Meciar's all-embracing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.Eugen Jurzyca of the Centre for Economic Development, a think tank,doubts the wisdom of what he terms "family circle privatization".Selling companies on the cheap throws away money that could be used forsocial spending and the relief of bad debts. It also promotesinequality by concentrating potentially valuable assets among a narrowgroup who can then sell them on at great profit to themselves.There is also growing concern about how these assets are being paidfor, in a country chronically short of capital. Those managers who buythe stakes will owe substantial sums to the state holding company, theNational Property Fund (NPF), over the 10-year period of the payment.The fear is that company cash flow will be diverted in the form ofdividends to owners to make those payments.Few Slovak companies have the cash flow to afford this. "The company ispaying for its own acquisition in the end," notes Jean-Christophe Ganz,manager of ING Bank in Bratislava.Economists play down the political dimension of privatization. For theNational Bank of Slovakia the important thing is that it is continuing,says Elena Kohutikova, head of the independent central bank's monetarypolicy unit. "It is difficult to decide which privatization policy isthe best one," she says.So far the government's policy has not had an adverse impact oninflation, but nor has it enabled substantial inflows of fresh capitaland know-how. This raises two further questions. The first is how thecost of the bond issue will be met.Each coupon holder is to receive a nominal Sk 10,000 ($345) bond backedby the assets of the NPF. The bonds can be used for things like payingfor an apartment or contributing to a private pension scheme, requiringearly redemption, and they are also likely to be transferable.The bonds are due to mature in 2001, requiring the NPF to have up to Sk35 billion ($1.2 billion) available to pay out. Meantime there isannual interest based on the discount rate (currently 9.75 per cent).Although not all holders are expected to retain the bonds to maturity,economists warn that the potential cost of the scheme could be as highas Sk 50 billion ($1.7 billion). This is a giant mortgage on the NPFthat it must be able to discharge.The second question is how industry will be restructured. Key companieslike Slovnaft and the big VSZ steel plant have largely modernized andare helping to fuel economic growth. Many others await the kiss oflife.Foreign investment is one obvious solution, and some observers expect apush to attract it in 1996. This would be a volte face for thegovernment, but one that Meciar may be pragmatic enough to pull off.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996POWER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTUREDThe EBRD is backing Ukraine's power sector with a loan of $61.9 millionto support the restructuring of the country's power sector. Followingan EU and UK Know-How-Fund commissioned study on Ukraine's powerindustry, the government is set to re-organize the thermal powersector, to include the creation of thermal generating companies,broadly following the pattern established during the privatization ofBritain's power industry.The loan will go to the country's four newly created thermal generatingcompanies to finance repair and maintenance at the largest thermalpower plants in order to improve the reliability of power generation.The loan will also pay for more accurate meters, investments requiredto start a wholesale electricity market, which is to be set up soon.Funds will also pay for managerial assistance to provide modernaccountancy measures and financial management techniques.The loan was signed during President Leonid Kuchma's official visit toLondon in December, when the EBRD signed a total of $75 million infunding to Ukrainian enterprises. In view of the continued operation ofthe Chernobyl nuclear power station, which Western experts unanimouslywant closed down, it is a top priority to help provide a more reliablepower industry to replace the Chernobyl plant."Perhaps the most urgent issue for Ukraine today concerns the country'senergy sector," said Kuchma during his London visit. "With the EBRD'sloan we can strengthen our existing resources, in this case thermalpower plants."In the longer term, the project will include a "twinning" programme formanagement with a Western power company. The actual company has yet tobe chosen.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996$50M AGREEMENT SIGNEDPresident Kuchma's London visit saw the signing of an important projectaimed to grease the wheels of trade in Ukraine. The EBRD has signed a$50 million trade finance agreement under which it will guarantee thepayments of participating Ukrainian banks to their foreigncorrespondent banks. The Ukrainian Innovation Bank (Ukrinbank), aprivate bank, is the first to sign up to the programme. Other banks areexpected to join the programme shortly.The programme was first started in Russian and Macedonia. Day-to-daytrade is stifled by a chronic shortage of trade finance, covering bothexports and imports from the East European countries. Under theprogramme, the EBRD guarantees six-month letters of credit issued byselected financial institutions. This guarantee allows banks toestablish reliable reputations with Western financial institutions,enabling them to adopt normal correspondent relations with banks inEastern Europe. The programme may be expanded later to cover banks inEastern Europe and in "lost" markets, such as India, where Ukrainianenterprises used to export five years ago.Under the programme, the Ukrainian bank informs the EBRD which foreignbank it wants to deal with and pays the EBRD a fee to cover theguarantee. The EBRD guarantees up to 80 per cent of the letter ofcredit thus allowing importers and exporters to get out of the currentstalemate and re-establish trade on a normal footing.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996EBRD INCREASES UKRAINE FUND CAPITALThe EBRD is backing equity funding by increasing the capital base ofthe Ukraine Fund, the first private venture funds to be established inUkraine. Set up two years ago, the fund has lent $5 million to 18companies. The EBRD will now increase its capital base by a further$6.5 million. Equity funding has been provided to companiesmanufacturing medical equipment, construction materials and foodprocessing and distribution.The fund was established with a group of international investors,including Bank of Boston and Claflin Capital Management. Despite thedifficult economic conditions, the Fund was oversubscribed andinitially raised $12 million as against a target of $10 million.The EBRD is backing further infrastructure investment with aninvestment of $5 million to assist in the construction of a fertilizerterminal, Transinvestservice at Odessa. The terminal is part-owned bythe Ukrainian State Property Fund, the Norwegian company, Norsk Hydroas well as local investors. The terminal will be used mainly for theexport of fertilizers from Ukraine and other CIS countries to LatinAmerica and Asia.These investments bring the value of signed commitments to a total ofabout $312 million for this year. EBRD president Jacques de LarosiArenoted that the bank is able to achieve this due to the improved macro-economic situation in the country and the growth of the private sector.This total compares favourably with the EBRD projects approved in 1994,when Ecu 153.9 million was committed in only three projects.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996TACIS FUNDS THREATENEDTechnical assistance programmes to the CIS countries are under threatfollowing a top-level move to block funding from the European Union.Spain is demanding tougher controls and greater participation inawarding contracts under the TACIS programme, which funds technicalassistance programmes to the 12 CIS member countries.No agreement has been reached to authorize the TACIS budget of Ecu 500million for 1996. While this dispute will not stop the programme in itstracks, unless there is a resolution soon, the effects will be felt inthe future."We have the legal base to operate by extending the present regulationsfor one year, but the budget is unclear," said EU official, Per Winter.Although TACIS officials agree on financial commitments within eachbudgetary year, which runs to December 31, the drawdown period canextend for up to three years. Winter added that there is always a rushto complete commitments by the end of the year in order to spend thefull annual allocation. If there is agreement within the first fewmonths of 1996, then officials are confident that the programme will beable to fulfil commitments for the year. Funding for the programme willbe discussed again early in 1996, when it is hoped that Spain and otherpossible allies might be persuaded to authorize a budget.Spain is objecting to the way TACIS is run, mainly because so farSpanish companies have only won 2 per cent of the programme'scontracts. EU officials claim they have tried to interest Spanishcompanies in the programme, but with little success. They point outthat Spain scoops the pool in Latin America, but have little experienceor language skills in Eastern Europe. Spain wants to introduce a newsystem of monitoring contracts and reduce the financial threshold forcontracts that are tendered, proposals resisted by other Member States,who fear it would create a larger bureaucracy and lead to delays.The TACIS programme had earlier been attacked by the European Court ofAuditors for inefficiency and poor targeting of funds, criticism thatthe PHARE programme, aimed at the Central European countries hadearlier suffered. PHARE has been re-drafted, changed its bureaucraticstructure and focus to enable it to prepare the Central Europeancountries for joining the EU.At the Cannes meeting in June, the EU decided to change the fundingmechanism for PHARE from an annual budget system to a five-year budgetof Ecu 6.7 billion, to avoid the annual scramble to commit funds by theend of the year. The civil service oversight was also changed from asectoral to a country basis. There are now country desks and theseofficials hold monthly meetings in the countries' capitals to determinethe future programmes in agreement with the individual governments.Contracts under the PHARE programme have also changed from a series oftechnical assistance contracts to a cohesive pre-accession strategy.There are three main strands of the PHARE strategy.The primary aim is devoted to helping the countries prepare formembership of the EU. Each country has to work out a programme ofaction that includes passing new legislation, preparing and ensuringits enforcement and introducing European technical norms and standards.While the programmes are driven by the individual countries, if EUofficials feel that the programmes do not make a realistic contributionto EU integration, then they can reduce the funds available.The second priority for PHARE funding is for infrastructure in areassuch as telecommunications, environment, gass and electricity networksand road and rail transport. In transport, the EU has designated Trans-European Networks, which integrate Central Europe's roads and railwayswith existing networks in Western Europe and in particular easingbottlenecks at border crossings. PHARE has now expanded into also providing finance in order tocatalyse foreign investments. Typically this might take the form ofputting up the government's share in an investment programme. The firsttime this was done was two years ago, when the World Bank and theEuropean Investment Bank were looking to the Polish government to kickin 10 per cent of the money needed to upgrade the E20 railway line fromBerlin to Warsaw. The Polish government re-drafted its proposed PHAREprogramme to allow the money available to be spent on the railwayproject.EU officials are confident that the accession of the Central Europeancountries will be the best prepared of any new Member States. Thetiming of their entry remains in the air, and it is also undecidedwhether they will come in singly or in groups. What is certain is thatPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will be the first, withofficials speculating that the likely entry date is the year 2000.Meanwhile, Slovenia, which would also qualify for early entry, has notsigned an Association Agreement yet, because of a dispute with Italy,while Macedonia, having solved its dispute with Greece, now qualifiesfor PHARE assistance. The eligibility of the other former Yugoslavrepublics remains in limbo.Back to Headline List WT03-B38-29IA059-000325-B025-155http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi88.html 205.156.212.5 19970115011013 text/html 88362HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:07:49 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:28 GMTContent-length: 88173Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi88.html Sample Issue Copyright FINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNet March 1, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT (683 words) SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (1197 words) PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATION (976 words) FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS (468 words) SEC PROPOSES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEMS (451 words) STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATION (951 words) SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDING (816 words) THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994 (344 words) THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAW (1175 words) ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARY (381 words) NEWS MORE INFORMATION ON PAYOUT POLICIES URGED (73 words) TSE SENDS MISSIONS TO ASIAN EXCHANGES (112 words) CCPC'S FIRST YEAR (322 words) LISTING RULES TO EFFECT RESTRICTIONS ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS (143 words) INCREASE IN SFC FEES (79 words) HKMA ACCEPTS WIDER DEBT INSTRUMENT RANGE (137 words) PROPOSED CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN ANNUAL BUDGET (145 words) CONSULTATIVE PAPER ISSUED BY THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE (1330 words) PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE" (970 words) CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDS (451 words) REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (314 words) ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATY (850 words) OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS (207 words) SUPER PRIMARY DEALERS (154 words) CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENTThe UK Securities and Investments Board (SIB), under its chairman,Andrew Large, is entering a new phase in its attempt to police London'sfinancial markets.The SIB's early years were mainly taken up with detailed rule-setting;subsequently there was a shift away from detailed rules in favour ofbroader principles which the self-regulating organizations (SROs) couldthen apply; and now, following some spectacular financial scandals, theemphasis is on enforcement.The background to this problem is the fragmentation of responsibilityfor tackling market abuse. The multifinance enforcement agenciesinvolved include the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury,the Crown Prosecution Service, the Services Fraud Office, theSecurities and Futures Authority, the Stock Exchange - and, of course,the SIB.The SIB Chairman is now proposing a much more centralised and effectiveenforcement regime, based partly on US experience. Firstly, he wants tosee the development of a central transaction database covering on-exchange and off-exchange transactions in both cash and derivativesmarkets, so that abuse can be better detected. Secondly, theinvestigation of abuse needs to be strengthened, particularly wheremisconduct is of a criminal nature. And, finally, there should be moreeffective enforcement action to deal with cases where abuse has beenestablished - as already reflected in the SIB's willingness to use itspowers under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban peoplefrom the investment industry.In the areas of investigation and enforcement the SIB is now focusingits efforts on more rigorous monitoring of the performance of the SROsthat come under its wing. This is being done through on-sitesupervisory reviews of both the SROs themselves and (morecontroversially) individual regulated firms. However, the SIB believesthat it is handicapped through insufficient statutory powers:specifically, powers relating to the appointment of officers of SROsand the imposition of monetary penalties on SROs where there is afailure to comply with regulations.In addition, the SIB would like to possess punitive powers overauthorised firms (eg the power to impose fines). The belief is thatfallback enforcement powers of this kind would encourage more decisiveaction by SROs who would wish to avoid any need for the SIB tointervene.But the most radical new ideas on enforcement concern the interfacebetween the civil and criminal law. Mr Large has pointed out that inthe US, market abuse may be dealt with both under the criminal law andas an administrative "offence", for which the SEC may impose penaltiesof three times the profit made. The most serious cases are dealt withby criminal prosecutors but in many other cases the civil route ispreferred, the public interest being served by the payment of financialpenalties to the SEC, which passes them to the US Treasury. This regimeis further buttressed by a plea-bargaining system which often avoidsthe need for protracted legal proceedings.Mr Large evidently sees much to be admired in the US enforcementregime, and on the particular issue of plea-bargaining he expressed hisviews forcefully earlier this month:"I believe it cannot be beyond the wit of man, and certainly not beyondthe combined brain power of our best legal minds, to devise a fair andopen system of plea-negotiations which respects the role of thejudiciary in sentencing, a guilty defendant's desire to own up quicklyand on all fronts, and the needs of our criminal and regulatory-enforcement agencies to secure their respective objectives withoutwasting valuable resources - that could command real publicconfidence."The fact is that the law, and the law enforcement agencies, havefallen into disrepute following a succession of failed prosecutionsinvolving allegations of financial fraud and market abuse. The publicperception is that the UK legal/ regulatory system is simply incapableof dealing with serious misconduct based on sophisticated exploitationof London's increasingly complex financial markets. The SIB chairmanclearly wants to do something about this, but it will require the co-operation of Parliament and, above all, the legal profession, iffinancial law and order is to be restored.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTSIn reply to an unusually large volume of negative comments, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has modified its earlierproposed rule requiring reporting by "large traders" both inside andoutside the US on transactions effected in "publicly traded securities"using US market facilities. (For a description of the originallyproposed rule, see FT-FRR January 1992.)As re-proposed, Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identifythemselves to the SEC, and require their brokers to maintain records ofthe large traders' activity, to be provided to the SEC upon request. Alarge trader is a person who, for an account he owns or controls,effects transactions, during a calendar day where the account islocated, in publicly traded securities, aggregating at least the lesserof (a) 200,000 shares with a fair market value of $2 million, or (b)$10 million fair market value, or that constitute "program trading."("Program trading" is either index arbitrage or any trading strategyinvolving the related purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or morepublicly traded securities with fair market value of at least$1,000,000.)The modifications are designed to reduce the number of tradersaffected, as well as the burdens and costs of the proposed system onboth large traders and their brokers. This is accomplished through:clarifying the definition of a large trader; increasing the minimumlevel of trading that requires reporting; reducing the amount ofinformation required for filing; streamlining the filing itself, aswell as providing for an inactive status; improving the instructionsfor filing; reducing record keeping requirements; providing specialreporting requirements for execution times; and defining a safe harbourfor the broker's duty to supervise his large trader clients.The large trader reporting system, if approved as re-proposed, willrequire large traders to file Form 13H with the SEC to obtain a largetrader identification number (LTID). Each trader is then responsiblefor advising his brokers of his LTID and all accounts to which itapplies. These brokers must maintain records of the trades for theaccounts, which they will be required to provide to the SEC uponrequest. The brokers must also supervise their clients' compliance withthe rule. The large traders themselves are required to update Form 13Hannually.In the re-proposal, the large trader definition has been clarified toinclude a person who effects transactions "for an account that he ownsor controls" in place of the original "for his own account or anaccount for which he exercises investment discretion." According to theSEC, this change is merely a clarification and does not change thefunctional meaning of the definition. The re-proposal includes similarclarifications with regard to the definitions of "person," "account,""ownership," "control," and "transaction." The revisions are designedto limit the reach of the large trader definition by limiting thenumber of accounts that are deemed to be owned or controlledindirectly.Probably the most important modification is that of the increase in thelevel of activity which identifies one as a large trader. Theidentifying activity level for any 24-hour period would increase fromactivity involving 100,000 shares or a fair market value of $4 millionto 200,000 shares or a fair market value of $10 million. In addition,those 200,000 shares must have a fair market value of $2 million, ineffect excluding from large trader status many who trade in largevolumes of lower priced securities. The re-proposed activity levels arealso intended to minimise the impact of the rule on natural persons whoinfrequently trade large amounts of securities.To simplify the identification of activity which requires reporting,the SEC has proposed to change the 24-hour period to "a calendar daywhere the account is located." The change will preclude the need toaggregate trades occurring on different days, or to "correct" for timezone differences. An account is deemed to be located at the principalplace of business of the broker, not where the client is located.The re-proposal narrows the scope of the rules for aggregation ofaccounts and transactions. This is accomplished partly through themodifications to the definitions of "ownership" and "control." Inaddition, aggregation of accounts will not be required where theaggregation would include accounts of a person who would independentlyqualify as a large trader. On the other hand, aggregation will berequired to include accounts of any other person who would notindependently qualify as a large trader. Further, under nocircumstances shall a person or group acting in concert toward a commoninvestment objective be allowed to disaggregate where thatdisaggregation would permit them to avoid large trader identification.Modifications to the filing requirements provide that a large tradermust file its original Form 13H within 10 days after it initiallyreaches the identifying activity level; and within 60 days after theend of each year thereafter. The re-proposal has rejected the originalrequirement that large traders submit a new Form 13H each time the"information contained therein becomes inaccurate for any reason," infavour of the single annual update. In addition, the new form providesfor "inactive status" filing, by which a trader is exempt from annualfiling requirements until and unless it subsequently reaches theidentifying activity level. At that point, the trader again has 10 daysto "reactivate" by filing Form 13H.Form 13H and its schedules and instructions have been modified toreflect the changes in the Rule and have been generally simplified. There-proposed Form 13H allows for incorporation by reference ofinformation already on file with the SEC. The requirement for detailedinformation regarding persons who own or control large traderorganizations has been largely eliminated. The schedules for listingnew accounts have also been revised, corresponding to the largetrader's status as owner, controller or custodian/ nominee of theaccounts.With regard to the duties of broker-dealers, the rule requires thatthey report electronically transactions that reach a certain level forpersons who they know or have reason to know are large traders. Thelevel of trading activity that must be reported is increased in the re-proposed rule from 1,000 shares or a fair market value of $40,000 to2,000 shares or a fair market value of $100,000. This change alsoincorporates the change from a 24-hour period to a "calendar day." TheSEC recommends that brokers inform persons they have reason to know arelarge traders of their obligations to identify themselves to the SEC.Although the principal responsibility for compliance in placed on largetraders, brokers have a duty to identify large traders. The re-proposalprovides "a safe harbour" for brokers in this regard, provided theyadopt and follow reasonable procedures to identify large traders.Finally, the SEC maintains that the burdens imposed by the proposedrule on foreign entities are "necessary and appropriate" and "notunduly burdensome," given their uniform application to foreign anddomestic entities. The re-proposal points out that, through theredefinitions of identifying activity level as well as the concepts of"ownership" and "control," the effect of the rule on foreign entitiesis greatly reduced.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATIONBoth the Senate and House Banking Committees have now passed theirversions of interstate banking legislation, and prospects are good thatboth Bills will pass the respective Houses of Congress before the July4 holidays. That will provide time before the end of the Congressionalyear for a conference between the Houses to resolve differences betweenthe two Bills, and passage of a landmark interstate banking Bill thisCongress.HouseThe House Banking Committee passed HR 3841, the "Interstate BankingEfficiency Act of 1994", by a vote of 50-1, and it should be reportedto the full House of Representatives within the next 30-60 days. Seniormembers of the Committee are considering placing it on the portion ofthe agenda of the House known as the suspension calendar, usuallyreserved for non-controversial Bills. While that may not succeed, sincetwo-thirds of those voting are required to pass such a Bill, the merefact that it is being considered shows that the Bill has solid strengthand will very likely pass the full House.The Bill is similar to the Bill passed by the Financial InstitutionsSubcommittee, changed only by modest amendments related to branchclosing requirements, statistical data collection, and inter-affiliateagency activities. Efforts to impose crippling amendments sought by con-sumer activists were soundly defeated.The House Bill would permit acquisitions of banks across state linesone year after passage of the Bill with no authority for states toprohibit such acquisitions. Consolidation of interstate banks within aholding company into a single branch network could take place 18 monthsafter passage. States would be able to prohibit branching by passinglegislation any time within three years after passage of the Bill, andif a bank holding company had consolidated its subsidiary banks withinsuch states into an interstate branch network before the passage ofthree years, it would be required to convert them back into banks asthey existed prior to the consolidation.De novo interstate branching, as opposed to acquisitions andconsolidations, could take place only if a state expressly permits itby statute. States would also be able, during a three-year periodfollowing passage of the Bill, to prohibit interstate branching throughacquisitions.Branches of national banks would be subject to the laws of the hoststate with respect to con-sumer protection, fair lending, and communityre-investment as though they were branches of a state bank chartered inthat state. Branches of state banks would be subject to the laws of thehost state as though they were branches of a state bank chartered inthat state.Foreign banks would be free to branch interstate with wholesalebranches and would not have to establish a subsidiary bank to do so,but no change is made in the current law which requires establishmentof a subsidiary bank for conducting retail banking activity, whethersuch activity be conducted through a branch or a bank. In other words,if a foreign bank wished to engage in interstate retail bankingactivity, it would have to do so through a US subsidiary bank.SenateThe Senate Banking Committee passed its interstate banking Bill,currently unnumbered and known as the "Interstate Banking and BranchingAct of 1994", by unanimous vote, and it is expected to pass the fullSenate before the Easter recess. It differs from the House BankingCommittee Bill in some key respects.Interstate acquisition authority mirrors the House Bill, and nosignificant differences need be debated in conference on that part ofthe Bill. In the Senate Banking Committee Bill, interstateconsolidation, however, may not occur until two years after passage, asopposed to 18 months in the House Banking Committee Bill.Under the Senate Banking Committee Bill branches of national bankswould be treated in a host state as though they were branches of anational bank chartered in that state. Branches of state banks would betreated as though they were branches of state banks chartered in thatstate.Foreign branches do not fare as well under the Senate Banking CommitteeBill as under the House Banking Committee Bill. While a foreign bankwhich had established a subsidiary bank to engage in retail bankingwould be permitted to branch (as would any other US bank) it appearsthat it would not be permitted to establish interstate wholesalebranches without first establishing a subsidiary bank, unless the statelaw expressly permitted such activity. It appears, however, that itwould continue to be able to have representative offices, agencies, andloan production offices in all states not specifically prohibited bystate laws, as long as those entities only conducted wholesale bankingactivities.Under both the Senate and House Banking Committee Bills there arelimits on the aggregate amount of deposits which can be retained in afirm which expands by acquisition, although those limits differslightly.PrognosisInterstate banking seems to be alive and doing well in this Congress.While passage of onerous provisions urged by consumer activists maystill derail final passage in the House, the prospects now are goodthat an interstate Bill will pass this year.The conference between the two Houses on the Bill will be difficult.Significant differences exist on a wide range of subjects such asdetermination of applicable law governing interstate branches, timingand effect of state actions vis-e-vis branching, effect on foreignbranch activity, concentration limits, and the effective date for theconduct of activities permitted by the Bills.Similarly, the shadow of serious disruption of Congressional activitywhich might be occasioned by hearings into the "Whitewater" affair arebeginning to build, and what Bills that might retard or scuttle areunpredictable.Still, for the first time since the McFadden Act was passed in 1927,Congress appears to be prepared to liberalise laws governing interstatebanking and branching activity.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDSThe Federal Reserve Board ("the Board") has proposed revisions toexisting risk-based capital standards as part of the implementation ofthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).In line with the Basle Accord, US banks currently calculate theirregulatory capital requirement on the basis of credit risks associatedwith broad categories of assets and off-balance-sheet instruments.Institutions are required to maintain a level of capital equal to atleast eight per cent of their risk weighted assets.The proposed modifications would seek to adjust capital standards so asto take into account the following factors:1 The degree concentration of credit risk in a bank's loan portfolio.2 An institution's ability to manage credit risk.3 An institution's ability to manage the risks posed by involvement innon-traditional activities.Although the Board recognises that there is no generally acceptedapproach to identifying and quantifying the risks associated withconcentration, it proposes that institutions with significant levels ofcredit-risk concentration should hold additional capital. They notethat the information to achieve this is already available. Banks canidentify and track loans by industry, geographical location, country,and loan type. This information would form the basis for the newstandard.While the Board recognises that there are potential gains in riskreduction through portfolio diversification, it is aware that there arealso potential pitfalls. For example, it is concerned that a bankshould not seek to achieve diversification by "lending in unfamiliarmarket areas to out-of-territory borrowers or by rapid expansion of newloan products for which the situation does not have adequateexpertise." They are anxious that any new regulations will not createfalse incentives for management that will unintentionally decrease thesoundness of the banking industry.The proposal does not identify specific categories of non-traditionalactivities that it proposed to monitor. The Federal Reserve recognisesthat new developments in technology and financial instruments have ledbanks to become involved in activities that have not been associatedwith their traditional business. They are aware of claims that any newregulations could limit the ability of institutions to compete with non-bank competitors. However, they are concerned that the risks associatedwith any new activities should be promptly analysed and that capitalshould be increased appropriately. The ability of an institution tomanage such risks will be taken into account.The Federal Reserve notes that "the final supervisory judgement on abank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions thatmight be drawn solely from the level of its risk-based capital ratio".In addition to those factors which influence portfolio diversificationand a bank's management skills, they will also be looking at factorssuch as interest-rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks;and the quality and level of earnings.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SEC PROPOSES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEMSThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently proposed Rule 17a-23 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act")requiring brokers and dealers that operate automatic trading systems(broker-dealer trading systems or BDTSs) to maintain participant,volume and transaction records to be reported periodically to the SEC.Under the 1934 Act, sponsors of BDTSs must register as broker-dealersand are subject to its normal record keeping and reportingrequirements; they are not, however, required to identify separatelythose transactions effected through the BDTSs, nor to summarise thevolume or type of activity occurring through the automated systems.Additionally, numerous automated trading systems operate pursuant to no-action letters obtained from the SEC at the commencement of theiroperation.In 1989, the SEC proposed a rule that would have required sponsors ofBDTSs to comply with a number of procedural and substantivespecifications. The SEC now believes, in light of the favourablefindings of its Market 2000 Study (See FT-FRR February, 1994 for adescription of that study), that enhanced record keeping and reportingwill be sufficient for purposes of detecting potentially or actualfraudulent, deceptive and manipulative practices and protecting thepublic interest in the automated trading arena.The rule is intended to assist the SEC in evaluating the role ofcomputerisation and automation in the securities industry, with an eyetoward the goals of the national market system, to monitor the effectof BDTSs on competition, and to reassess whether broker-dealerregulation remains the appropriate method for monitoring these systems.The proposed rule would apply only to those systems through whichactual execution or at least matching of orders occurs automatically,excluding those systems which merely automate the collection of ordersor the routing of orders but do not provide for automated matching ofbuy and sell orders within the system. BDTS sponsors will be requiredto maintain records of daily summaries of trading; time-sequencedrecords of all trades; information regarding system participants aswell as applicants who have been denied participation; and all noticessent by the sponsor to the participants. The sponsors will be requiredto file with the SEC an initial description of their system and itsoperation; quarterly summaries of activity; and notification ofmaterial changes or cessation of operations. The proposed rulespecifies no particular format for these submissions, in recognition ofthe variance in internal procedures already established by BDTSs.The SEC stated in its proposal that the anticipated costs to sponsorsin order to comply with these requirements "do not appear to besignificant," as many sponsors already maintain their own records andthe automated nature of the systems facilitates accurate and timelydata collection.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATIONMore than 70 organizations responded to the Stock Exchange'sConsultative Document on the dissemination of price-sensitiveinformation (see FT-FRR November 1993 pp 7-8).The following points raised have resulted in changes:False market.

Many companies consider that theirresponsibility to correct errors in market perception should only arisewhen the cause of the error originates - or appears to originate - fromthe company or its agents.Companies should not have to be "incessantly concerned" with commentson their performance, their sector or their competitors. The Exchangewill be examining, in consultation with the Treasury and marketparticipants, possible changes to its Official Listing Rules to clarifythat a company which is keeping the market properly informed only has aregulatory obligation to correct misconceptions in the market when thesource of the error is itself or its agents. Factual correction ofinaccurate information from a third party should be a matter ofsensible judgement and good practice by the company.There will have to be further consultation by the Exchange on the basisof the text of the revised rule. The present text of the guidancereflects existing Listing Rules.Confidential. Concern had been expressed that the draft guidance doesnot fully reflect the situation where a company should not make anannouncement. There may be occasions when a company's duties to itsshareholders, employees and creditors conflict with any duty of promptdisclosure to the market as a whole. In response to this, the WorkingParty has included a new paragraph on the handling of confidentialinformation. The Working Party did not intend this guidance to implythat companies could not keep commercially sensitive informationconfidential until the appropriate moment for its announcement.Responsibility for issuing information. The revised guidance makes itclear that in the Working Party's opinion, policies concerning thehandling of price-sensitive information must be set by the Board of acompany, though the implementation of the policy may be delegated.Annual General Meeting. Some commented that public occasions such asAnnual General Meetings were unsuitable for intelligent discussionbetween directors and shareholders because they were so sparselyattended.The Working Party would "deplore" a situation where the publicproceedings at the AGMs remain anodyne, whilst influential audiencesare briefed privately on sensitive matters. Companies must remembertheir obligation to announce formally - either before or at the time ofthe meeting - any price-sensitive information which is to be given atthe meeting.Significance. Some consultees have suggested that the guidance, iftaken to extremes, would require a company to monitor constantly allcomments about itself, its competitors and its marketplace to see ifthey created the need for some statement of clarification. The guidancehas been amplified to stress that an assessment must always be made ofthe significance of information. The guidance is not intended to leadto a stream of inconsequential announcements.Status of guidance. The Working Party was strongly urged to clarify thestatus of the guidance in proceedings either in a court or as a resultof action by the Exchange as Competent Authority. The guidance cannotconstrain any regulatory body and compliance with it will notnecessarily constitute a defence in the event of regulatory actionbeing taken. However, the Board of the Stock Exchange has agreed thatthe Exchange will take into account judgements made by companies inaccordance with the guidance.List of what constitutes price-sensitive information. No respondentbelieved that price-sensitive information should be defined byreference to a given percentage movement in share price, but a fewsuggested that a list of likely price-sensitive events might behelpful. The Working Party has gone some way to meeting this requestbut has emphasised that any list is inevitably deficient in those greyareas where companies may be most anxious for guidance.Making people insiders. Some respondents suggested that the very act ofasking a shareholder if he consents to become an insider will conveyprice-sensitive information to him, in that he may well have a shrewdidea of what he is likely to be told. If shareholders wish to avoidbeing placed in this position and are reluctant to lose their abilityto trade, even for a short period, they should make this policy known.Quarterly statements. In general, respondents did not wish this part ofthe guidance to become prescriptive and endorsed the tone of theconsultative paper. Some thought that it was inappropriate for themarket to be given figures which had not been externally verified. TheWorking Party disagrees that the market will be misled by suchinformation provided that its status is made completely clear at thetime of the announcement.Analysts. The guidance now contains some observations on how analystsshould behave in the conduct of their relationships with companies.Many analysts are employed by firms which are members of the Exchangeand, even if the Exchange has no statutory responsibility for theirconduct, it feels it should encourage best practice, especially ascompanies are expected to handle their side of these contacts withgreat care.Small companies. The guidance is applicable to every size of company.It is acknowledged that companies whose progress is followed by only afew analysts will have particular problems if those analysts are wildlywrong in their forecasts and may well need to consider whether theyneed to make a correcting announcement.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDINGThe Securities and Investment Board has announced proposals to endcross-contributions for SFA and IMRO members with regard to theInvestors Compensation Scheme.The proposals have been drawn up in the light of comments which the SIBhas received in response to its Discussion Paper, "Financing InvestorsCompensation", published in October 1993.The proposals are as follows:* to end cross-contributions, as of April 1 1994 for SFA and IMROmembers, and on recognition of PIA for members of FIMBRA, LAUTRO andSIBRO;* to set up separate contribution arrangements for SFA, IMRO and, ifrecognised, PIA, with a cap of #100 million for each SRO;* to treat SIBRO firms as belonging to the relevant SRO forcompensation purposes;* to continue with a unitary scheme, administered, as now, by ICS, withseparate SRO funds;* to change the basis for allocating management costs to an activity-related basis, as far as possible;* to give SROs increased control over, and responsibility for, lookingafter their own arrangements for financing their own compensationliabilities.Cross-contributionThere was unanimous support for the proposed ending of cross-contribution and the SIB proposes to set up separate contributionarrangements for individual SROs, with no cross contribution betweenthem. However, there was concern about the proposal that there shouldbe caps of #100 million for each of SFA, IMRO and PIA.The fact that an SRO has a cap of #100 million does not necessarilymean that it has to levy the full #100 million on its membership in anyone year. It would be open to an SRO to avoid having to do this byborrowing on its own credit.Treatment of "SIBRO" firmsThe ending of cross-contribution raises the question of how SIBRO firmsshould be treated. The SIB last year indicated its preference thatdirect regulation should be available only as a last resort. TheDiscussion Paper proposed that, instead of remaining a separateconstituency with its own cap, SIBRO firms should be treated, forcompensation purposes, as belonging to the relevant SRO.This was the only other proposal in the Discussion Paper which arousedsignificant comment. Concern related to: the inappropriateness ofbreaking the link between compensation and regulation; the requirementin s54(3) that so far as practicable an SRO's contribution to ICSshould reflect claims experience in its own constituency; and thepracticalities of identifying the appropriate SRO.However, the SIB did not find these arguments persuasive and remainsconvinced that the original proposal is the most appropriate wayforward. Rather than breaking the link between compensation andregulation, the SIB sees the proposed approach as emphasising the valueof community of interest as between investment firms in the threeeventual groups (SFA, IIRO and PIA) in effective regulation. Apart fromSIBRO members who are applicants for membership of a SRO, who will betreated as belonging to that SRO's group, the presumption is that therelevant SRO will be PIA (if recognised) unless a firm is predominantlyengaged in dealing (in which case, it will be SFA) or managing (inwhich case, it will be IMRO).Separate SRO fundsor separate schemes?There was very little support for the idea of entirely separate SROschemes, each with their own administration. Accordingly, the SIBproposes to proceed on the basis of a unitary scheme, administered byICS, but with separate SRO funds.Management costsThe SIB proposes that the first #300,000 of management costs should betreated as fixed costs and that these should be divided equally betweenSROs. The SIB proposes that the variable costs element should beallocated on an experience-related basis according to a 3-year rollingindex which takes account of the number of defaults occurring in eachconstituency and the number of claims related to each constituencyhandled by the Scheme in that three-year period.Methods of financingSRO members' liabilitiesUnder the present arrangements, SROs are given the status ofadministrators of the Scheme for the purpose of the levy procedureonly. In other respects, they act as agents of ICS and it is the SROmembers, rather than the SRO, which owe the liability to the Scheme.The SIB proposes to change the rules so that the SROs will beconstituted as the administrators of the Scheme for the purposes ofraising the amount required - whether by levy or otherwise - from theirmembers. The initial liability to pay ICS will thus fall on theindividual SRO, but ICS will retain a right over the SRO's members inthe event of a failure by the SRO to pay or collect and pay over thesums due to ICS.The SIB also proposes to enable an SRO to defer - at least, in part -its members' obligation to pay for compensation liabilities by means ofborrowing.Representations in respect of the proposals should reach the SIB byMarch 25 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994On March 1 1994, The Traded Securities (Disclosure) Regulations 1994came into force, to give effect to Article 7 of the EuropeanCommunity's Council Directive (89/592/EEC) of November 13 1989 whichsought to co-ordinate regulations on insider dealing.Article 7 requires that:"all companies and undertakings, the transferable securities of whichare, whatever their nature, admitted to trading on a market which isregulated and supervised by bodies recognised by public bodies,operates regularly and is accessible directly or indirectly to thepublic, should be under an obligation to inform the public as soon aspossible of any major new developments in the issuer's sphere ofactivity which are not public knowledge and which may, by virtue oftheir effect on the issuer's assets and liabilities or financialposition or on the general course of its business, lead to substantialmovements in the price of the securities admitted to trading".The regulations stipulate that the above will apply to securitiestraded on any regulated market in the United Kingdom, except where therecognised investment exchange, which regulates and supervises theregulated market on which an issuer's securities are admitted totrading, exempts the issuer from this obligation.  It may do so ifsatisfied that the disclosure of the particular information wouldprejudice the legitimate interests of that issuer.The regulations go on to state that in the event of failure on the partof an issuer to comply with such disclosure of information, the rulesof the recognised investment exchange (on which those securities aretraded) must:* discontinue the admission of the securities to trading; and/or* suspend trading in the securities; and/or* publish the fact that the issuer has failed to comply with theobligation; and/or* itself make public any information which the issuer has failed topublish.The Regulations thus impose important reporting requirements on issuersof securities traded on regulated markets, although those listed on theStock Exchange are already subject to similar rules set out in Chapter9 of the Yellow Book entitled - Continuing Obligations.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAWOn December 27 1993, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance (MoF)notified banks that there was no need to refrain from entering intoclose-out netting agreements. It was said that the MoF had consultedwith the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the MoJ had come to theconclusion that close-out netting provisions would be held valid in theexisting framework under the Bankruptcy Act, the CorporateRehabilitation Act and the Civil Code. Strictly speaking, however, eventhough Japanese banks are now allowed to enter into close-out nettingagreements with foreign counterparts, the question of validity willultimately have to be decided by the Japanese courts, this point beingacknowledged by both ministries.There has been some substantial discussion among Japanese lawyers onthis issue. The main question appears to be whether a contractualagreement entered into with a view to setting off, under certaincircumstances such as insolvency of one party, debts which are not dueand payable and are denominated in different currencies will be heldvalid under the Japanese insolvency law. Two main points at issue are:* whether a set-off will work on a cross-currency basis (the "currencypoint"); and* whether an agreement to set-off debts which are not due and payablewill stand under the Japanese insolvency law (the "timing point").As to the currency point, Article 403 of the Civil Code provides:"Any debt denominated in a foreign currency may be paid by the debtorin Japanese currency, the amount of which shall be determined inaccordance with the exchange rate available in the place of payment."There is also a rule established in a Supreme Court decision that, inconnection with a debt denominated in a foreign currency, the creditor(not the debtor) may require the debtor to pay in Japanese currency.The combined effect of these is that one of the parties to a swapagreement will be able to convert all the outstanding foreign currencydebts into those in Japanese currency, thus enabling such party toeffect set-off as if they were in the same currency. Since this happensby operation of law, it is argued that there is no reason why anagreement to set-off on a cross-currency basis should be held invalidunder Japanese law.As regards the timing point, there is a well established Supreme Courtauthority which states that an agreement made between a bank and acustomer to set-off debts which are not due and payable will defeat theclaim of the customer's creditor who obtains a garnishee order over adeposit which the customer has made with the bank. It is generallyunderstood that the above rule will apply where a liquidator isappointed for the customer.On the basis of these observations, there does not appear to be anydifficulty in affirming the validity of a close-out netting agreementunder the Japanese insolvency law. Such an argument has been advancedby a leading academic lawyer in Japan and it appears that there hasbeen an implicit consensus of opinion on these lines among Japaneselawyers.Insofar as there are remaining objections, they are likely to relate tothe argument that, while a right to convert currencies is availableunder ordinary circumstances, it would be quite another matter for itto be available in an insolvency situation. The reason behind this isthat to allow creditors who have multi-currency mutual debts toexercise such a right in an insolvency situation, would give themfurther priority over those creditors who do not have such a right,such as depositors (although the contrary argument can be that sincethe right of set-off is firmly established and those creditors having aright of set-off are given priority over other creditors, it will beregarded as a relatively minor step to expand the scope to multi-currency mutual debts). Another problem with the above argument isthat, since the argument is based on Article 403 of the Civil Code,there is some uncertainty as to a close-out netting agreement embodiedin a contract governed by a legal system other than Japanese law.It should be noted that the Supreme Court decision referred to withrespect to the timing point took a substantial approach, in which it isconsidered that the majority opinion upheld the validity of contractualset-off against the claim of the garnisher on the basis that such afunction of set-off would enhance convenience in trading and be ofbenefit to society as a whole. Although the said Supreme Court decisiondealt only with the timing point, the basic idea may well apply to thecurrency point. Such a consideration would probably strengthen theconclusion reached by Japanese lawyers and would be useful to overcomethe difficulties pointed out above.It is worth noting that in the Supreme Court decision referred toabove, one of the respected judges added, that if such a right ofcontractual set-off was widely acknowledged in a business community,its validity should be upheld in that business community. It isinteresting that the judge intimated that there could be a speciallegal system which would govern a business community. Such an idea hasnot been discussed in detail among Japanese lawyers, but would beuseful in this context.If there is any concern about upholding the validity of close-outnetting, it would be that creditors will be able to erode the principleof pari passu distribution easily by an agreement with the debtor.According to the above intimation, however, the validity of close-outnetting will be limited to financial institutions active in the market(if "business community" may be translated as "market"). It is truethat to protect those financial institutions in such manner would havea negative impact on other creditors (such as depositors) when afinancial institution goes into liquidation. However, other creditors(in particular, depositors) would be protected more properly by thecapital adequacy requirements, the deposit insurance scheme and otherregulatory measures.Although it may still be arguable as to how the validity of close-outnetting should be substantiated, it must be emphasised that almost alllawyers (including the officials of the MoF and the MoJ) who havefocused on this issue recently have come to the conclusion that a close-out netting agreement should stand up under Japanese insolvency law. Inorder to minimise or even remove the risk, however, it is advisablethat some steps should be taken, which now appear to be possible asJapanese lawyers have almost reached a consensus. It may be consideredthat some relevant institution should formalise the Japanese position,but it is questionable whether there is any institution which wouldperform such a function. More importantly, the Japanese courts, as amatter of policy, resist being influenced by outside opinions. In sucha judicial climate as exists in Japan, it will probably be moreappropriate to introduce recognition of close-out netting bylegislation.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARYThe Ministry of Finance (MoF) has selected Asahi Bank as the first citybank to establish a securities subsidiary. Asahi will be permitted toopen its subsidiary for business from July this year. Under theFinancial System Reform Act, enacted last April, the MoF removed theoriginal firewalls between commercial banking, trust banking andsecurities industries.Last July, Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-term Credit Bank ofJapan and Norinchurkin Bank set up securities subsidiaries. However,the MoF delayed the establishment of subsidiaries by city banks becauseof strong opposition from the securities industry. The city banks arefeared for their large financial resources, great influence over manyindustries and highly trained staff. Because of these fears the MoF hasrestricted the activities of bank subsidiaries to dealing andunderwriting bonds.From the existing 11 city banks:In July:Asahi bank has the green light to commence securities operationsthrough a subsidiary.In November:Six other city banks will commence securities business. Dai-Ichi KangyoBank, Mitsubishi Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Sakura Bank and SanwaBank.In March 1995:In the near future the MoF is expected to approve this date as theentry point for Tokai Bank and Takushoku Bank to the securitiesbusiness.Of the two remaining city banks, Daiwa Bank took over its securitiessubsidiary "Cosmo Securities" last August in a rescue bid. Finally, theBank of Tokyo has no immediate plans to enter the securities business.The MoF announced that it deliberately spread out the entry times sothat the securities industry would not be too disrupted by theentrants. According to the MoF, by the end of January 1994, thesubsidiaries had underwritten approximately Y50 billion worth ofdomestic corporate straight bonds, approximately Y3 billion worth ofdomestic convertible bonds and some Y50 billion of overseas bonds.Last month Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank came to the rescue of KankakuSecurities by extending subordinated loans of Y70 billion. The twofirms already have close ties but Kankaku stated that it has nointention of becoming a subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as a resultof the rescue. In the case of Daiwa Bank's bailout of Cosmo Securitieslast August, Cosmo issued new shares that were bought by Daiwa, makingthe securities firm its subsidiary.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994MORE INFORMATION ON PAYOUT POLICIES URGEDIn a move designed to support shareholders' rights the Tokyo StockExchange (TSE) is urging companies to provide more detailed informationon their dividend payment policies.

So far 65city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, life and non-lifeinsurers have used the CCPC to liquidate troubled debts. The number offinancial institutions using the CCPC is likely to rise in March 1994,when many companies end their financial year. Estimates of the value ofbad debts that will be sold to the CCPC in March are put in excess ofY1 trillion.The banks sell bad debts to the CCPC at a discount, then charge theloss against their profits, so cutting their tax bills. The CCPC isthen supposed to liquidate the loans by selling the underlyingcollateral to private investors. So far it has only been able to sellY17 billion of collateral, due to weak demand for real estate. Incontrast the CCPC has bought Y1.33 trillion worth of bad debts with aface value of Y2.86 trillion.In the 1993/94 financial year the Ministry of Finance (MoF) restrainedthe sales of bad loans to the CCPC, to avoid large tax losses. Thispolicy has now changed and the MoF wants to accelerate the banks' write-offs dramatically. The goal of the MoF is to strengthen banks' balancesheets in the face of unprecedented enormous bad debts.Banks' property sales to the CCPC              No. of     Face value     Discount     Loss borne             properties     Y bn        to book %    by banks Y bn1993March          229          681.7        33.7           229.6April            1            0.1        20.0             0.02May              9           10.0        33.0             3.3June            12           24.3        27.5             6.7July            14           64.2        59.3            38.1August          60          130.8        49.0            64.1September      414          954.7        49.1           469.0October         16           54.1        45.8            24.8November        19           51.4        60.7            31.2December       116          231.2        54.6           126.21994January        103          187.6        47.3           88.8February       226          467.0        54.2           253.1Total         1219         2857.1        46.7          1334.92Source: James CapelBack to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994LISTING RULES TO EFFECT RESTRICTIONS ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONSThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange has announced that changes to the ListingRules have been approved, which prohibit multiple applications forpublic offerings of securities and which should limit the occurrence ofundetected multiple applications.

It has invited comments on thepaper by April 22 and expects the strategic plan to be publicised inmid-1994.The consultative paper summarises discussions that have been held withmarket participants of issues facing the market and possible waysforward. It also indicates the Exchange's response to each of theproposals, which ranges from specific measures, through invitingfurther suggestions, to stating that it does not intend to take theproposals further. The list of market participants with whom theExchange held discussions includes as well as issuers, stock brokersand fund managers, a wide range of interested bodies and individualssuch as The Hong Kong Association of Banks, The Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, The Hong Kong Society of Accountants, academics andinformation providers. The stated purpose of the paper is to get anindication of the market's general views. If the market shows supportfor a particular course of action, the Exchange may conduct a separatemore detailed consultation at a later stage.The main emphasis of the consultative paper is on identifying ways inwhich the Hong Kong's stock market can maintain its competitiveness inan international context, as well as facilitating its role as a sourceof international funds for the continued economic expansion in China.The paper identifies certain key issues which are facing the Exchange:* the maturity of the Hong Kong market in terms of domestic listingsand the need therefore to attract more listings of overseas companiesin order to maintain growth;* the significance of overseas investors to the recent growth in theAsian markets and the need to maintain and promote this interest;* the importance of China's economic development to the future of theExchange and the role the Exchange can play in helping to fund thatdevelopment;* the increasing demand for sophisticated derivative products for riskmanagement purposes or as trading vehicles;* the need to be up-to-date in the secondary market in terms of marketautomation, to facilitate higher trading volumes and meet theincreasingly complex demands of investors;* the competition from other Asian exchanges, and the need to stayahead or at least equal with their development of derivative productsand automated dealing systems; and* the need to promote the growth of the bond market in Hong Kong,possibly as an alternative means of raising funds for Chinese companiesrather than equity issues.Recurring themes in the consultative paper are the need to provide amarket that has the highest level of transparency and efficiency andthe need for a market which attracts investor attention. In thisrespect, the Exchange believes that the emphasis must now be on an"international" rather than local solution, as had been the case in thepast.The consultative paper outlines options for the development of theExchange which should meet the stated aims of transparency, efficiencyand international competitiveness.Some of the options involve building on existing developments. Theseinclude the introduction last year of the Automatic Order Matching andExecution System (AMS) and the first direct listings of Chinaincorporated enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as the ongoingdevelopment of a traded options market, expected to be launched inearly 1995, and improvements to the debt listing regime.Other options involve establishing a new direction for the Exchange aspart of the search for international solutions. New developments whichthe Exchange is considering further include:* re-orientating the Listing Rules of the primary market towards theinternational arena by basing them on a listing philosophy similar tothe US, which would rely on extensive disclosure and self-regulation byissuers and financial advisors, backed by strong sanctions against non-compliance;* relaxing the rules that require overseas entities to provideshareholders with the same standard of legal protection as under HongKong law. It is suggested that the US approach of requiring compliancewith the overseas entity's domestic corporate governance regime butwith the US accounting disclosure and accounting requirements would beattractive to overseas entities;* strengthening the corporate governance regime for listed companies,for example by making audit committees and properly qualified financedirectors and company secretaries mandatory;* improving the current disclosure requirements, such as requiring moredetail in the annual report, involving the auditors in interimannouncements and requiring annual asset valuations in the accounts;* establishing a formal regime for the regulation of sponsors andfinancial advisors, which may be backed by legislation;* including members' internal control systems in the Exchange'sinspection programmes and considering whether further measures arenecessary to improve members' internal control systems;* improving the automation of the market and considering thepossibility of off-floor trading;* improving the provision of real-time trading information to themarket and developing a "quality of market" function to monitor andfacilitate improvement in market transparency on a more formal basis;* introducing appropriate training programmes and allowing theinterface of AMS terminals with members' in house systems to facilitatethe development of sophisticated trading strategies in the secondarymarket;* extending the trading hours of the market which may allow a shortover-lap with the start of trading in London;* reforming the current disclosure regime arising from the Securities(Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance, which is thought to be onerous insome respects and inadequate in others;* increasing the current requirements for the minimum public float ofsecurities in a listed issuer and improving monitoring procedures;* abolishing the board lot system and the rules for spreads, inconjunction with the full immobilization or de-materialization of sharecertificates;* dissolving the Fidelity Fund or merging it with the clearing house'sguarantee funds and increasing the size of the maximum payment ofcompensation by the Compensation Fund in the case of member defaults;* considering the appropriateness of penalties for misconduct and thefeasibility of establishing arbitration facilities for disputes betweenmembers and between members and their clients;* enabling listed issuers to include their repurchased shares in theirbalance sheets as treasury stock held for subsequent re-sale; and* reviewing the relationship between the Exchange and the Securitiesand Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to ensuregreater co-ordination of responsibilities and resources andconsolidation of the different statutory instruments and non-statutorycodes covering the securities market.In addition, the paper identifies areas where improvements or newmeasures might be welcome and the Exchange specifically invitessuggestions for future developments in these areas. They include:* developing listed Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chipcompanies; and* measures, beyond those for streamlining the listing process currentlybeing considered by the Exchange, to develop the bond market further.The paper identifies three proposals which the Exchange does not intendto take any further. These are marketmaking for stocks, introducing asecond-tier board for smaller companies which do not meet the fullListing Rules requirements and introducing a trading-only board, withno compliance requirements for the issuers concerned.Although in the Foreword to the consultative paper the Exchangestresses that these are tentative proposals which are open to commentat this stage, in the body of the paper the Exchange identifies thedirection of the strategy for the years to 1997 and beyond. Thisdirection is focused on attracting overseas issuers and investors,possibly by moving towards a US style disclosure-based regulatoryregime, and increasing the role of automation and sophisticatedproducts in the secondary markets. Press response in Hong Kong to theproposals has been favourable, although doubts have been raised as tothe feasibility of introducing a US style disclosure regime in the nextthree to five years, and the appropriateness of such a regime, whichwould include reduced vetting by the Exchange, for new issues in HongKong.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE"A joint approach to the supervision of "bancassurance" in the EuropeanUnion is still a far way off. While there is agreement on some basicprinciples such as the need for transparency of group structures, theexchange of information, the role of auditors and the monitoring ofintra-group exposures, the main point of contention remains thequestion of group surveillance of capital.Consolidation would be the "natural" tendency of bank supervisors;however, it has not been conclusively shown that this method isadaptable for the control of insurance groups. Insurance supervisorspropose the "solo-plus" approach, whereby pure solo supervision of eachof the components of a group is extended to include elements of group-wide risk assessment. The issue was the subject of a "jumbo" meeting ofEU finance supervisors in Brussels on February 23, and discussed duringa seminar held at the Central for European Policy Studies (CEPS) onMarch 15.Financial conglomerates are defined as "group of companies withspecific control relationships or under joint management, and whoseactivities consist largely or exclusively of providing services in atleast two of the following financial sectors: banking, securities,insurance." This refers in practice to many different structures: theycan be horizontal or vertical, headed by a supervised or unsupervisedentity, which may be a financial or a mixed-activity holding. Accordingto recent data, there are more than 200 financial conglomerates in theEU. Some Member States already allow consolidated accounts ofconglomerates, although it is far from clear whether this would bepermitted under EC legislation.While the European Commission does not want to stop the development offinancial conglomerates, which they see as a source of strength for theUnion's financial services sector, Member States' supervisoryauthorities disagree on the way to control the capital adequacy of suchconglomerates at the group level. Different regulatory rules and testsare applied at national and Community level, and wide variations existin the accounting treatment. There is however agreement on two basicpropositions, as Patrick Pearson of the Commission's DG XV said at theCEPS seminar: all solo supervisors should monitor the full risks of theconglomerate; and sufficient capital should be appropriatelydistributed and available in the group to cover risks.Some "easier" issues regarding financial conglomerates have alreadybeen dealt with in the draft BCCI follow-up Directive. This proposalsets a 20 per cent participation as the threshold for the inclusion ofa company in a group. It requires group structures to be transparentand says that the head office should be in the same Member States asthe registered office. It furthermore requires auditors to providerelevant information to the supervisory authorities. However, thedefinition of groups was criticized at the CEPS seminar by an industryrepresentative as an example of excessive regulation, and it wasquestioned whether reporting obligations could be strengthened by law.But there was agreement that further efforts should be undertaken tolower the obstacles to the exchange of information among supervisoryauthorities, and that a lead supervisor should be designated for thecontrol of conglomerates. Reference was in this respect made to the"protocol" model applied by the Dutch authorities.On the matter of how best to tackle the most striking problem in thecontrol of financial conglomerates, the prevention of double gearing,the opinions of regulators diverge. Double gearing is the double use ofregulatory capital in the different entities of the group. Banking andinvestment firms supervisors would adopt consolidated supervision totackle this problem, but it is not obvious that this is the method toapply to control bancassurance groups, since it is not proven that thecapital requirement for both parts is identical. The way therefore todeal with double gearing in the immediate future is the automaticdeduction of participations, or the deduction of a minimum solvencymargin. However, automatic deduction is not required under the EUbanking and insurance Directives.Other prudential concerns should also be dealt with in the near future.Capital requirements can be circumvented through the use of unregulatedentities, such as leasing and factoring firms. In the other direction,the holding company controlling the group can be used to distort thecapital standards. The latter problem was partly addressed in theamendments to the consolidated supervision Directive (92/30). However,it thereby only applies to financial holding companies, controllingcredit institutions, and it does not include mixed-activity holdingcompanies nor insurance companies in the consolidation. One proposal isto introduce "fit and proper" criteria for the shareholders of aholding company, but it remains to be seen whether this is feasible. Afurther problem is "incestuous capitalisation", whereby own fundselements are purchased by other intra- or extra-group entities, apractice which cannot be prohibited by regulators. Limits should alsobe set for intra-group loans and large exposures. The latter limitsexist in the banking and investment services sector, but not ininsurance. It might for example bring the banking arm of a conglomerateto place its large exposures within the insurance undertaking.As a medium-term solution, it was proposed that the solo-plus approachshould be adopted, whereby extra elements are added to the solocontrol, namely the exchange of information, the monitoring of intra-group transactions and transparency, and a minimum solvency for theparents' company capital. Banking supervisors will however continue topush for full consolidation. As Jean-Louis Duplat, President of theBelgian Banking & Finance Commission and Vice-Chairman of the EuropeanCommission's Banking Advisory Committee, said: "The solo-plus approachoffers a suitable solution for the time being, . . . the principle ofsupervision on a consolidated basis, completed with aspects of solosupervision, and, if necessary, sub-consolidated per pole (banking andinsurance pole), should be the final objective."Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDSDespite widespread speculation in late February that market volatilitymay have been increased by activities of US hedge funds (in sellingbonds and trading financial derivatives), the central banks governorsdecided at their meeting in early March against any immediate movestowards curbing hedge funds' activities.Hedge funds are not under the direct control of central banks, since,although mainly managed in the US, they are normally based offshore.However, their activities have still caused concern to the regulatorsfor a number of reasons:* their activities appear to have added to market volatility;* heavy losses following unsuccessful speculation (eg on currencymovement) might lead to defaults on loans from banks where a hedge fundis highly geared;* failure to settle a contract could lead to a chain of defaultsoccurring throughout the financial system.Any attempt to increase control over hedge funds would, however,encounter difficulties, whether the chosen approach was one of directregulation or an increase of existing indirect control (via supervisedbanks). Direct regulation would be difficult, since it would need totackle cross-border issues, define "hedge funds" and also try toisolate the particular activities causing concern (given that short-term leverage risk is in itself a common investment strategy). Thealternative of an indirect approach by the central banks would insteadfocus on loans made by supervised banks to hedge funds for the purchaseof assets. Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board arecurrently studying the implications of the ensuing credit riskexposure, in light of the banks' common practice of only holding assetsto the value of the cash lent, with a margin of around 5 per cent orless to cover risks. The concern here is that such margins would not belarge enough to cover sudden changes in hedge funds' positions,particularly given that the credit risk of hedge funds is hard toanalyse, since they are not credit rated, have complex structures andholders may also not provide net asset valuations. Additionally, recentnetting and market risk proposals by international supervisors seemlikely to reduce the requirement for banks to set aside capital againstsuch hedge fund exposures.For the present therefore, the central banks appear happy simply tomonitor the situation, whilst keeping a closer eye on hedge funds'activities. Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman ofthe G-10 governors, summarised this approach, saying:"We are willing to examine closely what is going on with these newtechniques, but we do not think that there is for the time being anyneed for specific regulations. We think we have got to live with thesenew techniques, but will follow closely what is going on."Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe International Accounting Standards Committee ("IASC") has issued arevised proposed International Accounting Standard on financialinstruments (Exposure Draft E48) for comment. This draft results from areconsideration of an earlier proposal (Exposure Draft E40) issued inSeptember 1991.The draft covers the accounting for the disclosure, recognition,measurement and presentation of all types of financial instruments andsets out the proposed treatment for the financial assets and financialliabilities so created, in the accounts of the respective enterprises.A financial instrument in this context is a contract that gives rise toboth a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability orequity instrument of another enterprise. Financial instruments includeboth primary instruments such as cash, receivables and equitysecurities, and secondary or derivative instruments, such as options,futures and forward contracts relating to financial instruments andinterest-rate and currency swaps. Various interests, such as those inassociates and subsidiaries and commodity contracts, were excluded fromE40. The new draft also proposed to exclude from the scope of theStandard insurance contracts and assets held specifically to providefunds for satisfying obligations under insurance contracts.Other significant changes from E40 include:* the criteria for recognising and subsequently discontinuingrecognition of a financial asset or a financial liability now refers tothe transfer of substantially all of the risks and rewards associatedwith the asset or liability;* a legally enforceable right of set-off must exist before a financialasset may be offset against a financial liability and the net amountincluded in the balance sheet;* impaired monetary financial assets and impaired non-monetaryfinancial assets are now treated separately under the Standard ;* hedge accounting is now permitted for price risk exposure whereexpected future positions are highly likely to materialize;* financial instruments that hedge currency (foreign exchange) risk arenow within the scope of the hedge accounting requirements of theStandard.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATYThe coming into force of the European Economic Area (EEA) Treaty onJanuary 1 1994 led to substantial changes in the regulation of manycommercial areas in Norway, including the regulation of financialmarkets.The changes relate both to the implementation in Norway of the generalprinciples of EEA law, like for example non-discrimination of EEAnationals, and the implementation of the various EC Directives relatingto financial markets. There follows an overview of some of the changesrelating to both banking and investment business.BankingThe Norwegian regulations contained various provisions regardingnationality and residence of persons acting as board members of a bankand the founders of a bank. Originally these persons had to beNorwegian nationals and resident in Norway. These requirements havebeen changed to cover persons who are nationals of an EEA state andresident in such a state. The restrictions on foreign ownership ofNorwegian banks remain applicable since Norway can, according to theEEA Treaty, benefit from a transitional period for its investmentcontrols until January 1 1995 when it has to lift its restrictions inrespect of EEA nationals.The various EC Banking Directives have been implemented in Norway,including the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive as a result ofwhich EEA Member State banks may provide services to, and establishbranches in Norway. The services provided for, relate to the taking ofdeposits as well as the services set out in the Annex to the Directive.The relevant regulations open possibilities for the imposition ofvarious rules on these branches to the extent that they are necessaryfor the public good, as provided for in the Directive.The Norwegian regulations in respect of banking activities have alsobeen amended in other respects to comply with the various EC bankingdirectives including regulations in respect of consumer credits andmoney laundering.InvestmentAs far as intermediaries are concerned, the rules now provide anexemption for branches of EEA credit institutions in Norway to conducttheir securities activities through a separate legal entity. Norwegianbanks are under an obligation to organise their securities marketbusiness in a separate legal entity. The activities must also beseparated physically from the other activities of the bank. Branches ofEEA credit institutions do not have to comply with these rules. Thelegislation further provides a basis for the adoption of additionalrequirements on EEA credit institutions offering securities servicesthrough a branch in Norway.In addition, the obligation on Norwegian residents to make purchases offoreign securities through a Norwegian broker has also been amended.The rules now provide that Norwegian residents can buy and sellsecurities which are regularly traded in the EEA without the mediationof a Norwegian securities broker. In addition, these securities nolonger need to be kept in the securities deposit of a Norwegian bank orsecurities broker. Although the exemptions are mainly directed tosecurities traded in EEA member states, the regulations also providethat the exemptions can be made applicable to securities traded instates which have supervisory standards similar to those of the EEA.The listing requirements of the Oslo Stock Exchange have been amendedto comply with the various directives in this field, including therules in connection with the preparation and recognition ofprospectuses. The Norwegian regulations in connection with the offeringof non-listed securities have also been amended.If the securities to be issued have a value of more than 5 millionkrone and the offer is directed to more than 50 persons, then theissuer has to prepare a prospectus which complies with detailedrequirements. The prospectus must be sent to the board of the OsloStock Exchange, where the contents of the prospectus will be checked inorder to ensure that they comply with the relevant regulations. If thesecurities are listed on an EEA stock exchange, a similar prospectusneeds to be prepared if the value of the issue is more than 300,000krone or if the offer is directed to more than 50 persons.Different prospectus requirements apply to issues which are directed tomore than 50 persons and have a value of between 300,000 krone and 5million krone. In such cases, a less elaborate prospectus will need tobe prepared. The prospectus must also be sent to the board of the OsloStock Exchange, however this is for filing purposes only. There are anumber of exemptions to these prospectus requirements which should alsobe considered.In addition, there are more general rules in connection withinvitations to subscribe or the corresponding acquisition of shares inconnection with the incorporation of a company or capital increases,founder shares and bonds with a term of more than 12 months. In suchcases a prospectus must be prepared which complies with some basicrequirements. These rules apply only to the extent that a prospectus isrequired pursuant to, for example, company law or when a prospectus isissued in connection with the issue.The regulations relating to investment institutions have been amendedand now also incorporate the UCITS Directive.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTSSince the beginning of March, options on futures contracts have beenquoted on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time on an"experimental" basis. The wording of a standard contract for theseinstruments is currently being settled by the management committees ofthe "Mif" (Government Bond futures exchange) and by the "Mts" (theGovernment on-screen trading market). It is expected that regulartrading will commence in earnest sometime in April 1994.The underlying instruments will be futures contracts on ten-yearTreasury Bonds (BTp decennali) and will be based on the American model(ie exercisable at any time from the date of purchase to the date ofexercise). There will be nine striking prices, exercisable at fiftybase-point intervals, and the premium will be payable upon maturity ofthe option or upon its exercise.In order to ensure the efficient management of the new instruments, theCassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (the national clearing house) enteredinto a contract last August with the Options Clearing Corporation inChicago for the supply of specialised software which will also be usedfor the other new products which are shortly to be introduced onto themarket, namely three-month Eurolira futures and stock exchange index-linked futures.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SUPER PRIMARY DEALERSIn March, a Decree Law of the Ministry of Treasury introduced a newplayer in the Italian markets namely, the "Super Primary Dealer", whowill operate in both the Italian primary and secondary markets inTreasury Bonds.The "Super Primary Dealer" is a Primary Dealer who is able to satisfycertain strict pre-requisites (in particular, it must have assets worthat least Lit. 75 billion, and have been awarded a market sharecalculated on the basis of a year's trading, equal to at least one percent in respect of each category of bonds and no less than three percent of the of total volume of Treasury Bonds issued on the primarymarket over the same period).

(Lynn Busing, Servantis Systems Inc.,770/840-1434.)Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL SERVICES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUSTING FRAUD     Credit card institutions must be more proactive in their fraud-fighting strategies or risk significant losses from fraud, riskmanagement experts say.      To nip fraud losses in the bud, credit card departments must beon the lookout for current fraud schemes, such as account boosting,account takeover and counterfeit cards, say anti-fraud specialists. Issuers also should implement new procedures and programs for theentire lifetime of an account to prevent these new forms of fraud.       Increased transactions are translating into an uptick in fraudlosses (Visa estimates that for 1994, it had $409 million in fraudlosses in the United States out of $290 billion total sales;MasterCard's fraud figures are believed to be similar to Visa's).  Reactive vs. Proactive     The banking and credit card industries have, historically, hadmore of a "reactive stance" to fraud, taking action only once thecardholder alerts the bank to some fraudulent activity, such as astolen card or a charge-back item on a bill, said one consultant.       The more effective way to keep fraud losses down, however, is toidentify fraud schemes before they reach the individual cardholder. "Don't wait until the cow is out of the barn," advised Larry Hay, vicepresident of risk management at Plainview, N.Y.-based CardholderManagement Services, a firm specializing in card marketing, processingand consulting.     How can you become more proactive instead of reactive aboutfraud?  Consider these strategies, offered by credit card fraudexperts:Beware of Account Boosting     Card executives need to be attuned to every kind of new fraudscheme because they're faddish -- one form of fraud may be populartoday and virtually non-existent tomorrow, card industry observerssay.  Fraud schemes change frequently as law enforcement groups, card associations and financialinstitutions devote attention to one type.  Subsequently, criminalswill look for new methods.     Visa has begun to alert its member institutions about "accountboosting," a scheme where criminals obtain legitimate credit cards,accrue balances, then send issuers, via overnight courier services,stolen or counterfeit checks that exceed the balance amount, "boosting" the account's credit line. Federal law requires banks to post credit payments before checksclear, so, the next day, the fraud perpetrators go to an automatedteller machine (ATM) and withdraw the excess amount on that cardaccount and the check later bounces.     Visa has been helping the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) track down one large accountboosting case in Los Angeles, which resulted in 41 arrests recently,said Allan Trosclair, vice president of fraud control for Visa.       Some account-boosting cases also are being linked to bankruptcyfraud -- individuals accrue massive card debt knowing they will filefor bankruptcy and have no intention of repaying the card debt.  TIP:  Card executives should be wary of any payments coming in throughovernight services, Trosclair warned.  They also should watch forlarge payments or payments that exceed what a cardholder owes.       "If I send in a $6,000 check, and my credit limit is only $5,000,there's something wrong," he said.  Banks may also want to monitor forbankruptcy fraud behavior, by keeping track of accounts that suddenlyhave high purchase volumes or uncharacteristically extravagantpurchases.  "There are several systems available which develop aprofile of normal purchasing activity of an individual cardholder andwhen that [behavior] is severely changed and warrants some attention,"said Hay.  Prevent Account Takeovers     MasterCard has been alerting its member institutions to watch foran increase in "account takeover" fraud in which a criminal obtains acardholder's basic information (address, phone number, accountnumber), sometimes through old receipts, records or by stealing thereal cardholder's mail.       The criminal calls the card issuer, assuming the cardholder'sidentity, and requests that a new card and personal identificationnumber (PIN) be sent to a new address because the card was lost orstolen and the cardholder has moved.  "What happens is that the [real]cardholder may not get a statement for a couple of months, thecriminal may pay off the minimum balance [to avoid detection] and thenstart [using the card]," said Nancy Elder, a MasterCard spokesperson.TIP:  To reduce account takeover fraud, issuers can include a three-digit code, determined by the bank, on the back of a credit card nextto the account number.       Account representatives should be trained to be suspicious forthe three characteristics of account takeover:  a request for a newcard, a new PIN and a change of address.  Representatives should askfor the three-digit code.  "If they say they don't have the card onthem, respond by saying 'call us back when you have the card inhand,'" said Elder.Use Technology, Training To Stop Fakes    Issuers also must be alert for another kind of fraud: counterfeit cards.  These illegal products declined in the early 1990swith the advent of the hologram; however, fake cards recently havegained in popularity as holograms have become easier to replicate,according to James Steel, regional vice president of security and riskmanagement at MasterCard.      To prevent more counterfeit card fraud, both MasterCard and Visahave implanted secret card validation algorithms in each card'smagnetic stripe.  MasterCard calls it a card validation code (CVC) andVisa calls it a card verification value (CVV).      When a merchant swipes the card through an authorizationterminal, the code enables the issuer to detect if there has been anyalteration of the stripe, and if so, to deny authorization for thetransaction.      An increasing number of transactions, however, are suspectable tocounterfeit card fraud because of purchases made at retail locationsthat don't have on-line authorization terminals, or by telephone wherecards cannot be checked.TIP:  One of the best ways to reduce counterfeit card usage is toensure that merchants are adequately trained in counterfeit carddetection, fraud experts say.      MasterCard's Holiday Fraud Prevention Seminar Program, forexample, helps merchants understand different types of credit cardcrime by touring U.S. malls and educating merchants.  Acquiringinstitutions also should require that their merchants offer trainingto telephone operators, clerks and sales associates to help them learnhow to detect credit card fraud schemes.Implement a Review Policy    Issuers can use proactive strategies even after the fraud hasoccurred by having a purposeful chargeback review methodology, saidHay of Cardholder Management Services.  TIP:  Review a charged-off account for improper authorization codesand irregular activities, such as major purchases.      Improper authorization codes may indicate merchant collusion,experts say. Irregular activities also may offer leads to criminals --a purchase of a piece of furniture, for example, may have an addresswhere the furniture was delivered.

The system also allowed the bank to more than double the numberof random interest rate scenarios it can create and reduced the timeneeded to meet regulatory reporting requirements, Bancorp executivessay.    Asset/liability management software uses computer simulationsunder random rate scenarios to monitor interest rate sensitivity,liquidity position and capital adequacy.  Although such services areoffered by banks as part of their corporate services package, somelarge companies have purchased asset/liability software for in-housetreasury management, consultants say.    However, treasurers largely have shown lukewarm interest in thesoftware as systems can be costly, tough to maintain and difficult touse, consultants note.System Reduces Analysis Cycle    Bancorp installed RADAR, a UNIX-based asset/liability managementapplication from Risk Management Technologies Inc., of Berkeley,Calif.    RADAR simulates up to 100 randomly generated, interest ratescenarios and presents a statistical and graphical view of eachpotential outcome.  Companies can use this data to look at statisticalprobabilities and begin to generate strategies for the best balancesheet mix.    The system also analyzes product risks.  For example, banks canuse the system to look at commercial lending across their subsidiariesand provide information to various business managers on optimal feestructures and interest rates, explained Rick Simpson, asset/liabilitymanager at Bancorp.    In addition, RADAR reduced by two weeks Bancorp's time needed toconduct rate analysis and issue reports for different business lines. "Today we are performing the same reporting in two weeks, which givesus the second half of the month to [plan] how to use the information,"Simpson explained.    Although Bancorp hasn't calculated the interest rate savingsRADAR has provided, trimming just one basis point on the spreadbetween assets and liabilities means an additional $1.8 million to thecorporation, he noted.    Bancorp also can run a full balance sheet analysis for one of itsbanking concerns in two minutes.  Simpson estimated it takes a fewhours for the bank to run a hundred different scenarios.     RADAR uses RAM-resident, interactive modeling and supports bothvalue-at-risk (VAR) and risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)analytical approaches.Software Not a Hit with Corporations    Sumitomo Bank Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, the world's fourth largestbank, plans to implement a RADAR system for asset-liabilitymanagement, interest rate risk management, transfer pricing, strategicand product planning and product and customer-service performancemanagement, its executives say.      Sumitomo will create a bank-wide data warehouse for use by thesystem.    National Computer Systems of Minneapolis offers DataWriter,another software application for asset/liability management.      The Windows-based system generates detailed reports on any aspectof an asset management operation, including specialized assetmanagement.  Treasurers can use DataWriter to produce multiple reportssimultaneously.     In addition, the system allows treasurers to use point-and-clickfeatures to define data and maintain libraries for storing andindexing reports.    Asset/liability software is not widely used by corporate treasurymanagers, notes consultant Jim Sagner of Sagner-Marks in West Orange,N.J.      "Even the most popular software which does account analysis hasbeen purchased by only a few corporations.  Many of them use theirsystems just once or twice a year, and probably are sorry they spentthe money," he said.    Most treasurers use asset/liability software provided by banks aspart of their information systems and balancing and reportingservices, Sagner said.  He believes treasurers are reluctant to buycustom asset/liability systems because banks are providing adequateservices at competitive prices.  "Banks usually cut deals on theseservices to win other business with corporations," he explained.    However, only banks with sophisticated treasury workstationproducts offer asset/liability services as part of their standardsoftware package for corporations, notes Henry Waszkowski, head oftreasury consulting at Wachovia Corp. in Atlanta.  The packagesgenerally feature debt modules, funds need forecasting and investmentmodules, which do little analysis, Waszkowski said.      He said corporations often have to buy asset/liability modulesfrom vendors to implement on existing treasury workstations.  Manyother companies gather rate forecasting information from consultingfirms or by polling banks they do business with and subscribing toeconomic services, Waszkowski noted.    "Full-blown" workstations that include asset/liability managementsoftware make the most financial sense for corporations with more than$1 billion in sales annually and operations expanding overseas,Waszkowski said. Treasurers Scared Off by Price of Software    Sagner said another reason asset/liability software gets alukewarm reception from corporations is that treasurers are afraidvendors won't be able to provide long-term support for the systems. He also believes treasurers are turned off by the $10,000 to more than$100,000 price tag for the software.      "The little bit of money treasurers have as discretionary budgetis used for industry conferences or visits to vendor or bank sites,"he noted.    Sagner recommended treasurers avoid asset/liability systems thatare not bank-supported.  Otherwise, there is a chance that thesoftware vendor will go out of business and its system will becomeobsolete and tough to maintain.    TIP:  If you are keen on buying custom software, get a handle onvendorinstallation costs, which inflate greatly the price of off-the-shelfsoftware.Look for Flexible Asset/Liability Software    Jeffrey Wallace of Greenwich Treasury Advisors in Greenwich,Conn., suggests treasurers also avoid asset/liability systems that usestatic gapping models, which compute debt-equity ratios withoutfactoring in the yield curve.  "The real issue is how the yield curveimpacts bucket limits," Wallace said.    "[Treasurers] won't care if they are long on the three-month sideand short on the six-month side if the yield curve is relativelyflat," he said.  "But if the curve is inverted, they might beconcerned about their gap restrictions."     Wallace suggested treasurers look for asset/liability softwaremanagement software that allows them to simulate a variety of interestrate scenarios.    TIP:  Keep in mind that PC-based asset/liability packages arelimited by the PC's processing capacity, memory and storage capacity. To compensate, they use aggregated data, which is not as accurate,Simpson cautioned.

Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL SERVICES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996MECA SOFTWARE GAINS MORE FINANCIAL BACKERS    Banks looking to support personal financial management (PFM)software may have to consider another major player.    Competition in the PFM software business continued to heat uplast week as three new bank-investors pledged their moneys toFairfield, Conn.-based Meca Software's Managing Your Money PFMproduct.     FirstBank Systems, Fleet Financial Services and the Royal Bank ofCanada all bought stakes in Meca, which is co-owned by San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp..  Each of the fiveinstitutions will own a 20-percent share of Meca.     The five Meca partners have a combined customer base of more than40 million customers and represent more than $655 billion in assets,giving Meca -- whose software is used by more than 600,000 consumersand small businesses in North America -- a significant competitiveboost, industry analysts say.     However, some banks do not believe the Meca partners will be ableto work together and create a competitive product.     The overwhelming market leader for PFM software, with more than 8million copies sold, is Intuit's Quicken.  Microsoft's Money PFMproduct -- launched earlier this year -- is a distant third to Meca.PFM Maneuvering     The Meca deal continues a six-month trend, which has seen PFMmanufacturers aggressively seeking out bank partners to offer on-linehome banking.  Both Microsoft and Intuit have struck agreements withmore than 19 banks across the United States.  Many of theseinstitutions including Chemical Bank, CoreStates Bank and Wells FargoBank will offer both Money and Quicken to its customers.Advantages     Meca's owners said the deal gives them an advantage in the PFMmarketplace over the Microsoft and Intuit banks because institutionsnow can customize their PFM software packages.  Minneapolis-basedFirstBank, Providence, R.I.-based Fleet and Royal Bank of Toronto allwill create a branded Managing Your Money product with differentfunctionality.     "This investment will enable Fleet to develop its own branded PC[personal computer] product, designed to meet the specific needs ofour customers while providing them convenience and privacy," saidMichael R. Zucchini, vice chairman and chief technology officer atFleet.     Fleet's version of Managing Your Money will provide Fleetcustomers with an on-line link to open accounts, check and transferbalances, apply for loans, track their investments and buy stocks andmutual funds.Avoiding Conflict     Meca critics question whether the five large institutions canagree on one software product.       "I just don't see why these banks, who compete against eachother, would want to join forces," said one Southeast banker.  "Theegos of the executives at these large institutions are bound to causeproblems."     However, allowing each bank to customize may allow Meca tosidestep any controversy.     "I don't see a lot of potential conflict," said Stu Bloom, apartner at the Hackensack, N.J.-based consultancy, Carmody & Bloom. "Banks are going to do what banks do -- offer basic financial productsto their customers.  There should be no great conflict in what will bedeveloped."     Royal Bank of Canada will use Meca to launch a PC computerbanking system.  Its customers will connect directly to the bank'shost computer to pay bills, receive account balances, transfer fundsand access account information.  Royal will roll out Managing YourMoney nationally in late 1996 to its 10 million customers at more than1,600 branches, according to Royal Bank officials.The Future    Industry analysts expect the strategical maneuvering of PFMsoftware providers to continue throughout 1996.    In fact, Intuit recently announced its plans to provide on-linebanking over the Internet.  This is a change from its recent strategyof signing up financial institutions.    Intuit said it is developing a direct connection to the Internetthat will allow consumers to pay bills, check account balances andtransfer funds over the Internet.  Banks working with Intuit will havethe choice of offering customers Internet banking or banking solelythrough Quicken.  PFM Landscape    The Intuit decision earlier this week proves that the PFMlandscape is changing on a daily basis.      PFM manufacturers will most likely continue to strike deals withfinancial institutions.      However, do not expect banks to support solely one PFM product. Industry watchers believe banks want to offer their customers the most  choice  and   will   offer any  alternatives on the marketplace.      "It wouldn't be surprising for a bank to take an open systemsapproach to these types of [PFM products]," said Bloom.  "In someways, it would be advantageous.  It won't surprise me [if some Mecainstitutions offer Quicken or Money] even though they have taken anequity position in Meca."

It also claims to be the only bank to fully exploit theopportunity to initiate true interstate banking.     "We have installed a common lockbox image platform at all of ourbanks which gives our customers the same consistent functionality,"said Julie Stephens, product manager at the $56 billion asset-bank.     A common platform allows First Interstate to offer same-dayautomated clearing house settlement (ACH) across its Western stateaffiliates or same-day cash concentration for customers who requireseparate accounts, officials say.     The bank's image-retail lockbox provides customers withstreamlined workflow, higher quality processing and improved customerservice, she said.       In addition, the system includes intelligentcharacter recognition (ICR), which allows matching payments andcoupons to be read by the system and processed without keying.  Thisimproves the speed and quality of processing.       Phase 2 of First Interstate's image-retail lockbox project willinclude the ability to provide transaction images to customers forreceivables posting.     The image system is expected to capture about 11 million itemsper month.     First Interstate Offers Common Platform       First Interstate also completed recently a multimillion-dollarproject to install common cash management systems across the bank's13-state domain.       A provision of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act allowsaffiliated banks to act as "agent" for one another, and act as anagent itself.     First Interstate offers common direct demand accounts (DDA),account reconciliation processing (ARP) and account analysiscapabilities.  Customers can use the products to make same-daydeposits to a single account from deposit acceptance points in 13Western states.  With fewer accounts to manage, customers candetermine cash positions faster and easier, bank officials say.     "Many companies with multi-state operations will no longer haveto concentrate or reconcile funds," said Jan Cloyde, the bank'sexecutive vice president and manager of cash management.  She claimedthat competitor banks are well behind First Interstate in developingmultiple interstate banking options.(Julie Stephens, First Interstate, 213/614-7652; Ken Preston, 213/614-3656.)

The gasps that were heard in court as the defendants inthe Maxwell trial were acquitted on all charges were soon followed bycries outside the court. Whether the shouts in court were of joy,shock, or surprise, the comments outside were of a predictable nature:critics slammed the use of juries in fraud trials and the record of theSerious Fraud Office in prosecuting complex fraud.Whenever a fraud case goes wrong - in other words, when defendants areacquitted or those convicted receive light sentences - the reaction isalways the same. We were not disappointed in the case of the Maxwelltrial.In contrast to the cries of 'abolish the jury' or 'scrap the SFO', oneof the most pertinent and sane comments came from George Staples,director of the SFO. Although presumably bitterly disappointed by theverdict of the jury, he said: 'It is our job to conduct a thoroughinvestigation and ensure that defendants are prosecuted fairly, andthat has happened. The jury has considered the verdict for many daysand has reached its verdict. The criminal justice system has functionedin the way that it was designed to do.'The truth - reinforced by the announcement of further trials - is thatat the moment the SFO is being forced to conduct political show trialsrather than trying to solve the serious problems of corporate fraud andillegal acts in the City and elsewhere.If there is trouble in prosecuting serious frauds, then creatinganother agency or removing the people in charge will not solve theproblem. The law is a mess. In its report of July 1993, the RoyalCommission on Criminal Justice said: 'Those giving evidence to us havesuggested that fraud trials would be simpler to determine if thesubstantive law of fraud were reformed. Apart from the common lawoffence of conspiracy to defraud, there is no specific offence of fraudin England and Wales, and fraudulent conduct has therefore to be boughtunder the ambit of various offences.'Pension law has been reformed as a result of the Maxwell trial - sonow, should the law on fraud.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FRAUD CASES UP 16% - VALUE BY 25%Fraud in central government has increased by 16% in the last year,according to the Treasury's own figures. The 1994-95 Fraud Report - ananalysis of reported fraud in government departments - the Treasuryrevealed that government departments reported a total of 408 cases ofdepartment staff fraud, an increase of 16% over 1993-94 and 35% over1992-93. The total sum involved was #2.12m compared with #1.69m in 1993-94 and #2.11m in 1992-93, although the report says that in a number ofcases the amount involved had not been identified or could not beassessed.The report was published in January 1996 just two months after the 1993-94 report (see The Fraud Report, November 1995) which was released onlyafter a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner under the Code ofPractice on open government. The Treasury refused to speculate on thegrowth of fraud in central government. It said: 'Whether the increasein the number of fraud cases reported reflects a real trend isimpossible to say. It may be that greater fraud awareness and betterfraud reporting procedures in departments leads to more cases beingreported. What is undeniable is that the risk of fraud is notdiminishing. Staff at all levels need to be alert to these risks.'Strangely out of the 58 central government bodies, including allgovernment departments, which submitted annual returns in 1994-95, 30of them - just over half - submitted a 'nil return' saying there hadbeen no cases of fraud.For further details turn to page 10.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996'CONCERTED ATTACK ON FRAUD IS REQUIRED,' CLAIMS AUDIT FACULTYMore concerted action by management, regulators, auditors and theGovernment is needed to fight fraud effectively, according to a bookletpublished by the Audit Faculty of the Institute of CharteredAccountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). Peter Williams reports on arecent initiative by accountants.In a new booklet, Taking Fraud Seriously, authors Tony Bingham ofCoopers & Lybrand, Ian Huntingdon of KPMG and Martyn Jones of ToucheRoss, wrote: 'Crime and crime prevention evolve together and there isno shortage of effective measures with which to counter the fraudster.The real challenge is not a technical but an attitudinal one, the willto make fraud prevention a priority.'The role of directors and managementA company can minimise the risk of fraud if directors and seniormanagers take a positive lead and set the tone from the top,communicating clearly that fraud, corruption and dishonesty is nottolerated. According to the booklet, directors and managers should seekto establish a clear anti-fraud culture by:- Leading from the top. Senior management must demonstrate commitmentto an anti-fraud culture and be seen to be subject to the sameprocedural guidelines and investigation as the rest of the work-force.- Implementing and communicating an anti-fraud policy, covering suchmatters as giving and receiving inducements, reporting channels,investigation of suspected fraud and dealing with perpetrators. Thereshould be a public pledge that allegations of fraud or other wrongdoing by employees or by a third party will be properly investigated;- Developing a fraud contingency plan, setting out what is done and bywhom in the event of the discovery of fraud.The booklet also calls for quoted companies to comment in their annualreport on their efforts to prevent fraud and, in particular, to discusstheir policies on the areas outlined above. This suggestion has beenopposed by some finance directors.Taking Fraud Seriously also discusses the role of non-executivedirectors suggesting that they should:- be alert to the risk of fraud in a business, particularly top levelmanagement fraud;- be satisfied that internal control measures are given the rightemphasis within the organisation;- be satisfied with the integrity of the organisation's public companyreporting;- establish open lines of communication with internal and externalauditors and be prepared to spend time discussing the auditor'sconcerns.The authors also call on directors to consider their wider publicduties when deciding whether to report alleged fraudsters to thepublic. At present, many directors feel it is in the best interests oftheir organisation not to report fraud to the police but to quietlydeal with the matter themselves, often leaving the fraudster to strikeagain.Reform of the lawAs well as calling for a change in attitude towards fraud, the authors - all of whom are auditors - suggest that legal changes are required.Alongside wider legal questions - such as an examination of the prosand cons of creating a legal responsibility for officers and employeesof public companies to report prima facie fraud to the police - thebooklet calls for enforcing and extending section 389A of the CompaniesAct 1985. This section gives auditors rights of access to the company'srecords and requires its officers to provide such explanations orinformation as the auditors need to perform their duties. It alsocontains the offence of misleading an auditor, which the report says isuseful but that it does not carry a stiff enough penalty to encourageprosecutors to use it.The report wants the maximum custodial sentence increased from twoyears to five, and for the offence to be extended to any employee andany organisation.The role of the regulatorsRegulators play a key part in the fight against corporate fraud.According to the report, they need to guard against two main dangers.First, increasing the length and complexity of their rule book imposesa burden on the majority of members with well-run business and, second,more complex legislation can damage the effectiveness of inspectionteams.Regulators could increase their effectiveness by:- reviewing their rule books to ensure emphasis on the prevention anddetection of management fraud rather than on minor offences- making greater effort to cooperate with overseas and internationalregulators- passing on important information promptly to auditors. The authorswant the law changed to impose a duty on regulators to tell auditorswhen a client is suspected of fraud. They say that auditors can oftenbe left in the dark about such suspicions. At the moment, auditors areunder a legal obligation to report their suspicions. Regulators haveopposed the opening up of a two-way street saying that, where possible,information is often already passed on.The Government's roleTaking Fraud Seriously calls on the Government to establish anindependent standing body - The Fraud Advisory Panel - withresponsibility for:- providing a forum for discussion and improved cooperation betweenGovernment, law enforcement, the private sector and other interestedparties;- increasing the overall awareness of the problem of fraud.The Panel's membership would be drawn from the legal and accountingprofessions, law enforcement, regulatory agencies, business andacademia.Secondly, the Government should designate a lead department for thecoordination of the its anti-fraud strategy. At the momentresponsibility for anti-fraud policy is scattered around variousWhitehall departments.Copies of Taking Fraud Seriously are available from Tracy Gray, TheAudit Faculty, The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &Wales, Chartered Accountants' Hall, PO Box 433, Moorgate Place, LondonEC2P 2BJ.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996FFIN WORKING FINE ON FRAUDMike Feltham, head of the London Stock Exchange surveillancedepartment, told the Taking Fraud Seriously conference (see opposite)that great efforts have been made to ensure that information isexchanged relating to any fraud or market abuse.He said that one of the ways the Stock Exchange passed on and receivedinformation was through membership of the Financial Fraud InformationNetwork (FFIN). Feltham said: 'FFIN was formed as a result of arecommendation in a study commissioned by HM Treasury, as part of aGovernment response to such cases as BCCI and Maxwell.'Supervisors, regulators, investigators, law enforcers and Governmentmeet on a regular basis to exchange information and pool knowledgeabout actual or suspected serious financial fraud.Feltham said: 'FFIN has around 20 members but its feeder contacts go alot wider. The primary objective is to provide a framework for poolingand disseminating information about financial fraud and other seriouscriminal activity which pass through, and make use of, the UK financialsystem.'FFIN has no operational responsibilities as these remain with theindividual members. He added: 'There are three stages in the fightagainst financial fraud: detection, investigation and enforcement.FFIN's role is to assist principally with detection but it also helpsthe transition of cases from the detection to the investigation stage.FFIN tries to put together the different pieces of a jigsaw spreadaround several players where the picture that emerges can be far moresignificant than the individual pieces taken in isolation.'Although each member has its own constitution and rules onconfidentiality there is normally a legitimate way in which to transmitinformation within the membership when the need arises. Feltham said:'To my mind, FFIN has already assisted the exchange by enabling it topass cases to the appropriate investigatory and prosecution agencies,which has resulted in action being taken which would not haveotherwise.'The London Stock Exchange and a number of other London regulators alsobelong to an international inter-market surveillance group, ISG, whichprovides a framework for the sharing of information and thecoordination of regulatory matters among market centres. Formed in1983, ISG now has 22 North American, European and Australasianorganisations with a common interest in fraud prevention. Feltham said:'Membership of ISG has assisted us in being able to track movements ofsecurity trading and has allowed us to produce a much more broaderpicture than was previously possible.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996FRAUD RISES ALONG WITH STANDARDSReported fraud has increased because expected standards of commercialbehaviour have risen, according to Ian Hay Davison, who was deputychairman and chief executive of Lloyd's from 1983-86. Davison said thattimes change: acts once condoned are now regarded as fraudulent.He said: 'That was the problem of the underwriters at Lloyd's: theyreally had no idea that the ways of their fathers are today regarded asnot only unacceptable but as criminal. When I started in the City, theprovision of undisclosed benefits in kind to directors, the use ofinsider information to deal before company news was made public, thedevelopment of schemes solely designed to avoid personal taxationrates, and what we would today regard as false or misleading accountingpractices, were rife. Year-by-year, case-by-case, statute-by-statute,standards have been raised and offences created.'But he added: 'Fraud is a serious problem. It has always been and thereis no point in raising standards if the new higher standards are notenforced. There can be no doubt that the enforcement of law in the areaof fraud has been and continues to be lamentable.'Davison also pointed to other reasons, such as more complex markets,greater opportunities through the abolition of exchange controls, agreater spread of wealth providing more smaller savers to be gulled,and especially the greater power of computers.He added: 'British white-collar crime has the quality that too oftenits perpetrators persistently refuse to concede that what they havedone is wrong. One attractive quality of the Chinese, as I found in myterm as chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Review Committee, was thatwhile culprits at Lloyd's if caught red-handed consistently failed toconcede the enormity of what they had done, the Chinese accepted thejustice of the prosecutor's actions.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE?The Government watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) (UK), hasexpressed concern over the need for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) (UK)to keep under review more effective arrangements to prevent and detectfraud. In this article Rachael Church looks at the lessons to belearned by the MoD and others.The MoD spends #23bn a year on the nation's behalf, including #9bn onprocurement, yet it reckons that it is relatively free from fraud andcorruption. It has identified only #22m possible fraud in 1993-94 - amere 0.1% of its total expenditure, and a much smaller figure than manyprivate-sector organisations.Three recent cases involving the corruption of former MoD officialsraises a number of issues of wider relevance, according to the PAC.Since November 1993, three individuals previously employed by theDepartment - Gordon Foxley, James Taylor and Bernard Trevelyan - havebeen convicted of receiving corrupt sums. The Foxley case is the mostsignificant of the three and concerns the receipt of corrupt paymentsfrom overseas contractors. The Department says that not all the corruptfunds in the Foxley case have yet been identified - although he wasconvicted of 12 offences totalling #1.36m. Much of the money is lockedaway in Swiss bank accounts. Despite civil action the PAC said: 'TheDepartment could not give us any grounds for hope that they wouldsucceed in gaining access to these accounts, but told us they wouldpursue every possible avenue.'Three overseas companies involved in the Foxley case have beenblacklisted, and the MoD is taking steps to recover the corruptpayments. It has demanded a public apology and a clear assurance thatthey will not involve themselves in corruption again, as well as moreonerous oversight arrangements if contracts are placed with them infuture.Rotating dutiesThe PAC says that the Foxley case illustrates the risks of fraud andcorruption where staff are in post for a long time and have influenceover contracts. The National Audit Office (NAO) identified cases wherestaff had been in post at the same location for over 12 years. The MoDsays that the Foxley case was exceptional in its longevity. It now hasa firm policy of moving staff every five years, but could not say thateveryone who had served in a post for five years would be moved. Inthese cases there was a balance between the benefit of long experienceand deep knowledge and the risk of someone knowing all the tricks ofthe trade and therefore increasing the risk of fraud.The MoD's vetting arrangements failed to identify Foxley's lavishlifestyle which included nine properties in England. The Departmentsaid Foxley had a good cover story that his wife was a medicalpractitioner 'who was known to have money in her background'. It is nowconsidering adopting vetting arrangements similar to those used fornational security purposes to identify individuals who present a fraudrisk.Gifts and hospitalityAs a result of the Foxley case, the Department's rules concerning theacceptance of gifts and hospitality have been strengthened, byproviding more specific guidance on their interpretation. It says thatlarge-scale, expensive and exclusive hospitality has now been largelyeliminated, and that hospitality books are now properly maintained andscrutinised. Rules have also been tightened where officials leave towork for defence contractors and the Department looks carefully atprecisely what individuals have been doing and who they have beendealing with - although it still considers this an area of potentialrisk. In the US there is a five-year blanket ban on such a switch, butthe MoD says that the UK would not be able to afford the loss of brainsthat might be transferred in to income-earning, export-earningactivities.The MoD has also set up a fraud unit, promulgated fraud indicators,runs fraud-awareness courses, and has a 'hotline', so that people canreport frauds anonymously.OTHER PROCUREMENT AREAS AT RISK..The scope for fraud is higher where control systems are lesscomprehensive or where changes in management arrangements have alteredthe circumstances in which the controls operate. In the MoD's caseareas identified by the NAO include:- computer systems- non-competitive contracts- local purchase units and- the control of assets held by contractors.As a result of NAO work, the MoD has drawn up an action plan to reducethe risk of fraud.Computer systems. The MoD increasingly relies on computer systems. Areview by the NAO of the payment systems at Liverpool had identified anumber of concerns which the MoD is addressing through risk assessment.Local purchase units. Around 400 local purchase units account for about#270m a year but the MoD acknowledges that it is harder to exercisecontrol over small local contracts than it is for large procurementcontracts. In some cases there was no separation of duties and theMoD's internal audit team visited fewer than 1% of them each year. Itplans to extend auditing in this area.Non-competitive contracting. In 'cost-plus' non-competitive contractsthe risk that costs may be overstated is obvious. The MoD says it hasreduced the level of non-competitive contracting and startedinitiatives such as 'No acceptable price, no contract' and the Equalityof Information Statement, which aims to reduce the risk of poor valuefor money, including fraud.Control of assets held by contractors. Government equipment and sparesare held by contractors to enable them to carry out repairs andmaintenance contracts. Controls in this area are often poor with oftenan absence of separation of duty, supervisory checks, stocktaking andexit-gate checks. The MoD's response is that less and less equipment isheld in this way so the risk should diminish over time.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996LOSING OUT IN THE NUMBERS GAME'Calling cards' allow calls to be made on the move. They are anecessary and valuable product for many businesses and individuals. Butthe increased flexibility they offer comes at the price of increasedrisk. Dean Smith of Fraud Management Limited outlines the problem.Everyone knows of the most common mobile product - the cellulartelephone - but fewer people are aware of the increasingly popular'calling card' - a product now supplied by most majortelecommunications companies across the globe. In the UK, majoroperators such as BT, Mercury and Energis all offer card-based servicesoperating alongside other international players such as AT&T, MCI andSprint. The card's basic function is to allow a call to be placed, fromvirtually any telephone, and charged to the account holder for thatcard - ie a no-cash call. Billing may be to the user or, in a corporateenvironment, to a cost-centre manager responsible for the telecomsspending of a team of people. There are a number of flexible billingoptions available which vary by supplier.Calling cards offer a good means of cost control over telecoms spendingwhen users are away from home or office. Increasingly, such productsare being combined with payment cards as value-add features, AmericanExpress being a good example. This evolution is sure to continue,reducing the amount of plastic in the pocket and enhancing existingcard services. But increased usage means increased risk.No flights of fancyPicture this: you are on business in New York and about to catch aflight to Los Angeles from JFK International Airport, when a delay oftwo hours is announced because of bad weather. You decide to call theperson you are meeting to advise of your delay and find a suite ofpayphones nearby from which to call. From your pocket, you pull outyour calling card and lift the telephone handset. As you do so, you areaware of someone just behind and to the side of you, apparently waitingto use the phone. You dial the free access number which connects you tothe automated operator of the service you use. Following a prompt, youenter the card number, reading from the card in your hand. Followinganother prompt, you enter your secret PIN followed by the telephonenumber you are calling. As you enter these last digits, you notice thatthe person behind you moves off to use a telephone just a little downthe line. 'Hello Jim, it's Phil here - just calling to say I'll be alittle late ...' As you end your call and move back towards the coffeeshop, you see the person who was behind you with a group of others, allbusily scribbling away in a huddle.Three weeks later, back in London, your telecoms manager calls you andasks why your calling card bill is so large. 'Nonsense, I only used ita dozen or so times to call home and for business'. But on inspection,you find the normal #200 bill has risen to #10,000. Calls to Mexico,Columbia, Europe, the Far East and other destinations you know nothingof. Even more surprisingly, calls were made from other countries whileyou (and your card) were in the United States.Another victim of 'shoulder-surfing'The person behind you when you made that call at JFK was noting yourcard and PIN details. When he went to another payphone, he called hiscolleague in Amsterdam to test the card and pass on the numbers. Yourcard details were then put onto the Internet as part of a well-organised distribution network. What do they get out of it? A fewdollars per card number, free calls, and a few more dollars when theysell the numbers to others waiting around the payphones to make callsor obtain card numbers themselves.This is one of the less sophisticated methods of obtaining carddetails. High-powered binoculars, video equipment and sound-recordingdevices (useful when speaking your numbers to a human operator) haveall been used in similar environments.Similarly, there are risks when using calling cards from hotels orother businesses that use call-logging equipment. Card numbers may becaptured in soft or hard copy for reference by prying eyes. Callingcards might also be used for data transmission from portable PCequipment, in which case card details may be stored within. And what ofthat 'last number redial' button on the telephone you have just used?It is fortunate, however, that the UK has to date suffered relativelylittle from this type of fraud. The US remains the telecoms fraudcapital of the world, but trends in other countries are definitely onthe up. It makes sense, therefore, to take care when using a callingcard anywhere in the world, not just the US.Shopping around for securityMost telecoms providers are aware of the risks involved with calling-card products. As such, most have developed a degree of fraudprevention and detection within the product configuration, operationand call monitoring. Security features vary widely from operator tooperator and so it is worth exploring these with their agent during thesales process. It is also worth establishing who would be responsiblefor the bill should you be hit by fraud. On the whole, servicesuppliers in the UK are reasonably good at fraud detection and shouldbe able to contact you if fraud is suspected.The following checklist will help reduce the fraud risk. Take the timeto deliver these messages to appropriate personnel within yourorganisation; users, telecoms managers and those responsible for payingthe bills. It could help reduce the trauma, wasted time and possibleexpense of a fraud incident.PIN security- Once you have memorised the PIN, destroy the original PINnotification.- Avoid writing your PIN down. If you have to, note it so that it couldnot be identified as a PIN.- Never write the PIN on the calling card or anywhere that might beassociated with the card eg on any related literature.- Do not disclose your card number or PIN to anyone except the callingcard operator when you need to make a call. You will never be contactedand asked for your PIN (or password if one is used) by the servicesupplier.- If you think that someone might have noted your card and PIN numbers,contact the service supplier to change them immediately.- Avoid PINs (or passwords) that would be easy to guess - those runningsequentially (1234, 9876 etc) or with repeated digits (1111 etc). Alsoavoid obvious keypad sequences like 1397 (clockwise) or 2580 (down themiddle), and your year of birth.Card security- Never leave your calling card lying around. Treat it as you would acredit card.- If your card is lost or stolen, report it immediately to the servicesupplier - and always carry the supplier's emergency phone number.- To prevent others noting your card number, never use your card as aproof of identity.Usage precautions- Take appropriate precautions when using your card to avoid anyoneseeing the digits you dial (if using direct-dial via tone telephones)or overhearing the numbers you speak (if calling via the operator).Shielding the keypad from prying eyes will help significantly. Whenpassing your card details to the operator, make sure nobody iseavesdropping. It is perhaps worth cupping your hand over the telephonemouthpiece.- If using telephones that display the digits you enter, ensure thatthe numbers are not visible to others and that they are cleared afteruse. Numbers can be cleared by lifting the telephone handset after yourcalls are complete and entering a random digit. This will also helpavoid problems with the last number redial function available on manytelephones.- Some hotels or organisations use call-logging equipment to helpmanage or account for their telephone usage. These could record yourcalling card details which may then be visible to others. This onlyhappens if you direct-dial calls using a tone telephone connected tothe logger. This risk can be avoided by making calls via the callingcard operator or using a telephone not connected to the logger.- If using your card to make calls from a computer (eg datatransmissions), ensure that your computer is protected againstunauthorised access - your card details may be visible within thesystem. If possible, do not enter your PIN as a default setting - enterit manually for each call made.- Never loan your card unless you are prepared to pay for the callsmade (which may be a lot more than the ones you know of).Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996HOW FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS FACE GREATER LIABILITY EXPOSURERoger Parker, partner in the Commercial Litigation department of Citysolicitors Richards Butler, considers accountants' increasing liabilityexposure - and offers some remedies.The Fraud Report has referred in recent editions to surveys suggestingthat fraud is on the increase - or at least that detection rates are.The number of situations where forensic accountants are called in toassist companies results in greater liability exposure for theaccountant - albeit with greater fee income as well.This article summarises the basis of such liability exposure andhighlights certain practices which have led to a degree of concernabout risk-management techniques deployed by accountants. On the basisthat any litigation is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication thisshould interest companies as well as accountants.Common threadsA number of claims, across the professions, have common features:- Complexity. The more complex the case the more for the development ofproblems, be they caused by lack of appropriate communication,expertise, diligence or resource.- Late instruction. The forensic accountant will often be instructedafter a fraud has been committed. What is less understandable is ifthere is an instruction given unnecessarily late, as happens from timeto time. If there is belated instruction in pressurised circumstances aproper investigation is less likely to result.- Fiscal control. Proper financial control of any consultant isessential, but the thin line between budgetary control and imprudentmanagement should not be crossed.- Access to the client. For a company this tends to be less of aproblem because of the proximity of the in-house lawyer to client. Itcan be more of a problem where the client is further removed - forexample when the accountant is instructed by a solicitor. It is for theaccountant to ensure that he has all proper and necessary access to layclients and to those who may have direct access to materialinformation.- Trends. Increasingly, disgruntled clients are 'having a go' atprofessionals, sometimes because of their own deep pockets, sometimesbecause of their insurers. Also, it is increasingly common for thedissatisfied to seek to apportion responsibility. Somebody 'must' be toblame - a human reaction that many (particularly US) courts have over-indulged.Sorting out communicationOne of the fundamental principles of English and US contract law is therule that vague wording in a contract will generally be construedagainst the writer (contra proferentem). Not surprisingly therefore,professional liability cases in both jurisdictions have tended to giveclients the benefit of the doubt when liability is based onmisunderstanding. It is incumbent on the professional proactively toseek out areas where clients may not have sufficient understanding.This issue is the biggest single source of claims and is thereforeregularly of concern to professional firms. It is increasinglyimportant in complex fraud cases because:- Investigations can be labour intensive involving many hours. Hoursare money. The client will not necessarily be well-placed to assess thevolume of hours or the complexity of the task. That is why he or sheinstructs the accountant.- Explanation of the substance of the problem can be complex andresults may only come toward the end of an investigation. This meansthe patience of the client may be sorely tested as hours are spent andfees incurred with no result until completion. It can be harder infraud cases for clients to know whether their decision to invest isworthwhile. It may be even harder to explain to the client's commercialmanagement.Contracts as reference pointsClaims will sometimes be based on a retainer letter. The latter isunder-utilised. A perfectly adequate contract between client andprofessional on a major instruction can be contained within a couple ofpages. It should be the reference point for identifying responsibilityfor the purposes of both contract and negligence. Very few of the majorEnglish legal authorities revolve around the retainer letter becausenot enough attention has been given to defining the scope of servicesthat should be contained in it. More time has been spent in draftinglimitation clauses or costs schedules. There are important matters, butthere need not be an exclusion of the scope. This may seem a bit basic,but how often have you seen a professional spell out precisely what heor she is doing? What sources will the accountant be checking for signsof malpractice? When will the accountant cease to follow a line ofenquiry? What if that line would have produced the answer?The absence of at least a basic pointer to the scope of work isinconsistent with the practice adopted by a number of otherprofessionals. Part of the historical reason for this is linked to theabsence of fixed fee in certain investigatory work. A fixed fee tendsto lead to a fixed definition of what is to be done with theflexibility of additional services being provided upon request - for anadditional cost. An open-ended and potentially vague assignment is morelikely to lead to a vague brief. It is not suggested that vagueness canbe eliminated, but focus on the 'greyer' areas at least enables a moreaccurate assessment of where the parties' risk exposure is.Resisting negligenceIt is clear from recent leading authority in England that if theprofessional escapes liability in contract he or she may notnecessarily be so lucky in resisting a claim in negligence. To limitthe danger there should be, possibly to the advantage of both partiesto the arrangement, synonimity between contractual and tortuousobligations. This can be done simply, by a statement to the effect thatthe parties do not agree to there being any tortuous liability over andabove their contractual responsibilities as defined. What many will seeas unacceptable on policy grounds is the possibility of spending timeand money negotiating a retainer letter/contract only to find that someother, judicially imposed, criteria determines responsibility.ConclusionIt is easy with hindsight to apportion blame for conduct. It is not soeasy to think positively how to implement procedures to reduce the riskof dispute. Perhaps predictably, one answer is to do with training, inthe basics - communication skills, drafting and straight thinking ofwhat each party to the arrangement is expecting to achieve and how theyare going to achieve it.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ADVANCE FEE AND PBI FRAUD - ALWAYS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUEAdvance fee and PBI fraud continues to be a dramatically successfulform of fraud, despite warnings issued in recent years by bodies suchas the Bank of England, the Law Society and the Federal Reserve. AndrewKeltie, a partner in Baker & McKenzie, London and a member of Baker &McKenzie's Civil Fraud Group, reports.With hindsight, advance fee and prime bank instrument (PBI) frauds seemso obviously dishonest that it is hard to understand how anyone couldbe deceived. But the combination of ostensibly authentic documentation,and the skillful use of psychology, has led to many sophisticatedbusiness people being defrauded of substantial sums. A recent exampleis the loss (and subsequent recovery) of more than #6m by the SalvationArmy in 1992. In May 1992 the Army had been persuaded to pay $10m to aBelgian bank for investment in 'prime bank instruments' which theSalvation Army was duped into believing could be bought as a discountand sold at a profit. In fact, PBIs do not exist and there is no marketin them, other than that conjured up by plausible fraudsters.Advance fee fraudThis involves tricking the victim into believing that participating ina transaction (the participation being dependent on payment of anadvance fee or 'commission') will give access to a low-interest orinterest-free loan, or the receipt of some other financial benefit. Theadvance fee is usually a small percentage of the finance apparentlybeing provided. It may be suggested that the source of the finance is'oil money', or that the funding is by means of a 'self-liquidatingloan'. Fraudsters will go to considerable lengths to compile a dossierof correspondence and legalistic documents, purportedly authenticatingthe availability of the funds and the credentials of the participants.This will often involve the use of headed notepaper obtained frombanks, accountants and firms of solicitors. The growth (and increasingacceptability) of fax documents means that genuine letterheads can beused to create bogus documents which are difficult to detect if sent byfax.Once the victim is persuaded of the genuine nature of the transaction,and the availability of low-cost or free finance, the next stage ispayment of the advance fee, often expressed to be the agent'scommission, the victim having been convinced that payment is the finalstage in obtaining the promised funds. In most cases as soon as it ispaid the fee will disappear along with the fraudster.Prime bank instrument fraudAdvance fee fraud is still committed but its more sophisticatedexponents have moved on to PBI fraud, which rests on the use of bogusfinancial instruments as being the source of the alleged loan orprofit.PBI fraud is based on the mythical existence of a secret market inwhich the world's largest ('prime') banks deal with each other, reapinghuge profits. The victim is enticed with a promise that he can share inthose profits, for a modest investment. PBIs are usually referred to as'prime bank guarantees', 'prime bank promissory notes (or paper)','master collateral commitments' or 'discounted standby letters ofcredit'.The story is that the 'prime' banks lend huge sums to each other allthe time, and that there is a market in PBIs which the victim will beable to tap into via a smaller bank at which the fraudster has acontact. Unsurprisingly, the smaller bank will often appear to beincorporated in Panama or Liechtenstein, and will rarely be found inany banker's almanac or directory.Although standby letters of credit do exist and are issued by banks,they are a form of collateral security or performance bond. They arenot negotiable and there is no market in them. Prime bank guarantees,prime bank notes and the like do not exist.A veneer of respectabilityBoth advance fee and PBI frauds are invariably dressed up with avariety of complicated legalistic (but incomprehensible) documentation,all of which the victim is solemnly asked to read carefully and sign.These usually include a confidentiality agreement and a 'certificate oforigin of funds', confirming that the victim's investment is of 'good,clean funds of non-criminal origin'.Another key feature is secrecy. It is frequently claimed that thesource of finance in advance fee fraud is the Middle East, because ofreligious restrictions on earning interest on loans; or that disclosureof the covert market in PBIs would lead to the market breaking down,because it would no longer be confined to the elite few. The realpurpose of such secrecy is, of course, to prevent or dissuade thevictim from carrying out any form of due diligence and to explain whythe victim cannot meet the lender. It can also make action to attemptto recover lost funds far more difficult.Other devices used to reassure a victim include:- returning a portion of the fee at the end of a week or month,representing it as a form of profit, the aim being to persuade thevictim that the investment is profitable, and to commit more funds- spurious references to organisations such as the World Bank, theUnited Nations, and the International Chamber of Commerce- the apparent involvement of professionals, particularly lawyers'client or trust accounts- supposed absolute security.It is often said that transactions are on a 'bank-to-bank' basis andthe investment is as secure as the bank itself. As in the SalvationArmy case, a common device is to persuade the investor to open anaccount at a foreign bank into which the profits to be earned from thetransaction will be paid. Before receiving any profit, however, theinvestor must pay sufficient funds into the account to show that he isin a position to participate in the investment - a so-called 'proof offunds' transaction. Although the account will purportedly be interest-bearing and under the control of the investor, fraudsters will ensurethat they have signing powers over the account to enable the funds tobe removed and normally routed quickly through several otherjurisdictions to make tracing and recovery more difficult.Providing powerful remediesThe English courts are able to provide powerful assistance to victims,such as orders which freeze asset and permit the search of premises,the seizure of incriminating evidence, and the disclosure ofinformation (and in many cases a combination of all of these elements).In addition, such frauds will invariably involve criminal offences andthe police in England and elsewhere now have considerable experience ininvestigating these frauds, although the international nature of mostof them can cause difficulties for the police in piecing togetherexactly what has happened.Awareness heightenedIncreasing awareness of advance fee and PBI frauds, particularly amongprofessionals responding to warnings from their professional orregulatory bodies, has helped to reduce some of the most blatantexamples. Another improvement has been the introduction of anti-moneylaundering legislation in many countries. However, it remains the casethat it is possible in some jurisdictions for corporations to beestablished and call themselves banks. And the ingenuity andimagination of sophisticated fraudsters has responded to the increasingchallenges posed to them by growing awareness and more rigorouslegislation. This type of fraud is still a real problem which continuesto claim victims.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996CURRENCY SCAM INVESTIGATORS WITH A YEN FOR KNOWLEDGEFarleigh Projects International, part of Group 4, specialises ininvestigating complex, organised fraud for clients which include largecorporates and Government organisations. Managing director John Davisand manager of investigations, Tony Ockmore - both former policemen -talk to Peter Williams about Farleigh's role in investigating thedollar-yen swap scam.International fraudsters have netted at least $250m and maybe as muchas $500m over the last four or five years in the dollar-yen scam. Thevictims of the fraud are rich individuals some of whom allegedlyobtained their millions in the first place through tax-evasion schemes.The fraudster persuaded wealthy individuals to give them this 'blackmoney' on the promise that it would produce fantastic results and wouldbe 'white money'. Farleigh knows of one individual who invested $25m inone tranche.The fraud is simple: investors are told that their dollars will be soldfor Japanese yen and then sold back again. The promised return on thisarbitrage was fantastic - from $4m to $8m over a four-week rollingperiod.The documentation produced by the fraudsters was of a very highstandard and the names of banks and brokers used for the transactionswere reputable and legitimate. But there was no dollar-yen swapprogramme - the money was simply stolen.Dubious provenance protected fraudsterThe fraudsters reckoned that many of the investors would not kick uptoo much of a fuss because of the dubious nature of the origins oftheir cash. Those that did protest were either given a first tranche ofa dividend or interest payment - stolen from other investors - or showna false statement of the profits to date. Others were dealt with moresimply - they were threatened.Farleigh Projects now believes that this scam has been closed down, butJohn Davis believes it has some important lessons for prosecutingauthorities, regulators and financial institutions. Farleigh becameinvolved when it was hired to trace funds and people by an Austrianbank which was being sued by some of those defrauded. One of itsmanagers was corrupted by the fraudsters and over a number of years hadprovided them with the banking and money transmission facilities theyneeded.This international scam started in the bank guarantee fraud in the late1980s and moved into the dollar-yen programme as a sort of naturalprogression in the early 1990s. The heat was put on the bank guaranteefraud and they had to find a new outlet. They saw this as the perfectfollow on and in many ways they were right. The fraudsters got awaywith so much for so long because different regulators and differentprosecuting authorities simply do not talk to or cooperate with eachother. Farleigh has managed to get authorities across Europe to talk toeach other, acting as a clearing house for information. It even had topersuade three state prosecutors in different parts of Germany to pooltheir knowledge.Farleigh also believes the fraud has shown up weaknesses in UKlegislation. Money which is invested on the currency market or on otherspot markets is not regulated by the Financial Services Act. TheSecurities and Investments Board is studying whether the FSA should beextended to cover these activities.Banks could do moreSome observers privately believe that criticism could also be levelledat banks which still seem to welcome accounts which receive vast sumsof money from peculiar sources without asking too many questions,although the banks would claim they have now tightened up considerablyfollowing the introduction of money laundering regulations.The other element that has made the fraud difficult to track down wasthe way in which it was organised. Although Farleigh believes it knowsthe prime mover in the fraud it was never masterminded in one place.Instead different pockets of copy-cat frauds sprang up all over theworld - three operated separately out of Germany through Austria intothe UK, and others were based in Australia, Spain, France, Sweden andSwitzerland. Farleigh proved that they were connected because they havetraced at least one money flow between the various differentoperations. Davis said: 'It is probably the most organised and biggestfraud that I have ever come across in my life. The way it split itselfup has caused the police and the prosecutors major problems.'Although not all of the alleged fraudsters involved are facing trial,one person has already been sentenced to seven years by a German court,two people are due to appear in court in the UK later this year, andseveral other people have been charged in Germany and Austria - one ofwhom committed suicide while in police custody.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996THE FRAUD REPORT STATISTICS PAGEThe analysis of fraud in Government departments places frauds intovarious categories - but in reality details are often complicated andmay cross boundaries, as this month's statistics show.As in the previous two years, the largest category of frauds reportedin 1994-95 is travel and subsistence. These 105 cases represented forover a quarter in volume but only 6% in value.The second largest category involves theft of assets such as officeequipment, protective clothing and building materials. The number ofcases represent 15% of the total, while the value of the assetsrepresent a quarter of the total monetary loss. One case accounted for#400,000. It involved the alleged theft of equipment due for sale ordisposal, by a staff member who is suspected of exploiting weaknessesin receipt and stock control procedures. Collusion with outsideaccomplices is suspected and investigations are continuing.Misappropriation of cash came to #832,500, 39% of the total value offrauds in the year. Two cases accounted for over half the loss in thiscategory. Enquiries are continuing in one case - value #298,000 - wherea new member of staff noticed irregularities in the accounts. Thesuspect was arrested following a suspected arson attack on the officecontaining the records in question. Cash books and other records wereallegedly found in the suspect's possession. A prosecution is pending.In one case the actual loss to the public funds is estimated at#41,000, whereas the gain to the perpetrators is believed to be between#600,000 and #700,000. Over a number of years an embassy officialallegedly exploited currency exchange rates by manipulating thedifference between the local official market exchange rate and theunofficial, parallel market rate, retaining the difference. The fraudwas carried out in collusion with a locally engaged accountant and theofficers are believed to have falsified embassy accounts by recordingonly the lower, official exchange rate. The official is also alleged tohave been responsible for rigging local building contracts. He was dueto be charged with theft, deception and corruption but committedsuicide while on police bail.The Treasury has warned departments to increase controls of access topersonal and sensitive data held on computer. It reports thatunauthorised staff access is on the increase.Overall, in 38% of the cases, perpetrators were prosecuted, or wereawaiting prosecution or had been dismissed without prosecution. In afurther 22% of cases, the perpetrators were subject to internaldisciplinary action ranging from a reduction in grade through to aformal reprimand. The lesser penalties were applied in cases such asmisuse of sick leave, official vehicle or telephones for personalcalls.WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FRAUDSTERS?The Government says that it takes all cases of fraud very seriously.Set out below is what actually happened to perpetrators of fraud in1994-95.Action                                                 No of casesProsecuted, resulting in custodial sentence                 41Prosecution, resulting in fine or probation                 18Prosecution pending                                         34Dismissed (without prosecution)                             63Downgraded                                                   6Loss of spine points and/or promotion bar for  specified period                                          24Formal reprimand                                            62Resignation, no further action                              28Disciplinary action pending                                 26Insufficient evidence to sustain disciplinary action        16Culprit not identified                                      42Cases still under investigation                             48Total                                                      408Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996BY DEFINITION, A BIG PROBLEMThe rules concerning Government accounting requires departments to makean annual return to the Treasury of all cases of suspected or provenfraud - including attempted fraud - affecting their departmentsincluding their agencies, within the following categories:- Fraud perpetrated within the department by its own staff, includingthe theft of assets and cases of collusion outside the department.- Computer frauds, whether perpetrated by members of staff or membersof the public. A computer fraud is defined as one where IT equipmenthas been used to manipulate computer programs or data dishonestly (forexample to alter or substitute records; to destroy or suppress records;or to duplicate or create spurious records); or where the existence ofan IT system was a material factor in the perpetration of fraud (iewhere the fraud was unlikely to have occurred there had been no ITsystem.) Departments are also asked to report any cases involving thetheft or fraudulent use of computer time and resources.- Frauds by contractors arising in connection with contracts placed bydepartments for the supply of goods and services.- Any other frauds which reveal potentially significant systemweaknesses or exposures to loss of a nature which other departmentsmight face.Data is not collected on external frauds perpetrated upon departmentsby outside parties, such as tax or benefit frauds or those involvinggrants or subsidies. Nor does the report include frauds occurring innon-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).

It is revamping its existing productrange, expanding its distribution network and embarking on a majorrecruitment campaign that will result in the appointment of 20 businessdevelopment, client relationship and marketing executives to supplementits existing Luxembourg operation.At present Threadneedle's European activities are based primarilyaround the Global Assets Fund (GAF), a Luxembourg-domiciled Sicav with$500 million invested in 20 subfunds. This is distributed in Belgium,the Netherlands and the UK, although a small amount of business alsocomes from Germany.The European venture is the first significant business outcomefollowing BAT's decision to consolidate the fund management operationsof Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, its two life, pensions and investmentproducts subsidiaries, into a separate company in June 1994.Threadneedle currently has around #30 billion ($45 billion) of assetsunder management.The European thrust will initially be based around a revamped GAF,which was originally offered under the Eagle Star name. "We arerelaunching GAF in Belgium and the Netherlands during March 1996," saidAlan J Ainsworth, Threadneedle's managing director (retail). "Therelaunch will incorporate a number of significant changes. We shallalso be offering Belgian investors a new guaranteed equity Sicav."Threadneedle currently distributes GAF through two Belgian banks,Banque Commerciale Bruxelles and Bank Unie. It has recently signed athird - and as yet unnamed - bank distributor. In the Netherlands itrelies primarily on independent brokers for distribution, a distinctionwhich will be reflected in a new pricing structure for the relaunchedumbrella fund. IFAs, together with Eagle Star, have also been used inthe UK to market the fund, although Threadneedle hopes to focusincreasingly on direct media.The German market will be targeted later in 1996. "We have a major newproduct initiative for the German market," said Ainsworth. As in theNetherlands, Threadneedle currently relies on IFAs to distribute GAF.Other markets earmarked for development are Spain - where Threadneedlehopes to capitalise on its links with SAFEL, a Spanish retailinvestment group in which BAT owns part of the equity - and France.The new initiative is certainly well-timed. Global stockmarkets havebeen extremely buoyant during the first few weeks of 1996, and theomens for the rest of the year are propitious. The prospect of furtherdrops in interest rates and greater liquidity are expected to powermarkets upwards, and this should help boost demand for the product.In addition the relaunch is likely to benefit from the momentumachieved during 1995. "Last year we grew the Global Assets Fund byaround $100 million," said Ainsworth."We also added three newportfolios: a Latin American fund, a Japanese smaller companies fundand a global bond fund."Threadneedle has already made a number of key appointments to supportits European initiative. Robin Threadgold, previously at Fidelity, hasbeen made head of European Business. Tina Wilkinson joined the companyin January from Gartmore Indosuez in Paris to head European Marketing.Another major appointment is expected in the next few weeks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

With interest ratesfalling and the UK stockmarket generating total returns of around 20percent in 1995, compared to around 6 percent on bank deposits, mutualfunds should be well placed to increase their share of the savingsmarket.So far there has been no shortage of new product announcements. Two ofthe largest players in the UK market - Perpetual and M&G - haveannounced their intention of launching two new low-cost investmenttrusts aimed firmly at the PEP market.M&G is launching M&G Equity Investment Trust, a split capitalinvestment trust offering a number of classes of share, in February. Aunique feature of this trust is that it will be completely load free,although at 1.25 percent the annual management fee is rather high andthis, on normal criteria, would pre-empt its sale to the non-PEPinvestor.On February 20, Perpetual will launch Perpetual Income and GrowthInvestment Trust plc. Managed by Neil Woodford, whose other funds haveenjoyed outstanding performance, the trust has a lower annualmanagement fee (0.75 percent per annum) than M&G but imposes a 0.5percent plus VAT charge for the PEP wrapper.Low costs are clearly seen as an important marketing tool by manycompanies. Fidelity has launched a range of four no-load funds,including an index tracker, clearly aimed at the PEP market.The Fidelity MoneyBuilder Index carries an annual management fee of 0.5percent, which briefly was second to only River & Mercantile in thelow-cost tracker fund stakes. One of its rivals, Legal & General,retaliated immediately by reducing the fees on its UK tracker toexactly the same level.Among other companies who have announced new product launches to cashin on the PEP season are Schroders, whose top performing UK GrowthInvestment Trust is issuing new shares, Hargreaves Landsdown (OptimumIncome & Growth Trust), Flemings and Jupiter Tyndall (Jupiter HighIncome Fund).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This will enable investors to track in asystematic way the performance of privatised companies on stock marketsaround the world.The index encapsulates around 175 different shares, and includes mostof the large privatisations initiated by way of initial public offersince 1980. Denominated in US dollars and weighted by marketcapitalisation, it will be added to as new privatisations occur.Calculated back to 1990, the index shows that over the medium termprivatisation shares have significantly out-performed marketsgenerally.Total privatisations in 1995 amounted to $73.2 billion, a recordaccording to Privatisation International, with at least 45 countriesengaged in active privatisation programmes. Total proceeds were about15 percent higher than in 1994 and were split equally between publicoffers and private sales to strategic investors.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Tony Shearer, thecompany's chief operating officer, resigned following "personalityclashes" with the managing director David Morgan. The failure toconsummate a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Dah Sing would appearto have sealed A J Oddie's fate. His post of business developmentofficer has been phased out, so precipitating his departure from thecompany.With events at Dunedin still fresh in the memory there is inevitablespeculation that these departures might be followed by others. There isalso mounting concern that these departures could be symptomatic ofmore wide-ranging problems at the company, which pioneered unit trustsin the UK and is the largest provider of general PEPs.Critics have pointed to the sharp fall-off in the company's investmentperformance. There is concern that M&G is increasingly being driven bymarketing as opposed to performance criteria.These claims are countered by assertions that recent market conditionshave not been conducive to the company's investment style, which isvalue-driven and focuses on small-to-medium-sized companies. Taken on amedium-term view M&G's is still above trend.Prudential Portfolio Managers (PPM) is searching for a new chiefexecutive following the departure of Hugh Jenkins, who retired on newyear's eve. Prudential, with more than #75 billion ($110 billion) ofassets under management, is one of the largest UK fund managers.Rodney Dennis, who currently manages PPM's UK and European operationsand chairs the company's asset allocation committee, will assumecontrol until a successor is found.It could be some time before a new appointment is made."We will takewhatever time is needed to ensure that the right candidate is selectedfor what is a vitally important job within the group," said aPrudential spokesman.Schroder's long-serving Ed Mercer, one of the pioneers of investment inJapan, is seeking pastures new at Atlantis Investment Managers.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightFUNDS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996WHO WILL BE NEXT IN THE UK FUND MANAGEMENT AUCTION?There was no shortage of M&A activity in UK fund management in 1995.Given the speculation and rumours surrounding the sector, the new yearcould generate substantial further activityTHE MOST intriguing - and longest running - saga in the UK fundmanagement industry concerns the future of Hill Samuel following themerger of its parent TSB Group with Lloyds Bank, which became effectiveon December 28.The long-term future of Hill Samuel, a UK-based merchant banking andasset management group, has been a subject of debate ever since it wasacquired by TSB shortly before the stockmarket crash of 1987.Encouraged by its new owners, Hill Samuel went on a commercialproperty-lending binge at the time the market broke. Bad debts were solarge that in 1992, TSB had to establish a special loans administrationunit to manage them. More significantly, Hill Samuel's debtscompromised the profitability of TSB Group during the early 1990s.Hill Samuel, however, has important and profitable fund managementinterests. Hill Samuel Asset Management and Financial Servicescurrently claims to manage #28 billion ($42 billion) from its Londonoffices and a further #10 billion in the US, where it has twosubsidiaries. It also trying to expand in the far east. Fund managementactivities contributed #21 million to group profits in 1994.These interests dwarf Lloyds's asset management activities. LloydsInvestment Managers, the bank's main asset management vehicle, only hasaround #12 billion of funds under management.Given the emphasis which Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman isallegedly placing on the sale of investment products within the bank,as well as improving earnings quality generally, both units should havea future within the enlarged group, although it is not beyond thebounds of possibility that the merchant banking interests will be soldoff. To all intents and purposes, Lloyds has exited from this sector ofthe banking market.Some commentators are not convinced, however. A former fund manager wasvery critical about Lloyds's stewardship of Lloyds Investment Managers."Lloyds Investment Managers was very profitable. It had to be to remainin the Lloyds Group," he told FI. "We were set a target ROE of 20percent which was only achieved by squeezing costs and investment. Ourperformance definitely suffered as a consequence."For the moment both investment groups will operate as separateentities, as will the other components of the TSB-Lloyds merger."Everything is in the melting pot. No decisions have yet been madeconcerning the future and structure of the group," said a Lloydsspokesman. A Hill Samuel spokesman was more cryptic. "We are constantlygetting enquiries about our future from the media. We just don't know."At the moment all options would appear to be open. The two fundmanagement groups could be combined to create a large integrated group.Alternatively, one of the units could be sold off. Given the length oftime taken to dispose of John Govett (see FI 14) and uncertainties overthe sale of Gartmore, the market for UK-based asset managers may nolonger be quite so buoyant.In the mean time, Hill Samuel Asset Management's chief executiveRichard Bernays has decided to leave the company. He is joining JupiterTyndall where he will replace Leonard Licht as vice chairman, followingthe latter's retirement. Jupiter Tyndall was acquired by Commerzbank in1995.Bernays will be replaced by Peter Axten. Axten, who is a former HillSamuel employee, is currently chief executive of LIM. For the moment,at least, it looks as if the merger option is being taken but, asusual, time will tell.Meanwhile there has been little progress made in resolving the futureof Gartmore, following Banque Indosuez's decision to sell its 75percent stake in the company. The bank released a statement in Januaryto confirm that the sale would still go ahead and that a number ofparties were still interested in acquiring the shares. There had beenspeculation that the sale could have been called off followingpersonnel changes at Indosuez.It is understood, however, that a number of potential purchasers, suchas BAT, NatWest and Prudential, are no longer interested in the companywhich is valued at around #370 million. Bankgesellschaft from Berlinand NationsBank from the US are apparently still interested.NationsBank already has what is essentially a call option on part ofGartmore's equity.Following the fall-out at Dunedin Fund Managers (see FI 12 and 13) Bankof Scotland, the company's majority shareholder, is rumoured to beready to put its stake onto the market. An announcement is expectedshortly. Before the management defections, Dunedin was thought to beworth around #100 million.As usual there is no shortage of potential purchasers. All the large UKfund managers are thought to be interested in the company. In practice,however, it may be difficult to bring the shares to market. DespiteStandard Life owning a significant proportion of the minority shares,as well as 34 percent of the Bank of Scotland, the investment trustsmanaged by Dunedin also retain significant holdings. This could yetconstitute an effective poisonous pill.One acquisition which has been completed was the purchase of CINManagement (CINMan) by Friends Provident, a UK mutual life company. Thepurchase will make Friends Provident the tenth-largest UK fund manager,with total funds under management of #32 billion."The acquisition will take Friends Provident quantum leaps forward toits long-term goal of becoming one of the small band of financialservices companies which will dominate the sector in the newmillennium," said its chief executive Michael Doerr.CINMan's main business focus is the management of the UK coalindustry's pension schemes. The sale of the company to a privateinstitution was almost a logical consequence of the UK government'sdecision to privatise the coal sector. CINMan currently has around #17billion under management.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Capital gains realised throughout 1996 on the saleof Sicav monetaires - or money market funds - will be exempted frominclusion in newly introduced tax allowances, provided the proceeds areinvested in residential property.Until the end of June capital gains will also be exempt from tax,provided that a minimum of Fr3,000 ($600) of the proceeds is spent onhousehold appliances and electrical goods. Penalty and tax regimes onother forms of long-term saving are also being changed to encouragegreater spending.These measures reflect the attempts being made by the government toreboot an ailing economy through boosting consumer spending. Withconfidence low about future prospects, consumers have been reluctant tospend. Whether the strategy works - much less results in an increase inexpenditure on French manufactured goods - remains to be seen.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

At present, German investment companies canonly offer custody services to purchasers of their funds. This cancause problems for investors who deal with several companies who mustopen - and pay fees on - several custody accounts. Some investors havecircumvented this by going to a Luxembourg-based bank, so helping toundermine German-based business. "The German investors who went toLuxembourg to get custody services would be able to think about comingback," said Manfred Laux, managing director of BVI. The change wouldalso open a new source of earnings for the fund companies.Greater opportunities for mutual funds to invest in liquid instruments,especially money market funds. The range of liquid assets in whichfunds can invest is still restricted to bank deposits, certificates ofdeposit and certain classes of short-term paper issued by public sectorinstitutions. The money-market fund sector, which has grown to aroundDM100 billion ($66 billion) in the 18 months since its introduction,offers an alternative with the same high degree of liquidity andyields.Equal rights for closed-end funds on depreciation, so that they canbenefit from the special depreciation rates available in easternGermany and real-estate markets. There would also be tax advantages forretail investors.Approval for open-ended real estate funds to purchase shares inproperty companies and thus invest more easily in non-Germanreal-estate markets. This would reflect a growing willingness on thepart of real estate companies to invest in the London and Netherlandsproperty markets, which offer relatively low currency risks and providebetter yields than the German market. This change would also allowGerman mutual funds to avoid higher taxes on foreign investment throughacquiring property holdings indirectly.Fixed-term equity funds, with guaranteed returns. One of the financeministry's objectives is to encourage share ownership by individuals inGermany. Fixed-term equity funds may encourage private investors toinvest in equities as part of a retirement savings plan. Banks havebegun to market equity funds for this purpose. Commerzbank, forexample, recently launched an advertising campaign which describedequity funds as the "fourth pillar" of an optimal retirement plan(after the state pension, company pension, and life assurance).Investment companies contend that the idea would be more attractive ifthere was a definite wind-up date and some form of guaranteed returns.Laux points out that fixed-term bond funds were an immediate successwhen they were introduced to the German market in 1985. "There appearsto be no pressing reason for the concept to be restricted to bondfunds," he said. "On the contrary, fixed equity funds would surely beappropriate vehicles in which to attract a large number of newinvestors because - given the right hedging instruments - the investorwill get at the very least his own investment back."Approval for funds to invest in OTC options. This is a prerequisite forfixed-term equity funds. "The indications are that OTC options will beallowed and thus we expect limited-term equity funds to come too," Lauxsaid.However, Laux is less optimistic about the prospects for a "generallicence" which would allow mutual funds to invest across the range ofderivatives. Under the current system, each type of derivativeinstrument has to be approved separately."The existing legislation is too inflexible and sometimesinappropriate, so that some of the more recent innovations are notcovered, thus frustrating the introduction of many interesting fundstructures," Laux said. "If new instruments have to be expresslysanctioned by law, then there is always the possibility of a long-timelag between their introduction and when they can by used by mutualfunds."But Laux has been told by the finance ministry that the "generallicence" will probably not be granted until the Fourth FinancialMarkets Promotion Act, which is due in about 1998. The same goes forthe BVI's final demand of approval for feeder funds. "I can't rule outthat feeder funds won't be passed until the Fourth Act, but they arenot our highest priority, he said. "I think the ministry wants to waitfor further discussion (of this) at European level. It doesn't want toanticipate European law."Nevertheless, Laux is not unhappy with the results achieved from hislobbying efforts. "We know that the Finance Ministry has problemsbecause of a lack of qualified personnel. You can't get everything doneat once."The BVI chief is in no doubt about Bonn's"strong political will to helpGermany become one of Europe's leading investment centres. The FinanceMinistry is going to great lengths to promote Germany as a financialmarketplace," he said.Though German investment companies are already creating new products inanticipation of the new legislation, delays are likely. The ThirdFinancial Promotion Act will also encapsulate EU directives onsecurities and bank capital adequacy, and they must be implemented bythe end of the year if Germany is to avoid sanction.Moreover, securities and capital adequacy take priority at the financeministry as well as with the regulators. So while the Third Act will bepassed in the autumn, the sections relating to mutual funds willprobably not reach the statute book until the spring of 1997.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The firm will launch five newinternational equity funds this quarter, which it will market to bothUS and European investors. It will also introduce a convertiblecurrency product for its three off-shore money market funds, which areprimarily marketed to institutions in Europe.The eleventh-largest US fund provider, with some $65 billion in totalassets in over 250 funds, Federated now has just under $400 million ininternational assets. In the last five years, international assets havegrown from 1 percent to 5 percent at Federated, but the firm hopes thatfigure will move to 20 percent by the end of the decade.Given the recent US boom in international investing, and the imperativeof diversification, Federated sees its new global push as a necessarystep toward its goal of controlling 5 percent of the $3 trillion to $4trillion US fund industry by the year 2000. At the end of November,Federated had $63.8 billion in assets, or 2.3 percent of the $2.78trillion US fund market, according to the Investment Company Institutein Washington.Federated now manages two international funds and a global utilityfund, but in December, Federated registered five equity funds with theUS Securities and Exchange Commission. It expects them to be approvedby February. The new funds include a European growth fund, anAsia-Pacific growth fund, a Latin America growth fund, an emergingmarkets fund and an international small company fund. The new productswill bring Federated's total global offerings to eight and itsinternational equity funds to six.Last April, Federated created a new unit, Federated Global ResearchCorp., in New York, under the direction of international fund pioneerHenry Frantzen. Frantzen, 52, who brings 25 years' experience ininternational fund investing to Federated, previously worked for BrownBrothers Harriman, Oppenheimer Management and Yamaichi CapitalManagement.Frantzen began his money management career in 1971 at the $30 billionCollege Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). He built CREF's internationaldepartment from scratch, increasing the fund's international assets to$6 billion between 1978 and 1987. During that period, he achievedannual returns of nearly 23 percent, beating the Lipper internationalfund average by almost 3 percentage points.At Federated Global, Frantzen received a mandate to recruit a "dreamteam" of international managers. The idea was to create an investmentmanagement capability that could launch and manage any and allinternational funds demanded by Federated clients.In September, the new unit began by replacing Fiduciary Trust asadviser for Federated's International Fund, which had $196 million inassets under management at the end of 1995. (Federated also manages anInternational Income Fund with $184 million and a Global Utility Fundwith $11 million in international assets.)In the seven months following Federated Global's launch last April,Frantzen hired 25 staff for his New York office, including 12 portfoliomanagers, several coming from CREF.To give his new team full international flexibility, Frantzen hasorganised Federated Global along lines of geographic specialisation:for Asia and Latin America, Federated Global hired Alexandre deBethman, 33, away from CREF; Mark Kopinski, 39, from Twentieth CenturyMutual Funds for Asia Pacific investing; Frank Semack, 43, from OmegaAdvisors for European equities; John Kowit, 50, from John HancockAdvisors for international fixed-income securities; Tracy Stouffer fromCREF for small-mid cap international equities; and Jolanta Wysocka fromParametric Portfolio Associates/PIMCO Advisors LP for emerging marketsecurities.Given the collapse of the peso in late 1994, early 1995 might haveseemed like an inappropriate time to launch Federated Global in NewYork. But nine months later, following an excellent year on the USstock market and two lacklustre years for international equities, USinvestors are looking overseas for investment opportunities, andFrantzen believes he is launching his new line of international equityproducts at just the right time."The general overlay for the entire investment world today is lowinflation, particularly in Latin America," Frantzen explained. "Thetrend is being driven by the entry into the world market of 900 millionIndians who have become capitalists and 1.2 billion Chinese. Theopening of Russia and its extraordinary natural resources is anotherfactor."Frantzen's enthusiasm is so global that he is hard-pressed to isolateparticularly promising regional investing opportunities for 1996. LatinAmerica looks very good, with inflation down from 428 percent in 1993to an estimated 33 percent in 1995 and a projected 19 percent in 1996.The regional as a whole is reaping the rewards of democratisation andthe continuing reduction of import barriers. Brazil's import tariffsfell from 70 percent in 1989 to 14 percent in 1995, for example."In Latin America, we believe the markets are presenting us exactlywith a buying opportunity," Frantzen declared. He expects LatinAmerica's two recessionary economies, Mexico and Argentina, to recoverby 1997. He also projects regional GDP growth at over 4 percent in1997, up from an estimated 1996 figure of 1.3 percent.In the Asia Pacific region, Frantzen foresees a major turnaround forJapan, which has suffered four consecutive years of falling earnings.But he projects these to increase by 75 percent in the fiscal yearending in March 1996, and another 50 percent in the following fiscalyear. One of the first investment decisions Frantzen made when he tookcontrol of the Federated International Equity Fund in September was toshift its weighting of Japanese stocks from 18 percent to 37 percent.Following several poor years, Frantzen believes that Asian stocks arenow relatively cheaply priced. Growth and savings rates remainextremely robust, and continuing deregulation "in almost every country"augurs very well for the region as a whole. But Frantzen stressedthat"we have a healthy scepticism of some of the numbers you see comingout of China, although it is certainly a big growth area". Frantzenexpects to place major investments in India, where Federated has notplaced money so far.Frantzen is also bullish on the European Union, where he thinks fallinginterest rates, relatively high unemployment and low inflation, willdrive growth in the coming phase. He appears less enthusiastic abouteastern Europe and the Russian Federation, at least in the short term,however.In the US, Federated will market its five new equity offerings throughits traditional client network of broker dealers and other financialintermediaries. The company has no direct marketing arm and reliessolely on its client network for sales. The firm will pursue a similarstrategy in Europe, where it will push its international equityproducts, and particularly its Latin American investment expertise, asEuropean institutions generally view Latin America as the strong suitof US international managers.While it sees equity investing, especially in the context ofdefined-contribution savings plans, as the biggest long-termopportunity in Europe, Federated will also stress its convertibledollar money market products.In 1987, Federated registered two dollar-denominated money funds in theCayman Islands, and then redomiciled them in Dublin, after itestablished an office there in 1990. It has now registered three moneymarket funds (with $300 million in assets) and two long-term bond funds($100 million), all dollar-denominated, in Dublin, which it sees as aless expensive and more flexible regulated operating environment thanLuxembourg. Federated has outsourced custody and administration to Bankof New York's Dublin operation, which has a funds servicing jointventure with Allied Irish Bank.This year, Federated hopes to launch a currency product, which willconvert its dollar-denominated money market funds into 22 differentcurrencies, with State Street Boston handling currency swaps for thefunds.US-managed money market products are particularly attractive to largeEuropean banks, big US custodian institutions and US multinationalcorporations in Europe, given the growing demands for money marketinstruments in Germany and the UK, and the lack of fully liquidcommercial paper markets in those countries. Federated now offersinstitutions in Germany, for example, an additional 1.25 points ofyield over prevailing interbank rates.Federated's convertible approach differs from that of FidelityInvestments, which recently launched three money market funds inEurope, denominated separately in dollars, pounds sterling anddeutschmarks. Federated believes that its approach offers far greaterflexibility in the 15 European Union markets, combined with advantagesof scale.As in the US, Federated will rely solely on financial intermediariesfor its retail products. The firm cited the example of Fidelity, whichattempted to market its funds directly in France in 1988, and thenrelaunched its funds marketing through a wholesale distributionstrategy last year.In France, Federated is targeting large domestic banks, which stillcontrol some 50 percent of retail funds distribution, as well asbrokers and insurance firms. In 1994, Federated began to advertise in arange of French and international financial publications, includingGlobal Investor, La Tribune des Fosses, and Le Figaro.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

State Street will replace Brown Brothers Harriman,which had been Magellan's custodian since the fund's inception in 1963.State Street had previously administered four small Fidelity funds withtotal assets of some $4 billion. The bank's custody clients alsoinclude Alliance Capital, Merrill Lynch, GT Capital and Invesco.The addition of the largest US equity fund could provide State Streetwith up to $10 million in additional fee revenue, where the bankcharges two basis points on assets under custody. The bank is alreadythe world's largest fund custodian with some $2.3 trillion in assetsunder custody at the end of 1995, up 32 percent from the previous year.(Assets under management in 1995 stood at $226 billion, up 41 percentfrom 1994.) State Street reported total 1995 fee revenue of $297million, or 73 percent of total revenues.In late December, State Street announced the formation of a new custodyunit, which will unite all of the bank's custody operations, includingline and support areas and State Street's corporate systems andtechnology group. The unit will be run by David Spina, whom StateStreet promoted to president and chief operating officer in December.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Analysts said the firm couldfetch up to $1 billion.In late 1992, Clayton Dubilier bought Van Kampen Merritt of Chicagofrom Xerox for $415 million, and later merged the asset manager withAmerican Capital Management & Research, which it bought in mid-1994from Travelers for $430 million. The combination of the two groups,which sell their funds only through broker-dealers, was intended tocomplement Van Kampen's bond-heavy product line with American Capital'sstock funds.But the combined assets of the two firms have lost market share,falling from 1.52 percent of the US funds market to 1.37 percent in thetwo years ending in the third quarter of 1995, according to FinancialResearch Corp. in Chicago. While Van Kampen's municipal bond specialityhas lost its appeal due to the global bond correction in 1993 and morerecent expectations of US tax reform, American Capital's equityofferings have failed to post the high returns that attractperformance-hungry US investors.Meanwhile, star manager Michael Price has also hired Goldman Sachs forthe purpose of selling his money management firm, Heine Securities ofShort Hills New Jersey, which owns the $13 billion Mutual Series fundgroup. Heine, whose accumulation of Chase Manhattan stock in early 1995pushed the bank to merge with Chemical Banking last year, wants to sellout so that he can"personally rattle the cages of stodgy companies",according to sources quoted in Business Week in early January.But Price's investment savvy is seen as Mutual Series's greateststrength, and some investment bankers believe his fund group couldfetch $400 million if he continues to manage its assets -as much asdouble the price Heine Securities might get if he leaves.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

StateStreet's cross-town 401(k) rival Fidelity Investments launched anin-house employee benefits unit early in 1995.Whereas defined-contribution pension plans allow corporate clients todispense with investment risk and all pension servicing duties, "totalbenefits outsourcing" allows them to dispense with health insuranceadministration and other employee services. Employees and retirees ofcorporations using such a service receive convenient and integratedservice through a single toll-free telephone number.Through its new venture with Watson Wyatt, State Street hopes toattract more corporate pension clients and fend off the competition ofinsurance firms who are leveraging their mutual fund and 401(k)operations with integrated health insurance services.Watson Wyatt has been in the benefits outsourcing business since 1991and now serves some 3 million employees from US firms such as Nynex,Rockwell International and Westinghouse. The alliance will also allowState Street to enter the benefits outsourcing business with a fullbenefits technology infrastructure in place.State Street is now the third-largest 401(k) provider in the US, aftermutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard Group (which together accountfor some 20 percent of the entire US defined-contribution pensionmarket). According to Cerulli Associates in Boston, State Streetmanaged $28.2 billion in 401(k) assets at the end of the third quarterof 1995, or 4.7 percent of the total market.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Investors who wish to follow GIT's portfoliopostings can access the firm's home page on the World Wide Web athttp://www.gitfunds.com.At present, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requiresfund companies to disclose their full portfolios only twice a year. Theagency also requires all funds to report daily changes in their netasset value, meaning that they must already calculate the value oftheir portfolios on a daily basis.But the SEC is now considering a proposal to require money market fundsto disclose their holdings quarterly, and has asked for industrycomment on whether more frequent portfolio disclosure would helpinvestors. The advantages of more frequent portfolio disclosure werehighlighted in early December, when managers of Fidelity's flagshipMagellan fund were caught publicly praising securities they were in theprocess of selling.The Investment Company Institute (ICI), a funds trade group inWashington, has opposed further disclosure on the grounds that it wouldharm shareholders by adding a needless expense to fund management andwould reveal trading strategies to competitors. The ICI believes dailydisclosure would be especially burdensome for large fund families andwould hurt firms that must make big trades over a number of days toavoid market turbulence.Some fund executives have argued that GIT's daily disclosure policy isrelatively easy for a small firm, and serves primarily as a marketingtool for attracting investor interest.But GIT executive vice-president Charles Tennes responded that dailydisclosure serves the interests of his firm's shareholders by allowingthem to scrutinise the company's statements and strategies more closelyby evaluating them against its managers' market moves. Tennes also saidcompetitors cannot take advantage of disclosures of trades made theprevious day.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Itis being marketed to Japanese institutions and individual investors byNomura Securities, which raised $400 million for the fund before theinitial offer period closed on December 20.Fidelity said that over the next several years, it plans to launch avariety of new Japanese investment trusts with different investmentobjectives.Fidelity's new investment trust will seek to achieve long-term capitalgrowth, using a bottom-up investment style. The fund's prospectusrequires that 65 percent of assets be invested in Japanese equities.Fidelity named Shigeki Makino, who has managed the US-based FidelityJapan Fund since 1994, as the manager of the new investment trust.Fidelity is positioning the new fund as a long-term investment vehicleand has given it an unusual structure: the fund will be closed for thefirst year, and will impose a 1 percent fee on redemptions in thesecond and third years.Fidelity is the second US firm to receive a Japanese investment trustlicence, following Morgan Stanley, which got its licence in October andplans to launch a Japanese investment trust shortly. In addition, fournon-US foreign firms - SBC Warburg, Jardine Fleming, Schroders andInvesco - have received licences and launched Japanese investmenttrusts.The new launches come at a time when Japanese investors are beginningto look to foreign firms for superior investment returns, given therelatively poor performance of domestically managed funds. But theJapanese market presents foreign fund providers with some distributionchallenges.Investment trusts are sold in Japan only on commission bybroker-dealers, a highly concentrated channel that forces foreign fundsto compete with the house products of distributors.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

For one smallnew investment partnership, however, falling markets have provided newopportunities. Noel Fung reportsVALUE PARTNERS may be just a small Hong Kong-based fund managementboutique. But it beat the rest of the pack by grabbing the award forbest performing Hong Kong equity manager last year.It managed to lose less money than its competitors in 1994, probablythe worst year experienced by the Hong Kong market since 1982.According to Micropal, its flagship "A" fund fell by 11.9 percentcompared with the 30 percent sustained by the "average" fund managerand the 31 percent fall experienced by the Hang Seng Index.Value Partners has a single mission - value investing in Asia andespecially in Hong Kong. The key to its performance to date has been tobe unconventional. "We typically invest in weird and unpopular stockswhich people despise," said Cheah Cheng Hye, Value Partners's managingdirector.It considers itself an investment company which uses a distinctbottom-up approach to identify undervalued companies rather than simplyfollowing overall market trends.Indeed Value Partners sees itself as something of an investmentpawnshop, soaking up stocks which sellers are desperate to dump. Sharesare sometimes disposed of almost discriminately by "top-down" and"momentum" players desperate to exit the market at almost any price.Value Partners will be only too happy to buy these stocks at bargainbasement prices and wait for the recovery, both in earnings and fromthe recovery of stock prices.Cheah Cheng Hye, a former financial journalist, has also been the Asiahead of research for Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank now ownedby Deutsche Bank. He quit the bank early in 1993 to establish a fundmanagement company with Yeh V-Nee, an executive director of Hsin ChongInternational, a Hong Kong-listed construction company. Value Partnerswas the result.The ownership of the company is split three ways between Cheah ChengHye, Yeh V-Nee and Holding Capital Group, a US-based associationcomprised of businessmen, professionals and corporations, with officesin New York and Florida.Currently Value Partners operates with just six staff, including Cheahand two analysts. "We rely exclusively on our own research to generatestock selections," said Cheah. It searches for "bombed out stocks",that is stocks where all the bad news has been fully discounted by themarket.Investors in the "A" fund are typically US and Switzerland-basedinvestment professionals. The minimum investment is $100,000. To datethe fund has $32 million under management.In addition to the "A" fund, Value Partners manages a number ofsegregated portfolios for institutional investors and high net worthindividuals mainly drawn from the US.The company's non-conformist style runs further than stockpicking,however. Its own capital is also invested in the"A" fund. If itsclients lose, it will lose twice over. Not only will its fees - whichare performance-related - suffer. It will also lose its own capital.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Jean Claude Broustra reportsTHOUGH 1995 was not the most auspicious year for French fund managers,this did not prevent Cortal, a bank, brokerage and investment housewhich distributes exclusively through direct media, from making furtherprogress.During the course of the year it increased funds under management byFr1.1 billion ($220 million) to Fr17.5 billion, as well as expandingits customer base. At the end of 1995 it was servicing 171,000customers, a 10 percent increase on the previous year. Of this total136,000 were "exclusive" to Cortal. The remainder were introduced byits business partners elsewhere within the Paribas and CompagnieBancaire groups, which it is part of.Cortal's vigorous expansion over the last 18 months is mainly due tothe speed at which it has espoused discount broking, still something ofa novelty within the French market. Its discount broking service, or"Centrale des Placements", which was introduced in mid-1994, enablesCortal customers to buy directly any shares or bonds listed on theParis stock exchange. They can also purchase Sicavs (open-end funds)managed by any French bank, insurance company or investment house.Overall, dealing costs and commissions are substantially lower thanthose offered by conventional brokers.The remarkable success of the Centrale des Placements shows a cleardemand for this type of facility. In just a year, the volume of fundsCortal manages through this service almost doubled and now accounts forFr2.6 billion in total. Of this Fr1.8 billion emanates from securities(shares and bonds), and Fr0.8 billion from Sicavs managed by otherasset management institutions.But the true extent of Centrale des Placements's popularity isillustrated by the fact that it currently accounts for almost 70percent of all new investments purchased through Cortal. 0f these thevast majority are for stocks and shares. These account for 50 percentof the 70 percent. The remainder come from external Sicavs.The main reason for the success of discount brokerage is its fee andcommission structure. Unlike other bank brokerage operations such asCredit Lyonnais (Fr63) and Societe Generale (Fr108), Centrale desPlacements doesn't impose a fixed minimum brokerage charge. Althoughthe minimum fee per order charged by Cortal (Fr46) is higher than thatof Societe Generale (Fr30) - though still lower than that of CreditLyonnais (Fr52.28) - commission rates (exclusive of tax) areconsiderably less at Cortal, especially where large transactions areinvolved.Societe Generale charges a standard 1.3 percent on all transactions,with Credit Lyonnais charging 1.22 percent for transactions belowFr10,000, and 1.01 percent for anything above this figure. Cortal'scustomers have to pay 1.15 percent on transactions up to Fr100,000,0.75 percent on the part between Fr100,000 and Fr500,000, and only 0.1percent on anything above this. This "sliding" fee scale was introducedquite recently to attract big clients.Custody fees are also lower at Cortal than at other brokerages. Theannual fixed commission per stock (including tax) is Fr38.18 at SocieteGenerale, Fr33.56 at Credit Lyonnais, but only Fr15 at Cortal. SocieteGenerale charges commission of just over 0.2 percent (including tax) onthe value of each portfolio held and Credit Lyonnais 0.19 percent.Cortal only charges 0.15 percent.In addition to the Centrale des Placements, Cortal offers its customersa range of other investment services. These include Sicavs, managed onits behalf by Credit du Nord, by Cardif, another Paribas subsidiary,and by Paribas itself.Cortal offers a range of fund money market, bond and equity Sicavswhich incorporate the entire maturity spectrum: short-term (investmentsof less than two years); medium-term (between three and five years);and long-term (more than five years).Short-term consists of: the Compte Optimal and the Compte a Terme.Medium-term consists of: Obligations Convertibles, France Rendement,Mone 40, Interets Trimestries, Eurocap, France 40, Parfrance andObjectif Monde. Long-term consists of: Cortal Pierre, CortalCapitalisation, Cortal Croissance Garantie and Contrat Majeur.Among the new services which Cortal has introduced to its customerssince is Service Optimal Placements. This keeps customers informed,through diagrams, graphs and pie charts, about the composition andperformance of their investment portfolios. The system used is known asthe "tableau de bord de l'epargne". It also provides customers withexpert personal advice, a regular assessment of the performance oftheir Sicavs, and advice about establishing a personalised savings andinvestment strategy of their own.Another service called Contrat Majeur Independant Retraite, which alsodates from 1994, is targeted at members of the liberal professions andother groups to build up a complementary tax-free retirement pensionwithin the framework of the Madelin law on social protection.A third, known as the Compte a Terme Cortal, which was launched in1995, offers guaranteed returns to investors. The return becomesprogressively higher in proportion to the size of the investment andthe length of time it is held for.At its inception the Compte a Terme entitled the holders to a taxallowance of Fr8,000. This has been withdrawn for 1996, but investorsstill benefit from a more favourable tax regime. Nonetheless, withinterest rates beginning to fall in France, this option is lessattractive than before.The most recent product launch was France Rendement, a Sicav thatinvests exclusively in French government securities. It replaced asimilar product called Rendement Trimestriel. A major differencebetween this and the new product is that Rendement Trimestriel providedonly one distribution option - a straightforward payment of dividends.The new product allows dividends to be reinvested or capitalised.Cortal also has operations in France and Luxembourg. Cortal BankLuxembourg is a subsidiary of the Cortal and Paribas Luxembourg banks.It was established two years ago and offers a wide range of investmentproducts. Its main service is the Compte Optimal International. Thisoffers deposit accounts in a variety of currencies, and personalisedportfolio management.Since 1992, Cortal has also had a 49 percent minority share in theCortal Bank Belgium. This also offers a wide range of investment andfinancial services at very low prices. The majority shareholder isParibas.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ian Orton reportsTHE RELATIVE merits of value and growth-orientated investment styleshave generated considerable debate among both academics andprofessionals. For the moment, at least, it would appear thatproponents of the value-orientated school would appear to hold theadvantage, especially in the US.Apart from the impressionistic evidence provided by well-known valueinvestors such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch, there is also asubstantial body of statistical evidence to confirm the view that avalue strategy will outperform a growth-orientated strategy over themedium to long term. The value-growth spread associated with the S&P500 index, for example, has averaged 320 basis points per year over thelast 20 years.According to David Umstead, managing director of Boston InternationalAdvisors, similar results can be obtained in non-US markets. He hasdeveloped a set of value and growth indices for 20 equity markets inEurope and the Pacific Rim and tracked their performance over theperiod 1974 to 1994. The system is known as the BIA Europe/PacificValue, Growth and Market Indexes.The results, which he presented at the recent Global InvestmentManagement '95 Conference, are emphatic. "A dollar invested in the BIAEurope/Pacific Value Index on December 31 1974 would have grown to$24.96 by December 31 1994 - an unhedged annualised rate of return of17.5 per year over the 20-year period. By contrast, a dollar investedin the BIA Europe/Pacific Growth Index grew to only $11.11, an averagereturn of 12.8 percent. The value index outperforms the growth index byan average of 470 basis points per year. Furthermore the spread isquite consistent."Examining the year-by-year performance of the two indices, Umsteadfound that the value index outperformed the growth index in 16 yearsout of 20 and produced lower volatility. The value index standarddeviation is 17.61 percent compared with 18.14 for the growth index.The largest positive value-growth spread is 17.22 percentage points in1988, and the largest negative is 7.13 points in 1980. The other yearswith negative spreads occurred in 1984, 1986 and 1991. There is noobvious pattern to the negative spread years. One occurred in a yearwith phenomenal returns (1986), two in average years (1980 and 1991)and one in a below-average year (1984).To provide greater insight, Umstead has divided the geographicalcomponents of his indices into three sub-groups: Europe; Japan; andPacific-ex-Japan. He found that the value-growth spread is quiteuncorrelated from region to region. Value-growth spreads are, howevermuch greater in Japan and the Pacific than in Europe.The end value of 3.77 for Japan meant that the value half of theJapanese market outperformed the growth half by nearly four to one. Thevalue half of the Japanese market delivered a return of 20.2 percent ayear over the last 20 years, compared with 12.5 percent achieved by thegrowth half.Umstead has identified five reasons why value beats growth. The firsttwo are consistent with rational behaviour and simply maintain thatinvestors may be concerned with attributes other than pre-tax risk andreturn."1. Value stocks have an inferior tax status. Because of this, taxableinvestors demand a higher return for value stocks.2. Value stocks have an inferior comfort-level. This also leads to theneed for value stocks to offer a higher return."The last three relate to various types of behavioural errors which stemfrom the fact that value stocks tend to be from companies with weakbalance sheets and income statements. "3. This leads to pessimisticextrapolations of future earnings and dividends which in turn leads topleasant earnings surprises.4. The weak financial statements also lead to the conclusion that thecompany is a bad company and therefore the stock is a bad investment.This in turn also leads to pleasant surprises.5. And finally this real financial record makes value stocks much moresusceptible to Monday morning quarterbacking, It is more difficult toexternalise blame if value stocks perform poorly."But how do active investors identify value stocks? Umstead uses anextremely straightforward approach when it comes to constructing hisindices. The key variables are the price-to-book ratio and marketcapitalisation. Companies are ranked in ascending price-to-book ratiountil their combined capitalisation amounts to half of total marketcapitalisation. These are value stocks. The remainder are growthstocks. The process is repeated annually and the indices arereconstructed accordingly.Within the BIA Europe/Pacific Indices, countries arecapitalisation-weighted, as are the stocks within countries.Rolling five-year performance of the BIA Europe/Pacific Value andEurope/Pacific Growth Indexes.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightFUNDS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INDIA BECKONSIndia is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for both directand portfolio investment. Dr Shanta Acharya reviews the government'sprogress in making the country more investor-friendlyTHE STRUCTURAL adjustment programme begun in July 1991 by thegovernment of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has been successful instimulating the scope of the private sector, as well as expanding tradeand attracting foreign investment in India.The economic liberalisation of India was initiated partly in responseto structural problems in the economy. The Indian government facedserious fiscal and external imbalances which had generated double-digitinflation at the beginning of the decade. Despite significantassistance from multilateral and bilateral agreements, foreign exchangereserves had fallen to $1 billion - or two weeks of imports - by June1991, pushing the country to the verge of defaulting on its externaldebt obligations.The reform programme precipitated by this crisis focused on the capitalintensity of India's historical growth process and was aimed atcurtailing its dependence on the unsustainable and unproductiveexpansion of the public sector. The country's relatively highinvestment rate had failed to show a matching, much less a sustainable,growth in output and employment.The aim of India's new economic reform agenda is to reverse thisvicious cycle by policies that will usher in a virtuous cycle of growththrough higher productivity and investment.Over the past four years, we have seen a commendable improvement inIndia's current and capital external accounts, accompanied bystructural reforms. To sustain the momentum of this process requires aconcerted effort to strengthen public finances, improve investment ininfrastructure, and encourage private investment to flow into crucialareas of the economy.It is also of crucial importance that the reform agenda filters down tostate government level. In the next stage of reform, fiscal prudence atthe centre needs to be complemented by individual states. In thisrespect the forthcoming general election will be crucial inconsolidating the success of the government's initiatives to date. Thegovernment's consensus-building approach in instituting economicreforms will ensure that the liberalisation process, though slow, isalso irreversible.Capital market reformsMr Narasimha Rao's Congress government started to liberalise the Indianeconomy with an agenda for reform that attempted to address thestructural inefficiencies that militated against investment. Thisfocused on trade policies, the financial sector, taxation and publicenterprises.This has resulted in a planned transformation of the Indian capitalmarket to enable it to assume an integral role in the allocation ofcapital within the nation's growth plans for the future. Thoughfrustratingly slow, change is discernible.Policy reforms covering the free pricing of new issues, the flotationof Euroissues, foreign institutional investment in Indian companies,the establishment of private sector mutual funds and the privatisationof state-owned companies are starting to have a discernible impact onthe capital market and the investment environment.The key issue of setting up a central depository to facilitate a smoothtransfer of the ownership of shares will have a dramatic impact ontrading when it is put in place. A high level of poor delivery,issuance of duplicate shares and problems relating to share transferand registration, particularly after a stock market scam in 1992,continues to plague the market. This limits confidence in the marketmechanism.Long-standing troubles in India regarding stockmarket infrastructurecontinue to thwart portfolio investment. This has made it difficult forforeign direct investment to flow into the country.It is inevitable that in this process of transformation of the economy,there have been more losers than winners. Nonetheless, it is expectedthat over the next five years, the newly elected government will bemore able to address the vital issue of infrastructural constraints tofacilitate the smooth flow of capital within the economy.Any investment decision, however, is ultimately linked to therisk-reward ratio that the individual investor determines for himselfor is prepared to tolerate over a stipulated period. This is partlyinfluenced by rational expectations within an economic framework thatenables the investor to identify the opportunity early enough to use itadvantageously. The need to distinguish between the performance of theeconomy and that of the stockmarket requires a high level ofdiscipline.While a long-term investment horizon is always desirable, it isespecially prudent to take into account the overall valuation of themarket when swimming in the rough seas of emerging markets. Overheatedmarkets are best avoided. Market fundamentals are often distorted byshort-term money flows. With the increasingly international nature ofcapital flows, it is vital to understand the various cycles in themovement of funds flowing into the real economy as distinct from thestock markets.Volatility can provide opportunities. In illiquid markets, activetrading may not prove to be such a winning strategy, however. For thosefund managers, asset allocation strategists and individuals interestedin investing in India, the critical task is understanding the economicopportunity and timing one's entry into the market accordingly.Poor stock market performanceWhile the fundamental resilience of the Indian economy is reflected ina series of economic data - from industrial output growth, exportperformance to corporate earnings - the stockmarket has been in thedoldrums due to a lack of liquidity.The Bombay Stock Exchange 30 Index declined about 30.7 percent indollar terms in 1995 but at the current level is offering investorsgood value. Valuations are reasonable at 12 times March 1996 earnings,with EPS growth of 20 percent estimated for the year to March 1997. Theimpending general election, which is expected to take place in April1996 will continue to restrain market sentiment but will also providegood buying opportunities for the long-term investor.The economy has responded positively to the structural adjustmentprogramme but macroeconomic stresses pose fresh challenges to policy.Real GDP growth recovered from 1 percent in 1991-92 to 4.3 percentbetween 1992 and 1994, and over the next two years is expected tomaintain the 6 percent achieved last year. Industrial production, afterremaining stagnant in 1991-92, recovered to grow by a modest 2.3percent in 1992-93 before surging by 8.5 percent in 1994-95. It isexpected to rise to around 9 percent to 10 percent over the next twoyears.Exports, having declined marginally in 1991-92, rose by 20 percent in1993-94 and by 18 percent in 1994-95, and are also expected to sustainthis pace over the next two years. Imports were severely hit byrecession and the structural adjustment plan in 1991-92. Both impactedadversely on industrial captilisation rates, leading to a contractionof 18.8 percent. They recovered quickly to grow by 11.9 percent in 1992-93 and by 6.5 percent in 1993-94, before surging by a further 21.3percent in 1994-95. Imports continue to show a strong rising trend,reflecting the recovery of demand in the economy and are expected torise by 25 percent in 1995-96.India's current account deficit also improved substantially to a mere0.1 percent of GDP in 1993-94 and 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994-95. Thedeficit is expected to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1995-96 but thenrecover marginally in 1996-97.At $4.1 billion, foreign investment (of which portfolio investment was$3.13 billion) rose sharply, resulting in a rise in the foreignexchange reserves to $15 billion by March 1994 and $20 billion by March1995. The subsequent slow-down in foreign investment may have been ablessing in disguise for India's policymakers, as management of foreignexchange reserves was posing a serious challenge.External competitiveness was beginning to be compromised. The rupee hadbeen virtually pegged at 31.37 to the dollar until mid-September 1995when the authorities allowed it to rise to 33.7. The rupee ratecurrently stands at 34.5.The monetisation of reserves has produced a sharp expansion in themoney supply. This resulted in a growth rate of 22.2 percent betweenMarch 1993 and March 1993. Coupled with increases in administeredprices, the inflation rate rose from a low of 7 percent in mid-1993 to10 percent in March 1994. As a consequence the real exchange rateappreciated. With industrial recovery in place, non-oil imports startedpicking up at a faster rate, and the larger current account deficit putdownward pressure on the currency, leading to the devaluation of therupee.The current trade and current account deficits do not pose any realconcern as foreign exchange reserves remain high at $17.5 billion inDecember 1995 or approximately six months of imports. Money supply hasbeen running higher than planned for some time, however. It increasedby 17.5 percent during 1994-95 but the slow-down in foreign exchangeinflows helped in restraining subsequent growth. Money supply growth isexpected to amount to 16 percent for 1995-96.Inflationary pressures have abated in the short term. Inflation isunlikely to rise above the 10 percent level.While the government is vigilant and the Reserve Bank of India hasresponded by maintaining tighter liquidity conditions at present, theinflationary battle can only be won by streamlining the financialposition of the states and the public sector enterprises. Thepolitically sensitive reforms required to address restrictive labourlaws, formulating bankruptcy laws etc can only be dealt with after theelections.Increased spending in an election year has forced the government toissue ad hoc treasury bills to fund the budget deficit, however,despite an agreement concluded with the central bank in September 1994to end the government's automatic access to such a form of financing byMarch 1997.The planned phasing out would have significantly enhanced monetarycontrol and severed the link between the expansion of bank credit andthe budget deficit. This reversal of government policy implies that thefiscal adjustment process will take much longer than anticipated.Stabilisation policyIn July 1991 the prime objective of the government was to stabilise theeconomy. This was achieved primarily through cuts on subsidies,defence, capital expenditure and loans to states and publicenterprises. The government deficit was reduced from 8.4 percent of GDPin 1990-91 to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1992-93.Much of this progress was lost in 1993-94 as the fiscal deficitescalated to 7.7 percent of GDP against a target of 4.7 percent, as aresult of revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns. The gross fiscaldeficit stood at 6.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95 and is unlikely toimprove significantly over the next year.The worse-than-expected fiscal performance could undermine thecredibility of the economic programme. Interest payments claim abouthalf of the central government's revenues. The financial sectorreforms, as well as the declared intention of the government to reduceits borrowing from the central bank over the next three years, willincrease the rates of interest currently being paid on government debt,further aggravating the situation.While the reneging of its commitment to reduce its dependency on thecentral bank for cheap credit for deficit financing during thisfinancial year may help in the short term, it does not inspireconfidence in the government's ability to contain its fiscal imbalance.More importantly, it tends to crowd out private sector borrowing,investment and the subsequent growth of the real economy. In addition,a limited fiscal adjustment has passed the burden of economicstabilisation onto monetary policy.The government's ability to curb expenditure is seriously hampered bythe fact that interest payments, defence, wages and grants and loansaccount for almost 70 percent of non-plan government expenditure.Furthermore, these are mandated by the constitution.The government's expectation of economic recovery in its last budgetseems to be paying off; the fiscal deficit will be lower than lastyear's level. Lower excise duties and interest rates have resulted inrecovery in household consumption as is evident from a lower savingsratio and healthy sales in consumer durables. A rise in importssimilarly signals a recovery in private sector investment. If, however,equity-raising by companies continues to be thwarted by marketconditions, the tide of investment into the real economy may not gathersufficient momentum over the medium term.Taking into account the infrastructural constraints of the economy,however, this may not be such a problem in the short term. Besides,constant fundraising by companies via issuance of shares not only leadsto EPS dilution but investor fatigue as well.Boosting private investmentThe fiscal deficit continues to be the government's main challenge anda real threat to India's economic prospects. The 1996-97 budget will beManmohan Singh's sixth. While continuing with the structural adjustmentprocess, his last budget emphasised a shift towards stimulatinginvestment so that economic recovery would help consolidate thegovernment's fiscal position.To lower the user cost of capital, import tariffs on capital goods weresignificantly reduced, corporate taxes were lowered and the excise dutyregime was reformed. The removal of barriers to private sector entry inareas previously reserved for the public sector was also initiated,although the progress achieved has been limited.The irony is that what has withheld private investment is not so muchthe high cost of capital but high idle capacity in sectors whereprivate investment could have been used, such as manufacturing.Meanwhile in areas where there is mounting urgency to expand capacity(this is particularly the case in relation to infrastructure), a policyand institutional framework supportive of private investment has yet tofully evolve. While Indian firms have raised capital through GDRissuance and convertibles, not all the amounts raised have found theirway back into the real economy to stimulate output and employment.As these funds get invested slowly, the recovery of the economy to the6 percent to 7 percent GDP growth level is sustainable only as long aspolicy continues to attract and stimulate investment. There is littlescope for the Finance Minister to accelerate the pace of reform untilafter the election.While the budget in February will provide an excellent forum for theCongress to highlight its achievements since 1991, politicallysensitive policy decisions cannot be taken in an election year.Although India's saving rate is running at around 20 percent of GDP,the heavily regulated financial system has meant that savings have notnecessarily flown into the most productive sectors. The government hastaken steps to address this issue by reducing the extent to whichcommercial banks are forced to hold government debt, rationingsubsidised credit to priority sectors- so bringing it more in line with market rates - and relaxing controlsover banks' lending decisions.The inflationary impact of the fiscal deficit is the key issue for thegovernment. Thus any savings made by the central and state governments,together with nationalised industries, will not only help containfiscal imbalance but reverse the anti-investment bias of the fiscaladjustment programme. This has produced a declining trend in publicinvestment since 1991-92, the year in which the programme commenced.As a result, the generation of employment opportunities by the publicsector has not been feasible and, as mentioned earlier, the privatesector has not been investing as a result of excess capacity inindustry. Gross domestic capital formation declined from 24 percent ofGDP in 1991-92 to 20.4 percent of GDP in 1993-94.While the annual growth rate between 1981 and 1991 was 16.3 percent perannum, gross domestic capital formation grew at only 4 percent perannum between 1992 and 1994. The whole question of labour reform canonly be addressed seriously when the government is in a position togenerate greater investment and employment.Investing in IndiaA country's economic performance is usually judged over decades ratherthan the over latest business cycle. A nation's economic strength isgauged not only by its macroeconomic performance and the profitabilityof its corporations but by the overall prosperity of its people. Withpopulation growth at 2 percent and an annualised real growth innational income of around 4 percent since independence, growth inIndian per-capita income has lagged behind that of other East Asiancountries.In the Indian context, the investment case rests on the fact that pastperformance provides no true guide to future prospects. India is poisedto enter a phase of sustainable GDP growth of around 6 percent to 7percent a year. With population growth expected to decline further fromthe current 1.9 percent per annum, per capita income should risesubstantially over the next decade.With 20 percent of the world population and the sixth-largest economy,India cannot be ignored. Her democratic ideology, the availability ofexisting legal and accounting infrastructure along with the prevalenceof English as a common language provides for a level of investorcomfort not to be found in either China or Russia, for example.The Economy's Response                        1991-92  92-93  93-94  94-95  95-96  1996-97Real GDP Growth %        1.1      4.3    6.2    6.4    6.2    6.2Gross domestic capital formation as % of GDP  23.6     22     20.4   19     19     20Gross domestic savings as % of GDP            23.1     20     20     21     21.5   22Growth in industrial production %            0.0      2.3    6      8.5    9     10Budget deficit as % of GDP                     5.9      5.7    7.7    6.6    6      6Inflation               13.5      9.6    7.5   10      8      9Export growth %         -0.9      3.1   20     18     20     20Import growth %        -18.8     11.9    6.5   21.3   25     23CAD/GDP %               -0.4     -1.8   -0.1   -0.7   -1.5   -1.2Debt service ratio      25       28.6   25.3   27.1   27     26Foreign exchange reserves ($ billion)   5.6       6.4   15.07  20.81  17     18Sources: CMIE and the author's estimatesFunds investing in IndiaFund                    Fund Manager       Fund size  Fund currency                                           ($USm)Atlas Inde              Fin Atlas           40.00     FRF20/20 India Fund        20/20 Fund Mgt       6.14     GADBarings Peacock Fund Ltd                    Barings             46.60     USDBombay Fund             Barclays            35.47     USDChescor Indian ICL Smaller Cos            Chescor             19.25     USDClariden India          Clariden            13.56     USDColumbus India Fund     Columbus Asst Mgt    3.70     USDDresdner-Thornton India Thornton            12.42     USDFleming Indian Investment Trust       Fleming             41.94     USDGovett India            Govett & Co         27.61     USDGT Indian Smaller Cos A USD              GT                  20.90     USDGT Indian Smaller Cos B USD              GT                  20.90     USDHTR India Fund          Henderson Touche    14.00     USDIndia Focus Fund        Citibank            14.79     USDIndia Fund A            Unit Trust of India 51.73     GBPIndia Fund B            Unit Trust of India 80.47     GBPIndia Fund Inc.

The Treasury's report says BICs are an example of how "pass-through"insurance can create competitive inequities.    "In recent years, banks have begun to offer a product similar to GICs(guaranteed investment contracts), called bank investment contracts, orBICs, which explicitly take advantage of pass-through deposit insurance asa marketing tool," the report said.   The report acknowledges that banks can effectively manage the greaterdegree of interest rate risk from BICs through contract limitations andhedging strategies.    The problem remains, however, that BICs are fully insured by thegovernment.    "This provides banks with a new opportunity to attract large depositsby expanding the use of the government's guarantee," the Treasury said.    "Meanwhile, insurance companies offering GICs totally outside of thesafety net do not have this competitive advantage," it said.   The Treasury report also said banking organizations should be permittedto offer BICs to pension fund managers, but without extending to themfederal deposit insurance.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991U.K. REGULATOR MAY WIDEN MORTGAGE-BACKED MARKETBritain's building societies and mortgage lenders are confident thatthe Building Societies Commission will reverse its proposals for thecontinued exclusion of sterling mortgage-backed securities from the listof instruments that thrifts can hold as liquid assets.    A favorable decision will provide considerable new support for themortgage-backed securities market in Britain, giving greater placementdepth to the market and increasing overall market liquidity,securitization specialists say. The ban was originally proposed in aconsultation paper issued by the Commission, the industry regulator forthrifts, late last year. It proposed several amendments to the BuildingSocieties (Liquid Assets) Regulations of 1987, which sets the assets thatbuilding societies may hold as liquid, easily divested assets.    Mortgage-backeds were among the securities it ruled were not suitableto be classed as liquid holdings. It said the mortgage-backed market inBritain was not sufficiently developed to provide "an appropriate" mediumfor thrifts' liquidity management.    The Commission determined that assets must provide maximum capitalcertainty and must be fully marketable. It said this must be achieved bythe assets having daily quoted, freely available prices and should betraded on a recognized money market or stock exchange.    Mortgage-backed securities tend to be held by institutional investorsto maturity, resulting in relatively low levels of trading and, therefore,limited market liquidity, specialists say. When the mortgage market was inits early stages in the mid-1980s, it was easy to understand why theproduct should not be included as a liquid asset. But the market nowtotals 9.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) in outstanding issues and isconsidered well established, its promoters say. The Commission has askedits members to give their views on the liquidity issue and these responsesare now being studied. An official announcement is expected within threemonths.    The Council of Mortgage Lenders, keen to see the development ofmortgage-backed securities, has previously voiced concern over theCommission's ruling. Council members believe that mortgage bonds shouldfully qualify as liquid assets, as Class-1 securities which carry thehighest rating.    "Given the depth, quality, trading activity and number of marketmaking brokers in mortgage-backed securities, there seems no reason whythey should not be treated as first-class assets," a source at onemortgage lender said. When the Commission was reviewing last year whethermortgage-backeds should be reclassified as Class-1 assets, thrifts andother mortgage lenders were convinced the regulator would decide toinclude the securities. A substantial amount of lobbying has been takenplace on the issue, which should result in the Commission agreeing tooverturn the proposal, specialists say.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991SWISS BANK GROUP BACKS $500 MILLION MICHIGAN NOTESKaren PierogMichigan last week sold $500 million of general obligation notes thatfeatured an unconditional standby note purchase agreement provided by aconsortium of three Swiss banks.    The standby agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.and Credit Suisse obligates the banks to provide funds for the principaland interest payments on the notes in the event that money in the state'sset-aside fund for the issue are insufficient. The banks' participation inthe note issue is split into thirds.    Susan Kish, a vice president at UBS, said that unlike a normal standbypurchase agreement, the pact between the banks and Michigan isunconditional.    "In a normal standby purchase agreement, there are usually conditionsthat have to be satisfied before the facility can be drawn, such as noevent of default or bankruptcy," she explained. "In this agreement,neither of those is applicable."    Kish said the only conditions the state must meet are legal onesinvolving the state's obligation to repay the banks.    The notes were priced last week by a Prudential Securities Inc. groupto yield 4.60% to the Sept. 31, 1991 maturity. The were originally pricedto yield 4.65%, but strong investor demand for the notes enabled theunderwriters to trim the yield by five basis points.    State officials made the decision to place a credit enhancement on theissue about two weeks ago. The state had originally planned to sell thenote issue unenhanced last month but delayed the pricing because of a Feb.6 state appellate court decision that called into question $450 million ayear of the state's single-business tax revenues, according to NickKhouri, the state's deputy treasurer.    Khouri said when Gov. John Engler, on March 5, proposed a revenueneutral amendment to the tax that would counter the fiscal effects of thecourt ruling, the state decided to proceed with a credit-enhanced cashflow borrowing to speed up the process.    "We wanted to do the deal as quickly as possible at the highestrating," he explained, adding that arbitrage considerations, which wouldearn the state $25,000 a day, were also a factor in moving quickly on thedeal.    The state also had to contend with the fact that on January 23,Standard & Poor's Corp. placed $3.14 billion of state debt on CreditWatchwith negative implications, after the state Legislature and the Engleradministration reached an impasse over dealing with a current year budgetdeficit.

In this excerpt,Moody's describes some of its credit analysis methods for ratingindividual corporate guarantors.Organizational Structure    A corporate financial guarantor's overall structure is an importantconsideration in determining its ultimate ability and willingness to meetpolicyholder obligations. As a starting point, Moody's analysts review allof the company's operating units on a consolidated basis and examine anyintercompany reinsurance that may be in effect.    To understand the true economic risk profile of the operation, thecompany's reinsurance assumptions and cessions and the expense allocationsof individual companies are reviewed on a consolidated basis. Thisanalysis recognizes that most insurers have sufficient financialflexibility to move corporate resources to individual subsidiaries, givingthem the ability to support weak units. Despite company-specificrestrictions which may be in effect, the confidence/sensitive nature ofthe public debt market provides the insurer with a major incentive to makegood on claims of all its affiliated operating corporations.    The activities of non-operating insurance units are also reviewed. Forexample, the debt-to-equity ratios of holding companies or othersubsidiaries that have issued debt are examined, as are their debt servicecapabilities. Potential demands under expected and stress conditionsshould permit the company to meet its obligations and still allow adequatesubsidiary capital growth for business expansion. The key objective ofthis analysis is to determine the insurer's true economic costs; amountand type of affiliated reinsurance; and amount and holders of any debt.Management has sufficient discretion within the regulatory structure topermit the obligations or resources of affiliates to affect the insurer'sown ability to perform on policyholder obligations.    While asset quality has primacy over other financial factors, earningsare critical to a bond insurer's long-term creditworthiness because theywill dictate the company's ability to generate sufficient capitalinternally or to maintain access to external sources of capital to meetfuture needs.    Corporate bond insurers do not generally have a standard premiumstructure dictated by regulations. The starting point in analyzing thequality of earnings is an assessment of the company's statutory accountingcompared with existing practices elsewhere in the financial markets. Inthe U.S. markets, bond insurance premiums are typically priced in relationto their value in reducing the debt issuer's total debt service cost.Accordingly, while large up-front premiums are common in the municipalbond insurance market, the predominance of shorter-term and amortizingdebt service in the corporate markets has meant that more premiums arereceived annually. In essence, premiums represent a contractually agreedrate multiplied by the periodic balance of principal (or debt service)outstanding. It is not uncommon for corporate bond insurers to charge alarger first-year premium with subsequent renewals at lower rates.Capital Adequacy    This key factor is best measured by relating the insurer's losspotential to total capital (surplus plus contingency reserves). New YorkState has established standards for the maximum risk-to-capital ratio;risk is defined as aggregate policyholder limits or insured par. For mostbond insurers, this equals total debt service, or the entire amount ofdebt issued. These regulations differentiate various types of underlyinginsured obligations, with capital requirements varying between $300 ofrisk to $1 of capital (municipal), to $100 of risk to $1 of capital(corporate). Note, however, that from the credit analyst's point of view,this gross measurement of risk has several major shortcomings.    First, reported statutory risk for partial bond coverage versus 100%coverage need not be consistent with true loss potential. This riskmeasurement problem is similar to that experienced by first-loss lettersof credit or subordinated securities; although the dollar volume of theobligation is important, it does not necessarily reflect the likely losseson a pool of assets in the event of default.    Second, the loss potentials of transactions, even within a particularcategory defined by regulators, can vary dramatically. Third, neitherrepayment sources nor temporal, geographic or originator diversificationis captured by the statutory risk measurement.    Many other factors can vary significantly among companies and shouldbe considered within the unique context of a particular managementstrategy, including the size of the unearned premium reserve, compositionof revenue between renewal and up-front premiums, the term of existinginsured exposures, and the quality of investment assets. Because of theinteractive nature of portfolio losses, revenue generation and thehistorical position of a company, the impact of these factors frequentlycan be clarified through computer simulation. Simulations are viewed asonly one of many tools necessary to assess the risk profile of a companyeven when transaction quality estimates are available.    Moody's model for corporate bond insurers incorporates historicalstatutory balance sheet and income statements for an individual company,company specific insured portfolio characteristics related to sector, andthe quality and contractual elements of reinsurance. The model can alsoproject a variety of outcomes depending on assumptions on key variablessuch as premium rates, volume of business written, loss development andquality, seasoning, and sector characteristics unique to the company.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991FDIC INSURANCE STUDY OUTThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released a study on bank depositinsurance that includes sections on how the private sector mightparticipate in the program in the future, according to George E. French,chief of the financial markets section in the FDIC's research department.    "The private insurer would set the premium rate and the FDIC wouldbase its premium level on the private insurer's risk estimates," Frenchsaid. He added that the full premium might not be downstreamed to theprivate reinsurer.    The FDIC has met with the staff of Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., who hasproposed legislation to reform deposit insurance, French said.    The FDIC's report does not contain an extensive discussion of stateinsurance systems or moving to a purely private insurance system, Frenchstressed. Moreover, the technical aspects of how contracts should bewritten has not begun.    The Treasury report's suggestion for the FDIC to do a pilot project,which would include several banks and insurance companies, was favorablyreceived, French said. "We've already met with members of the municipalbond insurance industry and their ideas are very useful," he said.    Financial guaranty industry executives interested in receiving a copyof the report can contact French at 202-898-3929. Industry representativesinterested in participating in any pilot projects can contact FDICchairman L. William Seidman or W. Roger Watson, director of research.    "We're presented with an opportunity to become a part of history bycooperating with the U.S. government and helping form policies that willguide the financial services industry into the 21st century," a seniorexecutive of a financial guaranty company said. "I think the industry mayshake its head in disbelief, years from now, if we miss this opportunity."Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, STRESSED BY ENHANCE UNITGuaranty Risk Services Inc. acted as financial adviser on about $58million taxable and tax-exempt principal and interest last year that wasinsured by Asset Guaranty Reinsurance Co., according to Kenneth C.Sherman, GRS senior vice president in charge of originations.    While GRS acknowledges the dollar amount is not large compared to theamounts insured by the major monoline financial guarantors, the firm ispleased with the high quality of the deals it did. "Given the real estatemarkets, we could have done a ton of deals, but not with the same creditquality," said a GRS spokesman.    GRS, a subsidiary of Enhance Financial Services Group, was formed lastyear to originate and underwrite deals that are subsequently insured byAsset Guaranty. That insurance is rated triple-A by Duff & Phelps Inc.    "The differential between unenhanced and Asset Guaranty enhancedtransactions has been roughly 200 basis points," Sherman added.    To date, deals originated and underwritten by GRS have all been realestate related. GRS is interested in smaller, middle-market transactionsthat have a high credit quality.    "We do not originate deals that primary insurance companies wouldinsure," Sherman said.    Currently, GRS has about $60 million in deals in its underwritingpipeline and several should appear in the market during April. GRS'average deal size is between $3 million and $10 million.    Most of GRS' deals have been multifamily housing transactions thatrefund or restructure existing debt.    "GRS will not accept construction, lease-up or refurbishing risks,"Sherman stressed. Issues can be structured with these risks if an approvedthird party is willing to take the risk instead of GRS, he said.   GRS is finding its business growing at a fast pace because regionalinvestment banks around the nation are trying to find credit enhancersfollowing the pullback by banks and savings and loans in providing lettersof credit. Additionally, the government enhancement programs are moving ata "sluggish" pace, Sherman reported.    Not only are regional investment banks welcoming GRS, Sherman said,but the investment community is referring deals to it.    "Investors are doing their due diligence, and the depth and level ofGRS' underwriting has prompted some investors to send deals to us," heexplained.    GRS' underwriting department has several criteria that must be met.First, underwriters look at the cash flow and demand debt coverage ofgreater than 1.25 times. Additionally, the loan to value ratio must notexceed 75%. "These two criteria work together because a deal with a 90%loan to value is not going to have 1.25 times the coverage," he said.    Finally, GRS requires an equity contribution from the developer,typically at least 10%, Sherman said. This equity contribution makes itharder for a developer to walk away from any deal. GRS-approvedtransactions usually have a maturity of 10 to 12 years.    During 1990, GRS acted as financial advisor to Asset Guaranty, whichinsured the following transactions:    * $9.36 million multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds forMankato, Minnesota. The placement agent was Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.,and the underlying credit support was provided by the Highland Hills ofMankato Limited Partnership Project.    * $1.7-million industrial development revenue bonds for theDevelopment Authority of Cartersville, Georgia. The sole underwriter forthe transaction was Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. The bonds aresupported by the Nantucket Industries Inc. project and are subject to amandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2001.    * $8.9-million industrial development refunding revenue bonds for theIllinois Development Finance Authority. Donaldson, Lufkin & JenretteSecurities Corp. and Young Capital Corp. were co-underwriters. The $8.5million tax-exempt series-A refunding bonds and $400,000 series-B revenuebonds are supported by the Orleans-Institute Place Associates Project.    * $6.78 million of multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for theNorth Dakota Housing Finance Agency. The deal was managed by Dain BosworthInc.     * $6.8-million Series-1 commercial development revenue refundingbonds and $470,000 Series-2 taxable commercial development revenuerefunding bonds for the Port Authority of St. Paul, Minn. Dain Bosworthwas sole manager. Fort Road Medical/Irvine Park Towers Project providedthe underlying credit support.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991FSA-BACKED PROGRAM BOOSTS AUSSIE SECURITIZATION    An Australian special-purpose corporation that carries creditinsurance from Financial Security Assurance is planning to sell its secondand third offerings of asset-backed securities.    The corporation, known by its acronym, SAFE - for Secured AssetFunding Entity Ltd. - was set up last year by Bankers Trust Australia Ltd.to offer a quicker way for issuers to securitize both mortgage and nonmortgage assets through a standardized format.    Securities issued through SAFE are backed by FSA and the StateGovernment Insurance Commission of South Australia. FSA is the seniorguarantor of the pro-gram, and securities issued through it are triple-Arated. South Australia is rated double-A-plus.    So far, one issue has been done through SAFE - last November, a $100million (Australian) offering by Town & Country W.A. Building Society wasbacked by residential and commercial mortgages. That deal consisted offive-year fixed bullet bonds.    In the latest transactions, retailer David Jones is planning tosecuritize credit card receivables, and the St. George Building Society isoffering mortgage-backed bonds. FSA would not confirm that either deal isin the works.    The Jones securitization is a resurfacing of a financing plan thatFrance's Societe Generale was putting together last year. Originallyplanned to be launched internationally out of Hong Kong, the A$180 milliontransaction will be now be issued through SAFE in the Australian domesticmarket.    A dealer group of seven banks is participating in the transaction,with Societe Generale acting as arranger.    St. George is pressing ahead with a mortgage-backed transaction,totaling about A$200 million. When the SAFE concept was first announced,it was expected that St. George and Beneficial Finance would launch issuesearly in 1991. But Beneficial's plans are on hold, apparently due to loanloss problems among affiliates in the Australian banking system.    Sources say the new transactions will help popularize the concept ofsecuritization after some recent setbacks in Australia, including doubtsover a special vehicle devised by Schroders Australia Ltd., which wouldhave been Australia's first internationally rated vehicle for securitizedmortgages. The entity was named PUMA, for Pooled Unlisted Mortgage Assets.Schroders initially hoped to raise A$50 million through it by the end of1990. But the difficulties in the Australian bond market promptedSchroders last month to cancel its plans to enter the secondary mortgagemarket.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991GLOBAL GUARANTY INSURED-UNINSURED SPREADS[TABLE](As of Thursday, March 21, 1991)                        5 year    10 year    20 year    30 year Revenue    Insured      5.75      6.35        7.15      7.20 Bonds      Single-A     5.99      6.55        7.35      7.40 G.O.

Indeed, the Boston-based mutual fund has kept pace withincreased cash inflows even as senior vice president Fred Cavanaugh hasscaled back high yield holdings as a percentage of the firm's StrategicIncome Fund.     "The technicals are in fantastic shape," said Cavanaugh,who manages the Strategic Income fund and oversees all of John Hancock'sjunk purchases. "There's a lot of interest [in high yield bonds] fromcross-over buyers from the high-quality corporate sector and we've seen atremendous amount of interest from retail investors."     Faced with looming credit concerns, however, Cavanaugh hasreduced the diversified portfolio's high yield allocation to roughly 40%from the "high to mid-40's" a year ago. Beyond some $200 million indomestic high yield securities, the Strategic Income fund also containsinternational debt, governments and preferred stock.     John Hancock holds nearly $1 billion in high yield bondsamong its Strategic Income, High Yield and High-Grade Bond funds, thelatter of which currently holds some 15%-20% in junk bonds. All told, thefirm manages pver $16 billion in assets for retail  and private investors.Bullish Near Term     Despite rising default rates and the reduction of exposurelevels, John Hancock's expectations for the coming year in the high yieldmarket aren't especially dire. Cavanaugh remains "constructive" on creditfundamentals for the first half of 1996 and is "more cautiously optimistic"regarding the latter portion of the year.     "We should see sufficient economic activity to support cashflows, even in the cyclicals" during the first portion of the year,Cavanaugh said.     This view has been bolstered by the recent price increasesposted by several steel and paper issuers. "A little bit of inflation canbe good" because it indicates healthy demand and bolsters short-termprofitability, Cavanaugh said.     Away from cyclical issues, Cavanaugh looked for each sectorof the telecommunications market including cable and paging to continueposting strong performances as their product offerings and user marketssteadily mature.     Despite this generally positive outlook, Cavanaugh hastaken several moderate steps to reduce credit risk by shortening high yieldmaturities and turning to higher coupons.Reining In Credit Risk     "Higher coupons tend to temper the pricing change needed toget a particular yield," Cavanaugh said. "But if you run into a distresssituation, [the security] will begin trading strictly on a price basis, soit offers little or no protection" in a default scenario.     Otherwise, the firm has gravitated toward the strongernames and more senior paper in the cyclical sectors. Hancock hasn't pushedcredit quality above the single-B level since cross-over buying hasinflated double-B pricing and driven down yields, Cavanaugh said.     Hancock has also rotated into overseas debt, which hasrisen from roughly 30% to 40% of the Strategic Income fund. Internationalpurchases have included some sovereign issues from Western Europe and highyield corporates such as the UK cable offerings.     "It's in a growth stage comparable to where we were eightor nine years ago, and there are some fairly well-heeled investorsinvolved," Cavanaugh said of the set of UK cable deals.     Meanwhile, Cavanaugh has avoided the retailing andrestaurant sectors of the domestic high yield market, where he predicted adifficult operating environment going forward.     "I would want to see the fourth quarter numbers,particularly for the retailers, before I'd change my view," Cavanaugh said."I'm not expecting robust results out of any of them, so it could be asector to avoid this year."Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH YIELD REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996PUERTO RICAN BANK TAPS MARKET VIA 144A OFFERINGAfter eyeing the market throughout 1995, FirstBank ofPuerto Rico became the second bank from the island to issue subordinateddebt last December.     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100million offering of 10-year subordinated notes with a coupon of 7.625% at99.277 to yield 7.730%, or 200 basis points over Treasuries.

Standard & Poor's lowered its marks for 126 domesticspeculative grade issues totaling $93.8 billion and upgraded 142 seriesworth $108.5 billion during 1995. Moody's Investor Service, meanwhile,downgraded 123 speculative grade securities equaling $25.3 billion whilegranting higher marks to 100 issues of $37.26 billion.     The figures compared favorably with those seen at the endof the last economic expansion and should bode well for delinquency ratesduring 1996, several analysts said.     "Further deterioration seems likely. However, the magnitudeof the losses should fall well short of the numbers seen in 1989 and 1990,"said Moody's senior economist John Lonski. During that period, downgradesmore than doubled upgrades in dollar terms, Lonski said.     S&P's 1995 results reversed the previous year's totals, inwhich downgrades outpaced upgrades in terms of both number and dollarvolumes. Although the number of Moody's downgrades exceeded upgrades in1995, the ratio of upgrades relative to downgrades improved on a dollarbasis and reached its highest level in 12 years. (See table, page 3.)     "If it weren't for the retailers and the manufacturers ofnon-durable consumer goods, we would have had many more upgrades thandowngrades" in 1995, Lonski said. Indeed, Moody's downgraded 70 such issuestotaling $23.6 billion while uprgrading 24 issues worth $16.4 billion lastyear.     Moreover, the dollar amount of fallen angels dropped to$9.83 billion from $12.9 billion even though the number of issues increasedto 12 from a record-low nine in 1994, according to Moody's. The ratingagency promoted 24 issues totaling $10.8 billion from speculative toinvestment grade, compared to 17 issues representing $10.8 billion in 1994.     These high yield numbers coincided with an overallimprovement of corporate credit quality during 1995, according to S&P.Overall, the rating agency upgraded $210 billion in industrial debt anddowngraded $118 billion. Upgrades were concentrated in automotive,chemical, health care and high tech industries while media andentertainment, consumer products and retailers bore the brunt of the ratingreductions.Gradual Credit Decline?     Despite these encouraging numbers, both agencies registereda higher number of speculative grade downgrades for the third straightyear. Moreover, the dollar amount of S&P high yield downgrades climbed forthe fourth time since 1991.     While these trends have more recently coincided with higherdefault rates, most observers linked the increased downgrade activity tothe issuance of smaller parcels of riskier debt.     "You have had a significant increase in single-B debt, sothat would contribute to the higher numbers," said Diane Vazza, director offixed-income research at S&P. Vazza added that the abundance of first-timeissuers over the past several years also contributed to the accelerateddowngrade activity.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH YIELD REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MARKET SURVIVES TOUGH WEEK;  GROWING CALENDAR NEXT OBSTACLEThe high yield market survived yet another week largelyunscathed despite the fact that the long bond jumped from 6.04% to 6.15%and the Dow skidded by over 100 points by Thursday's close.     Replete with fresh insurance allocations and new inflowsfrom mutual fund buyers, the high yield sector welcomed its first issuanceof the year and once again weathered downturns in other capital markets andthe continuing budget standoff.     "Most people have a lot of money to put to work right now,so they're buying yield first and credit second," one high yield tradersaid. Indeed, several dealers reportedly lightened their positions inanticipation of rougher market conditions later month.     Following light trading earlier in the week due to theblizzard conditions along the entire East Coast, secondary volumes reachedmoderate levels by mid-week. Aggregate high yield prices lost roughly aquarter point on Wednesday as the 30-year bond widened to yield 6.19%before tightening on Thursday following a slight comeback by both the stockand Treasury markets to finish essentially unchanged for the week.     Typical January favorites casinos and steel continued tolead the gainers, although several market players questioned the lattertrend given recent declines in auto sales. "People bulled up [on steel]with the price increases, but the demand for autos will determine whetherthat sticks or not," one trader said.Issuance Resumes     The continued strength of the high yield sector relative toother markets could be short-lived with upwards of $5 billion in issuanceexpected during the coming weeks.     Merrill Lynch priced the first deal of the year, launching$125 million for Young Broadcasting with co-manager JP Morgan. Originallysized at $100 million, the offering bore a 9% variable-price coupon andcomes due in January 2006.     Further issuance failed to materialize, although deal flowwas expected to begin in earnest this week with 21 road shows totaling over$5.2 billion reportedly underway or scheduled before the end of the month.     "That's a lot of issuance for this market to get through,so I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction," one high yield tradersaid. "The second half of this month should be a lot tougher than thefirst."     Heavy deal flow could stretch into February and even March,several market players said, as issuers rush to lock in the cheaper fundingafforded by low rates.     Moreover, the rumored closing of the SEC due to the budgetimpasse could spur issuers to crowd the market during the next six weeks,several traders added.Deals, Deals, Deals     Salomon Brothers will burst from the blocks with a fullslate including $100 million from APS, $450 million from MFSCommunications, an $800 million multi-tranche offering from Sprint Cellularand a $175 million transaction from Miami-based Telemundo, several sourcessaid.     Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette should also post a big Januarywith a jumbo $1.1 billion, six-tranche offering from El Paso Electric Co.The Texas utility will issue five series of BB-/Ba3 first mortgage bondsand a sixth level of preferred stock to finance its reorganizationfollowing bankruptcy, sources said. DLJ will also reportedly lead $120million in nine-year senior subordinates from Doane Products with a five-year non-call period.     Merrill Lynch was expected to return with a $150 millionoffering from Rogers  Communications that was originally slated for lastweek but pushed back to Friday or early this week by the blizzard.     Otherwise, the underwriter also reportedly held the books forthree Rule 144A offerings: a $115 million deal from steel producer BarTechnology, a $200 million offering for Hollinger Publishing and $75million from BE Aerospace.     Hotel issuers expected before the end of the month includedPrime Hospitality with $120 million through Smith Barney, a $127 milliondeal from Courtyard Marriott via Lehman Brothers and a $165 millionoffering from Coast Hotel & Casino lead by Bear Stearns.     Smith Barney also held the reins on a $100 million offeringfrom financial company First Nationwide, sources said.     The issuance calendar will apparently be rounded out with a$100 million offering from Chancellors via Bankers Trust, a $120 milliondeal from Dynacare through Citicorp, $150 million from InterCel throughMorgan Stanley and $650 million in Riverwood International debt led byChemical Securities.

Theprocess will begin in 1996 and over time, it is intended that the newstructure will comprise all of the national practices around the world.The aim is for the consulting group to be a unified global entity withits own profit centre, owned by all of the group's consulting partners.However, the accounting practices will continue to organise theirprofit centres along national lines.Late last year, DTTI announced that the UK and US consulting practiceswere to join forces as the first stage in the creation of the newconsulting group (IAB 175). Last September, D&T's US member formallyannounced the establishment of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, andthe UK firm will make a similar announcement in London on February 1.A spokesman for DTTI said that "delicate ongoing" negotiations aretaking place with other European members but it could be two years ormore before those firms sign up to the global entity. Othergeographical regions are having similar talks, he said, although all ofthe areas are at "different stages" of negotiation.Both Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group and Deloitte & Touche willcontinue to operate under the international administrative umbrella ofDTTI.Serge Audouin, DTTI's head of management consultancy for Europe, said:"Initially, this is a management integration; the financial split willcome later. This is driven by the need to globalise our practice inline with the way clients are operating." The move depends on theapproval of the partnerships in some countries, including the US.Meanwhile, Touche Ross, DTTI's UK member, is considering following thelead of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young by converting to a limitedliability partnership (LLP) with its legal base in Jersey (IAB 177),sources within the firm said.But, since the necessary changes to Jersey law have yet to be enacted,the firm is unwilling to make any public announcement. The sources saidTouche is hoping the prospect of seeing accounting firms set upoffshore will prompt the UK Government into changing UK law to allowLLPs, preventing the need for a move to Jersey.Touche is also set to change its name. The firm will be known asDeloitte & Touche. Until now, the Deloitte name in the UK has belongedto Coopers & Lybrand after the worldwide merger of Deloitte Haskins &Sells and Touche Ross fell through in the UK in 1990, and the DH&Spractice was snapped up by C&L.Originally, the Deloitte name was not to be available to Touche untilthe end of 1996, but C&L agreed to an earlier date.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Members, however, were given thego-ahead to use the chartered title.The ACCA spent the Christmas holiday chewing it over and duly announcedthat it is changing its name to the Association of Chartered CertifiedAccountants, or ACCA for short.Following the Privy Council's decision, the ACCA hierarchy decided thatit would be best for members to be known as Chartered CertifiedAccountants, hence the new corporate name.

It will also consider the wider issue of combattingcorporate fraud.The government first proposed giving statutory immunity to auditors whoreport suspected fraud in 1994. The immunity, which would be similar tothat currently enjoyed by auditors of banks and securities houses,would enable auditors to report their suspicions to the authoritieswithout fear of being sued by their clients.Originally, the law was to have applied to both listed and non-listedcompanies. But, in a progress report issued last autumn, the governmentsaid it would narrow the scope of the legislation because of the"highly complicated issues" involved.According to Louis Wong, HKSA executive director and registrar, thegovernment has now decided that the law should apply to quotedcompanies only.Wong stressed that the new law will not put auditors under anyobligation to report fraud. "It only applies in the event that theyreport it," he said.But accountants are still worried that the immunity will createproblems for their relations with clients."We are concerned that an expectation might be created to seek outfraud and that it might unfavourably affect the trust between theclient and the auditor," outgoing HKSA president Nicholas Etches toldthe AGM.A survey conducted by KPMG last year shows that fraud is a growingproblem in Hong Kong. The firm found that 80 percent of respondingcompanies thought the incidence of fraud would increase, compared with70 percent a year earlier. Some 77 percent said fraud is a"seriousproblem", up from 62 percent in 1994.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The firm, ISIK Yeminli Mali Musavirlik, whichwas previously unaffiliated, provides BKR with Turkish representationfor the first time.ISIK, which joined the BKR network towards the end of last year, postedfiscal 1995 revenues of TL16 billion ($270,000), an increase of justover 52 percent on 1994.The six-partner firm operates out of one office in Istanbul and employs12 professionals and three support staff. Fifty-five percent of feeincome comprises audit and accountancy work, with tax contributing 30percent and other work the remaining 15 percent.BKR targeted Turkey because of the steady growth in its economy as wellas its growing links with the European Union. "Turkey has developedclose links with the European Union and may one day be a full member,"said Charles Tucker, BKR's London-based secretary.There was a growing demand among BKR's European members, particularlyin Germany, for representation in Turkey.BKR's search for a suitable firm took 12 months, according to Tucker,who said ISIK was selected from a short list of two. The firm waschosen because of its size and profile, and the fact that ithas"definite expansion plans" outside Istanbul played a key role in thefinal decision. It is also longer established than the other firmswhich were under consideration.Many of ISIK's clients are in the textiles, shipping and consumerproducts industries. Work for multi-national clients currently accountsfor about 25 percent of its revenues. No list of clients is available.In IAB's annual world survey last month, BKR ranked 20th with revenuesof $341 million, an increase of 10.7 percent on 1994.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The group has all butformalised arrangements with Levitt Kirson, the CKL (now known as AGNInternational) member firm, and Josman & Seidel, one of three HLBaffiliates there.The two firms, which will give Nexia coverage in Johannesburg, Durbanand Cape Town, are forming an association of independent firms with athird member likely to be added in Port Elizabeth later this year.The combined fee income of the firm will add about R13 million ($3.6million) to Nexia's global revenues. Levitt Kirson's Johannesburgoperation, which has eight partners and around 45 staff, had 1995revenues of roughly R6 million, according to managing partner LennieFurman, while the firm's Durban office, which has two partners andaround 12 staff, had revenues of between R1.5 million and R1.8 million.The two are separate profit centres.Josman & Seidel, meanwhile, has revenues of roughly R5.5 million. Thefirm has eight partners and a total staff of around 50.Each of the firms will use the Nexia name in conjunction with their own- the first time that Nexia has allowed its affiliates to use its name.Previously, the Amsterdam-based group prohibited the use of its titleso as to shield the network from any possible litigation.Nigel Hodges, Nexia's executive director, said the change of heartfollowed legal advice. "We have taken legal advice both from the US andthe UK and the lawyers said there would be very little extra exposureby having a link name used by members," he explained. "We just have tomake it clear that we are an international firm of separate independentaccountants."Nexia's board of directors will meet in South Africa on March 10 and 11to rubberstamp the use of the Nexia name, and to formally approve bothfirms' applications.Initially, the local firms will operate independently of each other.According to Furman, the firms will have a common staff trainingpolicy, undertake joint marketing campaigns and tender jointly forcertain work.Furman cited dissatisfaction with CKL as its reason for quitting. "Wewere unhappy with the CKL situation," he said. AGN, into which CKL hasmerged, has "still got a long way to go to reach the size of Nexia", headded.Nick Blake, AGN's chief executive, said he was "disappointed" at thenews of Levitt Kirson's departure although it was not "totallyunexpected". He has arranged a meeting on January 18 with anunaffiliated firm in Cape Town in the hope that it may fill the gap.Sonny Josman, Josman & Seidel's managing partner, said the local firmsmay eventually merge."I would think we will make a decision on thatwithin the next three years," he said. According to Josman, thefederation may expand into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe if suitablefirms can be found.HLB's chief executive, Peter Frost, said incompatibilities betweenJosman & Seidel and its Johannesburg member, Freedman Scher, resultedin the split of its federation.In addition to losing Josman & Seidel, Alleson & Company, HLB's Durbanaffiliate, has also given notice to quit. Frost said replacements inCape Town and Durban have already been lined up, although he declinedto name them. He was planning to meet with at least one of theprospective firms on January 15 in Johannesburg.Nexia has never had a presence in South Africa, although one of itspredecessors, Spicer & Oppenheim, was represented by Fischer HoffmanStride until 1990 when the local firm switched to Pannell Kerr Forster.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ernst & Young chairman Philip Laskawy said: "Frivolouslawsuits in the past have drained resources from economic activitiessuch as research and development and new investment that fuel businessgrowth. Those with legitimate securities claims still have recoursethrough our legal system. By eliminating meritless lawsuits, the newbill will make the American economy more productive and efficient."A statement from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountantssaid: "The passage of this legislation is testament to the widely-heldbelief that the tide of frivolous securities litigation in this countrymust be stopped and sanity restored to a legal system clearly out ofbalance."This bill is a fair balance between the rights of truly- defraudedinvestors and those start-up companies and outside professionals whohave become victims of a small group of entrepreneurial lawyers abusingthe legal system."The bill had been awaiting the signature of the US President when IABwent to press with the final issue of last year (IAB 177), andproponents of the reforms were confident that Clinton would sign itinto law.However, he chose to veto the legislation under enormous pressure fromconsumer groups and trial lawyers.In the end, the veto was too late as both houses of Congress were ableto override his decision. The House of Representatives had backed thebill by 309 votes to 100 - 29 votes more than needed for the override.The Senate vote, 68 votes to 30 in favour, eventually proved sufficientto override the president's decision having originally fallen justshort of the total required.The new law is designed to eliminate routine filing of class actionlawsuits against public companies with no more evidence than a sharpdrop in stock price. It will also prevent the targeting of defendantswith"deep pockets", without regard to their culpability.The legislation provides a new safe harbour provision forforward-looking statements to encourage companies to provideprospective information without fear of litigation so long as thosestatements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied bymeaningful cautionary statements identifying factors that could causeactual results to differ materially from those projected.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

In February oflast year, KPMG's UK affiliate dropped the Peat Marwick name from itslogo (IAB 157)."Our new name will provide us with a single strong identity worldwideand help us to assist our clients to compete even more effectively inboth the Irish market and overseas," said managing partner JeromeKennedy.The SKC partnership was founded in 1972, although the firm's roots canbe traced back to 1876 when Stokes Brothers was formed. It became theIrish member of Peat Marwick International in 1980, and became theIrish representative of KPMG in 1987 following the global merger withKMG.SKC operates as one partnership in Ireland, unlike most of its Big Sixrivals which have separate entities north and south. The firm operatesout of four offices, employs over 800 people, and had fiscal 1995revenues of IR#36.2 million ($58 million), a drop of just over 1percent on the previous year.KPMG's move means that Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse is the only oneof the Big Six in Ireland to retain the local firm's name as part ofits identity.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

David Porter reportsIT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, andonly now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients towestern fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with thelocal Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to dobusiness. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keepingcontrol of that growth and turning it into profits is a differentmatter.Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, withfiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking evencurrently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according tomanaging partner Duleep Aluwihare."We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some ofour more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage tocontinue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run outof investment opportunities."Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one ofthe few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although itplans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice orCracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In orderto set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going tomaintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve inthis marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticketitems," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basicwork, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clientsinclude Poland's Finance Ministry.Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrandand Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived inPoland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess whenthe firm should start making a profit.Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking to IAB last July beforereturning to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We'renot just here for a financial return on investment, we're here to makesure that Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking atopening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of themarket, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firmhas acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bankand of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successesinclude the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, whichraised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing groupOkocim.PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgetedto start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After fiveyears in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-nationalcompany investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growthis running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where thefirm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clientsinclude Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatisedBank Gdanski.Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some timeare KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche."We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner BillDrysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where weare largely self-sufficient."Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at BarentsGroup, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of newclients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firmrecently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run itsGerman practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have afully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said."Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics groupSiemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polishclients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurancecompanies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices inCracow and Poznan during the last year.At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits getsshort shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm hasalways been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financialsupport from outside, other than very small amounts. All the otherfirms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they haveX amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of itsrivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw andSzczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is aheadache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line."Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It'sdifficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated intoa corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standardsright way."E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as muchbusiness as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when ithired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T."These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speakonly with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Oftenyou'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,all the rest will follow."The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in thePolish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is thesmallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strongposition in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firmtook action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz ashead of the Polish business (IAB 151). Leslaw Paga was head of thePolish Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is surethat Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitelyenhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said."There've been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its positionin Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industriesand service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong positionin financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say wewere latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"he explained.Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bankand of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in thebanking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk andCracow during 1995.Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four othermid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co-ordinatingpartner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "thesort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging withanother firm.He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name theprospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to anothernetwork. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we arelooking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with aheavy UK or English language capability," he said.Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switchedinternational affiliations from CKL International to Alliott PeirsonInternational during 1995 (IAB 171). Baltic Accountants continues toalso represent RSM International and GMN International.The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issuefor many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firmslike to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to localclients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing inPolish equity partners than others.Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firmholding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and USaffiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has beengiven the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, whileKPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managedfirm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly owned by Deloitte ToucheTohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent fromthe start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the localpractices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agreethat fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gapbetween what western firms are charging and what local clients arewilling to pay is narrowing.One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment mustpay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet themarket half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper localfirms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it firstarrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in"strategic situations".Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of awestern-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came intoeffect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accountingprocedures more into line with International Accounting Standards andto move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on taxcompliance.Another area where western accountants are making more encouragingnoises is in relations between the international firms and the localChamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when thechamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted tothe chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners thatPoland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shuttingnew blood out of the profession.Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences beingmended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciaksaid. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of coursethere will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bitfrightening to them."While the situation regarding audit training and exams remainsunacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamberwill rethink its approach.Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous inadmitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems tohave gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably bereviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said."And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all partof the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make surethe chamber is a strong and active body."Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and thatthe growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feelsthat this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We allexperience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."Poland: Key Economic indicators                                  1994   1995*   1996*GDP real (% change)                5.1      6.0     5.0Industrial output (% change)      11.9     12.0    11.0Inflation (% change)                32       29      22Unemployment rate (%)             16.0     14.6    14.0Average monthly wages (ZL/month)   460      620     780Trade balance ($/M)               -836   -1,000  -1,500Current account ($/M)             -944   -1,400  -1,900Exchange rate (ZL/$)              2.27     2.50    2.85* ForecastSource: CreditanstaltLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND - FEE INCOME                                      Most    Previous                                      recent  year's                                      fee     fee      Growth Effec-                       International  income  income   rate   tiveFirm                   affiliation    (US$/m) (US$/m)  (%)    dateArthur Andersen(1)     AA & Co, SC    20.0(2) 15.0(2)   n/a   Jul 95KPMG                   KPMG           12.0     7.8     53.8   Sep 95Coopers & Lybrand      C&L            11.0     7.7     42.9   Dec 95Ernst & Young          E&Y            10.0(2)  6.5(3)   n/a   Jun 95Deloitte & Touche      Deloitte Touche                       Tohmatsu                       International   9.9(4)  6.5(4)  52.3   Dec 95Misters Audytor        Summit          1.1     n/a      n/a   Jun 95TG Consultants         TGI             1.0(3)  n/a      n/a   Dec 95Sadren                 Pannell Kerr                       Forster         0.8     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Moore Stephens - RIR Revision        Moore Stephens  0.7(3)  n/a      n/a   Dec 95BDO Binder             BDO             0.6     0.4     50.0   Dec 95Baltic Accountants and Consultants       API, GMN, RSM   0.5     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Potworowski Kinast     Grant Thornton  0.5     0.5      0.0   Dec 95BRA Salustro Reydel    RSM             0.4     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Interexpert Poland     IA              0.4     n/a      n/a   Dec 94Tax-Audytor            Pannell Kerr                       Forster         0.3     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Arnold Hill            HLB             0.2     0.2      0.0   Apr 95Staniszewski & Richter Moores Rowland  0.2     0.2      0.0   Sep 95PNA Audit-Union        IGAF            0.0(2)  n/a      n/a   Dec 94(1) Figures do not include Andersen Consulting(2) Estimated by firm(3) Estimated by IAB(4) Figures exclude IDOMn/a = not availableNOTE: Other firms were contacted but did not respond.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996CAPTURING THE '90S SPIRITSpencer Lanthier, KPMG Canada's chairman and chief executive since1993, talks to Gundi Jeffrey about the firm's increasing emphasis onconsulting services, as well as the shift to a new corporate culturethat better reflects the spirit of the 1990sAFTER SEVERAL years of flat and even declining revenues, KPMG in Canadais poised to regain healthier growth. Much of this is due to a widerange of new service initiatives - mostly consulting-based - aimed atmeeting the needs of an increasingly- sophisticated and demandingmarketplace.Spencer Lanthier, 55, has been with the firm since 1960, becoming apartner in 1972, managing partner of the Toronto office in 1984 andvice-chairman of the Greater Toronto region and deputy chairman of thepartnership board in 1989. He has also served on various committees ofthe Quebec and Ontario institutes and, in 1993, was a member of theCanadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' corporate governance taskforce. He took on his present role with KPMG in 1993.IAB: Your revenues in the year to February 1995 were stagnant, butKPMG's worldwide results were up by more than 13 percent in fiscal1995. What do you expect your fiscal 1996 results to be like?Lanthier: We expect our fiscal 1996 top-line to be up about 5 percent.This is after four years of flat or negative growth, which has beenconsistent throughout our business in Canada.The reasons for this low growth relate to some major shifts in themarket for our services. Regulatory changes to audit requirementscontinue to hit all the big firms. Two years ago, for example, theCanada Business Corporations Act removed the requirement forprivately-owned companies to have audits. And more recently, theOntario Government eliminated the audit requirement for companies withrevenues of less than C$100 million ($73.66 million).Another issue is the high degree of corporate consolidation that hastaken place in Canada. For example, in 1994, one of our major clients,Rogers Communications, took over the publishing company Maclean Hunter.I can assure you that the fees for the combined company are a lot lessthan what they were separately.So all in all, the market for large-corporation audit services hasshrunk substantially and continues to decline. In that context, we'requite pleased with the growth of 5 percent in Canada this year.A lot of the growth internationally is coming from emerging marketssuch as eastern Europe and the Far East. But, in some of the moremature economies, the growth hasn't been that significant.IAB: The international firm has started reporting total billings toclients rather than net revenues. Will Canada follow suit?Lanthier: Internationally, our firm - and other firms also - is nowreporting our total billings per client. We've moved in that directionbecause we believe it more closely reflects the way we do business.For many years, the majority of our billings were based on the time wespent on the job. But now, we have more alliances and co-venturearrangements. Often, we act as prime contractor in projects thatinvolve various sub-contractors. In the past, we would have treated oursub-contractors' billings as expense reimbursement and deducted themfrom total billings to report our net fee income. We've concluded thatit makes more sense to reflect our total sub-contractors billings asrevenues. In summary, like most other major businesses, KPMG's revenuessimply reflect our total worldwide invoices to clients.In Canada, however, we'll continue to report on a net fee income basisfor the time being. The reason for this is that the Canadian firms haveagreed for many years on a set of precise guidelines for reportingincome to ensure compatibility.IAB: KPMG Canada has launched quite a few initiatives and service areasover the past year. Can you tell me about them and what you are hopingto achieve with them?Lanthier: The first is KPMG Investigation and Security Inc. This newgroup, headed by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissionerand past Interpol president Norman Inkster, offers a full range ofimpartial investigative services to businesses in Canada and around theglobe (IAB 176). KPMG ISI assists companies in cases where traditionalpolicing agencies are no longer able to help.It's really an extension of the forensic accounting division. We'recontinuing to offer traditional forensic accounting services, but we'realso expanding into the corporate security field. We did this becausewe knew that most [Canadian] police forces have been forced by cutbacksto place white collar crime very low on their list of priorities.Not only do we investigate white collar crime, but we also look at thewhole security arrangements companies have in place, not just thetraditional internal controls. For example, are they protecting theirexecutives adequately? Are their facilities secure? In the wake of lastyear's Oklahoma bombing, we received several inquiries from clientsinterested in reviewing their security.Also, as Canadian companies expand offshore, there is a need for themto review the viability and integrity of potential joint venturepartners. We can help in this area.We've been delighted with the results of this division already andwe've hired, at last count, six more former police officers.Another success story is our ISO 9000 practice, launched in early 1995in six centres across the country. KPMG Quality Registrar is one ofonly 12 accredited ISO 9000 registrars in Canada. And so far, we arethe only Big Six firm that has obtained this accreditation.We have two major services. First we certify that clients haveprocesses that comply with ISO standards. Then there is an annualcompliance report, that ensures they continue to be in compliance.This work is really a natural extension of our audit services and we'vebeen very successful with it in Canada. In the first full year, ourfees were about C$2 million.Next, very recently, we established a strategic alliance with MDManagement, the financial services subsidiary of the Canadian MedicalAssociation. This will allow KPMG to provide physicians and theirfamilies with accounting, tax and business advice. We were the onlynational accounting firm to participate in this alliance.KPMG's benchmarking initiative was launched in 1995, with the firm'sfirst national benchmark study of the corporate finance function. Thisstudy examines the role of the finance department in large companies -those with revenues of more than C$150 million - and middle-marketcompanies, with revenues of C$15 million to C$150 million, in themanufacturing, retail and distribution sectors.By focusing on performance measures such as cost, productivity andquality in finance, the study aims to help our clients better gaugetheir relative performance and identify opportunities for improvement.KPMG's new Centre for Risk Assessment and Control Design wasestablished to help organisations develop and implement cost-effectivecontrol and risk management systems, and to exchange best practices,particularly in the area of control and risk assessment.In February 1995, we rolled out our forest management practice, and ithas grown steadily. Three provinces, Ontario, British Columbia andAlberta, have in recent years passed new forestry legislation requiringcompanies to comply with cutting standards, reforestation, and so on.We help them ensure that they have the processes in place to complywith the regulation and help them with their reporting to theregulatory authorities. It's not a huge practice yet, but one wherethere is a real client need that we're trying to meet.We also have a rapidly-growing SAP and Baan implementation practice.SAP has really taken off in the industrialised world and has become thedominant software standard and dominant software platform for financialmanagement systems. We, together with others, are registered suppliersand implementers of SAP. Baan is something similar.I believe our Aboriginal services practice has also been a big success.More than 20 offices provide a range of financial and managementconsulting services to Aboriginal communities across Canada. Withcontinuing progress in land claim settlements, Aboriginal people arebecoming a major economic force in Canada, so the growth potential forthis service area is significant.IAB: I understand that KPMG has developed something called"ProjectGlobe", which has identified 14 service areas for growth. What doesthat mean for the Canadian firm?Lanthier: Project Globe is a framework that gives our consultingpractices around the world a common set of priorities. We adopted it ayear or so ago and it involves our focusing on three broad areas ofservice.The first is enabling technologies, which include services such asinformation technology strategy and systems implementation. Theperformance improvement area includes human resources and qualitymanagement services, among others. Strategic financial managementincludes capital transactions, treasury management and similarfinancial consulting services.IAB: Now to an old favourite that won't go away: professionalliability. What is KPMG doing in terms of risk management strategy todampen the threat of legal action?Lanthier: The number of lawsuits against accounting firms in Canada hasdropped over the past five years. Whether that's a result of improvedrisk management or a result of a better economy is hard to say. Most ofthe big lawsuits that we've seen in Canada happened as a result of thereal estate melt-down of five or six years ago. They had nothing to dowith audit failure. Since the real estate markets have stabilised,there haven't been any other major lawsuits coming forward.We have three simple rules for risk management: be careful about who wework for; be careful about what we do for them and be careful aboutwhom we assign to do the work. I think we all pay closer attention tothose rules than we did a few years ago. IAB: What do you see as KPMGCanada's biggest challenge in the next few years?Lanthier: I am focusing on two major areas. We have to grow our topline. You have to grow to be successful in our country. We're obviouslythe largest firm, with the largest market share, which makes it moredifficult to grow.That brings up the question of our core services. The audit is adeclining market. So is tax compliance.More and more taxpayers are buying tax preparation software for C$100or so, rather than coming to us. In the future, they could bedownloading tax software from the Internet for free.However, the total market for consulting services is expanding rapidly.That's why we've put a big emphasis on developing new,consulting-oriented services at a fairly rapid rate.Our second challenge is human resources - our people. Twenty-five yearsago, firms like ours were the employer of choice for a lot of thepeople going through business schools and other faculties. Butrecently, we've become a less attractive option. Some of our humanresource policies, cultures and practices simply aren't up to date. Werecognise that.To that end, in June, we brought on board a human resources changemanagement person at a very senior level. John Ellsworth brings yearsof global HR experience, having worked in general management consultingand with major corporations.John joined KPMG as a senior partner and a member of our managementcommittee. He is working closely with me and other people in the firmto help us change our culture. We want to ensure that we can attractthe best people, that we reward based on competence and not just onseniority. In the past, we have operated as a rather militaristichierarchy. We are determined to break down some of the barriers thathave existed, to move people forward, allow them to progress when theyare ready.It will take a long time for us to change and upgrade and get away fromthe sweatshop mentality that has dominated the accounting profession inthe past. You don't change a culture that's been ingrained for 75 yearsover six months or a year, but we're determined to make progress.These are my two priorities - to change our culture over the next fewyears and to grow our top line. The two go hand in hand. If you havethe best people, you'll grow.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The compilation of reports from Fed districtsconfirmed the prevailing view of an economy lurching along in low gearwith consumer spending anemic and the housing sector faltering.  Thecredit crunch, said the Fed report, is still with us.  The data in theeight-times-a-year report was collected before September 9 and sooffered a relatively recent snapshot of the US economy.  If it was notan inspiring view of the economy, it was by the same token notalarming either, and was consistent with the consensus view ofaffairs.  As recent data have suggested, the Fed likewise foundmanufacturing to be the strongest sector.  "Industrial production hasprovided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part exportdemand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation," the report said."As yet, there is little sign of a sizeable rebound in consumerspending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery,"it added.  Bank lending is still soft in most areas, often because ofreduced demand for loans, said the report, which is issued in advanceof meetings of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.Although mortgage interest rates are sharply lower, home sales haveslowed in San Francisco, Chicago and elsewhere, and commercialconstruction has virtually halted in many of the reporting Feddistricts.Elsewhere, a small rise in August housing starts gainsaid expectationson the part of Wall Street economists of a slight decline.Construction starts on single-family homes and apartments rose 0.6% toan annual rate of 1.07 million when the consensus among economists hadbeen for a 1.06 million rate.  That was the fifth straight rise forthe homebuilding industry, feared to be falling back into a slump.Nevertheless, the 0.6% rise was less vigorous than July's revised 2.4%gain, itself toned down from an earlier estimated 3.7% rise.Construction in the first eight months of this year was off 21% fromthe 1990 period.Political events were also driving the markets on Wednesday.  Therewas a report from Tass, the Soviet news agency, that Boris Yeltsin,leader of the ascendant democratic forces in the ex-Soviet Union, hadsuffered a slight heart attack.  That gave additional tone to the USdollar but did not have any noticeable impact on the Treasuriesmarket.  Markets also were watching a faceoff between President Bushand Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  Bush said US Air Force units would go toSaudi Arabia to provide better protection for the kingdom and, ifnecessary, to force Iraqi compliance with a UN resolution calling forinspection of weapons stocks.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991US CREDIT MARKETSThe Treasury market, which has become accustomed to having things goits way, did not like look of the housing starts data and sold off toa small extent but bounced right back.  That was typical of thesession, during which US government securities prices were mildlybuffeted by a series of factors but showed resilience.  The marketalso turned down a bit when the December Treasury bond futurescontract ran into some tough resistance at 99 and fell back to 9818/32.  Prices also declined on news that US Air Force units will besent to Saudi Arabia.  The Beige Book, however, was almost completelyignored.  The benchmark 30-year bond finished the day about 1/8 pointlower in price to yield 7.92% after 7.91% at the close on Tuesday.The 10-year note moved up slightly to yield 7.59% compared with 7.60%.Bills were virtually unchanged.The worst that could be said for the market right now is that it isindecisive.  However, sentiment is still positive in the absence ofany data seriously challenging the thesis that the economy is notmaking any headway and that inflation thus poses no danger.  As wesaid yesterday, the market is unlikely to be perturbed by mildlypositive data.  But the durable goods figure coming out September 25has it a bit worried.  The last one, for July, rose 10.7%, and asimilar surprise could test the mettle of fixed-income investors.  Itwould not surprise us if the market took some profits ahead of thatfigure, particularly if the trade and employment figures on Thursdaysuggest economic quickening.  Money supply, out late Thursday, willalso be closely watched.  Nonetheless, the bias is towards furtherprice rises and yield declines.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETSEveryone in the market keeps avowing bearish sentiment, but thedollar's behavior on Wednesday suggests otherwise.  Short-covering onYeltsin's heart trouble and the Bush-Saddam confrontation hadsomething to do with it.  But from our point of view the news breaksjust amplified the stirring of the dollar.  With many participants outfor the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday the market was thin and volatile,making it hard to draw firm conclusions.  But the dollar looks morebiddish.  In Europe it was supported at DM1.6650 and capped atDM1.6775, but in New York the news gave it enough punch to reachDM1.6940 before falling back to close at DM1.6850 after DM1.6750Tuesday.  Players will probably sell it again, but may be gettingtired of working the downside.The reasoning behind bearish sentiment all this week has been that theFed is going to ease again, which as we have noted before should notbe taken as a foregone conclusion.  Even if that turns out to be true,is the market likely to spend its time between now and Thanksgivinglooking for that ease?  More likely it will focus on something else,and that could be US economic numbers.  The indicators out onWednesday were not great news, but they were not bad news either, andsomewhere along the line here the data may swing market sentiment.For now, though, the numbers are indecisive, and so the market islikely to work in a range for a while, eventually testing DM1.70 butprobably not cracking it decisively.  Therefore we would modify ouradvice to suggest that if the dollar explores the bottom of its rangeagain, it looks like a good buy, but should not be held too far intothe DM1.6850 area -- unless the market shifts resistance up to DM1.70sooner than expected.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991BUY/SELL LEVELS FOR VARIOUS CURRENCIESBUY --           SELL --         BUY --           SELL --DM1.6950/US$     DM1.6750/US$    US$1.72/STG      US$1.74/STGY135.50/US$      Y133.50/US$     FF5.77/US$       FF5.71/US$SF1.48/US$       SF1.46/US$      CAN$1.1375/US$   CAN$1.1325/US$Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991NEW YORK FX CLOSINGSDM1.6847/52      FF5.7395/25     DFL1.8990/00     ESC144.65/75Y134.32/37       CAN$1.1369/74   DKR6.5090/10     MEX$3058/59SF1.4715/25      LIT1261/63      ASCH11.86/88     A$0.7999/04STG1.7290/00     BFR34.71/73     PTA105.61/68     HK$7.7568/78Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991TREASURY SECURITIES AND FED FUNDS30-YEARS 102.07-11 (7.92%)       10-YEARS 101.25-29 (7.59%)2-YEARS 100.11-12 (6.17%)3-MONTHS 5.18-16 (5.32%)         6-MONTHS 5.23-21 (5.44%)FED FUNDS 4 1/2%Back to Headline List WT03-B38-37IA059-000325-B026-21http://newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi89.html 205.156.212.5 19970115011600 text/html 58946HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 15-Jan-97 01:14:09 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 24-Oct-96 22:49:29 GMTContent-length: 58757Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi89.html Sample Issue Copyright INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNet January 19, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES TURKISH BOT PROJECTS EMERGE DESPITE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES (1523 words) RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?

Other countries have since left Turkey far behind.ECAs take on riskExport credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks have taken onsubstantial risk for the $1.4bn hydroelectric power and dam project atBirecik on the Euphrates River and the $865m water supply and treatmentplant at Izmit, some 80 miles east of Istanbul.A new readiness among commercial lenders to take on Turkish risk wasborne out by the oversubscription of unsecured commercial loans, pricedat 225 basis points (bp).A dozen more BOT projects are awaiting approval, mostly in the powersector, where the government has forecast growth in demand forelectricity of almost 250 per cent over the next 15 years.  Prior toher resignation, prime minister Tansu Ciller said that BOT projectsworth $16bn were needed in Turkey over the next decade.These include the 1,200 MW Ilisu Dam on the Tigris River, expected tocost some $2.5bn, for which tenders are expected soon.``It should certainly be quicker to do deals in future as there is nowa reference point for the Turkish market'', says Mr Howard Lack, thedirector at London-based Chase Investment Bank, the arranger forsyndicated lending at both Birecik and Izmit.``Before Birecik, the Treasury had no previous experience of a complexstructure that involved some 40 documents, but they will understand theissues and the risks that are being asked in the future'', Mr Lacksays.Banks' analysisAnalysts are examining the conflicting signals coming from Turkey toweigh the extent of their participation in future operations.``We are mindful of the election result, and like most banks, areadopting a wait-and-see approach'', Mr Alan Paton, head of trade andexport finance of Societe Generale's London branch tells ITF.``These are early days -- it is far from clear how things will go'', MrPaton adds.  SocGen took a strong hand in syndicated lending finalisedlate in 1995 for Birecik and Izmit.Adding complexity to western views of an increasingly important marketwhere the political situation may lay unresolved until February wasTurkey's entry into the EU customs union on 1 January 1996.``The EC vote was a positive factor, but we are continuing to monitorthe progress of the Turkish economy following the elections'',Mr Dennis Kennedy, NCM Credit Insurance's underwriter for the MiddleEast, North Africa and Turkey tells ITF.A series of recent economic and financial crises that came to a head in1994 has drawn comparisons with Mexico from some quarters.NCM said that Turkey represented ``a market with enduring economicproblems'' in a country summary issued in September.The ratings agency, Standard & Poors, revised down its country outlookfrom ``positive'' to ``stable'' in October.Recent estimates suggest the budget deficit for the first quarter of1996 will be greater than for the whole of 1995.The market fell under close scrutiny in 1994, when massive capitalflight led to plummeting sovereign debt ratings, an inflation level of126 per cent and currency devaluation of over 50 per cent.Reserves upHowever, the economy began to grow in the first quarter of 1995 andforeign reserves had risen to $16.3bn by September, compared to $3bn inApril 1994.  Inflation is also seen as less of a danger.As the macroeconomic situation improves, Turkish borrowers arereturning to the international market to borrow on longer maturitiesand narrower margins, which are creeping back to pre-1994 crisislevels.Turkiye Garanti Bankasi secured a benchmark two-year $150m facility inOctober at 65bp over Libor, marking the first loan over one year for aTurkish bank in 1995.ECA supportECAs took 64 per cent of the risk in the ground-breaking 672MW Birecikscheme, providing 151/2-year cover that includes a 51/2-year constructionperiod.Germany's Hermes insured DM585m (#256m) to support the principaldeveloper, Philipp Holzmann.Also involved were Belgian, Austrian and French ECAs, which guaranteedaround DM803m in bank loans to the sponsor Birecik Company, whichprovided DM327m in equity towards the 15-year concession.Eight-year commercial lending worth DM462m made up the senior debtpackage.Co-arrangers were Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, BayerischeLandesbank, Girokredit, Generale Bank and Societe Generale.Forty-four banks participated in the two tranches, which wereoversubscribed by 30 per cent.  Margins were 100bp over Libor for theECA loan and 225bp for the commercial deal.Given that aspects of the legal situation attaching to BOT schemes inTurkey remain unresolved -- all concession-type contracts fall under thejurisdiction of an administrative court -- lenders have extractedgovernment guarantees insuring them against force majeure or default byBirecik Company.The Birecik Company has protected itself against default on tariffpayments by the offtaker, the state-owned Turkiye Elektrik UretimIletim (TEAS), by obtaining government guarantees.``Future deals will need less support, with more risk being borne bythe commercial parties and banks'', says Mr Lack.Water projectThe UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has taken theleading ECA role in Turkey's second BOT scheme: a 15-year concession toimprove the supply of drinking and industrial water to the Turkish cityof Izmit.ECGD is providing a 100 per cent guarantee for $236m in commerciallending, which secured about $803m in bank debt.France's Coface has extended insurance for a $180m tranche, withJapan's EID/MITI supporting a further $40m in loans over seven years.The combination reflects ECGD's growing collaboration with its Frenchand Japanese counterparts (ITF 252/11).Untied lending worth $180m has been agreed by the Export-Import Bank ofJapan (Jexim).Banks have provided $167m on an unsecured basis, split into a $116mseven-year facility and a $51m five-year standby facility.  These wereoversubscribed by 15 per cent.Co-arrangers were National Westminster Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bankand  SocGen -- the latter lending over $83m.Repayments to the project company, Izmit Su, are to be made in dollars.Project security resides in offtake agreements and guarantees providedby the Municipality of Izmit backed by the Turkish Treasury.The sponsor -- which has injected some $139m in equity and comprises thelocal companies Guris and Gama and the Municipality of Izmit, alongsidethe UK's Thames Water and Japan's Mitsui & Co and Sumitomo Corporation-- will commence its operating period in December 1998.Breathing spaceMost ECAs have taken a watching brief in the immediate post-electionperiod.ECGD had planned a cover review in 1995, but this was postponed becauseof the December polling.The UK agency has ``one or two reasonable-sized deals in thepipeline'', according to a spokesman, ``but, as always, these may takeawhile to come to fruition.  Following Izmit, almost all the coveravailable in the market has been committed''.``The two deals both went well, but took quite a lot of the availableappetite out of the marketplace'', SocGen's Mr Paton observes.  ``Therewould be an appetite for the right project, but ECAs form a veryimportant leverage aspect for commercial banks''.Private marketsTurkey remains a popular market for forfaiters.The London-based Standard Bank will look at 360-day paper, principallyfor commodity-based short-term deals.  Standard is doing business up tothree years for capital goods transactions.``Margins have moved slightly upwards due to the uncertainty after theelection, but have otherwise been quite stable since the marketrecovered in 1995'', says a spokesman.Standard will look at paper from a range of banks, including two of thepublic sector institutions, TC Ziraat Bankasi and Turkiye Halk Bankasi.Bankers and insurers are generally agreed that Turkey's private sectorbanks may offer more scope for trade finance.NCM highlighted the local private sector as a much better risk forexporters in its September report, pointing out that the majority offoreign exchange reserves are held privately.``Public sector companies, currently comprising about half the legaleconomy, are in the main loss-making and debt-ridden'', said thereport.NCM's trading terms extend to a maximum 180 days, with open accountbusiness acceptable where buyers, mainly private, can show a goodrecent track record or a visible hard currency trading surplus.Analysts have noted that this is more commonplace as economicliberalisation has freed companies from political interference.Most businesses require the security of a letter of credit or bank-endorsed bills of exchange.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?The completion and disbursement of a ground-breaking $100m gold minefinancing has triggered hopes among western financiers that moreRussian projects will move ahead as the government gradually eases theregulatory environment.The move complements activity by western financiers in Russia'shydrocarbons sector, where protracted manoeuverings have eventually ledto the provision of US export credit guarantees for projects under theoil and gas framework agreement (OGFA) (ITF 247/6).The arranger of the limited recourse gold deal, Deutsche MorganGrenfell (DMG), took two years to structure and negotiate thetransaction with the Russian authorities and the lenders.The deal ``sets a precedent for international debt financing for suchprojects in Russia'', says a DMG director closely involved with theproject, Mr Andrew Seton.Funds for the project in the far eastern Magadan region were releasedin mid-December, following the signature of loan agreements in Junebetween the Omolon Gold Mining Company and the European Bank forReconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the US' Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation (Opic) (ITF 240/3).Opic contributed guarantees worth $52.5m and will also extend $60m ininvestment insurance.Omolon, a joint venture between the Denver-based Cyprus Amax MineralsCompany and Russian (mainly mining) concerns, is the first jointventure to receive a licence to mine gold in Russia.The company will use the loan proceeds to develop the Kubaka lode golddeposit, located some 200 miles off the Arctic Circle.Repayments from the sale of the mine's output will be channelledthrough a licensed offshore account.Security for the lenders is based on a series of long-term contractsthat have replaced Russian government payment risk with contractualrisk.In return for mixed hard currency and rouble payments, the Russiangovernment will be allocated first claim on the mine's output,anticipated at an annual 300,000 ounces of gold and 200,000 ounces ofsilver.If payments do not ensue, the Russian Foreign Trade Bank, in its roleas agent for the government and the joint venture, will export themetals to western buyers.``People were not prepared to lend or invest on the basis where thegovernment held a monopoly over gold production and exports'', anotherbanker specialising in CIS minerals tells ITF.  ``Lenders are happywith this deal -- and the structure is likely to be replicated for othergold projects''.DMG's activities in Russia and the former Soviet Union have raisednearly $4bn in project finance to date.Further EBRD activity in Russia includes support for short-term tradefinance under its Trade Facilitation Programme (ITF 248/2).Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES FUND PAKISTAN IPPA new independent power project (IPP) is going ahead in Pakistan'sPunjab state backed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan (Jexim) and theWorld Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC).As its contribution to 12-year Japanese buyer credits worth Y18.2bn(#115m) for the 365MW Lal Pir II scheme in Muzzafargagh, Jexim is toprovide Y10.9bn as a direct loan on its own account.  Around Y4bn ofthis is dollar-denominated.The remaining Y7.3bn is being co-financed with a syndicate of 15commercial banks, nine of which are from Japan.  Arranging thefacility, which is priced at 240 basis points (bp) over Libor, is thescheme's financial advisor, Bank of Tokyo, with Sanwa Bank, DeutscheBank, Dresdner Bank and ING Bank.The political risk in this tranche will be insured by EID/MITI.The deal was reportedly well over-subscribed, principally reflecting anappetite from banks that missed Lal Pir I (ITF 234/3).The proceeds will be deployed by the sponsor, AES Pak Gen Company(AESPG), to finance the purchase of equipment from Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries, to be supplied through the trading house NichimenCorporation.Jexim's security in the project pivots on the government of Pakistan'sguarantees for currency conversion and transfers; the purchase ofgenerated electricity over 30 years by the Pakistan Water & PowerDevelopment Authority (WAPDA) and the supply of fuel by Pakistan StateOil Company.IFC roleThe IFC has agreed an A-loan/B-loan structure worth $70m for the $349moil-fired scheme, which is to be implemented on a build-own-operate(BOO) basis.A $20m A-loan has been extended over 15 years.The $50m B-facility has a 12-year tenor and a margin of 275bp.  IFC hasalso taken a portion of the $95m equity injected by AESPG, which wascreated by the US' AES Corporation in June 1995.The participation of the World Bank's investment arm follows an A-loan/B-loan facility agreed for a $138m project in Karachi last July(ITF 242/5).Jexim and the IFC have worked together in Pakistan's power sector onLal Pir I and the country's first limited recourse power financing, theground-breaking Hub River scheme (ITF 222/1).The Lal Pir II project will help to alleviate power shortages inPakistan estimated at around 2000MW.

The question of the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant is also high on governments' agendas.Jexim observed that the G7 and EU nations had agreed in mid-1994 toprovide $4bn or more ``over the next two years'' and remained ``unitedin their recognition that the Ukraine's economic stability is importantto world peace, in view of its nuclear capabilities''.The Y18bn untied loan element of the package -- intended as co-financingwith the World Bank -- is part of the $200m in balance of paymentssupport, drawn from Jexim's funds for the development initiative,committed last March by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese primeminister.Other governments to commit export credits include the US, Germany,Italy, Canada and France.The IMF has approved an SDR1.5bn standby package; the World Bank hasalready committed loans worth around $720m; and the EU an Ecu225m loanfor balance of payments support.During a visit to Kiev last summer, Mr James Wolfensohn, the World Bankpresident, said the bank could provide over $1bn in the next threeyears.But these loans could be in jeopardy if a rebellious parliament has itsway over issues such as privatisation and farm reform -- and Mr Kuchma'sreform programme is blocked.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996UKRAINE SECURES FINANCE FOR AGRICULTUREKiev has secured the first financing from the EBRD/NCM co-operationagreement on projects in eastern Europe.The Dutch insurer and the European Bank for Reconstruction &Development are backing a $20.7m agricultural project in the Myronavkaregion, which includes Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.NCM's participation involves insuring Dutch exports of machinery andfarm vehicles.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996ECAS MOBILISE SUPPORT FOR EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI OIL REFINERYExport credit agencies (ECAs) are preparing to mobilise cover for anEgyptian/Israeli joint venture scheme, the Middle East Oil Refinery(MIDOR).Sponsors have yet to choose between Banque National de Paris (BNP) andNational Westminster Bank to head supplier credit arrangements, but afinancial close is expected by construction start, at the end ofMarch 1996.Export credit cover from Israel worth between $100-$150m has beensecured.Further ECA-backed loans for the scheme will total an anticipated$600m.  The eventual choice of agencies will depend on the sources ofconstruction equipment, but agencies from France, Germany, Japan,Belgium and the UK have expressed interest.A construction contract has been signed with a European consortiumcomprising Italy's Technipetrol and France's Technip, following a hardfought tender.Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas has been awarded a large subcontracting deal,which involves the provision of supplier credit guarantees worth $100mby Compania Espanola de Seguros de Credito a la Exportacion (CESCE).Regional banks, including the National Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank andIsraeli General Bank are to provide working capital worth about $370m.The European Investment Bank has also committed around $300m.Some $240-$250m of equity is to be injected into the project.

Thisrose to $25.6bn, up from $19.9bn in the first half of 1994.Particular note was made of banks' claims up to 360 days, which rose asa percentage of total claims.  A growing volume of trade finance andbanks' reluctance to expose themselves longer term were among reasonsfor this.The favoured target region for commercial lenders was Asia, wherelending jumped by $33.7bn, compared to $15.6bn in 1994.The report noted a ``greater selectivity'' in lending to Latin America,which fell by $4.2bn, although it seemed ``too early to say'' whetherthe Mexican crisis had impacted on this trend.A greater global dependence on short-term capital flows has ledcommercial banks to assess their portfolios on a more frequent basis.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996GRIFFIN LAUNCHES EXPORT INVOICE DISCOUNTING SERVICEGriffin Factors has opted to follow its main competitors and launch anexport invoice discounting service to cater for larger exportcompanies.Exporters with their solid in-house credit control unit will now beoffered finance, without the obligation to accept a traditional ``fullfactoring'' arrangement.An offshoot of Midland Bank, Griffin was one of the first factors tooffer domestic clients an invoice discounting service (under whichfinance is provided against invoices without direct involvement by thefinance house in the process of collection, unless a payment fallsseriously overdue).But it stood back from the industry-wide move into invoice discountingof exports, continuing to trust to traditional full factoring -- underwhich it retains responsibility for collecting all payments.And this approach seemed to be justified, because in most recent years,it managed to remain in second place in the league table ofinternational business handled by the UK's factors -- last year thevolume of exports it factored was up by 25 per cent at more than #90m.Griffin management was also concerned about the practical difficultiesof getting involved in collection of overdue invoice-discountedpayments.  A particular worry was a German law that allowed buyers torefuse to allow their debts to be assigned.Market pressuresBut market pressures on Griffin to follow competitors, such asInternational Factors, into the invoice discounting of exportsincreased.  There was strong demand for the service from clients andindustry figures showed that the spectacular growth in invoicediscounting was far outstripping the more measured expansion oftraditional factoring.There was, particularly, an increased number of larger exporters -- whowere not prepared to involve a factor in their routine paymentcollection -- seeking trade-based finance.Last year, Griffin dipped a toe quietly into the water.  It alsoequipped itself to cope with a change, recruiting specialist languagestaff who could chase up foreign payments.And, with fortunate timing, the law in Germany was clarified to allowforeign export suppliers to promise repayment to their financiers.There was clearly a risk that Griffin could lose clients who wanteddiscounted finance, if it continued to stand aside from this trend. But it still remains committed to further development of thetraditional factoring operation.  Recently, it set up an EDI servicethat will allow clients to send in invoices electronically, without theneed for paper back-up.  Restricted for now to domestic business, thiswill eventually be available to exporters.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996WOLFENSOHN RINGS ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES AT WORLD BANKMr James Wolfensohn, World Bank president, has restructured topmanagement posts at the bank in a drive to improve efficiency and tobuild incentives and accountability into the organisation's culture.In the first significant management initiative at the bank since heassumed control last June, Mr Wolfensohn has increased his team ofmanaging directors from three to five and created a new ExecutiveCommittee.The changes became operational on 1 January 1996.In a memo circulated among more than 6,000 World Bank personnel inDecember, the president explained the initiative as part of hisoverriding aim ``to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Bank'swork and its objectives'' by providing ``a framework for liberating theenergies and skills of the rest of the organisation''.The managing directors, who will become directly involved in specificday-to-day management tasks, have been allocated the following roles:* Mr Gautam Kaji will be joined by Mr Caio Koch-Weser, former vice-president for the Middle East and Africa, for a joint controlling rolein charge of the bank's operations, policies and programmes.Moving into the Middle East and Africa seat is Mr Kemal Dervis, who hasworked before on the Middle East.Mr Koch-Weser, a Brazilian, was a very familiar face across the region,including at various stages of the Middle East peace process.Mr Spiros Voyadzis, another Middle East expert, has been named theWorld Bank's special representative to the EU and manager of the bank'snew Brussels office.* Mr Sven Sandstrom assumes charge of Human and Information Resourcesand Management, in addition to Corporate Planning and Budgeting.Mr Wolfensohn has identified personnel and training as the bank'sgreatest problem areas.  According to the memo, Mr Sandstrom has beengiven a two-year brief to turn around the bank's traditional ``armlockof bureaucracy'' -- where task managers are reportedly separated fromupper levels by five management layers -- and to create a ``resultsculture''.* Ms Jessica Einhorn has been promoted to manage activities in financeand resource mobilisation, supervising vice presidency functionspreviously covered by the treasurer, the Controller, Financial Policyand Risk Management and Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services.She will also assume the chairmanship of the bank's Finance Committee.* Mr Richard Frank is to chair the Private Sector Development Group,with responsibility for working with senior managers of the Bank Groupand to evolve the bank's overall private sector strategy, which ismaking greater use of commercial markets through instruments, such asits revamped guarantees (ITF 248/10).Mr Frank has previously been responsible for working on the Bank'sfuture policy direction.The moves will ``provide clear lines of authority for the main areas ofour business and to strengthen the Group's ability to address majorstrategic issues'', said Mr Wolfensohn.Committee launchThe five managing directors will form part of a new 10-strong ExecutiveCommittee, which is to hold meetings on a weekly basis.The Committee includes Mr Mark Malloch Brown, promoted from director tovice-president of External Relations, and chief economist Mr MichaelBruno, also elevated to vice presidential status.Mr Malloch Brown has long links with non-governmental organisations andthe media.  His arrival in 1994 gave the bank a fresh approach topublic relations.Mr Bruno is a widely respected former governor of the Central Bank ofIsrael.Where matters are related to the larger World Bank Group, the committeewill be enlarged to accommodate the executive vice president of theInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), Mr Jannik Lindbaek, and theexecutive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guaranteeagency (MIGA), Mr Akira Iida.This fits a pattern profiled at the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annualmeeting in Washington, where exploratory strategies were announced forgreater co-ordination within the Group.Further changes in 1996 will involve the uptake by 50 top executives ofmanagement courses and the secondment of executive staff into industryand private sector banks.Mr Johannes Linn, whose experience at the bank includes several senioreconomics posts, became the World Bank's vice-president for Europe andCentral Asia on 1 January, following the retirement of Mr WilfredThalwitz.Mr Timothy Thahane, the World Bank vice-president who narrowly missedout becoming president of the African Development Bank, occupies a newvice-presidency for United Nations affairs.  This office is intended tobetter co-ordinate the World Bank's relations with the UN system.He is replaced as vice-president and World Bank group secretary by MrShengman Zhang, executive director for China since November 1994.Mr Wolfensohn stressed in the memo that the goal of the bank continuesto be the promotion of sustainable development ``in the broadestsense'', in particular the alleviation of poverty and assistingcountries in transition.  ``I have made it clear that I expect themanagement to work with me at top pressure'', he concluded.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996WORLD BANK AGREES NEW LENDING FOR EASTERN EUROPEThe World Bank has agreed new lending for eastern Europe, including a$160m loan to boost Poland's power sector.

Choice is offered between a group wide strategy orterms and conditions that more closely reflect individual subsidiaries'needs at three different levels:* rates for premium and service;* indemnification levels;* the ``excess'' threshold below which losses are for the account ofthe policy holder.For UK-based multinationals wishing to develop a gradual group widecredit insurance strategy, the scheme can be initiated through just oneor two subsidiaries and extended at a later date.Euro Trader is the latest in a series of product developments fromcredit insurers battling for UK market share (ITF 251/4).It also marks a further stage in a trend increasingly discernible inthe single European market whereby intra-EU deals are helping to fuelthe expansion of short-term political risk cover capacity amonginsurers (ITF 252/13).Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996EAST EUROPEAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING ON HOLDThe European Union assistance programme to the CIS countries iscurrently on hold, following opposition led by Spain to the way thecontracts are awarded.The TACIS programme, with funds of about Ecu500m, provides technicalassistance and know-how for economic and reform programmes proposed bythe governments of the 12 former Soviet countries and Mongolia.Spain has blocked the programme for 1996 because it wants reform of theway the contracts are tendered and different criteria used in theirallocation.  Privately, officials say Spain is opposed to the programmebecause their companies only win about 2 per cent of the contracts.Last March, officials proposed new guidelines for the TACIS programmeto start this year, which would permit TACIS funds to be invested insmall and medium-sized enterprises and in infrastructure projects.These funds are intended to be strategic investments that wouldcatalyse much larger funds from the World Bank, European Bank forReconstruction and Development and other institutional investors.Similar investments have been made successfully in Central Europe.New formulaThis new formula, extending the traditional mandate of the TACISprogramme, has already been approved by Parliament, but was blocked inthe Council of Ministers.  Officials plan to put it before the Councilagain, but say that an ``educated guess'' would anticipate it beingrejected again.The most likely outcome, say officials, is that the Council willeventually approve a continuation of the former programme, restrictingfunds to technical assistance and know-how transfer for one more year.The new programme is likely to be postponed until 1997.Meanwhile, officials are continuing to work on the programmes approvedusing the 1995 budget.  Assuming the Council finally approves the TACISfunds before the summer, officials are confident that all the fundscould be committed before the end of 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996DG BANK SETS UP FORFAITING OPERATION IN LONDONDeutschegenossenschafts (DG Bank), the central business and investmentunit for Germany's popular and co-operative banks, has set up a tradefinance unit to market trade paper to the London forfaiting community.Acting as the provider of corporate and international services foralmost 3,000 local institutions, DG Bank should be well placed to feeda stream of export deals to forfait traders and investors in thesecondary market.The new operation is being headed by Janine Barber, recruited fromStandard Bank London's forfaiting team.Ms Barber's specialist knowledge of eastern Europe will be particularlyuseful for DG Bank:  many of the small and medium-sized German firmsthat form the core client base of the Volksbanks (popular) andRaiffeisen (co-operative) banks are selling to the former communistcountries that lie across Germany's eastern border.  Indeed, during itsfirst weeks, DG's London trade finance operation has handled deals forexports to Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia.The fact that DG felt the need to set up a forfaiting presence inLondon -- to supplement the forfaiting service already offered by itshead office in Frankfurt and enhance its ability to take on risks thatit would not want to keep for its own portfolio -- bears witness to thecentral role that the UK's capital continues to play in the market fortrade paper.London hubAlthough the biggest users of the technique are probably Italian ratherthan UK exporters, London remains the hub of the secondary trading thathas gradually expanded forfaiters' ability to do business over recentyears.  Indeed, the range of country risks that can now be sold on themarket is probably wider than at any previous time.Confidence seems to have ridden out the shock of Mexico's late 1994financial crisis;  large volumes of Latin American risk are stilltraded.And there are even signs of a renewed willingness to support deals withBulgaria -- whose credibility was shattered several years ago by itsreadiness to take on new loans when it was on the verge of default.During 1995, specialists, such as Hungarian International Bank (HIB)and London Forfaiting Company (LFC), began to do Bulgarian short-termdeals;  and in recent weeks LFC has actually quoted three year terms,albeit for a transaction of only DM1m.What remains to be seen is how the market will evolve following theannouncement that HIB is to close.  The bank has been one of theleading forces in the market, with a strong reputation in pioneeringthe acceptance of deals with the more difficult ex-communist countries,such as Croatia, or the Baltic states.HIB will have a successor institution:  the Hungarian national savingsbank OTP is to set up a trade finance company in London -- based in thesame premises and using many of the same staff.  Capitalised at about#1m and hoping to chalk up #50m or so of deals in the first year, thisshould be able to build on the legacy of east European expertise.All the clearers continue to offer forfaiting services, but at Barclaysand Lloyds these are integrated into the main trade finance operations,alongside conventional export credit:  the aim is to put forward themost competitive technique for each particular deal, whether it beforfaiting or supplier credit (or something else).  Forfaiting is oftencombined with export credit, particularly as a means of dealing withthe 15 per cent uninsured ``front end'' component of Export CreditsGuarantee Department deals.Midland Bank Aval forms an integral part of the HSBC group and was oneof the first to spot the potential for combining forfaiting and exportcredit in the same operation -- but it does maintain a large team offorfaiting specialists in London and the Far East and generates a bigflow of deals from its own exporting customers in the UK, Italy andelsewhere.  It uses the technique to finance a lot of trade between FarEastern countries.West Merchant Bank is another leading export credit house which offersforfaiting as an alternative or complementary financing option.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996CHINA SECURES ECGD SUPPORT FOR POWER FACILITY, AIRPORT CONTRACTThe UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has agreed a majornew power-related facility for China, the boom market which absorbedthe largest volume of ECGD guarantees for any single country in theagency's 1994/95 financial year.ECGD has also backed the commercial portion of a UK mixed creditpackage for the new airport at Nanjing, and is gearing up to mobiliseadditional cover for a $2bn-plus power complex in Shandong.ECGD announced on 20 December that it will provide a 15-year repaymentguarantee for a #351.5m commercial loan in support of a contract won byGEC-Alsthom to design and supply equipment for the Ling Ao powerstation, better known as Daya Bay II, in Guangdong province.GEC-Alsthom was a leading supplier for China's first nuclear powerstation at Daya Bay (ITF 249/3).  At Ling Ao it is responsible this time for the turnkey design, supplyand supervision of commissioning of two 900 MW turbine generator unitsand plant, scheduled for completion by 2003.The commercial lending syndicate is led by West Merchant Bank (WMB),acting as arranger, principal lender and agent bank.The borrower is State Development Bank of China (SDB), the specialisedinfrastructure financing institution established in early 1994.

ECGD and Eximbank had set amid-January deadline for a preferential rate of 5.95 per cent alreadyrolled over previously.  All parties were understood to be anxious toavoid the proposed new rate of 7 per cent.The sponsor, China Power Company -- a joint venture involving a 49 percent foreign stake from China Light & Power and Electricite de France --anticipates raising some $800m through international syndication to addto equity that may total as much as $600m.The project encompasses four plants.  The international funding will bechannelled to the 1,300 MW Liaocheng and 700 MW Heze complexes.Equipment is to be supplied by the US' Westinghouse ElectricCorporation and the UK's Babcock Energy.Remaining funding is likely to be tapped domestically.ITF COMMENT:  Rapid growth in the huge Chinese market means the countrywill remain the most active trade finance market in 1996, especially asBeijing is expected to relax its credit squeeze, imposed since mid-1993.The economy remains mined with problems associated with everything froma sometimes opaque legislative framework and a commitment to obtainingrock-bottom pricing to political risk factors, which include thesuccession to Mr Deng Xioping and the People's Liberation Army's recentthreatening gestures towards Taiwan.But the macroeconomic numbers and market's potential still dazzle -- andECAs continue to take a positive view in the ``national interest'' togive companies a chance in the market that everyone wants to crack.China's foreign trade grew by 18 per cent in 1995 to $280bn, producinga trade surplus of over $20bn.  This compared to $5.35bn in 1994,according to preliminary statistics released by Beijing on 5 January.Foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $70bn at end-1995.  Foreigninvestment grew by 11 per cent last year, reaching $37bn.The pattern of ECGD's business is replicated by other ECAs.  The UKagency's concentration on the fiercely contested Chinese market wasreflected in its 1994/95 annual report, which showed exposure totalling#1.54bn (ITF 251/7).China accounted for over 40 per cent of ECGD's commitments to the so-called Amber Zone of priority markets in 1994/95.Exposure is building, but there is more support to come.

But it will be a market whose pitfalls canupset even the most careful investors for years to come.One not so happy New Year message came from State Economic & TradeCommission official Mr Xu Ming, who complained that domestic firms werebeing pushed out of joint ventures when profits increase and localpartners cannot match the new investments in equity made by theirforeign partners.This apparently widespread trend is giving foreign partners majorityholdings -- and, Chinese officials complain, monopolies in some domesticindustrial sectors.``It is almost unanimous -- when returns become high, foreign partieswill scramble to nudge their Chinese partners out of holding statuswith their overwhelming funding power'', Mr Xu said. Local firms should``stand up against the aggression of foreign partners'', he said.The language of international capitalism, which investors and creditorsso like to hear, will continue to suffer problems of translation inChina.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996BANKS LINE UP CHINESE PROJECT FINANCINGSInternational and locally-based banks are lining up a raft of newChinese projects.Standard Chartered Capital Markets is lead arranger for the non-recourse financing of a gas-fired power plant in Zhabei, Shanghai.The sponsors, GE Capital Corporation and the Shanghai MunicipalElectric Power Company, are looking to raise around $120m over 10years.China International Capital Corporation is seeking to raise around$750m for an oil project in the north-east.

In unveiling the nationwide listing of 30,123 properties, RTC ExecutiveDirector David C. Cooke said his agency will soon begin making assetinformation available more often than the required semiannual reports.However, he did not specify whether that meant quarterly or monthlyupdates.   Demand for detailed listings of RTC's holdings seems to be overwhelming,based on the 22,000 written inquiries received by the agency in recentmonths and the heavy order volume for the inventory report last week.   As a result, entrepreneurs in the technology, publishing and marketingindustries are circling - hoping to help the bailout agency disseminatefresh data on new properties assumed by RTC, as well as results of recentsales.   "The inventory will also be made available through a variety ofcomputer-compatible media," Cooke said.   In fact, a consortium of reputable technology companies, not yet willingto publicize its effort, is working to create a system which would allowsubscribers to use a personal computer to "dial in" to a central databaseand conduct sophisticated analysis of RTC assets.   In addition, the bailout agency has been approached by publishingventures that are eager to repackage the property listings to fit specificneeds of various investors.   Rather than select one or two companies to deliver the information, RTCwill probably make the raw data on properties available to all potentialpublishers and let users determine which of the competing services bestmeets their needs.   American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp., a unit of Dallas-base AMRCorp., has seized one of the first inventory-related assignments. RTC hiredthe firm to process orders for the three-volume property listing, which ispriced at $50.   Later this month, AA Direct Marketing Corp. will begin operating a 900-number telephone line, which will allow investors to order specializedproperty listings for a nominal fee that will be charged on their regularmonthly telephone bill.   For example, a caller reaching RTC's new asset information center couldrequest a listing of all single-family homes in the Phoenix area, and theorder would be processed and mailed within 24 hours. The phone number hasnot yet been announced.   Would-be investors and others needing to closely scrutinize each assetsay they hope the agency eventually expands its data collection effort toinclude more than just basic information on each property.   The new report on commercial properties, for instance, provides only anaddress, square footage, a one-line description, the property's age, acontact name and - in some cases - a list price.   Congress' requirement that the inventory be rushed into print beforeDec. 31 made it impossible for RTC to include information on all of itsholdings. Instead, the report listed only properties with clear titles thatwere held by the 283 thrifts under RTC control on Sept. 30. It does notinclude assets held by S&L subsidiaries, or assets of institutions placedin the conservatorship program during the fourth quarter.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Workout Firms Eye Louisiana Portfolios   RTC's Baton Rouge field office is looking for private-sector help inmanaging and disposing of nonperforming loans and real estate left overfrom the resolutions of six Louisiana conservatorships.   "We would like to have the bid packages out this month," said JayHambric, who runs the Baton Rouge operation, one of four consolidated fieldoffices in RTC's east region. The assignments, which could be awardedsometime in February, will be one of the first disposition contracts handedout since RTC opened its doors five months ago.   Roughly $300 million in assets will be put out for bid after the agencypackages them by type, size and quality. Categories will include realestate, real estate loans, student loans, second mortgages and other typesof consumer credits. There is also expected to be more than one qualitycategory, including delinquent unsecured loans.   Packages will likely be awarded to firms with experience and expertisein managing assets in those particular categories. RTC officials inWashington are deciding on the fee structure for the assignment.   RTC also retained commercial loans from the six resolutions, but Hambricsaid his office would concentrate on disposing of the consumer debt firstsince there was so much more of it.   He said his office would contract separately with a firm to conduct duediligence reviews of the assets before they are packaged.   By the time bids are invited, RTC expects that most interested partieswill have completed the agency's newly issued registration forms. Bids willbe accepted from only those firms whose registration statements meet RTC'scriteria. RTC still hasn't decided how it will publicize the request forproposals.   The targeted assets were on the books of the following six Louisianathrifts, whose deposits were transferred to healthy institutions on theresolution date shown in parentheses:   * Acadia S&LA FSA of Crowley (Oct. 6). Assets: $108 million.   * River City FSB of Baton Rouge (Oct. 6). Assets: $73 million.   * Enterprise FS&LA of Marrero (Sept. 8). Assets: $64 million.   * Elmwood FS&LA of Harahan (Sept. 8). Assets $58 million.   * Evangeline FS&LA of Lafayette (Aug. 18). Assets: $37 million.   * First Savings of Louisiana FSA of La Place (Sept. 15). Assets: $25million.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Final Blueprint Still Lacks Specifics   RTC's policymakers last week unveiled a strategic plan that acknowledgeskey concerns of real estate and asset management professionals, but in someways fails to spell out precisely how the agency will address thosematters.   Industry and government observers agreed that the three-member OversightBoard placed the greatest emphasis on disposal of marketable assets asquickly as possible.   But the Board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, was farfrom specific in addressing the need for incentive-based compensation forcontractors. It said contractors could be paid "as a percentage of proceedsnet of expenses, with the percentage increasing as proceeds increaserelative to the estimated market value of assets."   While that description acknowledges the industry's rejection of fixedfees, it failed to state exactly whether RTC would be willing to pay basefees - to cover a management firm's costs - in addition to performance-based fees.   The industry's desire to perform the asset management, or generalcontractor, role in liquidations was mentioned - but not directly addressed- in the strategic plan.   On Capitol Hill, the document drew early applause. Rep. Bruce Vento, aMinnesota Democrat who heads a House task force monitoring the thriftbailout, said he was pleased with the Board's decision to quickly disposeof the assets. "Procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have topay to manage [the assets]. The stuff doesn't get better with age," Ventosaid in a wire service article.   Anticipating accusations of dumping, the Board justified its pledge tomove swiftly, saying that "holding properties off the market for anextended period of time may increase the ultimate costs of assetdisposition because of the expenses associated with managing and financingthe property." It also noted the risks of deterioration if properties areheld in RTC's portfolio for long periods.   "It is, therefore, important to begin returning assets to the privatesector as soon as feasible," the strategic plan states.   Oversight Board President Daniel P. Kearney attempted to silence chargesof dumping real estate on depressed markets by explaining that it wouldtake several years for RTC to complete the "arduous" legal process oftaking clear title to its properties and readying them for the market.   Christopher Kallivokas, president of Real Estate Recovery Inc., an assetmanagement firm based in Sterling, Va., agreed that fears of propertydumping were unfounded. Kallivokas argues that the RTC for the most partwon't be delivering new properties to the market. "Virtually every propertyin the RTC's inventory has been available [to buyers] for some time undertheir former ownership, whether it was a former S&L or FSLIC," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Two S&Ls Added to Program   RTC closed the year by taking over two small thrifts: the $70.9 million-asset Columbia FSA, Webster, Tex., and the $27.5 million-asset Silver SAFA, Silver City, N.M.   During 1989 the agency resolved 37 institutions, as shown in thebreakdown below. Another 11 were advertised for sale in November, and thosetransactions should be completed shortly.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Crafting the Rescue Process   The Oversight Board's strategic plan instructs RTC to take specificsteps to assure that it resolves failed thrift institutions quickly andinexpensively without threatening local financial and real estate markets.Those instructions include:   * Limit any new lending or investments by conservatorships to low-riskassets.   * By Jan. 15, develop a prioritization schedule for institutions to bemarketed and resolved.   * By Jan. 15, develop plans for soliciting bids from all interestedqualified buyers, including procedures for encouraging the participation ofwomen and minorities in the bidding process.   * By Jan. 15, develop procedures for making available to all potentialbidders full information on each institution under RTC control and fornotifying rejected bidders within 30 days.   * By March 30, establish a national sales program to coordinate thedisposition of any financial assets held in conservatorship.   * By March 30, report to the Oversight Board on the feasibility ofhedging RTC's overall interest rate exposure.   * By Aug. 31, report to the Oversight Board and Congress on the reviewof case resolutions entered into by FSLIC between Jan. 1, 1988, and Aug. 9,1989.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990RTC Fills Key Housing Post   RTC has named Stephen S. Allen, a veteran of the non-profit housingcommunity, to serve as director of the agency's low-income housing program.   Allen takes the helm of RTC's most politically sensitive area after 13years with the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., where he was an associatedirector in charge of neighborhood preservation projects. In that position,he directed the group's development efforts in designing modelpublic/private partnerships for affordable housing.   At his new post, Allen will direct and coordinate the sale of RTC'sresidential properties to eligible buyers nationwide. An RTC statement saidhe and his staff plan to work closely with state housing finance agencies,various national non-profit housing organizations and governmentalassociations to identify eligible buyers.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990RTC Writes a Best Seller   If only demand was this strong for RTC's real estate...   The company handling inquiries and orders for the agency's newlypublished property listings was flooded with more than 15,000 toll-freecalls in its first two days on the job.   Those placing orders by phone last week were told by harried operatorsthat they probably would not receive their books for about a month - quitea long time considering that RTC's Oversight Board just instructed theliquidation agency to "avoid deferring the marketing of properties."   Some calling the 800-number that leads to the Dallas headquarters ofAmerican Airlines Direct Marketing Corp. received the following recordedmessage: "Due to the overwhelming response to the Resolution Trust Corp.program, all of our agents are busy. Please call back later." Others weresimply asked to hold for the next available agent.   "It's very hectic" said one weary operator, who couldn't offer anestimate for the number of orders placed by the 15,000 callers during thefirst two days.   Copies of the inventory report may be ordered by calling (800) 431-0600.    The reports are priced at $10 each for the commercial and land volumes,and $15 each for the single-family and multi-family residential reports.The complete set is available for $50. Check, credit card or C.O.D. ordersare accepted.   The same toll-free number may also be used to inquire about locating thereports at one of 1,400 depository libraries throughout the country.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990GRAPEVINE   RTC's Dallas staff underwent a growth spurt last week when nearly 50employees of the defunct Federal Asset Disposition Association joined thebailout agency's regional office. The new recruits are filling assetmanagement, contracting and support positions at various levels. Amongthose assuming key RTC posts will be former FADA contracting staffer JanieThomas, who will serve as senior contracting specialist in Dallas. Manystaffers from FADA's Atlanta office have joined RTC in that city, too.   Asset managers are hoping RTC will sharpen its definition of "competingproperties" in the agency's conflict-of-interest rules. As currentlyworded, the provision could preclude a contractor from managing West Coastapartment buildings if that firm owned "competing" apartment buildings onthe East Coast. The industry's recommended solution: RTC's conflict rulesshould concern themselves only with similar properties in the sameimmediate, geographic market.   Staffers at the RTC Oversight Board are zeroing in on appointees tochair the national advisory board and each of six regional advisory panels.The seven, who will comprise the national board, will help select theremaining regional advisers. After sifting through scores of nominatingletters, the staff will soon eliminate the runners up and ask the OversightBoard to okay their selections. The seven are expected to be named withinthe next month or so.   It looks like RTC's consolidated office network in the western regionmay not be operational until spring, despite what was originally a Januarytarget. The Denver-based operation, which was initially dealt a larger sumof thrift assets than any other region, has been slow in establishing itsthree field offices slated for Denver, Phoenix and somewhere in OrangeCounty, Calif. By contrast, the east region has already opened its fourfield offices, and begun staffing. The Baton Rouge, La. office, forinstance, already employs 55.   Staffers in the Baton Rouge field office are trying to remove themystique from RTC's registration process for aspiring contractors. Agencyofficials will spend the next two Monday's conducting educational seminarsfor firms in Louisiana and Mississippi.   New England's real estate lenders took another pounding in the thirdquarter. Veribanc Inc., a financial statistics firm in Wakefield, Mass.,said real estate-related loans and real estate repossessed by New Englandbanks increased for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. At southwest banks,however, the situation seems to have stabilized and - by some measures -improved.
