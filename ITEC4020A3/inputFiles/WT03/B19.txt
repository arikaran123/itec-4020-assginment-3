Both the A/D module andthe control module are connected via a high density ribbon cable on theback of the module. The modules may be placed in any order with the controlmodule placed on either end or in the middle. If less than 4 A/D modulesare being used, the empty spaces may also be placed in any position. A/Dmodules are addressed by their A/D channel assignment switch setting whichis mislabeled "RAM Size" but correctly labeled "SW1".It is found in the A/D module on the memory board. Never assign the samechannels to more than one A/D module attached to the same control module.

For example F(17) A(0) W(13) setsthe digitizers so that 7/8 of the data points stored will be taken afterthe stop trigger signal was received. If your total memory is 512KS/channel,then 448K samples would be taken after the stop trigger signal. F(17) A(1) W(y) Sample Speed This sets the digitizer sample rate.For example F(17) A(1) W(59) sets the digitizers to 10 Mega Samples persecond. The external clock input can be selected by using an external clockcode. For example, F(17) A(1) W(132) uses the external clock input insteadof the internal clock. The external clock may be slowed internally for specialapplications by selecting the proper code. F(18) A(ch) W(z) Input Voltage Selection This selects the usablerange of input voltages. Every channel must be programmed separately. Eachmodule may have different voltage range programmed into each channel. Forexample, the following commands set channel 0 to +/- 2V, channel 1 to +/-5V, channel 3 and 4 to +/- 1V: F(18) A(0) W(12), F(18) A(1) W(8), F(18)A(2) W(2), F(18) A(3) W(2). The second module uses channels 4 to 8 and soon, up to channel 15 on the 4th module. F(10) Clear LAM This clears the LAM flip-flop on the control module. F(26) Enable LAM This enables the LAM on the control module so thatwhen the digitizers receive a stop trigger and finish digitizing, a LAMis sent to the LAM Encoder Module. This does not clear the LAM. If the LAMwas previously set, an immediate interrupt will be generated. F(9) Start Digitizers This starts the digitizers continuously samplingand storing data in memory. stop trigger or F(25) Hardware or Software Trigger This stops the digitizers after thepost trigger samples have been taken. The F(25) command and a TTL pulseinto the stop trigger input on the front of the control module work identically.After the digitizer is completely finished taking data, the control moduleLAM will be set. If the LAM has been enabled, this LAM will be sent ontothe dataway to the LAM Encoder Module. F(16) A(ch) Prepare to Read Data This command selects the channelnumber to be read. Channels may be read in any order and can be read morethan once. Each time the F(16) command is issued, the A/D module will begintransmitting data from the beginning of the selected channel's memory, notfrom where it left off last time. F(2) Read Data Word This command is used to read back sequentialdata points from the digitizer's memory. Q-stop mode is available, ie, validdata will be signified by Q=1, invalid data by Q=0 (read past the end ofdata.) F(8) Check LAM This puts the status of the LAM into Q even if theLAM is not enabled. F(27) A(ch) Generate A/D LAM This command will generate a LAM whichwill come from the A/D module assigned to the specified channel. It is usefulfor identifying which A/D channel is in which slot. For example, supposethe controller module is in slot N=5 and 2 digitizer modules are in slotsN=3 and N=4. Then an F(27) A(0) might generate a LAM in slot N=4 signifyingthat channel 0 to 3 were plugged into slot N=4. Remember that this and allother command must be issued only to the controller module. F(11) A(ch) Clear A/D LAM This clears the LAM on the A/D module whichis assigned to the channel specified. Any of the 4 channels on that modulemay be used interchangeably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WT03-B19-2IA041-000763-B003-441http://pisces.ucsd.edu:80/~ggunner/d3midschmatic.html 132.239.190.110 19970303070444 text/html 2180HTTP/1.0 200 Sending Processed HTML Content-length: 2048MIME-version: 1.0Server: OSU/2.1aContent-type: text/html GeFanuc PLC Controlled DIII-D Mid-Plane Probe Schematic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WT03-B19-3IA040-000756-B024-520http://pisces.ucsd.edu:80/~rlehmer/resume.html 132.239.190.110 19970303071319 text/html 3221HTTP/1.0 200 Sending Processed HTML Content-length: 3089MIME-version: 1.0Server: OSU/2.1aContent-type: text/html Ron Lehmer's Resume Ronald Lehmer 3314 Mentone Avenue #2 Los Angeles, CA 90034 Home (310)838-4734 Work (619)534-9740 OBJECTIVE A scientific research and development position specializingin experimental plasma physics and computers.

In order to isolate which memory boards weredefective, a test jig with parallel data and address lines and a clock andstrobe system was built. The jig was driven by a DRQ3B high performanceparallel interface card installed in a MicroVAX II. All of the driver code forthe test was developed in house using QIO calls to the card, as well as thesorting procedure to determine the severity of the memory failures. CAMAC Systems Projects Development of Non-standard CAMAC module drivers into MDS The MDS data acquisition provided the hooks to allow user written CAMAC moduledrivers to be included in the standard high level MDS interface. For thediagnostic work at DIII-D, drivers for scalers and clock modules not supportedin MDS was required. Using templates from MDS written in FORTRAN, the modules'actions can be scripted. In addition, CASE tools such as CMS and CDD arerequired to correctly build the drivers and the user interface is configuredusing the TDMS forms package. Development of Custom 20MHz Waveform Recorders for the PISCES In addition to leading the design and fabrication program to assemble the 64channel A/D system, the development of the MDS user interface was critical inverifying the functionality of the digitizing system. Critical testing includedthe testing of clock and gain settings, operation of the stop trigger systemand post trigger counters, and data integrity. FORTRAN codes and some MDSscripts were used to provide a rudimentary test interface for the engineeringteam to test each function of the digitizing system. Installation of Hytec Ethernet Crate Controllers at PISCES Lab Development of new CAMAC management software (ECCTS) compatible with Hytec ECCsoftware. Based user interface on original CTS (CAMAC Topology Server)developed by ORNL, however, converted logical name management to be compatiblewith new software environment. Also provided privileged user interface tostarting and stopping Hytec ECC communication software. In addition, a problem with the Ethernet hardware of the Hytec Controllersprecluded their use in a fiber optic Ethernet network that included a repeater.Was able to evaluate network problem and determine that upgraded controllerswere necessary. Installation of Hytec Ethernet Crate Controllers at DIII-D Tokamak Similar software/hardware integration environment, however, some CAMACmodules used on Langmuir probe diagnostics were affected by presence of anenabled Inhibit line on the CAMAC dataway. Determined by testing that moduleswere operating normally and that Hytec default configuration is to enable theI-line, rather than ORNL software, that disables it. Wrote software thatdisables I-line on ECC whenever controllers are reset by user action. World Wide Web Experience WWW Server Configuration and Management Experience with OSU HTTP, NCSA httpd, and MacHTTP Servers, includingrules and mapping configuration and security considerations. As Webmaster,generated a majority of server content from existing promotional material andscientific reports. Provided support to other users in group in theirproduction of WWW material. Monitored server accesses and generated reports. CGI Programming Experience using CGI scripts to generate Metrolink commuter trainschedules on the fly. Other CGI scripts give user-customized information aboutstation locator maps and connecting transit information. WWW Content Production Two major projects: PISCES Lab Outreach Project and Southern CaliforniaRailroad Resources. The PISCES Lab Outreach Project involved the conversion ofexisting progress report material to HTML. In addition, the Beryllium SafetySystem in the PISCES Lab requires a variety of material updated on a regularbasis as well as a real-time digital camera of the facility. Analysis Applications Programming FLCTRNS - A Plasma Turbulence Analysis Package Originally written in FORTRAN with no graphical user interface, theFLCTRNS code was rewritten in IDL (a 4GL programming language) to provide anintuitive X windows graphical interface. FLCTRNS takes digitized data from anarray of Langmuir probes and computes auto and cross power spectra, wavenumberand coherency spectra, dispersion relations S(k,f), and an estimation of thetransport of plasma particles due to the turbulent fluctuations. Additionalmodules have been added for analyzing non-time stationary behavior in theturbulence using the Wavelet transform. The modular nature of FLCTRNS hasallowed for the simultaneous support of the program at five differentfacilities running three different underlying database packages. Time Domain Visualization of Density Structures One of the major diagnostics in the turbulence measurements at PISCESLab is an array of Langmuir probes arranged in an 8 by 8 array. Thus,turbulence at 64 spatial locations is recorded simultaneously. One method foranalyzing the intermittent turbulent behavior in the plasma is to assemblemovies of the density fluctuations, using IDL to extract data from the databaseand generate shaded color contour plots of the fluctuation levels. The colorcontour plots are then converted to PICT files and transferred to a Macintoshto generate Quicktime movies of the time dependent motion of the intermittentdensity blobs in the plasma. Other Analysis Codes Maintained and enhanced other analysis codes, including Langmuir probeanalysis codes for single, double, and triple probes. Developed tools to inferelectric field magnitude and shear from emissive probe measurements of theplasma space potential. Maintained automated codes that compute the operatingpoint of power supplies, gas feed systems, and other user specified settings. DCL Programming DCL Programming tasks have included the following: User interface to control data acquisition system Nightly automation of WWW server statistics analysis Monthly accounting and error log processing Image backup interface with selection capability for disks and tapes VMS Software Experience VMS Operating System VAXCluster Software (MSCP disks, queue management, redundant design) DECnet, LAT, LAST Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX) FORTRAN C (both VAXC and DECC) VAX Debugger Common Data Dictionary (CDD) Code Management System (CMS) Pathworks for Macintosh WT03-B19-5IA040-000756-B024-543http://pisces.ucsd.edu:80/~rlehmer/camac/camac_pic.html 132.239.190.110 19970303071336 text/html 1961HTTP/1.0 200 Sending Processed HTML Content-length: 1829MIME-version: 1.0Server: OSU/2.1aContent-type: text/html Gunner-Lehmer CAMAC Module Photo Page Gunner-Lehmer CAMAC Module Photo Page The modules pictured here are the GL-AD1020 Waveform Recorder, a 4 channel highspeed CAMAC digitizer.

The plasma source consists of a hot LaB6 cathode with an annular, water-cooled copper anode and attached drifttube. The vacuum system includes four turbo-molecular pumps with a pumping speed of 1500 1/s each. The plasma diameter can be adjusted between 3 and 10 cm by three independent magnet coils located in the source region. The main chamber magnetic field (variable between 0.01 and 0.19 T) is produced by four water-cooled coils. The main diagnostics include: (1) motor driven water cooled Langmuir probes; (2) fast scanning probe assemblies capable of measuring radial density, floating and plasma potential, plasma flow velocities and Mach number profiles; (3) a 1.3 m Czerny-Turner monochromator with an OMA system; (4) a fast reciprocating probe for density and potential fluctuation measurements and the determination of fluctuation-induced transport; (5) several baratron and ionization gauges for neutral pressure measurements for neutral pressure measurements; (6) a CID camera; (7) an IR surface temperature monitor. A CAMAC crate with slow and fast data loggers and a Micro Vax computer system is used for data acquisition and processing. Differential pumping is employed to achieve a neutral gas pressure of 2x10^-4 - 10^-2 torr in the plasma source, while keeping the main chamber pressure between 6x10^-5 and 2x10^-3 torr. Plasma is produced in H2, D2, He, and Ar gas. Plasma densities of 10^11-5x10^13 cm-3 in hydrogen and helium, and up to 1x10^14 cm-3 in argon have been achieved. The electron temperature is in the range of 3 - 30 eV. Neutral hydrogen densities inside the plasma are determined from absolutely calibrated Ha line intensities. A Fabry-Perot etalon is used to measure the temperatures of main plasma ions, neutrals and various impurity species. The PISCES-A chamber provides good diagnostic access. The fast scanning probe system has been extensively used for 2-D and 3-D mapping of plasma density and potential profiles during biased limiter and divertor simulation experiments and tests of magnetized probe theory and presheath measurements. The PISCES-A plasma source is presently converted for higher density hydrogen operation in order to study plasma plugging effects in the gaseous divertor regime. Pulsed operation will enable us to operate at a discharge current as high as 250 A. The differential pumping capability is increased by installing a second turbomolecular pump at the plasma source. This allows plasma production at higher pressures while maintaining high electron temperature and ionization efficiency. [1] D.M.Goebel et al., J.Nucl.Mater. 121(1984)277.

Ease-of-use and high sample throughput are important for the walk-up NMR environment. With this in mind, Varian developed GLIDE, a simplified user interface that is easy to use without sacrificing advanced features. Depending on their skill level, users can switch between GLIDE and the more advanced VNMR™ user interface. Drop-down menus and pop-up windows provide the familiarity and ease-of-use of desktop PCs on a modern NMR spectrometer. Selected buttons are visibly marked after a pop-up window appears, providing user interface location status. GLIDE allows the user to submit a sample, automatically or interactively lock and shim, select a solvent and experiement, and go! If specific acquisition or processing parameters need adjustment, an icon-driven customization facility is available. After a particular data set is acquired, processed, and plotted, the data can be archived with the user-selected options clearly indicated. This feature saves the interactive NMR session as a visual template, making it much easier to repeat. After selecting the experiment and solvent, "dimmed" options can now be selected allowing users to customize their setup options or go directly to fully automatic NMR operation. GLIDE also features a context-sensitive information bar which reduces the learning curve for the novice or occasional user. As the mouse passes over a button or option within GLIDE, the information bar displays a description of that item. The NMR spectrometer session, from parameter selection to plotted output, can be saved as an interactive, visual template. With icons, paramters, and other features adjustable in either text or visual form, recalling or repeating similar sessions will be much easier. Within GLIDE, everything from button labels and icons to parameter descriptions is adjustable. Groups of individuals, such as advanced users, novices, or students can tailor a particular user interface to optimize performance, restrict parameter adjustment, or educate users. This level of customization, combined with GLIDE's logical, results-focused design, will benefit all GEMINI 2000 users by creating an unsurpassed level of comfort and familarity for walk-up NMR spectrometer operation.

Single- or multi-dimentional, high-resolution, narrow bandwidth spectra are easily obtained without introducing aliasing artifacts or requiring excessive data storage capabilities. Digital filtering provides sharper cutoffs compared to analog filters, thereby minimizing the artifacts folding from outside the region of interest. The frequency-independent filter response of digital filters ensures flatter baselines and more accurate integration across the entire spectrum when compared to analog filters. Applications such as the detection and quantitation of low-level signals from polymer and groups are enhanced with oversampling and digital filtering.

Intelligent Automation Varian's exclusive MAGICAL™ II (MAGnetics Instrument Control and Analysis Language) macro language delivers the most intelligent NMR automation available. It combines all VNMR commands with high-level language features, such as IF statements and loops, and provides access to parameters and key features of the data, such as integrals and frequencies. A customizable, menu-driven program for automation allows up to 100 randomly accessed samples to be queued. After selecting the sample location, experiment, and solvent, processing and plotting automatically starts before the next sample is even in the magnet. Users can change the priority of samples and interrupt an automation run without having to re-program the remaining samples. The enter and status windows of the automation user interface can be customized to meet specific needs. Fast Sample Handling for High-throughput Sites The Sample Management System (SMS) autosampler delivers fast, reliable sample handling for both walk-up and quality control facilities. Its 30-second sample change time dramatically improves productivity, and for 1D proton or fluorine analyses which take four minutes or less, it can provide up to 25% higher throughput than conventional NMR autosamplers. The SMS autosampler provides the most efficient use of resources by allowing unattended operation. Developed in partnership with Zymark Corporation, the SMS autosampler uses state-of-the-art robotics including self-calibration and a tactile-sensing gripper. Optically-encoded potentiometers ensure long-term positional accuracy, while voltage feedback circuitry verifies robotic functions for maximum reliability. The SMS autosampler can be configured with easy-to-remove 50- or 100-sample racks, accommodating either 5- or 10-mm NMR tubes. For polymer analyses, modified trays are available for sample heating before introduction to the magnet.The versatility and expandability of the Sample Management System ensure a viable upgrade path for evolving sample handling needs.

Introduction For many people dieting has become the "normal" way to eat. Not often can you get through a day without thinking about calories, fat grams, or the exercise you think you should be doing but have trouble finding time for. Thinness, discipline, and restrained eating have become confused with goodness, strength of character, control, and success. Most folks buy into this way of thinking but manage to keep it in perspective. People with eating disorders, however, lose that perspective and become obsessively preoccupied with food and weight. They act out their preoccupations with compulsive behaviors that hurt their bodies, ruin relationships, and destroy self-respect. Read on to learn what you can do to help yourself or someone you care about. Then, if you want more information, follow the instructions for ordering our monthly newsletter. Good luck to you as you find out how to fight the disorders that have brought suffering and misery to thousands of people, perhaps some just like you or someone you love. Return to Table of Contents Definitions Anorexia nervosa: the relentless pursuit of thinness People refuse to maintain normal body weight for age and height. They weighs 85% or less than what is expected for age and height. In women, menstrual periods stop (or do not start if they are prepubertal when weight loss begins). They deny the seriousness of their low weight. They are frantically afraid of gaining weight and getting fat even though they may be alarmingly underweight. They report feeling fat even when very thin. Anorexia can kill. In addition to the above diagnostic criteria, it often includes depression, irritability, withdrawal, and peculiar eating behaviors such as rituals, strange food combinations, and division of foods into "good/safe" and "bad/dangerous" categories. Bulimia nervosa: the diet-binge-purge disorder People eat more in one or two hours than most folks would consume in a normal meal. Food is often gobbled or stuffed. They feel out of control while eating, like they cannot stop, especially if binge food is high-fat, high-sugar "forbidden food." They vomit, misuse laxatives, exercise, or starve to get rid of the calories. They diet when not bingeing, which makes them hungry and vulnerable to the next episode. Like anorexics, they believe their worth depends on being thin. Their weight may be normal or near normal unless they are also anorexic. Like anorexia, bulimia can kill. In addition to the above criteria, it can include depression, loneliness, shame, and feelings of emptiness even though these folks put up a cheerful front. Friends may describe them as competent and fun to be with, but underneath, where they hide their guilty secret, they are hurting. Feeling unworthy, they have great difficulty talking about their feelings, which almost always include anxiety, depression, and self-doubt. Binge eating disorder: sometimes called compulsive eating People binge eat frequently and repeatedly. They feel out of control and unable to stop eating during binges. They may eat rapidly and secretly, or they may snack and nibble all day long. They feel guilty and ashamed and experiences great psychological distress. They have a history of diet failures. They tend to be depressed and obese. People who have binge eating disorder do not purge like bulimics do. They may be genetically predisposed to weigh more than the cultural ideal, so they diet, make themselves hungry, and then binge in response to that hunger. Or they may eat for emotional reasons: to comfort themselves, escape disturbing situations, and numb emotional pain. Regardless of the reason, diet programs are not the answer. In fact, diets almost always make matters worse. Anorexia athletica: sometimes called compulsive exercising People exercise more frequently and more intensely than is required for good health or competitive excellence. They may be fanatics about weight and diet. They steal time to exercise from work, school, and relationships. They focus on challenge and forget that physical activity can be fun. They define their self-worth in terms of performance. They are never satisfied with their performance and do not savor victories. When they achieve a personal best, they immediately set a higher goal. When confronted with their unrealistic demands on themselves, they may become defensive and say something like, "You don't understand. I'm a serious, elite athlete, and you aren't. I'm special and different. You couldn't possibly understand my situation." Compulsive exercising is not a recognized diagnosis as are anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder. We include it here because many people who are preoccupied with food and weight exercise compulsively in attempts to control weight. The real issues are not weight and performance excellence but rather power, control, and self-respect. Return to Table of Contents Statistics. How many people have eating disorders? Research suggests that about 1% of female adolescents have anorexia nervosa and another 4% have bulimia. About 10% of people with eating disorders are boys and men. About one-third of adult Americans, both male and female, are overweight or obese. Many of these people have binge eating disorder. Researchers can only guess at the vast numbers of people who have subclinical or threshold eating disorders. They do not have normal relationships with food and weight, but neither are they disturbed enough to qualify for a formal diagnosis. Since physicians do not have to report eating disorders to a health agency, and since people who have them tend to be secretive, denying they have problems, we have no way of knowing exactly how many people in this country are affected. Percentages extrapolated from research are as close as we can get. Return to Table of Contents Who gets eating disorders? Eating disorders usually appear between ages 12 and 25, although there are exceptions in both directions. They tend to begin when a person is dealing with a difficult transition, shock, or loss: puberty, marriage, divorce, family problems, death, new job, new school, breakup of an important relationship, sexual or physical abuse, critical comments from a respected authority figure, and so forth. These situations sometimes demand more of people than they believe they can deliver. They feel helpless and out of control. Wanting to take control but not really knowing how, they seize control of the one thing readily available to them: their bodies. The dieting, bingeing, purging, exercising, and other strange behaviors are not random craziness. They are heroic, but misguided and ineffective, attempts to take charge in a world that seems overwhelming. People who become anorexic often were good children: conscientious, hard working, and good students. They may be people pleasers who seek approval and avoid conflict. They may take care of other people and strive for perfection, but underneath they feel defective and inadequate. They want to be special, to stand out from the mediocre masses. They try to achieve that goal by losing weight and being thin. People who become bulimic often have problems with anxiety, depression and impulsivity (shoplifting, casual sexual activity, alcohol and drug abuse, etc.) They may be dependent on their families, even though they profess independence. Many have problems trusting other people and have few or no satisfying friendships and romantic relationships. Because of intense demands for thinness, some people are at high risk for eating disorders: wrestlers, jockeys, cheerleaders, sorority members, socialites, dancers, gymnasts, runners, models, actresses, entertainers, and male homosexuals. Return to Table of Contents Danger signs Since everyone today seems concerned about weight, and since most people diet at least once in a while, how can one tell what is "normal" behavior and what is a problem that may escalate to threaten life and happiness? No one person will manifest all of the characteristics listed below, but people with eating disorders will demonstrate several. Food behaviors: People skip meals, take only tiny portions, won't eat in front of other people, eat in ritualistic ways, mix strange food combinations. Always have a reason why they aren't hungry; become "disgusted" with favorite foods like red meat and desserts; eat only a few "safe" foods; boast of how healthy they eat; always have a diet soda in hand; drastically reduce or completely eliminate fat intake; read food labels religiously. If they break their rigid discipline and eat normal or large portions, they excuses themselves from the table to vomit and get rid of the calories. They sometimes use laxatives, diet pills, water pills, or "natural" products from the health food store to promote weight loss. Appearance and body image behaviors: People lose, or try to lose, weight. Frantic fears of weight gain and obesity. They wear baggy clothes, sometimes in layers, to hide fat, hide emaciation, and stay warm. Obsess about clothing sizes, complain that they are fat even though others reassure them they are not; spend lots of time inspecting themselves in the mirror, and usually find something to criticize. Detest all or specific parts of their bodies, especially breasts, bellies, thighs, and buttocks. Insist that they cannot feel good about themselves unless they are thin, and they never get thin enough to satisfy themselves. Exercise behaviors: They exercise excessively and compulsively. They may tire easily, keeping up their regimens only through sheer will power. As time passes, athletic performance suffers; even so, they refuse to change their routines. Thinking behaviors: In spite of average or above-average intelligence, these people think in magical, simplistic ways: e.g., "If I'm thinner, I'll feel better." They lose the ability to think logically, evaluate reality objectively, and admit and correct undesirable consequences of their choices and actions. They argue, become irrational, and then withdraw or tantrum. They become competitive, wanting to be special: the best, the smallest, the thinnest, etc. They have trouble concentrating; they obsess about food and weight, and hold to rigid, perfectionist standards for themselves and others. Emotional behaviors: They have trouble talking about their feelings, especially anger. They deny they are angry: e.g., "Everything is OK. I'm just tired." Escape stress by turning to binge food, exercise, or anorexic rituals. Become moody, irritable, cross, and snappish. Touchy: respond to confrontation and even low-intensity interactions with tears, tantrums, or withdrawal. Feel they do not fit in; avoid friends and activities; withdraw and become socially isolated. Return to Table of Contents Medical complications If not stopped, starving, stuffing, and purging can lead to irreversible physical damage and even death. Eating disorders can affect every cell, tissue, and organ in the body. The following are some of the more common problems: Irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, death. Kidney damage, death. Liver damage (especially when eating disorders are combined with substance abuse), death. Destruction of teeth, rupture of esophagus, disruption of menstrual cycle, infertility, depleted immune system. Bloating, swelling, constipation. Muscle loss, growth of hair on face, arms, and body; fainting spells. Anemia, malnutrition, sleep disruption, bad dreams, mental fuzziness, cold and blue hands and feet. Permanent loss of bone mass leading to humped back, broken hips, stress fractures, loss of height, and in some cases premature death. Binge eating disorder: cardiovascular disease, increased risk of bowel, breast, and reproductive cancers; diabetes, and arthritic damage to joints. Some people become so depressed struggling with an eating disorder that they give up and commit suicide. Return to Table of Contents What causes eating disorders? There are many theories. For any particular person, some or all of the following factors may be woven together to produce the final problem. Biological factors: Temperament seems to be, at least in part, genetically determined, and some temperaments (obsessive-compulsive and sensitive-avoidant, for example) are more vulnerable to eating disorders than others. Also, once a person begins to starve, stuff, or purge, those behaviors can alter brain chemistry and prolong the problem. For example, both starving and stuffing can activate brain chemicals that produce feelings of peace and euphoria that temporarily dispel anxiety and depression. Psychological factors: People with eating disorders tend to be perfectionistic. They may have unrealistic expectations of themselves and others. In spite of their many achievements, they feel inadequate, defective, and worthless. In addition, they do not see shades of gray in themselves or in the world. Everything is either good or bad, a success or a failure, fat or thin. If thin is good, then thinner is better, and thinnest is best - even if thinnest is 68 pounds in a hospital bed on life support. Some people with eating disorders use the behaviors to avoid sexuality. Others use them to try to take control of themselves and their lives. They are strong, usually winning the power struggles they find themselves in, but inside they feel powerless, defeated, and resentful. People with eating disorders often lack a sense of identity. They try to create one by creating a socially acceptable appearance. They have answered the existential question, "Who am I?" with "I am, or I am trying to be, thin; therefore, I matter." People with eating disorders often are legitimately angry, but because they seek approval and fear criticism, they do not know how to express their anger in healthy ways. They turn it against themselves by starving or stuffing. Family factors: Some people with eating disorders say they feel smothered in their families. Others feel abandoned, misunderstood, and alone. Parents who overvalue physical appearance can unwittingly contribute to anorexia or bulimia. So can those who make critical comments, even in jest, about their children's bodies. These families tend to be overprotective, rigid, and ineffective at solving conflict. Sometimes they are emotionally cold. There are often high expectations of achievement and success. Children learn not to disclose self-doubts, fears, anxieties, and imperfections. Instead they try to resolve their problems by manipulating weight and food. Social factors:TV, movies, and magazines are three examples of media that flood people with messages about the "advantages" of being thin. Impressionable readers and viewers are told, sometimes directly, sometimes more subtly by the actors and models that are chosen for display, that thinness is a requirement for goodness, success, power, approval, popularity, intelligence, friends, and romantic relationships. The corollary is that non-thin means badness, moral laxity, weakness, lack of control, failure, stupidity, loneliness, rejection, and disapproval. Girls and women are disproportionally affected by anorexia and cultural demands for thinness. Never before in recorded history have females been exhorted to be as thin as is currently fashionable. Men, by contrast, are encouraged to be strong and powerful. As they work to develop their power in the gym and in the workplace, they equate "thin" with "skinny and weak." Perhaps that explains, at least in part, why only 10% of people with eating disorders are male. Trigger factors: If people are vulnerable to eating disorders, sometimes all it takes to put the ball in motion is a trigger event that they do not know how to handle. A trigger could be something as innocuous as teasing or as devastating as rape or incest. Triggers often involve the break up of a valued relationship. They often happen at times of transition where increased demands are made on people who already are unsure of their ability to meet expectations: new school, new job, death, divorce, family problems, and so forth. Return to Table of Contents Treatment of eating disorders Eating disorders are treatable, and people do recover from them. Recovery, however, is more than just the disappearance of starving, stuffing, and purging. To be lasting, it must include establishment of healthy weight and healthy eating patterns and resolution of the medical, psychological, social, and family problems that contributed to the eating disorder in the first place. Effective treatment includes several elements. Hospitalization for weight gain and to prevent medical crisis or death. Provides structure so eating patterns, bodily functions, and daily schedules can be stabilized. Hospitalization is often necessary when weight loss is extreme, when bingeing and purging are out of control, when there are related medical problems, when there is suicide risk, and when outpatient treatment has failed. Medication to relieve depression and anxiety. Dental work to repair damage and minimize future problems. Individual psychotherapy to develop healthy, effective ways of solving problems and taking control. Group therapy to build satisfying relationships; to learn how to express needs and feelings effectively. Family therapy to change old patterns and create new, more satisfying, ways of communicating. Nutritional counseling to debunk food myths and provide information about healthy eating. Support groups to provide peer support. (Note: Support groups by themselves are not sufficient treatment for an eating disorder. To be effective, they must be integrated into a comprehensive treatment plan.) Return to Table of Contents Where to find help If you are in crisis, go to a hospital emergency room or call a crisis hotline. Find the number in the yellow pages under Crisis Intervention. If you are not in crisis, ask your family doctor for an evaluation and referral. You can also ask people you trust, and who have been in your situation, for the names of physicians and counselors they found helpful. If you are a student, check with the school counseling center. Services may be low cost or free. To find low-cost resources, look for community service agencies in the Counselors section of the yellow pages. The organizations listed there may not provide formal eating disorders programs, but they do offer basic assistance to people who have no other options. Return to Table of Contents How to help someone you care about Your biggest problem will be convincing the person that he or she needs help. At first she will not admit there is a problem. She will fear weight gain. She will be ashamed and not want to admit what she is doing. She has used the eating disorder to protect, comfort, and empower herself. In the beginning at least, she will not want to give it up. Here are some suggestions to help you talk to an unhappy, but defiant, person. If your child is younger than 18 Get him professional help immediately. You have a legal and moral responsibility to get your child the care he needs. Don't let tears, tantrums, or promises to do better stop you. Begin with a physical exam, a dental exam, and a psychological evaluation. If the physician recommends hospitalization, do it. People die from these disorders, and sometimes they need a structured time out to break entrenched patterns. If the therapist asks you to participate in family sessions, do so. Children spend only one or two hours a week with their counselors. The rest of the time they live with their families. You need as many tools as you can get to help your child learn new ways of coping with life. If your friend is younger than 18 Tell a trusted adult - parent, teacher, coach - about your concern. If you don't, you may unwittingly help your friend avoid the treatment he or she needs to get better. If your child or friend is older than 18 Legally the person is now an adult and can refuse treatment. Encourage professional help, but expect resistance and denial. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink - even if it is thirsty. Some things to do Provide information. Give the person the URL of this Web site, or print out the information and hand it to them. Be supportive. The greatest gift you can give is a listening ear with no strings attached. Encourage professional help, but be prepared for denial, resistance, and stubborn, sullen hostility. Do what you can to persuade the person that a normal life is worth the hard work he or she will have to do to recover. Realize that recovery is the person's responsibility, not yours. Realize that people don't change until they want to, until they finally accept that being thin will not get them the happiness and power they want, and until they find some other way of dealing with problems. If the person refuses treatment, you get help for your fears and anxiety. Show him or her how healthy people use professional resources to help solve problems. Be kind to yourself. You are doing the best you can. No one, not even you, should expect more than that. Some things not to do Never nag, plead, beg, bribe, threaten, or manipulate. You will get stuck in a power struggle, and you will lose. Never criticize or shame. The person will withdraw. Don't pry. Respect privacy. Don't play police officer. The person will become resentful and even more secretive than before. Also, he or she will outwit you. Don't give advice unless you are asked for it. Even if the person does ask, don't expect him or her to act on it. Don't tell the person he or she has lost weight and is too thin. This is welcome news, and you will reinforce the problem. Don't congratulate the person on gaining weight. She will think, "I've gotten too fat. Now I'm not special anymore. I've lost, and they have won." Don't let the person run your family. For example, don't let him always decide what, where, and when you will eat. Don't ignore stolen food and bathrooms stained with evidence of purging. Make the person replace the food and clean up messes. Don't overestimate what you can accomplish. You can provide support and encouragement, but you can't make the person recover if he or she does not want to. Return to Table of Contents Prevention is easier than recovery Eating and exercise disorders are much easier to prevent than to cure. Remember that what you do speaks much louder than what you say. Give your friends and family the gift of a good role model. If you are a woman, get comfortable with your own body no matter what its size and shape. Never criticize your appearance. If you do, you teach others to be overly concerned about externals and critical of their own bodies. If you are a man, never criticize anyone's appearance, especially a woman or child's. Phrases like "thunder thighs" and "bubble butt," even if they are meant in jest, can wound deeply and puncture self-esteem. Remember that people are more than just bodies. They all have talents, abilities, hopes, dreams, values, and goals - just like you do. Most important of all, show - don't waste your time telling - people how you take care of yourself in healthy, responsible ways. Demonstrate how a competent person takes charge, solves problems, and builds a satisfying life. All of this demands a great deal of consciousness and vigilance on your part, but healthy role modeling is the most effective way to help people grow into health and strength.

What is a Trademark? Trademarks, Service Marks, Trade Names, and Company Logo A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, design, or any combination of these elements that is used by a business to identifya source of a product and to distinguish it from the competition evenif the source is unknown. Trademarks symbolize the reputation of thecompany and the quality of its products and services. A service mark is a word, phrase, symbol or design that isused by a business to identify a service rather than a tangible itemand to distinguish it from services offered by the competition. Forthis discussion, unless distinctions are made, "trademarks" refer to bothtrademarks and service marks. Trade names are corporate or business names. They identifythe business, i.e., the provider of the product or service, rather than theproduct or service itself. Trade names are the propoer nouns, so theycan be used in the possessive form and do not need to be followed by ageneric term. Because company names are frequently used both as trademarks and as tradenames, care must be taken to distinguish between the two uses and to follow the proper usage rules for each. Varian and Varian Associates, Inc.are trade names which are also registered trademarks. EXAMPLES: Trade Name: The linear accelerator, made by Varian Associates, Inc. has become the market leader for radiation therapy. Trade Name: Varian's latest enhancements for the accelerators became available last month. Trade Name: Varian is the world leader in vacuum system design for exceptional sputter processing. Trademark: Varian sputtering systems operate on production lines throughout the world. The company logo is a symbol used with the company name forcompany identity. Although it is not used as a trademark in literature, ourVA company logo is a registered trademark in countries throughout theworld. See the Corporate Identity guide for use of the company logo. Trademark Rights Product names used internationally are subject to the trademark laws ofeach country in which they are used. Although almost all countries havelaws for protecting trademarks, the laws may differ. In the United States, a company gains trademark rights by using a name witha product or service, not by merely selecting a mark. Generally, the firstcompany to use a trademark with a certain kind of product gains priorityover late users of a similar trademark for similar products. A company can register its trademarks with the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice, which provides certain legal advantages. Trademark and service mark registrations give the owner of the mark the right to prevent theuse of its marks by others in all states. Rights to a mark also can be lost if its use is discontinued. Nonuse of a mark with the intention of not resuming its use will result inabandonment of the mark. Therefore, attempting to preserve a markby "banking" it and making periodic use of it will not succeed if itappears that such use was not commercially significant and was madesolely to maintain ownership of a mark that is no longer intended for commercial use. Other countries give priority to the first to register a trademarkrather than the first to use a trademark. Each coun try has its own trademark registration procedure, so decisions to register atrademark need to be made country by country, balancing the importanceof protecting the trademark against the expense of registration. In all countries, trademark rights can be lost if the name becomes"generic", that is, if the name becomes the commonly accepted termfor the product, rahter than a distinctive term associating theproduct with a particular brand or source of quality. For example,the trademark Thermos was almost lost due to the public's generic useof the term as a common descriptive adjective or noun to describe orrefer to vacuum insulated containers.

Table of Contents: Star Workstation 4.5 | Automated Column & Solvent Selection | Peak Solutions Now you can increase lab productivity, expand existing resources, and lower costs with StarLIMS 7.0. New from the ground up, this Laboratory Information Management Software incorporates over ten years of Varian's practical experience with over 235 StarLIMS installations around the world. Offering labs a totally user definable database structure, StarLIMS is adaptable to virtually any lab requirement or environment. NEW! SQL-based client/server architecture. StarLIMS lets you choose the computing environment that meets your needs today with the flexibility to expand tomorrow. The software works with Oracle7, Sybase System 10, Microsoft SQL Server and Watcom SQL Server databases which run on numerous hardware platforms such as PCs, RISC workstations, minicomputers, and mainframes. Current network operating systems include UNIX, Windows NT Server, and Novell. NEW! StarLIMS' object-oriented technology. Save money by customizing StarLIMS to reuse Windows-based software objects (standard software modules) instead of programming new ones. StarLIMS lets you add new objects and includes built-in software objects that let you buildcustom sample login screens, results entry screens, approval screens and more. NEW! Five lab-specific options. Included with version 7.0 are StarLIMS' newest options: Scheduled Sample Login for continuous process, power, and water/waste industries; Batch Tree Management for the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries; Customer Specification and Material Inventory for all manufacturing industries; Analyst Certification and Training Management, and Lab Supplies Inventory Management, both for all types of labs. These options have been added to the existing Stability Study, Blending and Formulation, and Financial Applications options. NEW! Windows 95 Interface. StarLIMS 7.0 features a native graphical user interface for Windows 95 and Windows 3.x. Windows NT support to follow initial shipments. EXPERIENCE. Only from Varian. Put Varian's LIMS experience to work for you. From information managmentment to operations management, StarLIMS is the last word in laboratory handling. Varian has pulled out all the stops to make the latest revision of the Star Chromatography Workstation meet the heavy data acquisition demands of busy labs. Version 4.5, targeted for release in February 1996, has major enhancements that will improve lab productivity. The Workstation upgrades provide users with new Interactive Graphics tools for analyzing chromatograms. Simplifications to the user interface reduce training time and eliminate costly sample rework. Interactive Graphics The new Interactive Graphics software has been redesigned for graphical method building. Graphical placement of key data handling events makes for a more intuitive approach to method setup. With the new graphics software, it's possible to change signal to noise or peak integration controls with a click of the mouse. These features help busy laboratories speed up method development. Beyond changes to the user interface, the data handling software has been expanded and improved to give state of the art control of peak processing and instrument calibration. The better data handling will cut down time spent on sample rework. Easy to Use Version 4.5 has significant improvements in the ease of use category as well. A simplified Single Point Calibration interface greatly simplifies calibrations in this mode of operation. Organizing the sample data is now a snap, since the data directory path is in the sample list. The entire instrument startup process has been streamlined to cut operator training time. Designed for seamless control of Varian GC and LC instruments, Version 4.5 is the only data system offering customers automated control of Solid Phase MicroExtraction (SPME), the 1078 injector, Fast GC, and the PolyChrom Diode Array Detector. Version 4.5 will also expand its GLP compliance features to add tracking of column and LC module data. Version 4.5 has been written so that is compatible both with Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups. Customer: ChromoLab Environmental Services Where: Pleasanton, CA USA Who: Pierre Monette, Vice President Problem: "We were choking on paperwork!" The lab was had typing approximately 500 reports for 5000 samples a mont. "With a 1% error rate, we were losing our credibility." Solution: Purchase of Varian StarLIMS in December, 1993. Result: Lab productivity and accuracy have increased tenfold so that "StarLIMS has become the heart of our lab." All aspects of the operation, from sample login to electronic deliverables, are controlled by StarLIMS. Flexible software allows the lab to create unique management reports to suit needs of individual clients. ChromaLab has seized the technological advantage and has increased its sales by 20% in the last three years! Do you run multiple methods on a single HPLC system? Do you find yourself continually changing columns and solvents to tailor the system to your changing needs? Imagine being able to run a batch of samples overnight by six different methods, each with its own unique column and set of HPLC conditions. Using Varian's column and solvent selection system, the imaginable is now possible. Instead of manually changing solvents and columns, you can easily select the ones you need directly from the keypad on the pump. Or use Varian's Star Workstation to automatically program solvent and column switching for the ultimate in unattended automation. Solvent selection allows the chromatographer to select any one of eight different solvents as mobile phases in either isocratic or gradient mode. Column selection allows the chromatographer to automatically select one of six different columns already connected to the HPLC system. No more hassles of constantly making and breaking column connections or of changing solvents on the pump. Using the contact closures on the 9012 pump, you can select the solvents and column you need by setting the contact closures either on the keypad of the pump or from the Star Workstation via a click of the mouse. And, since Varian's Star LC modules are easily automated, you can switch solvents and columns in advance of the run, leaving the system totally unattended. Whether your lab does routine Quality Control, Method Development or Research, you can benefit from the ability to program solvent and column switching. See your productivity soar! Contact your Varian Sales Representative now and find out how you can turn your HPLC system into a productivity workhorse in your lab! Saturn GC/MS systems are renowned for unsurpassed detectivity in all modes of operation: EI, CI, MS and MS/MS. But to take full advantage of that performance, the system has to maintain optimal chromatographic peak shape for all analytes--from a nonpolar hydrocarbon to the most polar drug. Two new upgrades will help Saturn users meet that goal. The new 1078 injector, with its three modes of operation--split, splitless, and temperature ramped splitless-- delivers improved inertness in all injection techniques and is available as a cost effective upgrade to your 1077 injector body. In January 1996, Saturn will begin shipments of the latest advance in ion trap surface technology-SilChrom ion traps. Available as an upgrade, SilChrom (patent pending) guarantees inertness with a layer of both chromium and fused silica. Combined with the 1078 and a good fused silica column, SilChrom delivers the sharp, symmetrical peaks you need for even the most demanding compounds.

The most important step you can take in protecting Varian's trademarksis to use them properly. The rules and examples in this section showproper use of trademarks and illustrate some of the most commonexamples of misuse. If another company inquires ab out how to use a Varian trademark properlyin text, advise them to use the rules outlined in this section. Forgraphical uses, you should advise them of any specifics of the appearance of the trademark - color, typestyle, graphics, etc. - which will distinguishthe mark from other words. Grammatical Guidelines Use a Trademark as a Proper Adjective A trademark is a proper adjective; it should, therefore, never be used as acommon descriptive adjective. This means that it should at lesat begin with a capital letter and that it should describe a noun. Generally, the nounfollwing the trademark is the descriptive or generic name of a product.The descriptive name should appear in the print of the surrounding text.The mark identifies a particular brand of a product or service and modifiesthe generic name for the product or service. It is not the name of theproduct or service itself. EXAMPLE: ConFlat flanges To further emphasize our trademarks, you may follow the trademarks with the word "brand" written in the print of the surrounding text. EXAMPLE: ConFlat brand flanges In advertising copy when there is repeated use of the trademark, as a minimumrequirement, you may use the generic term following only the first prominentuse of the trademark. EXAMPLE: The UltraMass ICP-MS permits a variety of tasks to be accomplished simultaneously. UltraMass is simple enough for use in any laboratory environment. Avoid Using the Possessive Form Do not use the trademark in the possessive form. That is, do not use it withan apostrophe to show ownership. YES: VACION pumps are of great value. NO: VACION'S value is great. YES: EIMAC planar triodes NO: EIMAC's planar triodes Avoid Using the Plural Form Do not use the mark in a plural form. YES: LINATRON linear accelerators help customers boost productivity. NO: LINATRONS help customers boost productivity. Avoid Using the Verb Form Do not use the trademark as verbs. YES: A Germini spectrometer will be used to analyze the steroids in constraceptive drugs. NO: Gemini the steroids in contraceptive drugs. YES: Make a copy on the Xerox copier. NO: Xerox a copy of this letter. Use a Trademark Distinctively and Consistently You should always distinguish our trademarks from other words in the textin some way. This may include capitalizing all letters in the trademark, usinginitial caps, using initial caps with quotation marks, using italics, boldface, underline, a different color, or an agreed upon form. Thetrademark should be the most prominent word in the text either by size,font, or color. Trademarks should also be kept complete and separate. Do not abbreviatethem or use only a part of the trademark. Do not combine them with otherwords or numbers. Always ensure the mark is spelled correctly and reproducedfaithfully; avoid any variations. Also avoid using words such as "original" or "genuine" with a mark. Use of such words implies the presence of the sameproduct by others. EXAMPLES: Trademark: STAR YES: STAR local area network NO: STAR-2000 local area network YES: STAR 2000 local area network NO: STAR-Edit feature of the local area network YES: STAR-edit feature of the local area network Use of Trademark Notices and Symbols in the United States Companies in the United States use the superscript symbols ®, ©, and "SM"to give notice that they claim trademark rights in a product name or servicename. Althoug the law does not require use of any of these symbols to increasepublic recognition that the product or service name is a trademark, please followthese guidelines: ® Can be used only with trademarks which have been registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Use of this symbol without registration is forbidden by law, can bar subsequent registration, and can impair our ability to sue infringers of the mark. If you cannot reproduce the superscript symbol, another way of to give notice of registration is to display the words "Registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office" or the abbrevation "Reg. U.S.Pat. & TM Off." with the trademark or in a footnote. You may also follow the trademark with an R in parenthesis (R). ™ Can be used with any product name regarded as a trademark by placing the symbol adjacent to the mark at the mark's first or most prominent appearance. Do not use the ™ following the generic name of a product or service. YES: RES ELUT (TM) column NO: RES ELUT COLUMN (TM) The ™ is generally used with unregistered trademarks. An unregistered trademark is one which has been adopted by the business unit for use as a trademark but has not been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. However, it should not be used unless the Legal Department has first cleared the mark. See Sections on Selection, Searches, and Adoption. Another way to give this notice is to state "[PRODUCT NAME] is a trademark of [COMPANY]" with the trademark or in a footnote. SM Can be used with any service name regarded as a service mark. However, it should not be used unless the Legal Department has first cleared the mark. See Sections on Selection,, Searches and Adoption. Another way to give this notice is to state "{SERVICE NAME} is a service mark of [COMPANY]" with the trademark or in a footnote. The SM is generally used for an unregistered service mark. EXAMPLES: XIMATRON ® simulator STAR ™ gas chromatography system CLINAC(R) linear accelerators If a trademark appears repeatedly in a brochure, article, or other literature, youneed only use the appropriate trademark symbol with the first prominent appearance of the trademark. If you have a combination of a registered trademark and an unregistered trademark,you may give notice in the following ways: Propose ® Docu program Propose ® Docu ™ program When the mark is registered in one or more states (but not Federally), it ispermissible to identify it as a registered mark by using a footnote. i.e., "A registeredtrademark of Varian Associates, Inc." Use of Other Companies' Trademarks When we use the trademarks of other companies in our literature, we should followthe same rules as we do in using our own trademarks properly. The trademarkshould be used as a proper adjective and separated from other words in the text.Although there is no legal obligation to do so (unless we have agreed in a contract),we may choose to acknoledge the trademarks of other companies with a footnote. Whentrademarks of a number of comapnies appear in the same piece of literature,you may need to clarify ownership of each of the trademarks with a footnote. EXAMPLE: The UltraMass ICP-MS uses the OS/2 graphical user interface operating system. OS-2 is a trademark of International Business Machines Corporation. A foot note for a publication which refers to trademarks of two or more companiesmay be worded as follows: EXAMPLE: UNITYplus and VNMR are trademarks of Varian Associates, Inc. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners. As a matter of courtesy, you may also ask a company how it would like itstrademark acknowledged.

It isa process which is cost-effective in the long run because many potentialconflicts are elminiated or reduced if the steps in the process arefollowed carefully. Selection The process begins when a business unit selects a name for a new product. Because a name may already be used as a trademark by another company, a business unit should select and prioritize at least three names. From a legal point of view, distinctiveness is very important in selecting a mark. The most distinctive marks are coined terms which were originallymeaningless. Also distinctive, though not a coined term, is the arbitraryterm which is otherwise meaningless when applied to the product. The more originaland unique the name or symbol, the lesser the chance of infringing therights of others and the greater the ease in protecting the mark. COINED TERM: KODAK for cameras ARBITRARY TERM: CANDY for shoes After selection and at least six months prior to printing the sales literature,the business unit supplies the Legal Department with the followinginformation: The spelling, appearance, and derivation of the selected name(s) A description of the product Any literature on the product Projected date of first sale Countries in which the product is sold or will be sold List of its competitors Search An outside legal firm contracted by the Varian Legal Department will use thisinformation to search through on-line databases for an intial idea of whetherthe name may conflict with an existing name. If the in-house search is clear, the firm orders commercial searches which are more involved. They reduce thepossibility that Varian might adopt a trademark that infringes on another party's trademark rights. The search steps are as follows: The firm conducts an in-house database search for the name(s) in trademark databases covering the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. The firm analyzes the in-house search to determine whether another company is using the same or similar name for a for a similar product and how likely the other company is to object to Varian's use. The analysis and search are sent to the business unit for review and for a decision on whether to pursue the name. If there are possible conflicts, depending on the severity of the conflicts the business unit may: Abandon its choice(s) and select another name. Proceed with the commercial search. If, after the in-house search, the business unit wants to pursue its use of the name, the firm requests commercial searches -- a World search and a U.S. search. The World commercial search looks for possible conflicts throughout the world, and the United States search looks for conflicts with both registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States. The cost of a Full United States Search is approximately $320.00, and the cost of the World Wide Identical Screening Search is approximately $550.00 Upon receipt of the commercial search, our law firm analyzes the searches with the same basic process used for the in-house search. The analysis and search are sent to the business unit for review, and the business unit decides whether it wants to pursue the name or select a new name. If the business unit decides to pursue a name despite possible conflicts,the business unit may: Write to the owner of the conflicting mark asking for clearanceto use the mark. Use the name with the understanding that there may be an infringement problem and that it may have to stop its use of thename and re-establish customer association with the product usinga new name. If it is decided to select a new name, the search procedure must berepeated for the new name. This, of course, takes additional time. If the name is selected, the name is adopted for use as an unregisteredtrademark, and if appropriate, steps are taken to register the trademark. Note: Although commercial searches are thorough, theycannot guarantee absence of conflicts. Searches do not have the capabilityof finding every similar name, for instance, nor can a search uncovernames that are not recorded in a trademark office. Adoption After a name has been searched and selected for use, the business unit may use the ham. Through use, the name b ecomes an unregistered trademark and can be designated with a œ in the United States (see Proper Use of Trademarks). Sales and shipments in interstate commerce of goods bearing the trademark establish the date of first use and form the basis for our trademark rights against anyone who subsequently adopts the mark. Internal shipment or mailing is not sufficient. Ensure that the mark is affixed to the goods or its container. Although use of a name solely in advertising is not sufficient for trademark rights, use of a name solely in advertising is sufficient for service marks. Our law firm and business unit decide whether and where to register the trademark. The name and applicable information is recorded in our law firm's database. Registration: United States In most instances, our law firm files an application for a trademark registration in the United States. There are two types of trademark applications for registration: use based and intent-to-use. Used-based: If a trademark already has been in use or will be in use shortly, the firm will file a use-based application. Intent-to-use: If a trademark will be used later, the firm will file an application for an intent-to-use application. Upon use, rights will go back to the date of filing. To obtain a registration, the business unit will need to supply the following: Invoices of first sale shipments to a customer in another state or country. If an intrastate sale precedes an interestate or international sale, a copy of that invoice should be included as well. Six labels or photographs of the mark Product literature The United States trademark examiner will review the application and conduct a search for conflicting trademarks. If the trademark examiner has questions, he or she will ask the firm to provide the answers. At that point, the firm may need to contact the business unit for information. If the trademark examiner accepts the application, the name will be published for opposition by the public (the public has amonth to oppose the use of the name). however, if the trademark examiner believes that the name is "descriptive" or infringes on another's name, he or she may reject the application. If the name clears the opposition period or clears any resulting opposition(s), the registration is allowed and our law firm enters the appropriate information into the databses. If we are unsuccessful at obtaining a registration, we may have to select a new name. Maintenance: United States The registration is valid for ten years if the trademark remains in continuous use for the first five years. Between the fifth and sixth year, our law firm contacts the business unit for sales information and for specimens of the trademark as it used on or in connection with the product. If the trademark has been used for five consecutive years and the unit plans to continue use of the trademark, our law firm files the affidavit with the United States Patent and Trademark Office stating that the name has been used in commerce for five consecutive years. If the affidavit is accepted, the trademark becomes "incontestable." That means it becomes easier to enforce and harder to attack on legal grounds. A registration may be renewed indefinitely for ten-year period. During the tenth year, the trademark registration must be renewed if the business unit wants to maintain statutory rights. As with the affidavit, our firm asks the business unit whether it has been using the trademark as registered, adn whether it plans to continue using the trademark. If so, the firm asks the business unit to provide specimens of the trademark as it is used in commerce on or in connection with the product. Registration: International The need for international registrations is the decision of the business unit. In general, applications are filed in countries with scheduled sales activities. Registration requirements differ from country to country. Some countries, such as the United States, base trademark rights on use. Other countries base trademark rights on registration; the first party to file a registration obtains rights to a trademark. Basic registration steps as as follows: The business unit notifies our law firm of the countries in which it wants to register the trademark. The firm contacts its associates in the selected countries to request filings of trademark applications. The associates request necessary information/documents from the firm and apply for trademark registration in their respective countries. If necessary, the business unit is asked to supply addditional information and materials. The trademark offices in the respective countries examine the application' and search for conflicting names. They also examine the name for descriptiveness. If there are conflicts, our application is refused, and depending on the countries' law, we or the trademark office may strike an agreement with the owner of the conflicting mark. In many countries, as in the United States, the name is published for public opposition. If the name is opposed, we may strike an agreement with the opposing party. If we cannot come to an agreement, we may have to select another trademark. If the application is found in order and conflicts, if any, are settled, registration is allowed. Maintenance: International Maintenance requirements differ from country to country. Basically, each registration is good for a period of years -- 5, 7, 10, 14, or 15 years. Before a term has lapsed, we are required to renew the registration for a like term if we wish to renew rights. In some countries, such as Spain, we also are required to pay a tax every few years to maintain the registration. Each fiscal year the business unit will be sent a list of registrations due for renewal. The business unit decides whether to renew the regisrations and returns its decisions to our trademark law firm. If authorized by the business unit, approximately six months before a renewal is due, the firm will notify its associate to file a renewal application in the country of its renewal. Legal notifies the business unit if sales information, invoices, brochures, or additional information are required for filing the renewal application or for meeting the request of the trademark examiner who reviews the renewal application. The associate notifies our trademark law firm when a renewal has been granted, and the renewal and the date of the next renewal is recorded in the firm's trademark database.

Frustrated at having to manually dilute and re-analyze overrange samples? Let SIPS (patent pending) eliminate the need for these time-consuming, yet necessary chores. Varian's patented automatic Sample Introduction Pump System (SIPS), increases productivity, ensures accuracy, and reduces consumables costs. Russ Calow, Manager of Analytical Services, and Robert Irwin, Senior Chemist--Atomic Absorption Laboratory at Lakefield Research Analytical Services in Ontario, Canada recently discovered SIPS' benefits. Using the SIPS-10, the lab team increased throughput by 20% with precisions two to three percentage points better than manually prepared solutions. SIPS is an ideal tool for the Lakefield lab for a number of reasons. The foremost reason is that SIPS reduces costs. The lab, which analyzes metal, organic, and inorganic materials for mining, waste, and land reclamation, initially purchased SIPS for its on-line calibration and dilution capabilites. The auotmation of these tasks, previously completed manually, has also increased their productivity. Beforepurchasing SIPS, the lab team had been manually producing less than sixdeterminations per hour worked; with the addition of SIPS, determinations were close to seven per hour worked. With SIPS' "walk away ability," lab operators are now able to prepare samples, handle data, and run two or three instruments simultaneously. The lab runs the instrument two shifts a day, five days a week, with additional shifts on the weekend. Increases Accuracy In addition to increasing productivity, SIPS is proving to be extremely accurate. Calow reports that "during the instrument commissioning phase, the automatic calibration and on-line dilution capabilities of the SIPS system were carefully checked." Calow's team prepared a study, and as Table 1 indicates, no significant difference exists between the SIPS prepared standards and the manually prepared standards for the listed elements. Calow asserts that, "the SIPS preparedstandards display relative standard deviations on the order of two to three percentagepoints better than manually prepared standards." One caveat, however. Process solutions, which are too viscous to analyze directly without pre-dilution, can compromise the accuracy of SIPS. Calow points out that besides increasing productivity and accuracy, SIPS also has a low consumables cost. The Lakefield lab uses one peristaltic pump tube per month. Other flow-through instruments can have weekly or bi-weekly tube changes. Another bonus for SIPS users is the instrument's user-friendliness: the Lakefield team was able to get the instrument into full production in only one week, including the time needed for checking the on-line calibration and dilution capabilities of the system. SIPS has dramatically changed lab sample preparation techniques by insuring accuracy, increasing productivity, and decreasing costs significantly. In the process, SIPS has revitalized flame AA technology. Varian's auto-diluter for the SPS-5 Sample Preparation System is now compatible with the UltraMass ICP-MS! The SPS-5 saves lab time and money by providing accurate and automatic on-line dilution of overrange analytes during ICP-MS analysis. The SPS-5 auto-diluter, which is a precision syringe under PC control, frees lab operators to perform other tasks while the UltraMass continues the analysis. In addition to its on-line capabilities, the auto-diluter also aids in off-line sample preparation, and it prevents cross-contamination and dilution errors. Accurate Results Traditionally, manual dilution has been the preferred option for samples that contain a higher concentration of elements--such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and some abundant transition elements such as iron--that exceed the range of ICP-MS. Without the SPS-5 auto-diluter, lab technicians have had to perform tedious, off-line dilutions manually to ensure accurate sample analysis. Other ICP-MS techniques have attempted to address the problem of overrange analytes: some instruments employ dual range detectors with pulse counting detection for trace level analytes and analog detection for high range analytes. However, unless the sample is diluted, the overrange analyte ions will still be present in the ion beam which can lead to space-charge effects and can introduce mass bias interferences in the results. With the SPS-5 auto-diluter, quick and efficient sample dilution is easy and fast. Mounted as a module at the rear of the auto-sampler, the diluter automatically dilutes and remeasures overrange analytical isotopes. The dilution factor is determined by the software which takes into account the size of the signal relative to the calibration range. In the event of the sample still coming in overrange, the software will instruct the auto-diluter to perform another dilution. Increases Productivity Because the diluter is automatically controlled via software, lab operators are free to perform other functions, saving both time and money. The SPS-5, which is capable of automatically checking the accuracy of dilution at the start and finish of a sequence run, also ensures compliance with Good Laboratory Practice requirements in monitoring the accuracy of the dilution system. And, in addition to its on-line capabilities, the SPS-5 auto-diluter can be used off-line for most sample preparation tasks--dilution, spiking, standard additions, reagent additions and standard preparation--for optimum lab efficiency. Eliminates Contamination Each solution aliquot taken by the auto-dilutor is separated by a volume of air while a sample holding coil ensures that the sample never enters the syringe. This unique design eliminates cross-contamination. The diluter is also provided with an overflow rinse well which cleans the probe inside and out. To improve lab accuracy and increase dilutions per hour easily and efficiently, contact your Varian sales representative today about how you can turn your ICP-MS into a productivity workhorse with the SPS-5 auto-diluter.

Hawaiian Islands Atmospheric data processed from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. TeraScan: A World of Applications Pollution control. Sufficient food production. Environmentally sustainable growth and development. These are issues that transcend all political and economic boundaries to impact the entire world. Data collected by satellites has become a vital tool for studying and monitoring the earth's oceans, land masses, and atmosphere. Such global monitoring is essential to many efforts aimed at addressing these global issues as they become more and more pressing. Antarctic Polar Ice Pack Image collected from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. The number of satellites circling our globe continues to increase as new satellites are launched carrying ever more sophisticated instruments. Most satellites carry sensors that measure visible, thermal infrared, or microwave radiation; others carry radar sensors. The resolution of these instruments ranges from tens of kilometers to meters. Much of this remotely sensed data can be acquired directly as it is transmitted from the satellites. And TeraScan systems can to do just that, affording users the power and flexibility they need to take advantage of the full range of data available from these satellite sensors. Oceanographic applications of TeraScan systems include survey and research missions, search and rescue, ice cover analysis, biological studies, and measurement of sea surface temperatures and surface current patterns. As an example, satellite-derived information concerning ice cover greatly improves polar navigation, enabling icebreakers to find the best pathway through pack ice. Montage of the World Collected from the Geostationary Weather Satellites(GMS, GOES, Meteosat). Terrestrial applications of TeraScan systems include mapping of vegetation, snow cover, pollution, forest fires, flooding, and volcanic activity. For example, Forest Service firefighters now receive real-time information that aids them in locating "hot spots" in their area of surveillance, dramatically improving their fire-fighting capability. Researchers use TeraScan to track rainfall and the seasonal changes in vegetation. Water and airborne pollutants often have remotely detectable signatures. Even plumes of volcanic ash, explosively thrust into the stratosphere and capable of downing jet aircraft, can be tracked as they drift with the prevailing winds. TeraScan Software: It's All About Capability It takes a robust and sophisticated software package to convert the many different types of satellite data into meaningful information. The UNIX-based TeraScan software provides the full capability needed to control satellite tracking, data reception, and all hardware interfaces. What primarily distinguishes TeraScan, however, is its powerful processing and analysis tools, which provide many unique advantages. GOES-8Visible Data Image over the Continental United States utilizing sectorized processing. TeraScan software incorporates hundreds of functions for capturing, archiving, processing, mapping, modeling, animating, annotating, and exporting remotely sensed data. Data from geostationary, polar-orbiting, and specialized satellites, acquired in real time or from stored media, can be readily manipulated in many ways. Data-fusion capabilities enable users to combine different types of data, including data from non-satellite sources, to reveal patterns and relationships. Multiple map projection options are offered for precisely earth-locating images and overlaying geopolitical boundaries. Through a user-friendly graphical interface developed by SeaSpace, TeraScan software enables both sophisticated and inexperienced operators to access functions quickly and easily. An advanced scripting language is available to allow full automation of all routine and repetitive sequences, beginning with antenna tracking and acquisition, through all steps of data processing, data archival, and data product distribution. With its open architecture and network-accessible design, TeraScan software can support one user or many users in a wide variety of settings.

The PWS fulfills SeaSpace's vision of delivering high-resolution digital data to both the professional maritime market and the pleasure yachting community. At-sea use of high-resolution satellite digital data has previously been limited to researchers and government users. The PWS joins SeaSpace's extensive product line of real-time weather satellite stations. Primary markets for the PWS include the international super yacht and commercial fishing industries. For the first time, users aboard these vessels can receive and make use of high-resolution weather information. The digital data received directly from weather satellites is identical to that used by professional weather forecasters all over the world. According to SeaSpace's chief technical officer, Dr. Robert L. Bernstein, SeaSpace can now deliver professional-quality weather and ocean information to the non-professional, in a simple, easy-to-use turnkey system. The SeaSpace Personal Weather System delivers real-time weather information directly to the yacht or vessel -- anytime, anywhere. The PWS is derived from SeaSpaces proven maritime TeraScan ® systems installed on an array of ice breakers and research vessels worldwide. The PWS is a self-contained weather data acquisition, processing and display system that includes a 0.46 meter tracking antenna, a digital data receiver and a powerful desktop computer. The PWS acquires high-resolution (HRPT) data from the NOAA TIROS polar orbiting weather satellites and WEFAX transmissions directly from geostationary satellites. All data is automatically received and processed, creating weather and ocean imaging products in real time. The images provide information by which to make immediate operational decisions and plan the vessels future movements. Included with the PWS is SeaSpace's leading software package, TeraScan ®, a comprehensive package that provides quick access to all images and system products. The PWS implementation of TeraScan ® includes an easy-to-use graphical user interface requiring only simple point-and-click operation of the computer mouse. All images can be manipulated, including zooming an image to better see details, navigating for accurate information at every latitude and longitude point, and animating images taken at different times to observe changes in current weather patterns. The PWS will begin shipping in the first quarter 1996.

The body of water was causing international interest because of its rich natural resources and unusual currents caused by being a large body of water that mingled little with other oceans because it was nearly surrounded by land, said project organiser Dr. Fang Ming. The sea-viewing, wide field of view satellite will beam data through a dish on the Sai Kung university's roof to produce the pictures on a university computer [using TeraScan]. The HKUST station is one of 12 worldwide allowed to use the pictures free. NASA says it will launch the satellite in May. However, Dr. Fang said the launch had been put off several times. "It's a US$100 million [HK$773 million] project, which is small in NASA's eyes so not top priority." he said. And the method by which they would launch the satellite - firing it with a rocket from a flying 747 - had failed in September, so remedial work was being done before another one could be sent up, he said. The low-orbit, pole-to-pole satellite will send back colour images showing how much algae and plankton are living in the top layer of the ocean. The concentration of these organisms directly corresponds to the amount of pollution, on which they feed. The university is now receiving data from four National Oceanic Atmospheric Association weather satellites that show the wate temperature and wind direction. Warmer water would also encourage algal growth so the two would be correlated, said Dr. Fang. And last week the university recorded its first shot of the sediment - mostly sand - pouring out of the Pearl River into the ocean. "We don't want [the launch] to be delayed too much because it will put us off our schedule but for the moment we have a lot to do," said Dr. Fang.

Oneday after initial contact, USFS personnel arrived in San Diego for training and acceptance of the system. The USFS satisfies its real-time data requirements via digital data from one of SeaSpace's own in-house acquisition systems. Thesatellite data is provided to the USFS TeraScan system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by telephone modem. The SeaSpace support staff wrote customizedscripts to extract sections of AVHRR data needed by the USFS to monitor areas that are burning, plusregions previosly burnt and blackened. These data are then further processed, compiled with other sources of weather data, and analyzed by remote sensing specialists at the Ogden center.

This system is designed to acquire, process, display, and archive data transmitted from HRPT telemetry, in real time, from the U.S. NOAA polar orbiting satellites. Burt Baker, of SeaSpace's Customer Support Staff, traveled with the Kaiyo on leg two of the cruise from Koror, Palau to Yokosuka, Japan, as a TeraScan operator/analyst. Mr. Baker's primary responsibility was to ensure correct operation of the system and to produce SST imagery on a daily basis. In addition to providing SST daily imagery, the TeraScan system also supplied images of a large stationary tropical depression about 500 km to the west of the Kaiyo. The vessel has a GMS/WEFAX receiving system installed on the bridge, but the TeraScan system provided higher resolution images. The Cruise director and Chief Scientist for this leg of R/V Kaiyo's cruise was Mr. Ichio Asanuma. The following is a glimpse of Burt Baker's travel journal. The Kaiyo departed from Palau on May 11, 1994 and promptly found heavy seas and a stationary tropical depression (which soon became typhoon #4). For several days I provided images of #4 for the bridge. On May 15th we entered the East China Sea area, where most of the detailed oceanographic survey work took place. Genrally,The ship would stop and maintain position using bow/stern thrusters while Lidar equipment was deployed to measure phytoplankton concentrations at various depth.s Watersamples, both surface and at depth, were also collected.

Dech of the German Aerospace Research Establishment Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany The German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) at Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich is about to offer an operational on-line satellite data catalog and request system, the Intelligent Satellite Data Information System (ISIS). Through ISIS, the shortcoming of the traditional archives shall be overcome by means of implementing state-of-the-art database techniques and by integrating the system into international networks. The major objective of ISIS is to suply a broad user community with all information required to identify suitable data for a given application, and to access the respective archives for data acquisition. Emphasis is put on the user-friendly design of the catalogue interface, the online visualization of data, and the improvement of proceduresfor the generation of value-added standard products. The amount and type of data being offered will be determined both by user requirements and official data policy. Ina first approach, users will be provided on-line with digital quicklooks of all DFD acquired raw and value-added products. For the operational extraction and selection of certain environmental relevant featurs the Feature Data Bank Project (FDB) has been established. Themain purpose of operational information extraction is, besides raw data archiving, the generation of value-added state-of-the-art standard products which are calculated on a regular basic, e.g., thesea surface temperatures (SST), the normalized vegetation index, rectified data subsets and selected features. Special emphasis on the selection of environmental features is given to cretain events like the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the fires in California, the flooding events in the USA andBangladesh, the shrinking of Lakes Aral and Chad, and many more. Raw data and products from events like these are collected and produced at the FDB andwill be accessible via ISIS on request. The third part of the FDB will be the animation of high level products and selected features. Some are already done, like the animation of SST images from the Mediterranean Sea and the shrinking of the Aral Sea. Some furhter animationsare in work, like the animation of a time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index both on a global and ona regional scale (Europe). Others,like cloud animations based on geostationary systems, were begun recently. For all these tasks, TeraScan software is used. As an example, an overview about the production of the daily SST maps based on AVHRR data is given below. Besides the operation of the German Antarctic Receiving Station and a transportable x-band station, both for ERS SAR data acquisition, DLR isoperating in addition, a Meteosat PDUS and a NOAA HRPT receiving station at its center at Oberpfaffenhofen. The nominal HRPT data acquisition schedule covers the reception of at least five NOAA passes per day. Based on these scenes, a daily maximum temperature composite is calculated, covering the entire ocean ares of DLR's visibility circle in threedifferent maps (Mediterranean Sea, West of Portugal, and the North Atlantic Ocean). Based on the daily maximum composites, both weekly and monthlymaps are generated. However, these products are not restricted to the composite method used at the moment. Minimum, maximumand averages from all products (daily, weekly, monthly composites) can be calculated any time depending on user requests. TheseSST products are available from March 1993 to date. They are considered to be useful for many scientific purposes like climatology (e.g., as an important factor for climate modeling), oceanography, marine biological activity (e.g., algaegrowing), atmospheric science and many other fields. Averaged Maximum SST over Mediterranean The derivation of high-end products within the FDB project, like the SSTs from NOAA AVHRR data, are aplanned for further products as well as from different sensors like, Meteosat, TM, SAR, and in the future, SeaWiFS. Users who wish to get value-added products from the Feature Data Bank can access it by using the interface of the ISIS at the DLR. For further information about ISIS and data access,please contact Dr. Lotz-Iwen at lotz@dfd.dlr.de. For further information on the FDB project, please contact Dr. Dech or Ms. Holz at dech@dfd.dlr.de or holz@dfd.dlr.de.

The purpose of the demonstration was to show to tactical commmanders the "value added" of real-time, high resolution weather satellite imageryand vertical sounder data. Despite the fact that the effectiveness of modern weapon systems is highly dependent on environmental conditions, the importance of weather information to Army commanders is often underated. Weather information is needed to support ground and air maneuvers as well as direct and indirect (including deep) fires. The HRWSR is a commercially available system that acquires, processes, displays, and archives weather satellite imagery and vertical sounder data from polar orbiting satellites. The acquisitionsubsystem is a 1.0 meter diameter reflecting antenna, mounted on a gyro-stabilizing platform. The processing subsystem is a computer worksation with programs to automatically positionthe antenna to acquire each satellite pass to turn the sensor data into earth-located imagery and data fields, and to permitan operator to prepare weather information for Army users. The color monitor allows high resolution display of cloud imagery and data fields annotatedwith geopolitical boundaries and latitude/longitude lines. The softwarealso gives the operator the capability to zoom, to animate imagery, and to enhance with color. The HRWSR deployed on the back of a 2 1/2 ton truct to the III corps staff Weather Officer's work tent in the Corps Tactical Operations Center (CTOC) on November 2. Two USARSPACE operators, Mr. Jeff Faunce and Mr. Arthur Kyle, went with the system. For the next week, the HRWSR and its two operators remained at the CTOC field site, acquiring data from polar orbiting weather satellites that came within line-of-sightof the antenna. Imagery and data from an average of ten satellite passes per day were processed. The advantage that space-based assets bring to the battlefield - the capability to view the entire area of operators - was continually emphasized to the III corps weather staff and their customers. The primary productof interest was visual and infrared imagery from the DMSP and TIROS weather satellites. Visual wavelengths were used to view the earth during daylight andinfrared wavelengths were used during darkness. Imagery was registered to mercator map projections for the CONUS, the area of Texus and surrounding states, and the Central Texas area (about 100 milesradius of Fort Hood). This allowed the weather staff to view weather conditions on the synoptic scale, the mesoscale, and the microscale, respectively. Thus the weather staff monitored clouds produced by weather systemsaffecting Fort Hood at the time fo satellite passage and clouds from weather systems that would impact Fort hood 2-3 days in the future. In addition, vertical sounder data were used extensively to overlay upper level winds,temperature, analyses, and height contours on imagery. The weather staff then used all of this information to prepare products capable ofsupporting III Corps organizations such as aviation, intelligence, artillery, engineer, and chemical. The first operational demonstration of the High Resolution Weather Satellite Receiver was judged a success. The system performed flawlessly at both of the field sites. The weather team used the imagery and data to prepare weather products for Army decision makers, and useful feedback was collected.

The status of anyof these satellites could change at any time. Question: What is the cause of overhead dropouts in polar orbiter data? Answer:Overhead dropouts are usually indicative of system (cpu) time inaccuracies. Your system must keep accurate (+/- 5 seconds) time in order to properly track polar orbiting satellites. If the system time is off by more than 5 seconds, the antenna wil not point accurately at the satellite,particularly for high zenith passes.Bad or Old (more than two weeks) orbital elements may also cause overheaddropouts. You should update the orbital elements if they are more than twoweeks old (see Question #1 above). Lastly, your antenna may have a pointing (azimuth)error, which can be corrected by (1) sunalignment (2) manual alignment or(3) autoalignment. If none of the aforementioned cures the overheaddata losses, then contact customer support.

Question:When I run 'avcal', it returns the message: avcal.coef: Cannot access AVHRR calibration table avcal.coef: Using pre-launch coef's for visible channels' What does this mean? Answer:This is not an error, 'avcal' has an optional parameter that lets you reset the channel 1 & 2 slope and offset, and save to a file.If the file doesn't exist, avcal uses pre-launch coeffecients like it alwayshas. You could also pass your own coeffecients to avcal from the command linelike so: %avcal vis_coefs='0.11968 -3.73000 0.13715 -3.39000' Question: How do I filter values from data? Answer:Use 'emath', for example, if you'd like to remove all channel 4 IR temperatures below 10 degreesCelsius from a AVHRR data set, use 'emath' like so: %emath input_avhrr_data output_avhrr_data expr_vars = avhrr_ch4 expression = (x1 < 10) ? badval:x1 . . .

VISA, McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch, Sara Lee,Bausch and Lomb, and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance decided notto sponsor the Paralympics. That was regretable. But thesecorporations -- which were sponsors of the Olympics -- went toofar. These Sinful Six companies refused to release theircategories, thus prohibiting the Paralympics from soliciting theircompetitors. That meant that companies like American Express,Burger King, or Miller's could not be approached for sponsorship. The Sinful Six obviously believed that we don't have money to spendor available credit, so we don't matter to them. After all it was only the Paralympics. As Olympic sponsors these corporations had the right to retaintheir category and withhold their sponsorship of the Paralympics. Well, the disability community has the right to withhold spending money with these companies. That is exactly what Alana Shepherd of Shepherd Center, a founding sponsor of the Paralympics, is asking the disability community and our friends to do. We are calling for a boycott of the Sinful Six. "You're no BUD of mine!" "A BIG MAC is not on my diet!" "Who isSara Lee, anyway?" I'm sure that many of you can come up with creative slogans, and I urge you to forward them our way. If you are online send them to publisher@mainstream-mag.com or you can send them to our street address. Let these companies know what you think of their shameful treatmentof the Paralympics.

He talked of the need for research. He wants acure for spinal cord injury. The speech was described as moving. If you saw it,what did you think? Was it a good disability rights speech? Was it a pity-wringer?Fix the disabled people and get them out of their wheelchairs? Is ChristopherReeve a spokesman for you? To start with, read these insightful remarks from an historian who specializesin disability issues and images. And some response to him. Then add your opinions. Bad news in Chicago By Paul K. Longmore Due to the strenuous and commendable labors of disabled activistswithin the Democratic party and the Clinton administration,Christopher Reeve incorporated some important lines about the ADAand disability rights into his Monday evening Democratic Conventionaddress. We should not underestimate this achievement, coming as itdid at the last minute and against considerable counterpressures.We all should thank our colleagues working quietly but firmly toget those civil-rights claims into Reeve's speech. Mr. Reeve clearly found the words he was compelled to utterdistasteful to him, delivering them grim-faced and grudgingly. Heonly warmed up and became animated in his speech when he got to thesubject of cure. He will continue to be a problem fordisability-rights activists. His public role will likely becomemore obstructionist regarding the civil-rights of people withdisabilities. We must fashion strategies of response to hismessage, but this will not be easy. He is already a cultural icon, respected, beloved. He literallyembodies even as he espouses a series of American myths: thevictory of the human spirit over the worst of fates; the can-dotriumphalism of American medicine, science and technology that cansolve any problem; the preference for "non-political" technicalfixes to solve complex social problems; the avoidance of socialrealities, specifically the redefinition of conditions of socialinjustice as problems of individual tragedy and coping; the refusalto see "disability" as an issue of institutionalized prejudice anddiscrimination; the flight into cure as a way to evade confrontingsocietal and personal prejudice. The Reeve phenomenon should be located within the broader backlashagainst disability rights. It provides an avenue of escape thatallows U.S. society and the government to pretend they are doingsomething for disabled people, in fact, giving us what we reallyneed, cure. But responding to Reeve is not the most pressing issue at thismoment. A larger message appeared at last night's convention. Andfrankly, the program was more dismaying than I had anticipated. JimBrady's walking served the purpose of underlining theindividualizing of disability as medical affliction and heroic butpathetic personal striving. His and his wife's appearance wasdeliberately dovetailed with Reeve's. The combined message wasabout personal tragedy, pain and suffering linked to an image of agovernment and a president who feel their pain. The specific disability message was that disability is, in SarahBrady's word, "devastating" to families. The solutions to theproblems of disabled people were presented as prevention and cure. The annoyed tight-lipped Reeve said the few lines forced on himabout civil rights, but the dominant message was medical -- medicalsolutions for medical problems. These performances surely played well with most viewers, but interms of the disability constituency they were a serious politicalmistake. The Democratic party and the Clinton campaign must offerother messages that address the real concerns of disabled voters. It is important that other disabled people have been scheduled tospeak at the convention, particularly our highly respected leaderJustin Dart. But as much as we all hold him in deep regard, Justinis our hero and not well-known by the public. He cannot matchReeve's star power. Michaela Alioto will second Vice PresidentGore's nomination on Wednesday night. She too is unknown. Thus,their presence will be largely symbolic. Fred Fay made some important points the other day in this on-goingdiscussion when he talked about the political significance of thenumber of disabled persons appointed to positions in the Clintonadministration and the Clinton re-election campaign. We can addJustin Dart and Michaela Alioto to that list. The presence of allthese activists is unprecedented and it is important. But I have to differ with Fred on one point. I cannot agree thatthe presence of these, our colleagues, is more important than thepolicy positions of the administration. That leads me toward mymain point: disability issues in the current campaign. Fred also sent many of us his valuable memo on the disability vote.One central lesson we -- and the Clinton strategists -- shouldglean from the voting record of the disability constituency is thefirst lesson of Political Science 1: in U.S. politics,constituencies vote their interests. They vote for politicians whoprotect and advance those interests, and they punish thosepoliticians when they flout them. In 1982, the avalanche of letters protesting the Reaganadministration's attempt to undercut PL94-142 (now called I.D.E.A.)taught George Bush an important political lesson: the enormousdisability constituency would mobilize to defend its interests. In1988, Mr. Bush remembered that lesson. His pledge to seek passageof the ADA accounted, according to the Harris poll's electionpost-mortem, for half of his margin of victory. Mr. Dukakis ignoredthe disability vote and paid the price. A Harris-pollvice-president referred to the disability vote as a "sleepinggiant." The Clinton campaign would do well to keep this political historyin mind. It should also note an especially significant feature ofthe pattern of the disability vote. The constituency does not votefor cure or prevention. Nor does it vote for symbolism or speakersor appointees. It votes for laws, policies and programs. Thespeakers and the appointees are only important to the constituencyinsofar as they are able to espouse and advance the constituency'sagenda, and insofar as the presence of those speakers andappointees evidences the commitment of elected politicians tosupporting that agenda. Each day this week, President Clinton is announcing policyinitiatives that address the concerns of various constituencies. Onone day, he should offer a similar announcement targeted to thedisability constituency. Undoubtably in his acceptance speech, hewill pledge to uphold the ADA. He should make that promise ofcourse, but, given the DOJ's rather lackluster record ofenforcement, many activists will perceive his words as no more thanelection-year rhetoric. So, he must do more. Mr. Clinton should declare that in his second term he will solvethe following two major problems: 1. His administration willpresent legislation to establish a national Personal AssistanceServices program, along the lines ADAPT has been demanding foryears. 2. His administration will present legislation to eliminatethe work and marriage penalties in SSI and SSDI, adopting therecommendations of the independent, nonpartisan scholarly NationalAcademy of Social Insurance. In the meantime and until the latter legislation becomes law, thePresident will direct HHS Secretary Shalala to use her currentadministrative authority to issue waivers in every state to endthese "disincentives." The Secretary will undoubtably oppose this,as she has opposed and obstructed this reform for three-and-a-halfyears, but disabled voters want it. Some activists make the compelling argument that Mr. Clinton isbetter than Mr. Dole. The events of the past week (the signing ofthe welfare reform bill that will hurt hundreds of thousands ofdisabled children and enormous numbers of disabled elderlyimmigrants, and the huge political mistake of last night'sconvention message) have unfortunately blurred and narrowed thedistinction between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole. Mr. Clinton must give disabled voters powerful, issue-centered,policy-based reasons to vote for him, reasons for disability-rightsactivists to endorse him and campaign for him. The actions outlinedabove could counter the negative impressions left in the last fewdays. Some activists -- and surely some campaign strategists -- willargue that disabled voters have nowhere else to go. In fact, somedissatisfied disabled activists are talking about voting for RalphNader, who has a powerful disability-rights record. This couldprove a potent protest vote in crucial states like California. Other disability-rights activists are weighing short-term risksagainst long-term possible gains. It seems likely that the U.S.political system has entered on one of its periodic realignments.During the next two election cycles, the political landscape islikely to undergo a major reconfiguration. Some activists contendit might be more effective in the long run to organize and positionthe disability constituency to emerge as a major bloc in arestructured party system. I am not advocating any of these strategies. I simply believe theymust be taken into account by all of us, and especially by currentClinton campaigners. And I note that some disabled activists aretaking a leaf from Mr. Clinton's manual of political pragmatism.When he regards a policy position as likely to advance his chancesfor re-election, they point out, he chooses that course. They aresaying that they can and should be just as pragmatic. I would welcome responses and disagreements. I hope we can continueour collective conversation. Please invite anyone you think wouldbe interested to join in. Perhaps we should ultimately expand the discussion to engage otherissues, for instance, why are the two men who can at the momentmost easily attract media attention Christopher Reeve and JackKevorkian? Could it be that currently the media is framingdisability issues as cure 'em or kill 'em? Paul K. Longmore teaches history at San Francisco StateUniversity. What's your take on this?

Film at 11 SAN DIEGO - It's funny. Just the other day, on one of the listservs I subscribe to, we were talking about the sci-fi novel Footfall - which, if you haven't read it, is about an invasion of Earth by a race of intelligent miniature elephants who'd actually be kind of cute and comical if they weren't trying to enslave humanity. And here I am now, at the 1996 Republican National convention, watching as San Diego is invaded by a race of intelligent miniature elephants who'd actually be kind of cute and comical if they weren't trying to - Naaah. Cheap shot. I promise, no more elephant jokes for the duration of the convention. Still, there is a certain science-fiction aspect to the whole thing. Political conventions and sci-fo cons are a lot alike - both, for example, are full of people who wear outlandish clothes, have geeky conversations no one else can follow, and spend lots of time thinking about screwing and getting screwed. Literally and figuratively, in the case of political conventions. Even the San Diego Convention Center looks like the ancient remains of a crashed alien spacecraft - either that, or an all-Plexiglas Nazarene church from the early 1980s. In any event, it's an otherworldy spectacle. A few words about San Diego. This city is Republican Heaven. Not the Biblical kind, with puffy white clouds and angels in gossamer robes and jukeboxes with nothing but songs by Pat Boone and Marie Osmond - the Christian Coalition can have that one (although they might have to go north to Escondido and duke it out with Pat Buchanan to get it). No, the Republicans who own this town have more earthly concerns, and they've realized them here, in the Happy Hunting Ground of middle-of-the-road conservatism: the city government is in bed with big business, the local media have been lulled into sun-dried complacency, and the poor and minorities do nothing that interferes with profits - for which, in exchange, they are largely left alone. The cops here have the scary paramilitary strut typical of most SoCal police departments, but they're laid-back about it - they're not racists like in L.A., they just have a lot of rich people to protect. As far as Republicans go, the most prominent one with roots in San Diego is the former mayor, the aggressively bland Pete Wilson. That says it all, pretty much. A few fun facts: Several dozen sign-language interpreters will be working in shifts during the convention, either at several stations throughout the convention hall or roving the floor on call for conferences or caucuses. All of the convention materials - and I mean all of it, we're talking truckloads of paper, here - are being transcribed onto audiotape or computer disk or into braille. The convention hall itself has been fitted with portable elevators at each corner so that wheelchair users can reach the skyboxes or the upper tier of the bleachers.The 1996 election could very well be a critical one for persons with disabilities. The fact that the GOP's Presidential candidate is a gimp has made the party ultra-sensitive on the issue. If a delegate gets his wheelchair stuck in a toilet stall, and then goes complaining to CNN about it, the GOP will be really embarrassed. But don't worry. If I can't take a piss, you'll hear it here first. Go to Monday's report.

Have you ever been somewhere where and had non-disabled people stepin front of you in line and ignore you? Have salespeople in stores lookedthrough you and asked others what they wanted? How about waiters or likepeople asking a non-disabled companion what you want? AND what doyou do about this kind of treatment when it happens? It's MY money Sometimes when shopping, the store clerks give MY change back towhoever is with me. Despite using a wheelchair, I am capable of handlingmy finances. (Many people don't seem to agree with this). First, I only go shopping with my mother or sister who understand this frustration. Usually, they will speak up before I do (which doesn't take long).Many an embarassed clerk has apologetically given ME the change. My fantasy is to announce LOUDLY, "Excuse me, I think that's MY money, where'sthe manager?" Probably a better way to handle this is to discreetly speak to the manager and express my concerns as it isn't just me people dothis to. Melanie Shearmanshearmanms@dmci.net Two-way street It is a two way street. I was at a concert recently, enjoying from outside the grounds, asthe price was right --free. The crowd was diverse, ranging from middleage, middle class rock music lovers to the native inhabitants ofthe area; homeless, mentally ill, and free spirits of the nineties. A friend of mine, a leader in the disabled community I believe,came by and joined me. We were enjoying the music when an obviouslymentally disabled man came by and started a casual conversation with meabout music and how his uncle had taught him how to play a guitar "justlike Carlos Santana" who was playing in the background. I told thefellow how lucky he was and wished I had musical ability. After the man left, my friend, who had sat nervously through the conversation, quietly muttered to me "if you ignore them, theywill leave". My reply was "I know the feeling" name withheld Often ignored I'm hearing-impaired and very often ignoredif--as happens too often--I can't hear the other person. SometimesI've hadto have someone with me to "interpret" what's going on, since mydisabilities (hearing and vision among others) often leave meseveral stepsremoved from normal social interaction. David Moisandmoisan@shore.net Important issue Thank you Mainstream, this is a question of importance. Not onlytopeople "living" with disabilities as individuals but also as anunderutilized group in today's society. It really makes me wonder ifsocietyis so stupid they feel they can afford to look over such avigorous,talented, hard-working segment of the population. Have I ever felt invisible? The short answer is YES, YES and YESagain. I no longer allow myself to feel invisible, as an individual thatis. Iceased to allow that to happen to me one evening when I was outChristmas shopping. I was in my wheelchair looking at a rack ofblouses, wondering if my daughter would like a particular blouse Iwaslooking at. When what to my wondering surprise should happen. Somelady, and I used the term loosly, decided I was in her way andsimplymoved me. As the realization of what happened filtered down mychimney,like a volcanic eruption, up came the smoke of anger. I let thatpersonhave what for and ended by asking her if I had been standing therewouldshe have picked me up body and bones to move me or would she haveexcused herself and asked me to move. I also made sure that herears,and everybody else's within hearing range, understood that movingmychair is the equalivent of pushing someone out of your way whichequalsphysical assault. She walked away mightly embarrassed and I like tothink it will be a long long time before she attempts such actionsagain. Do I now feel invisible? The short answer alas, is once again YES,YESand YES again. Not as an individual, but as a part of the whole. Thismorning I heard a commentary by one of the editors or Mainstreammagazine. Apologies to this person that I did not get her name. It wasmy first introduction to Mainstream and I felt so proud thatfinallythere is a voice to give credence to my complaint that sportsevents forpeople with disabilities are being ignored. At the Barcelona Olympic games the Canadian BroadcastingCorporationshowed two events for athelets with disabilities. Now you canimaginethat watching Jeff Adams win his race set my heart racing. Thisyear Iwatched the Atlanta Olympics and had my dreams dashed as the closeofthe games came, and not even a mention of athelets withdisabilities. Not even a mention of the following Paralympics. How sad I was. Howinvisible I felt. I wonder if Donovan Bailey and Jeff Adams raced each other in anexhibition race or if Shaqille O'Neil participated in a game ofwheelchair basketball, how fast would the media be rushing off withtheir commentators and cameras to cover such an event. Maybe weshouldbe encouraging our favourite big name atheletes to perform in suchevents to promote the "abilities" of our favourite, not so big nameathelets. Dorcas Kelland Don't like it Yes, I was in a restaurant with my mother. The waitress asked mymother, `what does she want'. My mother answered back, `ask heryourself'. I don't like the feeling of being invisible. Lesley Mueller lezablele@northcoast.com Ultimate fantasy I have felt invisible so many times I really thought I was. So Idecided to try my ultimate fantasy -- the girl's locker room. Boywas I mistaken. Can you loan me two grand so I can make bail? Paul Ryan upvote@loop.com Get involved I've been treated exactly like all of the examples in the article thatlinked me here. I am blind, deaf in one ear, use a wheelchair and havediabetes and a transplant. I work full time at an independent living centerand pay taxes. I still get ignored in stores and patted on the head everynow and then or told how brave I am when I'm just sitting in the sun orpissing. I guess the sun can cause cancer and the chlorine in water can bedangerous, but I don't see myself being any braver than the sunbather nextto me or the guy at the next urinal. I believe the only thing that willchange this is for PWD to do a few things: 1. Get out and about as much as possible. Get out so much that we becomepart of the scenery. 2. Make the changes in the man-made environment so that we can get out andwork, play and/or just be bums like everyone that thinks themselves not to be one us. 3. Move into positions of power and decision making. Not just advisory, but real power positions. 4. Organize! Organize! Organize! We have plenty of numbers, but not much power or money. Let's use the numbers we have. We can change the course of local, state and national elections. 5. Don't get in the way of or criticize any PWD fighting for their rights. We already have enough ignorance, malice and enemies to fight. 6. Everytime you have the energy to do so, don't just take it. 7. Join like minded organizations like low income groups and unions. 8. Get involved in the health care fight. It might save our lives. Thanks Paul Peterson summitil@paw.montana.com What's your take on this?

How Good is YOUR HMO? HMO's -- Good health care for people with disabilities? Or, a dangerous jungle of peril? Some folks swear by them. Some swear at them. What do you say? Be careful I have a friend with pretty severe cerebral palsy. He is wheelchairbound andneeds lots of assistance with eating and daily care. Because of hisdisability his verbal communication is slow and deliberate whichtends tomake people think he is less inteligent than he is. He is veryinteligent andedits a local newsletter as well as correponds on the internet withpeoplearound the world. He has been living independently for over 20years with theassistance of his friend who has a less sever case of cerebralpalsy, he ispresently 45. Four weeks ago he developed tingling in his leg and went to theemergency room. A vascular study done with ultrasound determinedthere wereno circulatory problems and he was referred to his primary carephysician. Acouple of days latter the tingling had spread to his otherextremities and hebegan to lose strength in them. His primary care physician refered him to a neurologist and ordereda CT scanof the head and an EEG. The neurologist would not see him untilSeptember (in3 1/2 months). My friend was on Medi-Cal (a California phenomena).His PCPindicated he should be eligibal for Medi-Care because of hisdisability. Thiswould enable him to be seen sooner. He inquired with the SocialSecurityAdministration and was told he was not eligible for Medi-Care. Theneurologists office was contacted and informed about his dailyregression. Hecould not be seen until September unless someone cancelled. After having his tests completed he returned to his PCP. By now hehad losthis ability to bear any weight on his legs or use his computer andwas havingbowel and bladder changes. His PCP ordered a cervical spine x-rayandsuggested going to the emergency room at the local medical centerwhere theneurologists are on call. This was also suggested by theradiologistexamining the x-rays and an orthopaedic surgeon on call at thecommunityhospital where the x-rays were taken. We followed this advice and picked up the CT scan and x-rays andbrought themto the emergency room of the local medical center. My friend wasseen by theER physician who immediatly consulted with the neurologist on call.Theyagreed that he needed to be admitted. That was 1 week ago, today myfriendhad surgery on his neck at the C-3 level to decompress his spinalcord andstabilize it using metal plates. The neurosugeon was veryoptimistic abouthim having function return to his extremities. If he had waiteduntilSeptember, this may not have been so. The moral of the story is, if you have a condition that is goingfrom bad toworse and you are having trouble bucking the system, go to yourlocal medicalcenter where specialists are on call. When you have taken care ofyourproblem try to change the system. I will call the neurologist (theone whowould not see him) on Monday and raise a little hell. Curtis EssenArroyo Grande CA Live with it We read the take on hmo's, but what does one with a disability andonincome that is 1/4 the monthly income before. ANSWER: GET AN HMOTHATWILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND. I'M NOT SAYING LOVE IT, BUT LIVE WITH IT.HANDLE IT. IDID I have never had a problem with my HMO here in AZ.... they alwayshave been very good doctors that I was referred to and veryaccommodating. When I need pain meds I have never been denied them. I suffer fromPost Polio and degenerative rheumatoid arthritis. Since I have a fusedknee and have been overdosed so to speak on may a steriod, I have totake care of myself in a preventive type way and my doctors are and alwayshave been very assistive. I have had the gamit of orthos here in thevalley and they get to know me for what I am, for I never let up on whatI do how I do it and how I will always be an advocate for my disability. In fact initiated a program for disability awareness and will nowdevelop a training unit to make staff sensitive to disabled patrons in allvenues. My body was probably not up to managing another season of footballstadium patrons so we decided training all staff for this would bethe next step. I love my job. I sometimes cannot work all day but Isure am zealous to the point where I do my job the best I can until my bodygives me signs of slow down. I have problems with soft tissue injuriesand healing for me is a long time when even my body has a strain or asprain. I am very happy with my insurance though, my doctors assisting meis why I am able to do what I do in a still upright position. I know achair is in the horizon, but I will try everything until that comes to that. Squeaking wheel Having been a member of a HMO, Maxicare, for over 13 years, I can attest to the fact that the squeaking wheel getsthe oil or "if you want good care you have to know how to play the system. I am a post-polio quad maintaining a full time practice as anEnrolled Agent which means 16 hours per day, 7 days a week for 4 months and 40 hour weeks the rest of the year. When I feel that a medical problem that I have is not gettingproper attention I go to the medical director of the group in I amenrolled and let him know my concerns. In this way I have received referrals to excellent outside specialists and feel that I am getting top-notch care. Jerry Stein Most people are not aware that when they sign the contract with thehealthinsurance company, they are signing that they waive away theirright to suethat company....check your policy! Most people (that I'vequestioned), arenot aware that in most HMOs the M.D. is given a bonus for notprescribinghigh-dollar antibiotics, and are also given a bonus for notdiscussing(telling a patient) about their true condition if it is going toinvolvehigh-dollar treatment. I've asked M.D.s about this, and they admitit'strue. I am a registered nurse, and I can tell you that if you try totreatsome types of infection with a low-cost antibiotic, (erythromycinas anexample) when you really need something like Ceclor...which costsmore, youmay as well drink water for all the good it will do you. There isa numberyou can call to complain about HMOs, but be aware that areoverwhelmed. According to an article I read in one of my journals, they are nottruelycapable of handling the responses they are getting. Also, if youwork forthe U.S. government, they cannot help you, and no one seems to beable totell me who can....I'm still doing research on that one. Thenumber forThe Department of Corporations is1 (800) 400-0815 I feel the way to handle this is to do it yourself. Getmad....makecalls....and complain! Don't let them put you off, get copies ofALL yourrecords...then request copies of every visit thereafter. Let theinsurancecompany know that you are not going to take some mealy-mouthedanswers, andyou are going to let everyone know how you are treated. We hearhorrorstories, and we can't believe it will happen to us...trustme...it's only amatter of time before you are the one telling the stories. Dosomethingnow...write letters...talk to people waiting in line at the bank orstore...spread the news. You are not alone in this, and if enoughof ustake a stand we can do something. Feel free to write me with anyideas,and also with anything that you have found out....let's put it alltogether. Last but definately not least...a personal thank you to thewebmaster ofthis site. Keep up the good work! We need a law A law should be passed where physician must be paid a set fee, and not by how much money they save the HMO. I am with Kaiser and not once, in 13 years, has my primary physician recommended a complete physical. Another problem with the system is when doctors operate their own practice during the week and work part time at an HMO on the weekend. William Lineberger lineberg@ix.netcom.com We need control I have had reasonably good luck with my HMO for basic whitebreadhealth care, i.e., bronchitis, indigestion, etc. When it comes todealing with "scary" stuff, like chronic pain, ongoing physicaltherapy, and diagnosis of sci related symptoms, far too muchdepends on the personal biases and philosophy of the primary carephysician. I am a professional, employed full-time in my field, and do notwish to go on full, or even partial disability leave from mycareer. At the same time, I am a wheelchair user who deals dailywith severe pain and the various the effects of sci and arthritis(and middle age, and bad hair). Because I insist on continuing tobe professionally and socially active outside the home, my doctorsare opposed to prescribing effective pain medication (anythingstronger than ibuprophin). When I request review by a specialist, they tend to select otherdoctors that share their bias against analgesics. (I was told byone, "If you can sit here and discuss the issue with me, you don'tneed it, yet.") I cannot afford to change to a more expensive health care plan thatgive me more control. I have been on this carousel for over twelveyears, and the HMO system makes it difficult to get second opinionsfrom physicians unconnected with the primary care physician. When,due to bias, or lack of knowledge, or state- or lawsuit-inducedfear, our doctors won't go to bat for us, how can we work withinthe HMO system to shop for doctors that will? K.Hetrick Dearborn Heights, MI Not for us HMO's are not for people with disabilities. In fact, they are notfor sick people either. They are in the business of making moneyonly and that means selling insurance to healthy, young peopleonly. God help them if they get sick or disabled, because the HMOwon't!

Did she have to die? IsKevorkian the vangard for society to quietly dispose of peoplewith disabilities who might seem to be a burden? People and theirfamilies who don't understand disability and the opportunities forliving a full invigorating life? Are people choosing death because they don't understand the possibilities of life?

Barry @ timbo e mail Havy issue The ending of one's life is heavy, HEAVY moral issue. I think welive in avery enlightened society where the right to make that decision ispart ofour moral code. Only one person can make that decision aboutthemselves.No one else can, and to do so is murder. Witness the sentencedealt toRobert Latimer. For those of you unfamiliar with circumstancessurroundingthis case, he was the father of the 12 year old he carried to hisvehicleand gassed. He has been portrayed in the media as a loving fatherwhoterminated his daughter's life on compassionate grounds. I havelittledoubt the media portrayal is accurate, but mercy killing is stillmurder andmy heart refuses to bleed for him. I launched into the proceeding discussion only to illustrate mythinking onthe distinct difference between mercy killing and the voluntaryterminationof one's own life. Having reached approximately half of myactuarial lifespan I can emphatically say that I have no plans to avail myself ofthe Dr.Kervokians of the world. But my thinking may change as I age andthedegenerative nervous condition I have worsens. That brings me fullcircleto an earlier statement "where the right to make that decision ispart ofour moral code". Some questions ... The Assisted Suicide issue LOOKS LIKE a pretty clear cut issue ofpersonal freedom, choice, and dignity UNTIL one considers thepoliticaland systemic implications of legalizing euthanasia. Here are some questions to ponder... If we legalize euthenasia, will parents who feel inconvenienced bytheirchild's disability sbe allowed to simply administer a lethalinjectionand state it was for merciful reasons. What legal recourse will wehave? How will we protect the lives of those in nursing homes. Coercivestaffcould use the threat of death to force submission and compliance. Orworse, there would be a quick legal and easy way for health careprofessionals to decide who should take up beds. Disability Rights lobbyists are struggling again a hugeconservativefiscal-oriented government to gain access to adequate medicaltreatment. Their case is based upon the fundamental principal THATPEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE TO THE END THEIRLIVESAND EQUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ALL AVAILABLE MEDICAL TREATMENT. Conservative opponents have argued that there needs to be acost/benefitexpense ceiling and have thus put a price tag on the life of apersonwith a disability. The legitmate RIGHT TO DIE arguments are nowbeingused as BETTER OFF DEAD rationalizations. Many of the respondents seem to be afraid of being forced to liveapainful life. I'm afraid of being GIVEN NO CHOICE BUT TO DIE. The right to die proponents seem to put a huge amount of faith thatthatthe legalized death option would never be misused. I do not sharetheir confidence. In fact, I see scads of evidence to the contraryallaround me: - medical recommendations to abort children with disabilities; - hospitals routinely assigning DNR (Do Not Ressussitate) orders onpatients with a disabilities; - vital organ transplants being denied to people with disabilities,evenwhen a suitable organ is available. Right to die proponents maintain that "safe-guards" be put in placetoguard against misuse. Now let me get this straight... Currently, it is illegal to killaperson with a disability in any way and yet many people withdisabilities are literally fighting for their lives. Right to dieproponents are suggesting that we make it conditionally legal tokillpeople with disabilities and suggest that people with disabilitieswillbe safe and their lives will be protected. Sorry guys.....your logic escapes me. Talk of safeguards doesn'treassure me at all. It comes down to this. If we legalize assisted suicide, then anon-disabled person blowing hishead off with a shotgun remains an irrational and illegal act. Butaperson with a disaability asking for a lethal dose of morphinebecomes arational and legal act. Hmmm... Sounds like devalued status to me. If we legalize euthenasia, then a parent who kills theirnon-disabledchild is charged with murder, but a parent who kills their disabledchild is set free. Hmmm... Sounds like devalued status to me. If we legalize euthenasia, then a doctor is legally bound to useanymeans at his/her disposal to keep a non-disabled person alive, buthasthe right to withold treatment if the person has a disability Hmmm... Sounds like devalued status to me. The Right to die proponents are so fixated on this idea of automouschoice, that they seem to be oblivious (intentionally?) to the factthattheir actions are systematically undermining the safety and statusofpeople with disabilities.Worse than that, they seem not to care.

After all, it is the most personal decision we can make. Abby HansonAbigail@ix.netcom.com Free choice If you had just found out that you would die of a painful disease, would you not want to end you life before you had to go through it? I Sure would and so does a million others. Just because one person dosen't agree with it shouldn't mean that one person should have the right to decide for the rest of us. egrim@lilac.esd101.wednet.edu My decision I think that every person should have the right to determine theirown fate. I cannot speak as to if I would use the doctor's tactics but I know that that decision would be mine and mine alone if I ever found myself in such a state. Death scares most people, and terrifies the rest of us. Why should human beings deal with the "endless" suffering if we allow suffering pets to be "put to sleep"? Dan Martin dan@mail.wincom.net Pet analogy The analogy of putting an animal to sleep is often used and, at first, can seem to be a persuasive argument. However much we may love our pets,though, I think intellectual honesty would lead us to admit that euthanasizing a pet is generally done when the pet's life seems too burdensome for us -- not the pet -- to bear. (And, by the way, the pet has no choice in it.) In fact, last week on CNBC's "Charles Grodin Show," George DeLury used the animal argument when he was making his case for assisted suicide, yet his actions bear out the fact that it was he who had the most difficult time dealing with his wife's disaility. Delury (who "assisted" his wife who had multiple sclerosis to the grave) had made it clear to his wife that she was a burden. Other comments of Delury on the same show indicate that assisted suicide is for the benefit of others -- not the person who would be "assisted." He stated, "People have to think about it in advance and be prepared to act to save their families a great deal of distress..." (For more on Delury who "assisted" his wife's death, see Wall Street Journal "Euthanasia Chic" May 1,1996 and letter to the editor of WSJ from May 17.) rmarker@zeus.weir.net Remember Hitler While it is tempting to tout Kevorkian as a crusader for theindividual's right to determine his/her own lifespan, I find thewhole concept of "assisted suicide" for persons with a "poorquality of life" very reminiscent of Hitler's attempt, in the '30sand '40s, to legitimize the "euthenasia" of those poor, crippled,elderly, or feeble-minded folk that were "useless eaters," i.e., anunwanted drain on the resources of their families and derVaterland. If Kevorkian and his supporters, no matter howhigh-minded, win their crusade, it will not be long before [crips,gimps, handicappers, disabled, the physically, mentally,aesthetically challenged, you, I](pick one or more) become fodderfor a new Auschwitz. The world should not fear the physicallydisabled living in our midst, but we should all look out for themorally and spiritually disabled. K.Hetrick Dearborn Heights, MI I can decide I have always looked at suicide in terms of putting an animal tosleep. I know that that may sound strange or odd....but I havealways found it strange that we care so very much for our pets orsome strange animal that we don't know at all that we would takethe time to make sure that they are not in pain. I had my 18-year-old cat put to sleep (this was many years ago) because she was inkidney failure. If she had been human I would probably beenencouraged to put her through hospitalization/medication/treatmentregiments, etc. She had led a wonderful life, she was very dear tome and she deserved to be out of pain. Why am I, a human being, deserving of any less humane treatment? Why should I suffer, physically, psychically, emotionally - in anyway whatsoever. When I have reached the point where I can no longer"take any more" why shouldn't I have the right to end my life. Because you (the collective you) would feel too guilty. Guilty thatyou didn't do anything to help someone with a mental disability.Guilty that you didn't understand. Guilty that you were too selfabsorbed to notice that there was a problem until I decided to takemy life's control into my own hands. Then, of course, because of mydiagnosis you have to rail at the moon and rally behind the causeand say....oh, she doesn't know what is best for her....we musttake care of her and protect her from herself. Not so, I am capable of making my decisions for myself. You justdon't happen to like most of them......that is your problem! It is too painful for the majority of people in this country tolook at death. It is too difficult to see that there are just someof us who view death as a release from too much pain andsuffering...be we people of physical or mental dis-eases ordis-abilities. Having run on too much....I will stop at that. E&J Vered chaos@indy.com Why force anyone Why would anyone want to force a TERMINALLY ILL person SUFFER whenthey don't want to is beyond me. If a person who is GOING TO DIEwants to do it a little sooner then whoever wants to FORCE them tolive and suffer LONGER is the sick one. I know people are worriedabout the religious implications but that's THEIR soul, not yours. David Breaux First of all, let's be sure we refer to the issue as "the rightto be killed" rather than the "right to die". Wanting control and asking for the most expedient way out are twodifferent things. Larry McAfee was a good example of this. McAfeesued for the right to have the means to shut his respiratoroff, thus giving him the same opportunity as anyone else to endhis life if he chose. He did not want to make it easy or have someone else do it - he simply wanted to ability to do it. I think anyone with links to the disability community would bewell advised to monitor the publications of "right to be killed" organizations. They have automatically defended any self-proclaimed"mercy killing" of a child with a disability. Peter Singer, an author and "bioethicist" is also popular in "right to be killed" publications. One of Singer's more interesting suggestions isto give parents of newborns that have conditions such as Downsyndrome a 30 day period in which they would have the right toorder the medically supervised killing of the infant. So... Is this movement dangeous to people with disabilties? Yes -and it's easy to tell if you start to explore beyond the soundbitesand press releases. Stephen Drake Personal choice I believe it is wrong to kill myself. However it is not up to meor anyone else to decide for the world. I feel it is a personl choice whether or not to take your own life, and if the decision is made to end it, then help by someone who knows what they are doing is good to have. hagewood@micron.net Right to choose "Did she have to die?" That is your question. No. Does she have a right to determine when to die? I think so! Having a degenerative disease is a bit different from just having a disability. To watch ones body slowly deteriorate until you can't even swallow your food anymore is not a life that I don't think anybody would want to endure. And I don't think that you would want to sit back and watch your loved ones suffer a long slow death. Would you? Having watched a friend of mine die from Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), I think that a person has the right to decide when they've had enough. In the last stages of his life, when his speech could barely be understood, he would beg to be killed so that he would not have to endure this life that he was being forced to suffer in. He wanted to die, but this was in 1980 when dying with dignity was not discussed openly. Death was inevitable, but unfortunately so was his prolonged suffering. For six more months after he had thrown in the towel, he suffered. He gasped for breath, and choked on every mouthful of food until they kept him alive by feeding him by tube. The last six months of his life cost him everything that he had saved. So instead of leaving something for his two young daughters to grow up on, he left them in debt. The doctors and the caretakers ended up with his life savings and he paid it all to them to keep him alive in a life that he no longer wanted to be a part of. So your ending question "Are people choosing death because they don't understand the possibilities of life? No, I think they are choosing death because they understand all too well the possibilities of THEIR OWN LIFE! Michael Jablonski Chula Vista, CA Always a loss People should have control over their own destinies/lives.If an individual with a disability or not wishes to extinguishtheir life they should be able to do so. However, it isalways a loss and a shame when a life is lost. BMatt52704@aol.com What's your take on this?

Hot Topic Still going strong: Hot Topic over the Christmas-New Year Holiday season -- of 1995!! Parking -- the great hassle and debate. Everybody has an opinion and a story.Christmastime seems to bring out the grinches in spades. "Handicapped parking"spots are always jammed. Where do all these people come from? Is everybodyTiny Tim at this time of year and need a parking place to accommodate a disability?Bah! Humbug! But what can you do about it? RESPONSES and COMMENTS UPDATED ON DECEMBER 10, 1996 Filled with carts What aggrevates me is going to a shopping center and finding the handicapped parking spot filled to capacity with shopping cartswhen the cart return is just across the lane. How lazy can some people be?!I walk with the aid of crutches and when I use a cart I try toreturn it inside the store or to the designated return spot. If I am able todo it, why can't more able bodied people do the same? Blood boils I'am a 19 year old paraplegic college student who has used awheelchair since a car accident at the age of 3. I currently attend Babson College inWellesley, Massachusetts. This is a small business school with a large populatiion of foreignstudents and an even larger population of wealthy students (Ferrari's, BMW's & Merecedesare the most common cars driven by the students). Now a junior, I was the college'sfirst disabeled student to live on campus. As a result, services for the handicapped werea simply a "big mess". Needless to say, there was rampant abuse by able bodied students ofhandicapped spaces. I am normally a very mild mannered type of person but absolutlelynothing makes my blood boil more than seeing students and pizza delivery guysusing these spaces illegally. I have gotten in many fights with people who have foundme waiting by their cars when they returned, have on one occasion even followed a pizzaguy back to the reataurant who gave me an attitude and blocked illegally parkedcars in. Babson is a comparatively small, yet prestigous college of roughly 1,600 undergraduates and 2,000 graduate students. As aresult of my efforts, I am proud to say that as of September of 1996 Babson has some of themost stringent Handicapped parking enforcement regulations any where in thecountry (although we only have 2 physically disabled students). Some of the new ways I andthe Department of Public Safety will enforce handicapped parking will be through thefollwoing: 1) Campus Police Officers will take extra notice while on patrol of checking all handicapped spaces and ramps for violators. 2) Volunteer Observer will continually and at random check all handicapped parking spaces. This will be his sole responsibility. 3) Illegally parked vehicles will have their license plateselectronically recorded on hand held computers by the Campus Police. First Offense - $100 fineSecond Offense - $150 fineThird Offense - $200 fineEach subsequent offense fine will be increased by $50. Repeat offenders are subject to having parking privileges revoked by theDepartment of Public Safety. 4) Local pizza delivery establishments risk being issued tresspasswarnings which would prohibit them from making deliveries on collegeproperty if their employees continually fail to honor handicapped parkingregualtions. 5) Off campus visitors who illegally park in handicapped spaces will be issued citations from the State of Massachusetts which are officially recorded with state rather than local Campus Police citations. 6) After an attempt is made to trace the vehicle to it's owner, allvehicles illegally parked in a handicapped space will be automatically TOWEDregardless of the number of previous offenses. Hopefully these changes which we have implemented will have apositive impact on the respect people who visit Babson have for Handicapped parking.More importantly I hope that these new campus regulations wiil educate people to theimportance of respecting Handicapped parking every where else they go as well. I would also like to develop volunteer programs in some of thelocal communities which would allow the many concerned citizens who feel as stronglyabout handicapped parking infractions as I do to volunteer their time to assist theirlocal police by writing citations for any offenders they may come across. If youhave any comments or suggestions I would love to hear them. hjnd26b@prodigy.com More Gillette First of all to David Gillette: I cannot believe you have theaudacity to write, "...the majority of disabled and non-disabled people arelazy..."! Not more than two years ago I was an able-bodied person full ofenergy. I now can only walk with a walker (not for a very long time) and havediminished motor skills. I need to park in handicap spaces 1) forthe extra room I need for my walker and 2) because I can't walk great distances. I really hate to think there are such ignorant peoplethat would look at me and think I'm lazy! Walking slow isn't somethingI do by choice, believe me! I live in Phoenix, so getting a covered (handicapped) parking spaceat the mall is a must because of the heat -- and therefore also almost always impossible. I often see people who do not have any assistivedevices who have parking permits, usually senior citizens. This hasbeen very frustrating to me because I need the extra space for mywalker. Just being older doesn't qualify you as being disabled. But I heard someplaces have parking for both the handicapped and senior citizens, whichseems like a fair compromise. I do now realize from reading this page that there are unseen disabilities, but I think everyone must admit that there definetelyis alot of misuse of these spaces. I don't think you have to have amedical exam to get a permit, you just need a doctor to fill out a form. Ithink this is where alot of the misuse happens.I once saw a man park in a handicapped space who had an artificialarm. I am confused as to how this qualifies him to need to park closer(assuming that was all that was wrong). If anyone knows about the laws and what can be done to change orrevise them I would appreciate the info. It's easy to complain about it,but it'd be more effective to do something about it. Also, at one store in Phoenix they have a close parking space forpregnant mothers; and I've also heard consideration of making close parkingspaces for parents who have children who are 2 or under (because of their strollers and various things they have to tote around). I think I'drather see another handicap space instead. Kay G Talk about upset! I recently went to Mesa Community College to run an errand. My understanding of Parking for disabled is such: where there arediagonal lines that is a throughfare. Talk about upset when I was in ahurry and actually had I been a wheelchair person I would have not been happyeither. There was a parking block in the middle of thisthroughfare and I had something in my hand. The diagonal lines were painted blue(again wrong color) I presumed there was nothing in those diagonal lines,wrong again. With a fused knee and something in my other hand I fellhard over this parking block facing the wrong way and even in the area thatwas supposed to be for walking or wheeling free area. I ended up witha cast for four weeks and I was not a happy camper. I did not sue themand I am sure why not yet. Maybe I will come to my senses and do that! As a disabled patron liaison for public events venues here atArizona State University I am versed in disabled services and this just infuriated me. Thanks for listening. I truely believe a contractor did not wantto take out that parking block and painted it into the accessible areainstead. Access blocked My wife is disabled due to MS. This is probably the hardest thingexceptfor maybe the "handicapped" rest room where you practicaly have toleavethe door open to go to the bathroom or have me go in to help her. Mywife has had to sit and wait for me for two hours to help herbecauseshe was to afraid to ask someone to help her move the car so shecouldget in because someone had parked in the access aisle. I usuallyleavenotes on people's cars when they do something like that but it isverytempting to leave a more lasting impression! It is a shame thatignorance is not painful because there would be a lot of hurtingpeoplein the world. Has anyone reported any business to the JusticeDepartmentfor lack of accessibility? ron.infosys@rhcc.com Ditto for me I wish to echo Kathy Lawrence-Phillips' sentiments when she gaveTheodore J.Jelke the blast he so richly deserved. The bottom line Theodore, isif youwant to park in handicapped parking spots GET A STICKER. If youcan't,count your blessings and park elsewhere. Ray Leslierjl@netroute.net Why the heat? On the one hand, I agree that handicapped parking spaces should berespected, and it bothers me when cars without permits use thespaces. On the other hand, I think it is strange that this, of alldisabilityissues, seems to generate the most heat and outrage. This isespeicallytrue of non-disabled people. It is the one issue they seem to beable tolatch on to and get angry about on behalf of people withdisabilities. Handicapped parking is important, but not as important and complexanissue as, say, the availability of personal assistance services andthefunding thereof, or enforcement of other, more demanding ADArequirements. I think that being pro-handicapped parking requires little realunderstanding or commitment from supporters. I would rather seetheirenergy and outrage applied to the REALLY big issues ... the onesthatliterally determine whether or not we can life free and be part ofthecommunity. Andrew D. PulrangPlattsburgh, New York Sticker shock I am from NJ and the sticker (placard) for parking which wasformerly to be placed on the dashboard now is the hang from the mirrortype...it is difficult for me to hang this up...has anyone the same experiencewith this which seems to have become a national standard ?? Dear Editor: As a multi-disabled wheelchair user in Calif with avalid handicap lisence plate,I am appauled at meter maids andseniors.Both of whom fail to look at handicap plates,just the handicap place cards before they cite you and or are calling the police to cite you. Iwas cited (Illegally)three times by the same meter maid in San Jose,in straightening it out the PD required all of the documentation fromDMV I could not believe it as if I committed a crime when I did not.I finally had to threaten lawsuit. As for seniors they appear to bevery inconsiderate of physically disabled persons under the age of 65 ingeneral and this populations special needs, not that they don'thave the needs,thier gorup is taking over citys leaving little servicesfor disabled and not including them in any city services and cities arebuying into it. I served on a city commission and got the disabled participation in a senior nutrition program but when I went toutalize it I was told by seniors to go down to the homeless food program.How about that. Why should I when the program includes disabledpersons.We have a long way to go,discrimination,retaliation,the lack ofdisabled services is well and alive!-----------------I was just wondering if the person who posted the "Original Intent"letter about handicap parking being made for those with mobilitydevicesagrees with that. I hope not. I have a disability that I have touse acane and a Tens for. I live in alot of pain and can only walk shortdistances. I know that there is an abundance of abuse of parkingpermitsbut mine is not. Without it I could not go to the store oranyplaceelse for that matter. I can barely get in and get what I needanyway. Granted, I'm thankful that two years of PT and hard work got me outofthe chair and that i had the opportunity to do so. And I understandthespace needed for a wheelchair lift but I think that I have just asmuchof a right as someone in a wheelchair does to live as independentaspossible. Believe me, If it was possible for me to walk farther Iwouldbe extremely happy to do so!I do feel that people with disabilities should have the right tolegally ticket someone parked in a space without a permit.------------------------------I have always been the type of person that was raised to respectsomeone with a disablity by not parking in their spot. Now I'm disabled. I hadan accident last year and it cracked the sacrum the last bone of the vertebrea before thetailbone. I have been told by my physician I should be in a wheelchair but I know ifI do I'll never get back out so I try to walk as much as I can, but I have only between5 to 10 minutes of standing power, then the legs go numb and I fall. I have neverbeen treated so badly in my whole life as this last year since the accident by bothhandicapped and non-handicapped people. I didn't ask for this handicapped, and ifI could walk I would gladly do so. If I find a parking space close enough with out itbeening handicapped I take it, but please the name calling and sign language isadolescent. Yes I'm overweight but that had nothing to do with the accident Icould walk circles around you back then, as for now I workout 5 times a week so I cando what little walking I do today. I'm not lazy never have been never will sountil you can "WALK" in my shoes for one day, then PLEASE show me how I would love to walkaround the mall for a day for that matter anywhere.Until then don't judge a book by it's cover until you know thecircumstances.Tired of being called names and being treated badly!!-------------------I am not handicapped, but my x-wife was. It bothers me to seepeople who are not handicapped park where they should not. I used to allways stand up for the rights of thehandicapped, but I won't any more. Why? Well it cost me the best job I ever had. I was a contract Systems Support Specialist for the Child supportdivision of the Attorney Generals office of Texas. We shared a building in Downtown Tyler TX, with a Law Firm,an Investment Firm and KLTV Channel 7. Before the TV station moved in, the handicapped spaces were allwaysleft free for those visitors who needed them. But shortly after they moved into the building the parkingspaces were allways full, and the same ones who were there at 8am were still there at 5pm. After a couple ofmonths of seeing this I finally got there when one of the employees of the TV Station pulled into thehandicapped parking space got out of the car, which had no sticker or tag, and walked to the office building. Iasked her why she did this, she cursed me and told me it was none of my business. I confronted another whomoved shortly afterwards. One week I finally got fed up with what was going on, and left notes on the carsstating " if you insist on parking in the handicapped parking spaces or the spaces in between for vanaccessability, I will insist on calling the proper authorities. And if that doesn't work, I am sure some members ofthe El Norte gang, (who's markings you see on the wall) would be more than happy to earn some extra bucks to buysome crack". I made some calls to the police to tell them what was going on. I even went so far as togive the the license plate numbers of those parked there. But the problem still presists. Shortlyafter this I was confronted by a couple of other Channel7 employees, who accused me of Keying thier cars, whothen complained to thier station manager. That manager, on a day that I was out of town, then complained toour office administrator, threatening legal action. That evening when I returned home, I was informed not toreturn to work, and my contract had been terminated. I asked what was said by the station manager, and couldI at least tell my side of the story. The answer was no. I was fired without due process. I never had achance to dispute anything said by the TV station manager. Is there any law that is not as inforcable asanother. Can't something be done? These self rightous people at Channel 7 think they are mightier than the lawand insist on parking where they shouldn'tWell, Now I am out of work, all because I stood up for thehandicapped. Well not any more. If I see someone park in a handicapped parking space, who shouldn't be there, I willjust smile and wave. I just thought you might want ot know about this. Breaking law I have a handicapped parking sticker and find blue spots availablein my regular haunts (my usual grocery store, my work, somerestaurants), but I almost always find one or two cars withoutstickers using the blue spots there or in other parking lots. Actually, once when I had just bought a new car and was waiting formy handicapped sticker, I was parking in a blue spot in a shoppingcentre I don't usually frequent. Imagine my surprise (and delight)when I actually got a parking ticket! Of course, I just had to mailvalid identification to the police station and the ticket waswaived. The thing that bothers me most, is that the people breaking the lawdon't usually get caught, and cause those of us that need thoseparking spaces more time and inconvenience than we deserve. I must confess that I sometimes break the law myself by parking inno parking areas when there are no blue spots available, or noneprovided at all. I have yet to be reprimanded in any way. Darlene Vincent Montreal, Canada Disgusted Reply to David Gillette: I caught your comments and was disgustedwith what you said!!! Your attitude is what makes life miserablefor those of us with "hidden disabilities", such as Fibromyalgia,heart disease, asthma, etc. And please don't feed me your lineabout "if they would walk more often they wouldn't bedisabled"!!!!!! Case in point... my father, an avid Volksmarcher, walked an averageof 10 to 20 miles a day, never smoked or drank, kept his weightunder control and ate a healthy diet. Two years ago he sufferred amajor heart attack, had triple bypass surgery, and currently hascongestive heart failure. He is one of those who chooses not to usea handicapped tag because he is bound and determined to walk. I, and other family members, must listen to his labored breathing,moans of pain, and verbal complaints of chest pain. You must livein podunk city if there are always non-handicapped parking spacesavailable close to the buildings. I know for a fact that here inKansas, especially on holidays and weekends, even in the parkinglots of large shopping malls parking up close is at a premium.Usually one has to either drive around the parking lot foreverwaiting for someone to leave, or park two blocks away and hoof it. I have fibromyalgia. In case you've never heard of it, the best wayto explain the symptoms is to say that almost every spot on my bodyfeels like I've been beat up, but there are no bruises. I have novisible signs of pain to show the public that I am in constantpain. When I first get out of my car to go shopping I don't lookvery disabled, but after a very short distance my feet and backbegin to throb with pain. The last shopping trip I took my cane and was very thankful. I,like my father, was an avid walker until I was stricken with thishorrible pain. My next step is to get a scooter, but I have held off getting onebecause I didn't want to give in to using something that mightcause my muscles to atrophy from lack of use. Now that the pain isgetting more and more unbearable, the only way to get around willbe with a scooter, so I'll have to give in. I suppose then I willbe viewed as "truly" disabled by fools like yourself and will nolonger be ostrasized for utilizing my handicapped placard andparking up close! I hope one of these days when you manage to get your foot out ofyour mouth you will apologize to folks like my father and I. In themeantime, if you want the laws changed, do something about it! Sharon Huffman Kansas Commission on Disability Concerns http://www.idir.net/~adabbs emeralds@idir.net Re-striping We have newly re-striped shopping plaza parking lot in town.The handicapped spaces have been redone and are of the proper width with ADA compliant access aisles. Problem is that diagonal stripes have been painted on both the access aisles and the spaces themselves. Handicapped parking signs have also been placed on poles at the head of the parking spaces as well as the access aisles. The result? People with disabilities -- with the proper credentials, but obviously, not wheelchair users -- are parking in the access aisles. You can't really blame them. If they don't use a wheelchair, they probably have no idea what the purpose of the access aisles is and, with the botched markings and signage, it's an invitation to abuse. After six months of haggling, the stripes have finally been repainted so the diagonal stripes are only in the access aisles, but the signs are still there at the head of each aisle. Nothing is easy. Last week on ABC's Prime Time Live, there was a story about the abuse of handicapped parking spaces in Boston. Exacerbating the problem in Mass. is the fact that handicapped parking placard holders can apparently park free in handicapped spaces with parking meters. Is it then, any wonder that abuse is taking place in Massachusetts on an apparently greater scale than elsewhere? Is it right that people with disabilities should be permitted to park free... I don't think so. Don England travelac@sisna.com No sympathy Attention:Theodore J. Jelke I have NO -- I repeat No -- sympathy for you. You do not have a parking permit because your wife is not disabled so therefore why do you want me to feel sorry for you when you parked illegally and were fined?. You could have quite easily dropped your wife off at the door and moved the car to a non-handicapped parking spot. The mentality of people who think I am on crutches and "I'll only be a minute" is a good excuse infuriates me! The reason it is a handicapped spot is because a person such as myself needs extra room to transfer to my chair or let a lift down. It is not simply because it is closer. I think you should pay your fine and consider this one of life's lessons and be damn glad you don't need to use the spot because you are disabled!. Kathy Lawrence-Phillips Burnaby, BC, Canada jphillip@direct.ca AB spaces Here in Northern California (except in Berkeley) there always seemsto be plenty of blue spaces available, and very little abuse of them, but there are frequently no AB spaces avaiable. I have a DP license plate, but my disabilities are such that I don't alwaysneed close in parking (depends on why I'm there). I'm always tornif I take the last AB spot in a crowded parking lot, because Icould have parked in the blue zone and left a spot for an ABshopper. Should crips give a damn about the needs of the ABs? My heart says we should. Is there a moral middle ground on this issue? Reed Hopkins reed@best.com Curb blockers My pet peeve is the inconsiderate people who park along the curb.more often than not they are parked in front of the curb cut whichallows me on the sidewalk with my scooter. Think people, it only takes a minute. DSCROUCH@aol.com Like this card I happen to really like the card I found on the net -- it hasthe wheelchair logo and then says -- I'll trade you your parkingspot for my disability! Nancy Andison kakenpf@ptialaska.net Let's educate them I have a handicapped drivers permitdue to very weak arms that make it hardfor me to carry anything very far. You wouldn'tthink there was anything wrong with me tolook at me (unless I've got my walker thatday) and I'm sure there are many others out there who have illnesses like MS which arebetter on some days/worse on others. So, ifI'm feeling good that day I don't use a handicapped spot (and then I often find someone without a sticker has parked thereanyway!) I think a lot of the anger over this issue would be better spent educationg thepublic....we certainly need van sites markedand extra space areas marked so that peopleknow it's not for parking but to give a liftvan room to maneuver. Getting in someone's faceor leaving angry notes on their cars aren'tgoing to get us anywhere (and it might get someone hurt). Let's find a way to educate them. Meg David greengryphon@centuryinter.net True need I live in a large metropolitan area, Washington DC, where there arehandicapped parking spaces at virtually every public place. I makeit a point to watch someone I see parking in a handicapped space tosee if they look like they truly need a parking space close to theplace they are entering. In other words, do they utilize wheelchairs, scooters, crutches,etc. I'm sure no one would argue that disabled people in need ofmobility assistance deserve a special parking space. The fact isthough, my personal observations reveal what appears to me areable-bodied people using the handicapped spaces much more oftenthan disabled people who obviously need a handicapped parkingspace. Oh I know, there are people who don't have observable physical impairments, such as people with heart orasthma problems. I do not feel these types of "disabilities"qualify someone to be issued a handicapped parking pass. Why? Again, from my observations, maybe other than during Christmas,most public places have adequate parking requiring a very shortwalk from the car to the entrance even if one parks in a non-handicapped space. Let's face it, the majority of disabled and non-disabled people arelazy and will try to do anything to avoid even a 50 foot walk.Horrors! Maybe if these heart, asthma, obese, etc. people would walk more often, maybe they wouldn't be disabled! David Gillette DGillBFL@gnn.com Very frustrating I am very frustrated by the attitudes of some my disabled peersconcerning handicapped parking. I am one of those people who looksfairly young and oftentimes able-bodied. I do use a scooter formobility, but I prefer to walk whenever possible because I am alsooverweight. However, I have issues of falling, occasional unsteadygait, and joint problems that result in pain from weight bearing. I cannot walk long distances, so I would prefer to use my walkingtime to do something I need to do or something I enjoy doing ratherwalking through a parking lot which may have uneven footing (whichcan cause me to fall), cars coming too close for safety with mysometimes uneven gait, or slippery pavement. I am tired of others with disabilities challenging my need to usea handicapped parking place. I often wonder where these guardiansof parking got their medical degrees and why they feel they mustuse these degrees publicly, causing embarassment to others whoreally need the spots. My doctor is an ethical one and my permitindicates that there is a sound reason for me to have a handicappedparking permit. There are other courtesy issues among the disabled population couldalso be addressed. I question the validity of people who havepermits using handicapped spots when the person with the disabilityis staying in the car while another runs an errand. I would alsosuggest that it would be polite to leave the handicapped spots openif you can use a regular spot and one is open in very closeproximity to the handicapped spots. And, if you are an adult who can be dropped at the door by an able-bodied driver who can thenpark the vehicle, it frees up premium handcapped spots for thosewho do not have that option. We have a long way to go to get equal access. In the meantime, wecould be working together to make the world a little easier placeto live for others with disabilities. This may sound like Pollyanna, but a little bit of the Golden Rule-- the original one -- and basic courtesies such as sharing andtaking turns, could make access better for everybody. By the way, if you are able, putting the cart in the cart corral orback at the door of the store can provide access for the person whofollows you. Kathy Strom Blood boils Seeing someone park in a handicapped spot at the local mall orshopping center or wherever really makes my blood boil. Ipersonally do not have a diability nor do I have any relations toa person with a disability. I just feel that everyone should exertthe same courtesy and consideration as I do. It is very easy to dothe right thing. What is wrong with some people? I am interested in pressing the local officials into enforcing thelaws on the books, I just don't know what the laws are (Georgia).I have heard that the police cannot do anything because the parkinglots are private property. Is this true? If anyone has any ideas,I would be glad to hear them. Greg Roper WGRoper@ix.netcom.com That sinking feeling When I was in college, my friend and I went to the library in his lift van. As we pulled in this guy VAULTED out of his vette, and walked towrd the library. Needless to say we drove up next to him screaming words not printable in your magazine. He stopped, pulled up his pants legs to show BOTH artificial legs,and left us hoping to sink under the ground. On the other hand, a local paramedic trainer tells me that a litte tool called an automatic centerpunch, used in sheet metal shops to start drill hole, will take out most side glass with oneapplication. I am told it is used in extricating people fromwrecked cars. Jay Brill dor_l_dor@radix.net It's scary I AM A C6/7 QUAD. GOING TO A MALL OR DOING ANY SHOPPING IN MY SIDELIFT EQUIPPED VAN IS VERY SCARY WITHOUT ANOTHER ABLE DRIVER WITHME. I HAVE BEEN BLOCKED IN MANY TIMES BY SOMEONE PARKING ON THEDIAGONAL LINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR LIFT ACCESS. I HAVECALLED THE POLICE AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS OK BECAUSE THEY HAD AHANDICAP PLACARD. COULD THE ANSWER BE A DIFFERENT STYLE CARD ANDDEDICATED SPOTS FOR WHEELCHAIRS, WALKERS. ETC? I DON'T AGREE WITHPEOPLE WHO SAY YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE A PERSON'S DISABILITY. I'VESEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE PULL INTO THESE SPOTS (WITH PLACARDS ORPLATES) AND MOVE QUICKLY FROM THEIR CAR TO WHERE EVER THEIR GOINGWITHOUT A HINT OF BEING PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED. I HOPE SOMETHING CANBE DONE TO STOP THE ABUSE AND ALLOW THE TRULY PHISICALLY IMPAIREDTO ENJOY A MORE MOBILE LIFE WITHOUT FEAR. DAN MATTA GLASSPORT PA dlsjmatt@trib.infi.net Only a minute You know, I get tired of hearing "I'm only going to be a minute"from the non-disabled driver who illegally parks in a spot that isreserved for the handicapped. It seems that there is no amount ofreasoning in the world that will educate these mentally-impairedfolks. Education takes a great deal of time, but when you need aparking space which is yours by law, who has the time to educatethese selfish folks? How about using a valve stem remover to remove the valve stem froma couple of tires as a means of education? This method does not apply to those drivers who honestly don't seethe reserved parking sign, but it does apply to those schmucks whofeel that their interests are more important than anyone else's. Could it be that the signage could be improved so that folks couldbe made more aware of what they're doing? Finally, the primary problem with the issue of handicapped parkingis the fact that the law is not enforced, that is unless youpersonally call the authorities. A law is only benefical if it isconsistently enforced. Milton Datnoffmiltdat@wwisp.com Parking in the UK Here in the UK we appear to have the same problems as you have; theabuse of the designated spaces, the jealousy of the `privileges' ofa parking space and the general difficulty in getting the localauthority to make provisions fir disabled parking. Malcolm Nelson Carlisle, England Got a ticket Recently, my wife was on crutches because of a stress fracture inher heel. We went to a basketball game on the Auburn Universitycampus arriving almost at game time. I was going to drop her at thehandicapped entrance when I noticed several unused handicappedparking places near the entrance. I took one and we went into thegame through the handicapped entrance. Needless to say, I got a ticket. I appealed to the campus parkingcommittee but they upheld the ticket. I feel as though I am being considered as an evil person. Yet Ibelieve I did not violate the spirit of the law and should not befined or be grouped with those that use those spots for no validreason. Does anyone have suggested recourses? Is anyone aware ofthe details of these laws that say the places cannot be usedwithout a handicapped permit even if the user is handicapped? Theodore J. Jelke Original intent I've been a C-5-7 quad of almost 40 years and was active in theNational Paraplegia Foundation (now the National Spinal Cord InjuryAssociation) and at that time (1959-65) the NPF was the researchfoundation of the Paralyzed Veterans of America. As such, the NPFnational conventions were held in conjunction with the PVA nationalconventions. PVA was very active in lobbying for handicappedparking. The original intent of having a handicapped parking space was toprovide the addional room that was needed by A DRIVER WITH ADISABILITY THAT REQUIRED THE USE OF A WHEELCHAIR OR MOBILITYDEVICE. The issue of "proximity", i.e., being close to the entrance, wasnot a significant issue just the space that was needed. The problem arose when the lobbying groups convinced the variouslegislatures that other disabilities and needs should be included.Additionally, the requirements for certification were somewhatambiguous and were overly generous in inclusion. I probably am safein saying that there probably were physicians that were also overlygenerous in certifying some patients with whom they had a long-termrelationship. However, the main fault lies in the legislation andthe abuse of the tag. W. DutcherFlorida What's your take on this?

Stothers I hate Tiny Tim. TT is on the ropes in Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol.Sickly and dependent, TT is getting shakier and shakier on thathomemade little crutch. But he is saved from death by old EbeneezerScrooge, who sees the light in the nick of time. Now, before you go apoplectic at my assault on wee Tim, think abouthow he helps shape some of society's most cherished attitudes --charity, pity (for poor little TT), for example. Tiny Tim, plucky,sweet and inspirational, tugs at the public heart. TT has become Disabled Everyone in popular culture. TT is Jerry'sKid. Society idealizes this sentimental image of disability as a pitifulchild in desperate need of help. People feel better when they givea few bucks or a little toy for a kid with a disability. As an enduring symbol of modern Christmas time, Tiny Tim resonateswith a deeper, darker meaning for people with disabilities. Theproblem is that not all people with disabilities are children, butwe all tend to be treated as if we are Tiny Tims. When I'm in the stores and malls this time of year I get a lot ofsmiles meant for TT. How do I know? Well, I am a middle-agedbearded and balding adult in a power-driven wheelchair. People,mostly women but some men also, flash smiles at me. Not the kind ofsmiles most men would hope for from a woman, nor the neutralcourtesy smile exchanged by strangers passing on the sidewalk, butthat particular precious smile that mixes compassion, condescensionand pity. It's withering to the person on the receiving end. I hate it. I hate it because this Tiny Tim sentimentalitystereotypes people with disabilities and contributes to ouroppression. When you think about a person with a disability assomeone to feel sorry for, as someone to be taken care of andlooked after, it is difficult to think about hiring them as ateacher, an architect or an accountant. That's part of the reasonwhy the jobless rate among working age people with disabilitiesconsistently hovers around 70 percent. And because family, friends and reborn Scrooges nourish and protectTiny Tim, the rest of society doesn't have to worry too much aboutmaking sure people with disabilities have equal access toeducation, adequate housing, transportation, and other publicfacilities. What about the highly touted Americans with Disabilities Act, youask? Good question -- and good law for the most part. Butcomplaints about violations of the ADA are piling up faster thanfederal agencies such as the Justice Department and the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission can handle them. Inadequateresources are available to enforce the law. And local authoritiesmoan and groan about unfunded federal mandates that they can'tafford to implement -- such as providing access to allcitizens. Every year this country spends more than $200 billion on programsthat essentially keep persons with disabilities in a state ofdependence, severely restricting us from getting a good education,going to work, or even getting married. Not all of that money could be saved by removing the penalties onpeople with disabilities, but billions unquestionably could besaved. Not only would people with disabilities gain independence,but thousands of us would become taxpayers instead of tax users. These are serious issues affecting people with disabilities and ourstruggle to be included fully in American life. Remember this thenext time those facial muscles begin to activate that Tiny Timreflex. TT belongs to Christmas Past. And that's no humbug. FEEDBACK Pure ignorance I think that what we see from the average person by way of theirattitudes on the street, is nothing more than the pure igonorancethat the "normies" have passed down from generation to generation. Being Bi-Polar, I have had similar experiences ranging from "professionals" who have talked down to me. (I kindly and not sokindly explain that I am mentally ill -- not mentally stupid.) Tohaving the very same "professionals" speak extra loud as though Iwere hard of hearing. I have also had similar experiences with close family and friends.I have come to realization that if I spend a few minutes educatingthem, that their understanding seems to increase exponentially. Sothat is what I attempt to do. I have also found that these very same people fear what we are experiencing. Perhaps the pity that they seem to show towards us is nothing morethan a reflection of the "weirdness" that they feel for themselves. Tracy Stearns Well put! Great! Well put! America 1996 isn't Dickinsonian England! But we'd better watch thatconsumate politician: Newtie-the-unenlightened-Scroogethe-Gingrich-Grinch-Who-Stole-Christmas from thousands of Whos lastDecember or we'll find ourselves back in the days when "theAfflicted" were hidden in darkend rooms. Let's make sure thatdollar signs don't replace access signs. These signs aremore significant than smiles directed at a character in an oldVictorian novel. VOTE! MSM : keep up the good work! Rick Giles Absolutely! Absolutely!! I am with you all the way, and as for being treatedlike a child, read my flip side of it in my response regardinghandicapped parking. Sometimes the "kid gloves" don't come withsmiles of pity, but some nasty assumptions... Blessings to you during this Holiday and New year! Karen Estes What's youropinion? The change has been long-awaited, Osburn said. Last June, membersof American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (ADAPT) stagedprotests at the Capitol, saying they wanted 25 percent of aproposed $90 million increase for nursing homes to go toward theattendant care program. Osburn said ADAPT wants the entire waiting list to be gone, butsaid advocates were pleased that nearly half of the patients wouldsoon receive the service. But elsewhere... A Mississippi program that offers home nursing services to disabledpeople is being scaled back because of a money crunch. The Independent Living Program is used by about 90 Mississippians.Some may have to make do with less treatment, and others may be cutoff entirely. "If they overextended the program, I feel like they could haveforeseen that," said Jan Ruehling of Biloxi, who was paralyzed atage 19 by polio and is dependent on special breathing equipment. Ruehling said her 140 hours of monthly care have already been cutback to 124. "If we could afford (cutbacks)," she said, "we wouldn't be on theprogram in the first place." "Poor planning" created the dilemma, said Nell Carney, MississippiDepartment of Rehabilitation Services' executive director. "Our counselors over-obligated the program," Carney said. "Insteadof taking people off the program, we've tried to cut back." The state spends about $200,000 annually on the program. Between 5,000 and 6,000 Mississippians who are in nursing homesmight qualify for the Independent Living Program, Director WalterBlalock said. "There's just a lot of severe disabilities out there," Blalocksaid. "The numbers are staggering."

Within moments, firefighters broke down his door and rushed the48-year-old to a Boston hospital. Charles Drafts, a double amputee who types using a stick in hismouth, was playing chess with 159 other people from around theworld when he suddenly sent out this message: "I'm having physicalillness problems and need help." "He was starting to have some really bad feelings, shortness ofbreath and dizziness, and he typed in a message to all ourmembers," said Daniel Sleator, a computer science professor inPittsburgh who founded the Internet Chess Club. It was difficult to know how to respond to the emergency, saidSleator, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon University. "It took a little while to know whether it was serious or notbecause there's an awful lot of kidding and bantering that goeson," he said. "At first, I think some people were thinking it wasa joke. But others realized it was a serious thing and startedgetting the information right away." Back to top of page Fighting mad Four Kentucky children who are severely disabled have been out ofschool for nearly a month as their parents fight a decision toclose a class that serves them. John Balentine, superintendent of Floyd County Schools, said thechildren would be better served at other schools. The parents say abruptly changing schools would harm theirchildren's emotional stability. A declining population of school-age children in eastern Kentuckyhas forced officials to close schools and lay off teachers. But Balentine said that the changes in special education havelittle to do with concerns over money. The class for severelydisabled children at Betsy Layne High School simply didn't have thesupport it needed, he said. So he decided that the students shouldattend similar classes at other high schools in the county. (BetsyLayne still has a class for moderately disabled students.) The parents of the four children contend the move is all aboutmoney, and they say their children are being hurt. The parents are also protesting the end of a special transportationservice. For years, the district hired private cars to drivedisabled children to school. But the service was expensive,Balentine said. He eliminated it this school year, saving thedistrict $275,000. Disabled children must now ride regular school buses. Back to top of page Reservations, anyone? The Courtyard by Marriott hotels has agreed to make it easier toreserve accessible rooms and ensure that the rooms are availablewhen the customers arrive. The agreement, which affects more than 200 hotels around thecountry, resolves a complaint with the Justice Department that thechain violated the ADA. The complaint had been filed by a couple who reserved one of eightrooms accessible to disabled people at a Memphis, Tennessee,Courtyard by Marriott hotel. When they arrived they were given aregular room instead. The accessible room had been given to someoneelse. The hotel chain agreed to pay David and Mary Ann Williams of Tulsa,Oklahoma, $10,000 in damages and $7,500 in civil penalties. Mrs.Williams uses a motorized scooter. The Courtyard by Marriott hotels will also instruct staff not toreserve accessible rooms for non-disabled customers unless allother rooms in the facility are occupied; take steps to relocate anon-disabled customer assigned to an accessible room if the room islater requested by a customer with a disability; and, pay thedifference, if any, between the cost of an accessible room at aspecific Courtyard hotel and an accessible room at another facilityif a reserved room is unavailable. The justice department also signed an agreement with the ComfortInn near Florida's Walt Disney World to ensure all the hotel'samenities and a portion of its guest rooms will be fully accessibleto people with disabilities. By December 1, the hotel will ensurethat 19 guest rooms are fully accessible, including six withroll-in showers. Back to top of page School bias White children are 1.7 times more likely to receive help forlearning disabilities in Georgia than black children with similarproblems, according to a complaint filed with the federalgovernment. The complaint by the Southern Poverty Law Center, says Georgiaschools use a flawed formula to determine if children have learningdisabilities, such as dyslexia. As a result, about 7,000 black students who need help haven'treceived it, according to the complaint filed with the U.S.Department of Education's civil rights office. Learning disabled students account for by far the largest categoryof students receiving special education services in Georgia. Ofroughly 100,000 students getting special education, about 36,000are learning disabled. To determine if a child has a learning disability, Georgiaeducators look for a 20-point gap between IQ and achievementscores. Because blacks on average score lower on IQ tests than whites,black students are less likely to show the gap needed to qualify aslearning disabled, the complaint says. Back to top of page Paper apologizes The Olathe Daily News in Kansas offered a front-page apology forreferring to a boy who is mentally disabled by autistic behavior as"mentally stupid." The parents of the boy said in a story that ran alongside theapology written by publisher Timothy P. O'Donnell that they forgavethe newspaper and viewed the error as "God's will" to bring moreattention to the plight of the disabled. O'Donnell wrote that the choice of words was a mistake made by aneditor who wanted to question a reporter's use of the term "Downsyndrome" in the Friday front-page story on the need for employeesin the Olathe School District to assist disabled students. The editor used the word "stupid" as a place-holder until he couldconfirm whether the child had Down syndrome, but the word was neverreplaced, O'Donnell said. "Twenty years ago, those words could have been used to describesomeone like Marc and very few, if anyone, would have takenoffense," the boy's mother wrote. "Today, even strangers werecommenting how horrible they were." Back to top of page Dome seating A disabled Burien woman has filed suit against the Tacoma Dome,saying her constitutional rights were violated when she was givena poor seat at a 1993 Garth Brooks concert. Joanne Lawrence also named the country music star and hispromoters, TicketMaster and others connected with the event in theTacoma, Washington suit. Lawrence has had polio and uses a wheelchair. She is seeking morethan $50,000 in damages and legal fees. Mike Combs, the Tacoma Dome's assistant director, said whileLawrence's experience was unfortunate, the facility has improvedits wheelchair seating since the Brooks concert. The Dome has spent $140,000 on extending the section and disabledpeople can now buy a ticket to any section, Combs said. In her suit, Lawrence said a TicketMaster agent refused to sell hera ticket near the stage and assigned her a seat in the disabledsection, which was in the rear of the dome. Once she arrived at the concert, the suit alleges, Dome employeesrefused to let her husband sit with her. And when Brooks took thestage, audience members rose to their feet, obscuring her view. The lawsuit alleges that at the time of the 1993 concert the Domehad designated less than one-tenth of 1 percent � or 10 out of27,800 � seats for the disabled. The Americans with DisabilitiesAct calls for setting aside 1 percent of seating, Lawrence said. Back to top of page Voter suit An organization representing disabled students filed a lawsuitaccusing Virginia colleges of failing to comply with the national"motor voter" law. The lawsuit alleges the State Board of Elections, under politicalpressure from Gov. George Allen's administration, refused to ensurethat colleges are asking disabled students if they want to registerto vote. The National Coalition for Students with Disabilities Education andLegal Defense Fund filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court inAlexandria. Defendants are Allen; M. Bruce Meadows, secretary ofthe elections board; and Gordon Davies, executive director of theState Council of Higher Education. "If in fact some of our institutions are not providing theseservices, it would seem to me it's just that they aren't aware theyshould be," said Michael McDowell, spokesman for the highereducation council. Michael J. Beattie, a lawyer and executive director of thecoalition, said the federal motor voter act says disabled studentsapplying for assistance from a public college's disability servicesoffice must be asked if they want to register to vote. The questioncan be asked verbally or in writing, he said. The coalition, based in Fairfax, represents about 200 studentgroups across the country.

A Rhode Island physician who Earley refused to name will help himdie on Dec. 4 � a time when he estimates his amyotrophic lateralsclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, will become too unbearable forhim to continue living. "Around that time I will begin to lose the ability to breathesuccessfully based on my rate of decline," he said. "I'm totallyprepared for it myself. I'm not depressed.

"I'll wake up, have breakfast, be with someone Ireally care about, have lunch with some people, and go and end mylife." Earley said he wrote for help to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who offered toassist with the suicide, but Earley declined. "I was able toarrange something locally," he said. Earley will not discuss how hechose the person to help him or how and where he plans to killhimself. Under state law enacted in August, assisting a suicide ispunishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine as high as$10,000. Gov.

The department forwarded its investigation of Maria Breitbach'sclaim to the attorney general's office. Breitbach had applied for a substitute teaching position with thedistrict last fall, but says she was overlooked for the positionbecause she is deaf and the other candidate could hear. "The school district has a philosophy and long history of thinkingthat deaf teachers can't teach deaf students," she said, notingthat a deaf teacher has never taught in the district. District officials would not comment on the case. In a human rights department memo to the attorney general's office,officials said the district downplayed Breitbach's sign languageskills and enhanced the oral communication of the person hired. Back to top of page Media types Everyone should get involved in eliminating stereotypical andoffensive coverage of minorities, women and people withdisabilities in the media. But a Michigan Civil Rights Commission report, "The Role andResponsibility of the Media in the Community," put the onusprimarily on the newspapers, television and radio stationsthemselves to clean up their acts. "When an institution as powerful as the media condones orperpetuates demeaning stereotypes, progress toward the achievementof a climate of mutual respect and tolerance of others issignificantly impeded," the report said. Recommendations included enrolling employees in sensitivitytraining, promoting minorities, women and people with disabilitiesto decision-making posts and establishing advisory panels toprovide feedback on coverage. The report also suggested making iteasier for the public to complain about stories. The community should get involved by boycotting advertisers of newsorganizations that offend. Everyone should support media companiesowned by minorities, the report said.

What do they stand for? By Jenifer Simpson and William G. Stothers Things are not always what they seem. Except, perhaps, when theyseem confusing. We set out to pull together the voting records of members ofCongress on disability issues in the 104th Congress. It seemed like a straightforward task. What we found is a murkyswamp. Members of Congress have developed techniques for slippingchameleon-like away from accountability for their actions. It's like this: A bill is proposed. It is pushed and pulled and pummelled insubcommittee and committee before -- if ever -- it reaches thefloor of the House of Representatives or the Senate. The importantstuff may happen in subcommittee with or without a vote. If the proposal makes it through committee and onto the floor, itmay never receive a straight up or down vote. Instead it may betacked on to some other bill as a "poison pill" or as a littlenoticed side issue to some bigger issue. Take Welfare Reform, for instance: The Congress recently passed and President Clinton vowed to sign aWelfare Reform Act. Everybody was hot to reform welfare. It was asteamroller. The "end of welfare as we know it" was proclaimed. Included in thisextravaganza were significant changes in Children's SSI. What ended up in the final measure for Children's SSI, althoughharmful to thousands of children, was significantly "better" thenthe original proposal to block grant the funds at the level of 75percent of last year's money to each state. It would be foolish to say a Senator or Representative who votedfor welfare reform is against low-income children with disabilitieswho receive SSI. Do the compromises in the Children's SSI mean that a representativevoted the wrong way? Do we hold each legislator accountable forevery provision in every statute? Some say yes. At the least, weshould be asking a member why he or she voted for it and tellingthem how many children will lose their benefits -- even if wediscern that it is election year politics and members can losetheir seats on the bigger issue. What about the minimum wage? There is not always agreement in our community as to what is a"good" vote. For instance, a rise in the minimum wage may mean alot for low-income individuals with disabilities who work, but canhave a negative effect for individuals who hire personal assistantsfor whom they will have to pay higher wages. And Section 8... Some people may feel that a vote for expansion of funds for Section8 rental assistance for persons with disabilities is a "good"indicator. Others may feel rental assistance in general is a marketdistorting factor that works to keep housing stock out of thehousing market and works as a disincentive to a real increase inthe number of housing units. Others may say that any income supportprogram for persons with disabilities is good. Another person mayfeel "welfare" is bad. How we agree on these fundamental principlesand how they are translated into legislation that affects aparticular individual means every person with a disability andtheir family members must become even more informed and discerningabout issues. And we have to got to tell our representatives --again, and again, and again -- how important issues such aspersonal assistance services, Medicaid and health care, employment,access to affordable housing and transportation are to us. Go Vote! In the August '96 issue of MAINSTREAM, the GO VOTE pullout sectiondescribed the issues of most importance for the disabilitycommunity, and suggested some pointed questions to ask members ofCongress and the people challenging them in this election. Get acopy and press all the candidates strongly and persistently on ourissues. Okay, given all the caveats above, here are a few Congressionalvotes that show how Congress "works:" CHILDREN'S SSI How Representatives voted during initial welfare reform: In January 1995, the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee Membersinitially voted for welfare reform in subcommittee. At that time,Section 402 of the welfare overhaul bill was a proposal todrastically reform the Children's SSI program. Children's SSIprovides critical cash and Medicaid benefits to children withdisabilities in low income families. Section 402 gutted the currentfederal cash benefit by proposing to remove the cash entitlement tofamilies, block grant 75 percent of the current total amount tostate bureaucracy and rip out the Individualized FunctionalAssessment (IFA) process. The IFA process permits children with multiple but milddisabilities to be determined as disabled by SSA. The Senate laterlooked at welfare reform, and senators modified the House proposal,due to pressure from advocates for children with disabilities, sothat the cash entitlement was maintained. Nevertheless, the Senateproposal for children's SSI reform revised the childhood definitionof disability to be used by the Social Security Administration andcompletely removed the IFA process. The recently passed welfare reform bill includes a version ofChildren's SSI reform that is basically the Senate proposal,despite another attack in May 1996 by the House Ways & MeansSubcommittee on Human Resources. This critical vote follows. 104th CONGRESS House Ways & Means Subcommittee on Human Resources Members who voted for Section 402 (against the SSI cash entitlement for children with disabilities): Rep. E. Clay Shaw, Chairman (R-FL), Rep. Mac Collins (R-GA), Rep. Jim McCrery (R-LA), Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), Rep. John Ensign (R-NV), Rep. Phil English (R-PA), Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA), Rep. Jim Nussle (R-IA). Voting against this draconian proposal: Rep. Pete Stark (D-CA), Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-CT), Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI), Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-NY), Rep. Harold E. Ford, Ranking Member (D-TN). MEDICAID How Senators Voted on the Chafee Amendment: Congress passed the Medicaid Transformation Act in December 1995,which both removed the individual entitlement and set a cap to thestates on federal money for medical assistance and which permitsstates to design their own medical assistance programs. During the negotiations Senators Chafee (RI), Conrad (ND),Rockefeller (WV), Frist (TN), Harkin (IA) and Wellstone (MN) pushedthrough a critical amendment ("the Chafee amendment") favoringpersons with disabilities. This amendment would have requiredstates, in developing their plans for medical assistance underproposed block granting, to include persons with disabilities to bedefined as those who are currently SSI eligible. The Medicaid Transformation Act of 1995 was wrapped into an OmnibusReconciliation Act, which also included welfare reform. That actwas passed by Congress and then vetoed by President Clinton.(Medicaid was not included in the welfare reform act passed in July1996.) How the Senate Voted: YES AL-Heflin(D), AK-Stevens(R), AR-Bumpers(D), AR-Pryor(D),CA-Boxer(D), CA-Feinstein(D), CT- Dodd(D), CT-Lieberman(D), DE-Biden(D), DE-Cohen(R),FL-Graham(D), GA-Nunn(D), HI-Akaka(D), HI- Inouye(D), IA-Harkin(D),IL-Moseley-Braun(D), IL-Simon(D), KS-Kassebaum(R), KY-Ford(D),KY-McConnell(R), LA-Breaux(D), LA-Johnston(D), MA-Kennedy(D),MA-Kerry(D), MD-Mikulski(D), MD-Sarbanes(D), ME-Snowe(R),MI-Levin(D), MN-Wellstone(D), MT-Baucus(D), ND-Conrad(D),ND-Dorgan(D), NE-Exon(D), NE-Kerrey(D), NH- Gregg(R), NJ- Bradley(D), NJ-Lautenberg(D), NM-Bingaman(D), NM-Domenici(R),NV-Bryan(D), NV-Reid(D), NY-Moynihan(D), OH-DeWine(R), OH-Glenn(D),OR-Hatfield(R), PA-Specter(R), RI- Chafee(R), RI-Pell(D),SC-Hollings(D), SD- Daschle(D), TN-Frist(R), VA-Robb(D),VT-Jeffords(R), VT-Leahy(D), WA-Murray(D), WI-Feingold(D),WI-Kohl(D), WV-Byrd(D), WV-Rockefeller(D), WY-Simpson(R).

WELFARE REFORM President Clinton promised to sign the Welfare Reform Act passed inJuly. In addition to many other provisions, this act terminates SSIcash payments and food stamps for legal immigrants and potentiallywill eliminate 300,000 children with disabilities from the SSIrolls. That will result from the repeal of the Individualized FunctionAssessment process by which children with disabiliies were deemedeligible for SSI based on their functional status in relation totheir chonologically aged peers. The act also removes "maladative behaviour" from the list used toestablish whether a child has a medically determinable physical ormental impairment of sufficient severity to qualify for SSI. In addition, many children who now qualify for Medicaid based onthe SSI eligibility will not be able to re-establish theireligibility for Medicaid on some other basis, and thus lose theironly means of health insurance coverage.

By Douglas Lathrop Last April, I went to a snowbound, isolated cabin in the Sierras to spend a whole weekend with 15 people I had never seen before. Oh, I'd met them before - I'd just never seen them. Over the previous few months we'd argued about politics and religion, flirted, gossiped, exchanged dumb jokes, bared our souls, and generally hung out together. But I'd never seen their faces, nor they mine. Until that weekend, the only things I knew about them had come from the notes they had been posting to the Internet. At least once a day - more often, several times a day - I would log on to the net, check my e-mail, and read the notes that had been posted to various newsgroups (basically a much larger, worldwide version of the local electronic bulletin board). After reading and responding to enough notes, I began to feel as if I knew many of the newsgroup ''regulars'' as well as, if not better than, many of the people I know in person. And after that it didn't take long for me, and the other members of this ''virtual community,'' to feel a desire to meet each other in what we'd begun referring to, in ironic tones, as ''real life.'' So we picked a weekend. One of us offered the use of his grandparents' cabin in the mountains. We deliberately selected a weekend late in April so as to miss the last of the winter weather, whereupon Mother Nature proceeded to grace the area with 10 inches of snow instead. Instead of ruining the weekend, though, the snow only made it more special. We drank a lot. We played Yahtzee. We became embroiled in heated political and philosophical discussions of the same sort we'd been having on the net, only with real facial expressions and tones of voice to add emotion to our words. We drank a lot. We jokingly elected one of our number to be our official Congressional candidate when she became old enough. We played hearts. We discussed whether the '80s hit song ''Turning Japanese'' was about masturbation (the verdict: yes). At 3 o'clock in the morning a few of us went tobogganing. The rest of us ... well, we drank a lot. This went on for a whole weekend, and not once did I pick up any of the awkward vibes I usually detect from ABs when they meet me for the first time - this, even though I was the only Gimp in the bunch. No one addressed me in baby-talk, no one told me what an inspiration I was, and best of all, no one made a fool of himself or herself by trying too hard not to offend me. Of course, my disability didn't exactly come as a surprise to them - I had been quite open about it in my posts to the newsgroup, making reference to it whenever I considered it appropriate. In fact, hardly a day went by where I didn't remind them of it. Did I mention that we drank a lot? There has been much written recently about the so-called Information Revolution and how it is affecting the way we work, communicate, participate in the democratic process, and so on. Less heralded, but potentially far more profound, are the changes being wrought in the social realm. As the Information Age progresses, we may come to possess a wholly altered view of what a ''community'' is and how the members of that community socialize. On the Internet, most socializing takes place on the newsgroups, which collectively go by the name of Usenet. Originally, Usenet had only a few newsgroups, used mainly by scientists, academics, and other research-oriented types to share information and discuss issues related to their fields. But the number of people with access to the net has steadily increased, beginning with college students, and continuing with subscribers to online services such as Delphi, America Online, and Prodigy. There has also been an explosion in the number of commercial Internet service providers, which offer direct access to the net for a monthly fee. Most provide the same features available at university sites, while others have additional features available only to their own users, who are insulated from outsiders by a ''firewall'' - in networking terminology, a one-way security barrier that prevents other systems from accessing the one being protected. As the number of users has grown, the size of Usenet has grown as well. Today numbering in the thousands, the newsgroups range from the earnest (soc.rights.human) to the irreverent (alt.pave.the.earth), from the scientific (sci.physics) to the just plain weird (soc.culture.african-american), age groups (alt.society.generation-x - one of my favorites), artistic interests (rec.arts.books), and sexual proclivities (alt.sex.bondage), as well as groups for those who want to talk about their favorite TV shows (alt.tv.simpsons) or their least favorite (alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die). In short, there is a newsgroup out there to tickle - or inflame - just about anyone. To make the net even more bewildering for newcomers, or ''newbies,'' the name of a group may actually say nothing about the majority of notes posted to it. A group's regulars may have been posting to it for a year or more - practically forever, in the elongated time frame of the net - and they most likely have come to regard it not as a forum for discussing designated subjects, but rather as a place where they can hang out and shoot the bull with people they consider good friends regardless of whether they've ever physically met them. In these cases, the newsgroup has evolved into more than a simple electronic bulletin board and has taken on many of the features of an actual human community. It doesn't matter that the community has no physical location; its members can live hundreds of miles apart, even on different continents, and still feel ''close'' to each other. In my two years on the net, I have made more new friends than I did in the previous ten. I have seen people become engaged after first meeting on the net, too. All this has made it easy for me to envision a future in which social interaction has become totally independent of geographic proximity. It's also made me wonder what this future has in store for people with disabilities. As far as I can tell, that future is uncertain. We Gimps may find ourselves liberated by the net, or we may find ourselves, once again, imprisoned by it. Historically, one of the most oppressive aspects of life as a disabled person has been social isolation. In ''Isolation: Confronting The Painful Social Realities That Come With Disability'' (MAINSTREAM, September '93), Carol Gill writes, ''Those of us disabled since childhood have had a long exposure to the social isolation of disability. Some of us remember being sent from our 'regular' classrooms for 'special' separate services, or never being chosen by classmates for inclusion in sports or parties. We may have grown up in inaccessible homes and neighborhoods that thwarted our involvement in community activities. Some of us were cloistered in 'schools for the handicapped' or institutions.'' Gill, a psychologist, goes on to document the harmful effects this sort of isolation can have on a disabled person's social development. When viewed in the light of this kind of experience, the evolution of ''virtual communities'' seems like a godsend. On Usenet, communication is text-only - the reader of a note has no way of knowing anything personal about the author unless the author supplies it. Gone are those prejudgments, both conscious and unconscious, that people make when they see a Gimp coming toward them. On the net, people ''see'' only what others want them to see - so unless the rest of the net becomes aware of one's disability, that disability (in a ''virtual'' sense) doesn't exist. Even many ABs recognize the disabled presence on the net. A co-author of The Internet for Dummies writes, ''Physical disabilities don't matter - I correspond with several people who are blind or deaf. If they hadn't felt like telling me, I'd never have known.'' What a wonderful boon for the Gimp community, isn't it? Centuries of social ostracism wiped away with a modem and an e-mail address - right? It's not working out that way. I know from my own experience that there are a lot of Gimps on the net. I'm very open about my disability, and I've gotten in plenty of arguments over the ADA, the euthanasia movement, the portrayal of Gimps in movies and on TV, the implications of prenatal genetic testing, and other issues of concern to disabled people. As a result, I get a lot of private e-mail, cheering me on and telling me how cool it is that someone ''like us'' is willing to speak out. I'm flattered, obviously, but it makes me uncomfortable, too - first, because I hate being perceived as a spokesperson for anyone other than myself, and second, because I'd rather have these other Gimps talk about their disabilities publicly rather than hide behind their computer screens. When I suggest that they do so, however, I'm met with either dead silence or a reluctance bordering on fear. We're becoming isolated once again, I'm afraid. Worse still, this time the isolation is self-imposed. The only places on the net where Gimps seem uninhibited are where other Gimps gather. Of all the groups on Usenet, there is only one (misc.handicap) devoted to general issues concerning the disabled. Moreover, misc.handicap is moderated, meaning that the notes are screened by someone before being posted to the group at large. This helps to keep the discussions civil, but it also deprives them of the spontaneity and wildness that prevails elsewhere on the net - and that wildness is part of the fun. The communities on the net are chaotic, unpredictable places. The language is coarse, with old words taking on new meanings. (On one of the newsgroups I frequent, the word ''moose'' has come to be synonymous with gay or lesbian. It would take a whole book to explain how and why it happened.) Conversations on health-care reform or Hegelian philosophy occur side-by-side with others about Monty Python or Dungeons and Dragons. And because those conversations take place without the facial expressions and other cues that convey shades of meaning in everyday discourse, the emotional content of the words themselves is heightened. People regularly fling insults - or ''flames'' - at each other, and all-out ''flamewars'' break out without warning. It's understandable how an average disabled person might be intimidated by the freewheeling atmosphere; to varying degrees, our social opportunities have been limited because of our disabilities, and many of us are unsure of how well-equipped they are to interact with others in ''real life,'' much less on the net. Conditioned to expect rejection, they may try to conceal their disabilities from their new ''netfriends'' and thereby gain equal acceptance that way. Or so they hope. But what happens when the time comes to venture forth into the flesh-and-blood world and meet, up close, some of the people they've gotten to know so well from a distance? That's what happened with me, at least - in contrast to the stereotype of the computer geek who's content to sit at his keyboard and never leave his room, I've found myself eager to meet my netfriends in person. I can only imagine what I'd do if I hadn't been open about my disability from the get-go. I'd either be forced to come out of the closet (to use a ''moose'' metaphor), keep mum about it and go to meet my netfriends carrying the same fear of rejection I've always had, or shrink from the opportunity and thereby reject them before they have the chance to reject me. I prefer doing what I can to make the word ''Gimp'' a part of net slang. (I'll finally be convinced that there's a true Gimp presence on the net when one of us - I hope it's me - receives e-mail from Kibo.) By all rights, there should be legions of Gimps raising pluperfect hell from one end of the net to the other - because, weirdly enough, in the midst of all the anarchy on the net, people do connect and communities do form. And I'll be damned if I'm going to be left disconnected again. So yes, maybe the Information Age will see people with disabilities shattering a history of isolation. But it won't until enough of us have smashed the firewalls that we've built for ourselves first. Douglas Lathrop, a frequent contributor to MAINSTREAM, has yet to receive e-mail from Kibo, but if anyone else wants to write him, his address is lathrop@primenet.com. © Copyright 1995, Exploding Myths, Inc.

The group has also managedto make its voice heard at medical ethics conferences, and the recent AMAconvention. On Saturday, October 5, the group raised its voice on the internet.On Saturday, October 5, the group took to a new kind of "street"- the "information superhighway". Disability activists from theU.S. and Canada attempted to educate members of a mailing list operatedby one of the most noted proponents of assisted suicide, Derek Humphry,who is a founder of the Hemlock Society and author of Final Exit. Web sites operated by Humphry and other proponents of assisted suicidehave gained a reputation as rich sources for general informationon issues related to euthanasia, to the extent that even major news serviceshave been known to cite them as such. These sites, and the organizations that support them, have managed topromote the illusion that there is no opposition to their movement fromanyone but religious conservatives. They refuse to recognize the disabilityrights resistance to their bigotry regarding our quality of life. As sooften happens, this community is ignored, while stereotypes and fears aboutdisability are used to further somebody else's agenda. At approximately 9:30pm EDT, the following message went out to the right_to_dielist, followed by others over the course of the evening and into the morning: Not Dead Yet! is a group of disability activists who are opposed tothe legalization of assisted suicide. We have invited ourselves to yourforum for a number of reasons: 1. Derek Humphry, owner of this list, and John Hofsess have gained areputation as experts on the topics of assisted suicide and euthanasia. 2. Unfortunately, in spite of their reputations and the belief thatthe web sites operated by these gentlemen are comprehensive sources ofinformation on end-of-life issues, materials and news items that reflectopposition based in the disability community have never been made availablethrough sites or forums operated by either Humphry or Hofsess. 3. We believe this pattern of omission is intentional. Promoters ofassisted suicide and other related agendas have been successful in presentingthe issue as an argument between the religiously-based "right to life"movement and advocates of "choice". There is a third voice inthis debate, an opposition based in a civil rights perspective. In growingnumbers, members of the disability community are alarmed by the stereotypesand discrimination widespread in the medical community and reflected inthe language and stories used to promote the legalization of the "right",putting it bluntly, to be killed. 4. We do not expect to be welcome participants in your ongoingdiscussion,as it is currently framed on this list. Accordingly, we will be postingmaterials that will probably be unfamiliar to most of you and then leave.However, unless we see an acknowledgment of our voice in this debate, asevidenced by distribution of news stories related to Not Dead Yet! actionsas well as other disability-based materials, we will be back. The reaction to the invasion was swift. In a tersely worded email message,Humphry branded the group as "right to life", which in the contextof this debate generally refers to elements of the Christian conservativepolitical movements. Bob Liston, of Ypsilanti, Michigan, replied, "This is not a 'rightto life' issue-it is a civil rights issue." Liston, of the Ypsilanti-based ADAPT group, is the Michigan coordinator for Not Dead Yet. Liston, in a message to the mailing list, had this to say about thepromoters of assisted suicide: "It is not people who are terminallyill who are so emphatic about this 'supposed' right. It seems to be peoplewho are afraid of the thought that they may not be in complete controlof their lives. Guess what folks!!! None of us are." Why target the right_to_die listserv? "This list's membership includesa virtual who's who of figures in the "right to be killed" movement,"says Stephen Drake of Syracuse, NY. "In the months I've lurked onthe list I have witnessed kneejerk defenses of any parent or spouse whokills a relative with a disability. A short while ago, John Hofsess (founderof the Canadian Right to Die Society) called for pro-euthanasia organizationsto contribute to Kevorkian's dream to build a clinic". Drake says this appeal from a prominent leader of the movement shouldalarm anyone who has actually read Kevorkian's book Prescription: Medicide,published in 1991. In the book, Kevorkian states that his greatest satisfactionin his current work is "the prospect of making possible the performanceof invaluable experiments or other beneficial medical acts under conditionsthat this first unpleasant step can help establish...". Most people have an image of the so-called "right to die"movement as advocates for eliminating the last few pain-filled days ofsomeone with a terminal illness. In fact, the movement encompasses advocatesof this "right" for anyone with a chronic illness or disability.What all players agree on, though, is that it is a practical necessityto get legislation passed for a narrowly defined population in order totry to expand this "right" to more and more people through courtchallenges. Several well-known Right to Die cases involved people with disabilitieswho despaired when threatened with placement in nursing homes. They couldhave lived independently with home. and community- based supports. They- and 2.4 million other disabled Americans - have been consigned to nursinghomes because in-home supports are so limited. We want to live - in freedom. "Please understand. We don't want anyone to suffer," saysDiane Coleman, a national organizer of Not Dead Yet, "We believe thatdisabled people and sick people deserve to have their health care needsmet, including pain management and in-home support services that are oftendenied. "The failings of our health care system are not a justificationfor killing.

So Who Are We? By Steven E. Brown Saturday morning. The sun is shining. I sit contentedly in myliving room chair fulfilling a volunteer commitment. Bakingpleasantly in the warmth, and the light, I am energized. I finishthe volunteer work; I complete some light reading; I retrieve mypile of disability culture research notecards waiting to beorganized and filed. I feel productive. I am contemplative. BeforeI can stop myself my brain is racing into an approach anddefinition of disability culture I think might be livable. How many cultural definitions or characteristics might one find inthe above paragraph? Sun-worshipper? Volunteer? Workaholic? Reader?Philosopher? What would make any of the above words into cultures? Whatwould make me a member of such a culture? It's been ten years since I first started mulling over the conceptof disability culture. During the first five of those years I wasa passionate, though sporadic, investigator of the concept. I facilitated and participated in some panels that discussed thesubject. I began to promote the concept. During the past five yearsI have moved from passionate investigator to an "acknowledgedauthority" (and to what cultures does that appellation belong?). Iam writer, promoter, advocate, expert, co-founder of the secondinstitution specifically about disability culture, teacher,student, poet, and so forth. And yet when someone asks for a definition of disability cultureI am hard-pressed to respond in a way that will make sense to bothof us. I have never had a handy one sentence or paragraphexplanation of the concept. One reason for this is that the words themselves are full ofcontroversy. "Disability" is defined differently in various partsof the world, by distinct cultures, by diverse outlooks on life.What once was a disability may no longer be, for example, certainvisual needs which can be corrected with the use of glasses (andwho hears the phrase spectacle-bound?). The United Nations has spent more than ten years and who knows howmany people hours attempting to define disability, handicap, andimpairment for a classification system. The endeavor continues. "Culture" is a word just as value-laden. There may be as manydefinitions as there are people working in the field of "culturalstudies" (which did not exist several years ago). I am looselydefining that field, for the purpose of this essay, as anyone whochooses to pursue cultural issues. When I began to write about disability culture I felt much morecomfortable with my ability to define "disability" than "culture."So I started searching for definitions of culture. I quicklylearned how many definitions and controversies about the word andits meanings existed. So I did as I was taught many years ago. Ilooked it up in the dictionary. The 1973 Random House Unabridged Dictionary, which happens to bethe one I use at work, defines culture as "the sum total of ways ofliving built up by a group of human beings and transmitted from onegeneration to another." Shortly after copying this definition I came across another. I don't know its origin, but its definition is a "totality ofsocially transmitted behavior patterns, arts, beliefs,institutions, and all other products of human work and thoughtcharacteristic of a community or population." I did find one other definition useful: one is a part of a cultureif they think they are. I did not note the source of thisdefinition -- it seemed too simple, I guess. But the phrase, or avariation of it, shows up frequently, including in my own writing. The problem with these definitions is the same obstacle that is theproblem with any definition that is not commonly accepted -- theygenerate controversy. So, as I sat radiating in the sun thismorning, I started thinking about the definition and my inabilityin developing an argument defining disability culture that gave mecomfort. I seemed to have hit upon some clues. Let's see. . . What, I wondered for the first time, if I analyzed similaritiesthat the various definitions of culture seemed to share? Anappallingly simple answer resulted: Each definition of culture istrying to place the concept in some sort of context. Either one isa part of a culture because one fits the context or one is not forthe same reason. What then is the reason for such emphatic need to develop contextand ensure its integrity? Henry Adams wrote more than a centuryago, "order is the dream of man, chaos is the law of the universe."Context is order. If we can figure out to which culture, orcontext, we belong, then we can put the rest of humanity in order,that is in context, either as a member or an outcast of ourculture, our context. As any activist in any social, political, cultural or othermovement can verify, belonging is about naming, claiming, andproclaiming. We all do this all the time. I claim, for example, tohave a disability, to be a writer, to be a husband, and to be afather. Naming these identities is the same as making a claim tothem. When I claim to be a writer I also proclaim myself a member of agroup of people who write. Others may write who do not make such aproclamation. Are they not writers? Indeed, they are. But theychoose not to claim to be a member of the group. Meaning theyrefuse, for whatever reason, to put themselves into the context,the order of the group of writers. If I find out you are a writer who does not choose to proclaimyourself by that label I can either choose to accept you as you areor try to change you. In either case I am making a choice to putyou into an order, a context. Who am I to do this to you? Exactly. The debate about definitions is not a debate primarily about theliteral meaning of a word. It's a debate about power. Who has the power to create and apply definitions of culture? Forthe most part, the people who have claimed that power have beenacademicians in the fields of anthropology, psychology, history,sociology, and other so-called social sciences. There may be all sorts of reasons for this act of power. Peoplewho are formulating definitions may believe that they have the mostknowledge about the concept and therefore the most right toimplement their own beliefs. They may just as easily believe thatthey have spent many years of their life acquiring this knowledgeand because of it the position to formulate definitions. They mayalso believe that others who have not experienced their long questfor knowledge and position have little right to question theirjudgment. Or they could just as easily fear that when someonequestions their judgment they will lose their power. In any case, the motivation for claiming expertise is power. Thepower to name, the power to define, the power to proclaim, thepower to place people into a context, an order which fits thevision of the person doing the naming, claiming, and proclaiming. Many people who have had the power to define culture have chosen tostate, in one variation or another, that you cannot be a part of aculture because you think you are. Why not? Who makes this rule? If I choose to say I am a member of the disability culture who isanyone else to oppose this proclamation? A doctor, social worker,psychologist, politician (and so forth), who say I do not have adisability? Who are they to make this judgment? Do I have adisability if I think I do? Who is the expert, the person in power,who can argue I do not have this right? If I choose to state I am a member of the disability culture whois anyone else to oppose this claim? An anthropologist,sociologist, psychologist, historian, and so forth who says I haveno culture to which to belong? Who are they to make this judgment?Do I have a culture if I think I do? Who is the expert, the personin power, who can argue I do not have this right? If I do not give them the power no one has these rights. If I dogive them the power, then everyone has those rights. This makes the debate, the controversy over definition a fightover who has the power of naming, claiming, and proclaiming thedisability culture. I believe I have this right for myself. I amunwilling to give it to anyone else. I have the power. Of course, the entire preceding debate is moot. Because while wemay argue about its existence or characteristics the culture itselfgoes on with or without us. Art is burgeoning. Writing is increasing. Teaching is takingplace. Children are learning about their history. Values are beingexplored. Music is being composed. Humor is generating laughter.Members of the culture are being born and dying. Life goes on. The debate itself, while perhaps irrelevant, goes on as well. Andbecause I am a part of that debate, I offer a definition ofdisability culture as follows: People with disabilities have forged a group identity. We share acommon history of oppression and a common bond of resilience. Wegenerate art, music, literature, and other expressions of our livesand our culture, infused from our experience of disability. Mostimportantly, we are proud of ourselves as people with disabilities.We claim our disabilities with pride as part of our identity. Weare who we are: we are people with disabilities. You now have the choice to accept, reject, or refine thisdefinition. The power is yours -- if you take it. Steven E. Brown is co-founder of the not-for-profit Institute on Disability Culture, located in Las Cruces, New Mexico. What's your take onthis?

Stothers When I first acquired my disability, at the age of 10, I chose notto be disabled. I did not want to be disabled. I didn't want to beshuttled through hospitals and tortuous rehab programs. I wanted togo home, ride my bike through the countryside, explore the woodsand follow the little creeks around town, go swimming or try tocatch the fish. I hated being disabled. That didn't change after I returned home. I was the only kid witha severe disability around my area. My friends got on with theirlives without me. Unable to play with them, or keep up with them,I was left behind, at home. In some ways, I didn't mind. While I was angry and hurt that Iwasn't a part of the gang anymore, I also was glad that I didn'thave to expose my crippled self to them. I was ashamed of mydisabled body. And I was angry at it for not working like it used to. Boy, did Iever feel sorry for myself. Why me? I wanted to know. I didn'tdeserve this. Somebody fix it! Nobody did, of course. They developed a vaccine to prevent polio,which had caused my disability, but the vaccine would not cure me.What I had was what I had. Over time I built a shell to hide thehurt. Outwardly, I went to school, college and entered the workforce. Igot along, but I never really got close to anyone. I hated peoplepatronizing me and feeling sorry for me -- at the same time that Iwas feeling far more sorry for myself than anyone one would, orcould. What a mess I was. I did not deny my disability so much as Idevalued and rejected it. I tried very hard to be non-disabled. Inever looked at other people with disabilities, let alone associatewith them. I wasn't like them. I made jokes about my wheelchair andaccommodations I needed, and endured those "heh-heh" comments fromothers about going too fast and breaking the speed limit. It wasall very detached, and I was wound pretty tight. Maintaining the contradictions of such an existence was not easy.For me, drinking made it easier, even as it caused its own seriousproblems. I can't pinpoint when I began to change, although it was around thetime I met another person in a wheelchair. His name was also Billand he lived in the same apartment building as I did. Weencountered one another over time and gradually became friends. Wediscovered that we had had similar experiences as wheelchair users.Ultimately, we talked a great deal about those experiences andabout disability. Our friendship went beyond disability, butdisability added a richness and texture to it. In time, we gotinvolved with some other people with disabilities and foundourselves becoming disability activists. We found a community. Here, disability was a common bond, notsomething to be rejected. We all, I think, found strength andsupport. We were not all necessarily friends. But we valued oneanother. I didn't realize it fully at the time � this was in the early 1970s� but it was in that small community of persons with disabilitiesthat I first chose to be disabled. I chose to be part of the groupbecause I saw myself reflected in them. At last, I acknowledged myself. The group was called ALPHA, and for me it was a beginning. Inchoosing to be a part of this group I began to stop rejecting mydisability. Instead I began to incorporated my disability into myconception of myself. From being rejected as abnormal, disability for me became normal.And so it is. All you have to do is look around. Disability iseverywhere and touches almost everyone's life. It is a normalexpression of life, a natural part of life. Adopting that perspective brought me a peace I had not known. Ibegan to feel a sense of wholeness that I had not experiencedbefore. And I was taken with new energy and passion. Not overnight, Ihasten to add. The change took time, and more than a bottle or two.But change I did. Today, great numbers of individuals with disabilities believe thatdisability is normal. We're working hard to spread that news. Butcountless others, both disabled and non-disabled, have not yetheard. That's the passion of the disability rights movement: toexpand our knowledge of life to include and respect disability, toinclude people with disabilities equally, as the normal people weare.

I am having difficulties with the castorwheels,the joystick, and the clamp that holds the power arm. Invacaresays (throughmy provider) that there should not be any problems with the wheels. Hasanyone else experienced these difficulties? Do you haveinformation on how Ican get hold of Invacare and talk to them direct? Please let meknow. Thanks for info I just want to thank you for the information you are providing online. As a hemiplegic, the computer is my adaptive tool for research. Your magazine seems to offer a constructive climate rather than the "suefirst, ask questions later" mentality. This is important whendealing with highly controversial and emotional subjects. Many people seemto be of the mind that you can and should force others to come around toyour way of thinking. I can't tell you how many people honestly believethe ADA says you HAVE to make your business accessible when, in fact,most businesses only need to provide reasonable accomadation. Sure,total accessability would be a godsend, but this is life, it isn'tfair---or we wouldn't need accomadation in the first place. THANK YOU. MAINSTREAM is now a treasured bookmark!

His mother has recently heardrumors that the program which allows for his home care is injeopardy because of proposed cuts in Medicaid which are part of theFY '97 budget. I'm not quite sure how to begin researching this topic or how towork to make sure that these cuts (if proposed) don't become law.I'm from Washington State and have sent e-mail requests about thebill to Senators Murray and Gorton. My understanding is that the budget begins moving through Congress in June. I'm well aware of the benefits of this program and am willing tocontribute considerable time and effort to insure that it stays inplace.

Carl-Gunnar Harstrup Hate crimes I am a college student doing a report on hate crimes aimed at thedisabled people of the United States. At the moment, I am havingtrouble finding information. Would you please send me any ideas onwhere information could possibly be found. Thank you, Anna Loscotoffloscotoff@ocsnet.net Diluting resources I share your concerns that services may be cut back forpeople who really need them. However, part of theproblem is that so many situations have been labelled as disabilities that it tends to dilute out the finite amountof resources available even during a booming economy,as well as public support for same. One need only lookat "disabilities" such as drug and alcohol addiction,dyslexia, ADD, etc. to see what I mean. A similar problemhas been seen in the ADA, which has made employersmore timid about being inclusive and accommodating for fear of litigation. I believe that those who would speak for those with mobilitylimitations would do better to separate their issues from thosewith mental or other types of disabilities, and to seek strategiesthat would allow more support for things such as insurance coveragefor mobility aids, elimination of physical barriers, adaptive living,home health care, housekeeping, shopping services, aide services, portability and availability of private insurance, asset limits forreceiving disability assistance, and the like. Rather than simply targeting the GOP, it would be more effective to seize on those issues they are touting for which there may be somecommon ground. Otherwise you will continue to see a system that may bebroad in scope (to get more votes) but shallow in depth--much like thesystem we have now. Dr. Edward A. Cefala RDHJ42A@prodigy.com Any ideas? I am a Professor at Casper College in Wyoming and in the process ofdeveloping an assistive technology 2 year degree program. This type ofprogram has never been done before. The program will also include consumertraining and assistance, professional training, and regional resourcecenter for assistive and adaptive equipment. We are working with the RESNA group on the new ATP credidentialing.We hope to develop individuals that specialize in adaptive and assistiveequipment to assist O.T.'s, P.T.'s, other professionals, and consumers inevaluation, selection, training and making it all work. We are alsoincluding the technology tranfer group of wyoming (WYNOT) so we can trainprofessionals, consumers, care givers. I am in the process of developing a needs assessment for the degree plan.This must be submitted to our state college commission before anything elsegets done. The needs assessment must include the projected job market andpay for next 5 years for local, regional and national. The problem I amhaving is that this degree plan has never been done before and is a newcareer area. The way our college system works, we need a degree plan inplace so we can do training for professionals and consumers. If you have any ideas or would like further information please let meknow.

It was a wonderful event at the DorothyChandler Pavilion. But the occasion caused me to think about people who work day in and out for the movement and never getthanked. It caused me to pause and think about what I had to bethankful for. Bill. For my parents and family. For a quality education. Not every child with a disability received this. For Edie and her commitment to the cause. (And the Alan Glou gangin Needham who created a positive working environment for her.) Susie and Carol, who have worked with me for over five years. For Mike Jablonski, our computer doctor, mentor and friend. Good health. Two crazy cats. A van that keeps on running. Great weather. Readers who respond with wonderful notes of appreciation. Andreaders who say that they love the magazine - but can't afford tosubscribe. They keep me focused on the real issues of disability. A new generation of great kids with disabilities. A home that shelters body and soul. Love and laughter. Wonderful colleagues and collaborative efforts that delight us.

Competition that helps us to do better and be better. Ideas that turn into action. For all the help on GO VOTE - Shawn Casey O'Brien, JeniferSimpson, Chris Button, Justin and Yoshiko Dart, Becky Ogle, FredFay, Jim Dickson and Dave Williams. I'm thankful for individuals who keep up the struggle and thosewho keep pushing the agenda forward. For those who have been bold enough to file an ADA complaint orinitiate a lawsuit, putting America on notice that this law will be enforced. I'm thankful for companies that have voluntarily complied with theADA. It gives me hope that justice will prevail. I'm thankful for the leaders, who began working for our rightswhen no one believed people with disabilities had any rights. I'm thankful for this community - its perseverance and commitmentto justice.

Last year we heard of more than 30 events around the country.Parades, parties, picnics, letter-writing campaigns, essaycontests, city proclamations, press conferences, protests, sit-ins,filing of ADA lawsuits and settling of ADA complaints -- you nameit, it happened. This year, with the national election looming so large before us,it is critical to show the strength of the disability rightsmovement. The Anniversary of the ADA is just a few weeks in frontof the Republican and Democratic National Conventions. As the twoparties convene, it would be helpful for them to be able tovisualize us. July 26th is the perfect opportunity to host an eventwhere the disability community is visible -- showing the candidatesrunning for office that we are a large voting block. A friend of mine makes a point of taking July 26th as a "personalholiday" and doing something that he couldn't do before the ADA waspassed. Why don't you think about taking a vacation day on July26th this year? Do something creative to show what the ADA means toyou. I think it would be a great opportunity to spend the dayregistering voters. You can ask a few of your friends to go withyou to a shopping center or public park. Not only will you behelping to change the image of people with disabilities by gettingout and being seen "doing" something, but you will be working onsecuring our rights by encouraging participation in the democraticprocess. (By the way, when was the last time you did something tosupport the ADA?) According to the Unique People's Voting Project, (a non-profitorganization which encourages disabled people to vote), there are51,000 people with disabilities per congressional district, or 15%of the electorate. In 1994, 11 congressional races in Californiaalone were decided by less than 7% -- and some of those by a lotless. What difference does that make nationally? Newt Gingrichholds the third most powerful position in the United States by only19 seats in Congress. People with disabilities make up a votingblock that is large enough to decide every election. Disability issues cut across all political, economic and culturallines. Contrary to what opponents to the ADA want people tobelieve, disability is not a special interest issue -- it iseveryone's issue. Every American will come face to face withdisability, either themselves, a family member or close friend.To vote and campaign as a block, people with disabilities need theinformation to tell them who helped us and who didn't. That isexactly what MAINSTREAM will give you in the August '96 issue: ADisability Rights Guide to Election '96. Find out if yourrepresentative has voted Pro-Disability; or did s/he keep us busyputting out political fires? We'll give you tips on getting out thevote, registering your friends, the scoop on the permanent absenteeballot, a litmus test for those in Congress and much more. See page45 for more details and an order form for extra copies of thevoting guide. But in the meantime, the question remains, what are you doing tocelebrate the ADA? What's youropinion?

By William G. Stothers The routine went something like this: "Get me a Coke, Kathy," Iinstructed my sister. "No," she replied. "Get it yourself." "Come on, Kathy, get your brother a Coke," my father interjected. After some fussing, Kathy went into the kitchen and poured the softdrink for me. She wanted to pour it on me. This all took place, more than once, in our living room during theyears after I had returned from rehab hospitals here and there. Iwas using a manual wheelchair, circa 1953. It was heavy, the carpetwas thick and I was weak. But I wasn't so weak that I could not roll myself out to thekitchen and get myself a drink. My sister, a couple of yearsyounger than me, knew that as well as I did. I just did not want todo it. I had surrendered to my disability and felt more sorry for myselfthan I had words for. In my kingdom of self-pity, I becamemanipulative and controlling of my family and friends. I wasresistant to doing anything but sit around and watch television.Bored and boring. My father fell for my game, and I believed in it, too. Poor me. Butmy mother and sister saw through me like I was a pane of glass.Family life was a constant struggle as I sought to preserve myvictimhood. It took a long time for me to wake up to reality, andto assume responsibility for my life. I'm sure many people have endured the same kind of struggle.Probably, like me, they continue to feel occasional pangs of it. These remembrances return to me as I reflect on our disabilityrights movement in this hot political year. It becomes increasinglyclear that this election will determine the direction this countrywill take in the coming decades. The impact on policies that affectthe lives of people with disabilities is going to be enormous. TheADA and IDEA are threatened, and social welfare and health programs(already inadequate) face new cutbacks and emasculating "reform." But the political campaigning has stirred little interest so far,among disabled or non-disabled citizens. No news in that. The voterturnout trend has been headed south for years. Some folks are too busy making ends meet to get involved inpolitical campaigning. Economic survival crowds out other activity.Many people plain don't give a hoot; not everyone carespassionately about politics. Especially in the mass society fromwhich people feel outcast with no power and little opportunity tobe heard. It makes you want to sit back and just watch TV. Likethat kid I once was, some people stand around asking others to dothe work for them. I recently came across this quote from Martin Luther King, Jr.:"Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expedience asks thequestion, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular?But conscience asks the question, is it right? And there comes atime when one must take a position that is neither safe, norpolitic, nor popular, but he must make it because his consciencetells him that it is right." The phenomenal achievements in making society more accessible --promising in law full unquestioned equality and opportunity forthose of us with disabilities -- happened because people withdisabilities made it happen. People with disabilities proclaimedour worth as people and citizens. Drawing committed non-disabledsupporters to our cause, we changed our world. Martin Luther King's quote defines stages that many of us gothrough, from safe, to politic, to popular, to doing right. Thesestages mark a journey from self-centeredness to interacting withour communities, to participation in the world at large. It was not, and is not, easy to do the right thing. But it is theway to make change. It is the way to prevent bad things fromhappening. Another quote, from the English philosopher EdmundBurke: "All that is required for the triumph of evil is for goodpeople to remain silent and do nothing." Pretty heavy thoughts for summertime. Hey, who needs it? It's timefor vacation, having fun and enjoying life. We need and deserve it,too. Gimme a break! Hey, Kathy, go get me a Coke! "Get it yourself." William G.

After a breakfast with disabled athletes, the senator addressed a group of about a hundred people with disabilities and then watched a demonstration by Canine Companions for Independence, an organization for the training of service dogs. Gimps, animals, and TV cameras. Pure photo op. Pure politics. You even got a chance to see Dole cuddle a puppy. (A sight that has to be seen to be believed. Remember Michael Dukakis in the tank? This was weirder.) During his remarks, Dole restated his support of the Americans with Disabilities Act and said he would continue efforts to protect the act from congressional attempts to water it down. Later, when he was asked about the announcement by Justin Dart, Jr. - regarded by many people with disabilities as the "father of the ADA" - that he would be voting for President Clinton, Dole's only response was, "Well, obviously he can vote for whoever he wants." Dole doesn't do cuddly very well. Is Dole simply using the disability community to advance his campaign, as quite a few critics - disabled and nondisabled - have charged? Of course he is. But at the risk of sounding even more cynical than usual, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. Using people is what politics is about, after all - and when you're seeking votes in a democratic society, it's what makes politics important. What does a Presidential candidate do to court the Jewish vote, or the Italian vote, or the youth vote? He goes to New York and puts on a yarmulka. He goes to Chicago and chows down a lot of thick-crust pizza. He goes on MTV and lets Tabitha Soren ask him a bunch of easy questions. And if he does enough of it, he forces his opponent to do the same, lest he be accused of ignoring an important group of voters. Thus, the group being courted - and the voters belonging to that group - becomes an important force in the democratic process. Hell, I'm waiting for Clinton to find a puppy of his own to cuddle, or to take a ride in a scooter with CNN looking on, or to do something equally goofy. If both the Democratic and Republican candidates start jumping through hoops for our benefit, we'll know we've arrived. Go to tomorrow's report. Go to yesterday's report.

The GOP is working the disability angle, and working it hard. Tonight's highlight: Elizabeth Dole parading back and forth in front of the podium, clutching a microphone in one hand and "bonding" with the audience. She's obviously been taking lessons from the Sally Jesse Raphael School of Communications . . . putting her arm around a wheelchair user in the front row and telling the convention what an "inspiration" he is . . . telling the story of her husband's injury, how he was totally paralyzed until he "willed himself" to walk again, how he owes so much of his recovery to one of his teachers, who refused to let him lie around and feel sorry for himself . . . Didn't we see this once on "The Fact of Life"? Or was it "Diff'rent Strokes"? It was on a "very special episode" of something, I know that much. Welcome to the world of the Inspirational Cripple. Mrs. Dole's performance tonight was a sharp contrast to her husband's remarks to San Diegans with disabilities the day before. Bob Dole wouldn't have dared call his audience "an inspiration." His remarks were all about civil rights and self-empowerment - Mrs. Dole's, on the other hand, was the same old same-old about how success is merely a matter of taking a positive attitude and "overcoming" our disabilities. Which, of course, is what most ABs - and not just AB Republicans - want desperately to believe. During the roll call of delegates (which is just as tedious in person as it is on TV, by the way), I sat chatting with one of the convention's security guards, a young black man who, like many of the people working the convention, is a Republican. Nevertheless, he was getting weary of the constant parade of African-American success stories designed, apparently, to show the electorate that the GOP could be just as prone to white guilt as the Democrats. "Miracles do happen," he said, referring to people who, through their own effort, overcome their own circumstances and raised themselves out of poverty, "but they're rare. And for every one there are others who cannot get out." That's why they're called miracles, after all. Of course, the Republicans would counter by saying the reasons so many people are trapped in poverty are that government programs discourage them from working and that "Hollywood anti-heroes" (another popular catch-phrase around here) encourage personal irresponsibility. And a fair number of people with disabilities would probably agree with that sentiment. Anyone who's ever dealt with SSI/SSDI income restrictions knows what a work disincentive is. And how many times have we seen ourselves depicted in movies and on TV as helpless and pathetic? But there's a long way to go from here to believing that prejudice and discrimination are all a matter of "attitude." On top of the sign for the Alaska delegation there sits a stuffed animal. I had to look twice before realizing that it was supposed to be a polar bear. At first I thought it was a stuffed baby harp seal. Go to tomorrow's report. Go to yesterday's report.

I roll up to the Convention Center this morning, and . . . eek . . . between me and the metal detectors there lies an angry throng of abortion protesters. Two throngs, actually - one pro-life, the other pro-choice. And both of them are angrier than shit. Now, my usual response when I see large throngs of angrier-than-shit people is to get as far away as I can as fast as I can - especially when they're angry about abortion, an issue which just seems to bring out the worst in both sides. But I had no choice this time. I was going to have to plow right through them. It'd be cool if I could say I went in at ramming speed, swinging my detachable footrests with kneecap-shattering accuracy and cutting a bloody swath through the sea of fanaticism - but no such luck. This crowd did what every crowd does when it sees me coming: It parted before me like the friggin' Red Sea, that's what. Normally, I find this quite convenient - I just wish it made for better copy, that's all. One thing's for sure: You won't be hearing much about abortion within the convention hall itself. There's been little or none of the Family Values rhetoric that scared voters away from the GOP in 1992. Hell, even Pat Robertson is telling everyone that the abortion plank in the platform doesn't matter and that the real issues are taxes and welfare reform. If I hear the word "tolerant" one more time, I'm going to start wondering if I'm at Woodstock. Of course, there's always the odd delegate who simply won't get with the program. Colin Powell's declaration that he is pro-choice on abortion and in favor of affirmative action was greeted with more than a few boos from the convention floor. (Did you hear them on TV, or does the Republican National Committee have a "boo-filter" set up to keep all but happy thoughts from making it out over the airwaves?) And on the way out of the Convention Center, as I was passing a gay-rights demonstration in the official "free-speech area" (a fenced-in parking lot which has been designated as a safe play area for various activist groups), I heard some woman behind me gasp with disgust and say, "I'll just bet that the media will give those faggots just as much time as Colin Powell!" Strangely enough, that little dose of narrow-minded bigotry made me feel a lot better. Too much love combined with politics and I start getting twitchy. So I guess Colin Powell is the designated Child of Immigrants for this convention. The Democrats do it, too - it's a required element for one of these shindigs, I suspect - someone's got to go to the podium and talk about the joys and travails of being a child of immigrants. I'm waiting for 50 years from now, when Senator Rrrplginflurx of Planet Zagnut 7 gets up and says, "When my parents crash-landed here, they had nothing but a few food-supplement pills and a dream. They knew the value of hard work, and that it took a strong family to raise a pouchful of eggs to full maturity. And they taught me that shedding my skin in public wasn't just illegal, it was shameful." I really, really wish the ADA helpers would leave me alone, too. They're a corps of volunteers, dressed in blue golf shirts, who roam the convention hall ready to help disabled people if they ask for it. This I don't mind - what I do mind is getting pounced on every time I look slightly lost (which is a lot of the time even under normal circumstances). "Can I help you, sir?" "Just holler if you need assistance, sir." "If there's anything I can do, sir, please feel free to ask." Yeah, there's something you can do - you can stop hovering over me like killer bees, that's what. Any much more of this and I'll start thinking they're really there to quell any Gimp uprisings before they get out of control. But then, I'm paranoid. Go to tomorrow's report. Go to yesterday's report.

It has to do with music - or the lack of it. Having Travis Tritt sing was bad enough, although I'm sure one of his fans would say that I'm just one of those freaks who don't like country-western music (which is true). The worst, though, was allowing Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott up onto the podium for that horrifyingly off-key rendition of "God Bless America." In the name of everything good and holy, WHO TOLD THAT GUY HE COULD SING??? Of course, now that I've said that, I can just see the Democrats, at their convention, resurrecting that creepy Fleetwood Mac tune that they played into the ground during the 1992 campaign. Will my alienation from the two-party system ever end? One thing I can say without alienation is that this convention has raised the profile of the disability community to a level it has never been before in the political arena. What I'd like to see now is: for the Democrats to up the ante and actually address disability issues at their convention rather than simply lump us in with other constituencies in supposed need of more liberal do-gooding; and for the disability community itself to take the ball and run with it (or roll with it, as they case may be) and become real players in the political process rather than mere backdrops for the politicians. As I said the other night, politics is about using people, and it's vital that we become as adept at using the politicians as they are at using us. I'd love to be able to attend the Democratic convention two weeks from now, in order to compare and contrast them with the GOP - in terms of accessibility, presence of people with disabilities, and the party's attentiveness to the issues that affect them. But MAINSTREAM isn't Time-Warner, and they can't exactly send me flying to Chicago just so I can sit there and post rambling screeds to the Web. Oh, well - I'll just wear my PISS ON PITY shirt while watching it on TV instead. It's the next best thing to being there. Go to yesterday's report.

The State's strong export growth shows that Victoria is the place for companies to achieve sustained growth and profitability. The Victorian Government has identified a range of key industry sectors in which it is concentrating its efforts to generate the greatest rate of sustainable economic growth for Victoria and at the same time enhancing the State's international competitiveness. The key industry sectors selected have the following characteristics: They enjoy a growing share of world trade and form a significant part of Victoria's industrial, educational and research base. These sectors are: aerospace aviation chemicals, plastics and rubber education services information technology and telecommunications pharmaceuticals scientific and medical equipment tourism waste management and recycling Each sector adds value to Victoria's existing natural resource advantages. These sectors are: food processing forest products textiles, clothing and footwear They are industries in which Victoria has a strong industrial base and which have strong linkages with sectors in the above two categories. Examples of these sectors are: automotive engineering transport and storage packaging In aggregate, the key sectors account for about 30% of Victoria's economic output. The 11 key sectors within the manufacturing sector have combined sales of $35 billion and employ 80% of Victoria's total manufacturing workforce. Exports of education services and tourism are worth $2 billion and waste management sales are around $200 million.

The key to the package is the Victorian Government's support for the activities of the Strategic Industry Research Foundation, which is forging closer links between business and the State's research bodies. A sum of $4 million has been committed to SIRF for the 1996-97 financial year. Subject to SIRF's continued success and satisfactory reporting to the Government, SIRF will receive a further $4 million in each of the following three years. Mr Birrell said "It is time to give research and technology projects a higher priority, building on Victoria's leading strengths, which is what I am committed to doing." He described SIRF as ideally positioned to identify new strategic R&D opportunities for industry, and a leading contributor to Victoria's position as Australia's top R&D location. He said that SIRF provided support for strategic research ventures, including the Australian Computing and Communications Institute, the Biomolecular Research Institute and Ceramic Fuels Cells Ltd. The second leg of the package is $200,000 in grants to eight Victorian-based Co-operative research centres (CRCs). These CRCs will work closely with a number of small to middle-sized Victorian businesses on the commercialisation of specific product development projects. These CRCs will work closely with a number of small to middle sized (SMEs) Victorian businesses on the commercialisation of specific product development projects. Typical of the partnership approach this new program encourages is the teaming up of hi tech companies Cray Research (Australia), Silicon Graphics and Auspace to work with the Southern Hemisphere Meteorology CRC to develop advanced remote sensing instrumentation for meteorology and environment management. In another example, Hawthorn-based 3DIS Pty Ltd will work with Australian Photonics CRC to develop enhancements to its successful airports perimeter control security systems products. "SMEs form the backbone of Victoria's industry base and their ability to be innovative is a crucial linchpin upon which this State's future success in international markets depends ," Mr Birrell said. "This program gives SMEs direct access to the resources of Victoria's top line R&D organisations." The successful applicants are: Southern Hemisphere Meteorology CRC in partnership with Cray Research (Australia), Silicon Graphics and Auspace;Australian Petroleum CRC in partnership with Geotechnical Systems Australia Pty Ltd; Industrial Plant Biopolymers CRC in partnership with Albright & Wilson (Aust) Ltd, Tridan; Australian Geodynamics CRC in partnership with Encom Technologies Pt Ltd;Cochlear Implant, Speech and Hearing Research CRC;Australian Photonics CRC in partnership with 3DIS Pty Ltd;Australian Maritime Research CRC: in partnership with Australian Marine and Offshore Group Pty Ltd; andCRC for Waste Management and Pollution Control in partnership with Zeolite Australia, Process Design & Fabrication Pty Ltd. Other science and technology initiatives include: A Guide to CRCs in Victoria, a directory providing detailed information about these CRCs and how firms can access their specialist knowledge and expertise; A $50,000 grant to support a Victoria-wide study on maintenance practices for SMEs; A $50,000 grant to support the efforts of the Institute of Metals and Materials Ltd (IMMA) to establish IMMAnet, a new service to provide materials engineers with specialist technical advice and information about new technologies and training initiatives; and State Government support for the Federal Government's R&D company contact program which encourages international companies to base their R&D activities in Australia.

Background Business Victoria has demonstrated, through its Quick Responseprogram, that cooperation between supply-chain partners (ie manufacturers,suppliers and retailers) can produce significant marketing benefits. Many TCF companies, looking to export markets for their futuregrowth, are discouraged by the associated high costs and risksfor individual firms. Description A pilot program will be conducted with a group of TCF firms ableto supply a complete "collection" in a selected market niche (egactive leisure wear and street wear for teenagers). The network of companies will collaborate on design (style, colour,fabrics selection to satisfy the requirements of the target market),production, costing, packaging and administration. The network will agree on a risk aversion policy (what happensif some products do not sell) and a material re-direction policy. Sampling and market trials will precede commercial production. Users The pilot program will comprise ten participating TCF firms fromBusiness Victoria's Quick Response program. Outcomes Participating firms will benefit from reduced risk through usingthe supply chain management capabilities developed through theQuick Response program. Increased efficiencies will accrue from companies working togetherto export to selected niche markets. If successful, the pilot program can be expanded into other targetmarkets and geographic areas.

The Melbourne Exhibition Centre is part of the Industry and the first majorproject to be completed under the Victorian Government's Agenda 21 program. It opened for business in February 1996 with Victoria on Show, a landmark exhibition featuring the achievements of Victoria in manufacturing, research and development, technology and much more. The Melbourne Exhibition Centre is the largest and best-equipped exhibition venue in the Southern Hemisphere. It provides a world class facility for Victorian, Australian and international businesses and industries to showcase their strengths, and reinforces Melbourne's position as the trade and public exhibition capital of Australia. The Melbourne Exhibition Centre provides: 30,000 square metres of clear-span exhibition space 8,000 square metres of public concourse and amenities 1,500 square metres of meeting room space 1,800 basement and ground-level car spaces on site. It caters for international, national and local exhibitions, for trade or public audiences, or a mixture of both. Close to the heart of the city and a wide range of accommodation, it offers easy access by different forms of transport. The exhibition industry in Australia is worth some $1.3 billion, with Victoria accounting for 31% of this market.

Country Victoria: the Business Environment Because Australiais located in the Asia Pacific, Australian businesses have experienceworking across both western and eastern business cultures. Asone of the world's oldest democracies, Australia enjoys economicand political stability. The country has an excellent telecommunicationssystem, at more competitive rates than in most other countriesof the Asia Pacific. Moreover, Australia occupies the same timezone as East Asia.Victoria is well located in relation to Australianmarkets and suppliers. As the most densely populated state, Victoriais at the centre of a notional triangle that accounts for 70 percent of Australia's population. With only 2.9 per cent of theland mass, Victoria is Australia's smallest mainland state, yetit accounts for roughly 25 per cent of Australia's 17.7 millionpeople. Country Victoria's competitive advantages An independent study by KPMG rated Victoria cost competitivein: industrial land; senior management labour costs; air and sea freight; telecommunications; high voltage electricity; and gas. For example, senior management costs are 25 per cent moreexpensive in Singapore than in Victoria, and 10 per cent moreexpensive in Los Angeles. International telecommunications are80 per cent higher in Singapore, 15 per cent higher in Los Angelesand more than 100 per cent higher in Bangkok than the prices chargedin Victoria.

Victoria has a dedicated, well trained workforce and a supportivebusiness environment. Melbourne, Australia's pre-eminent portand the busiest port in the Southern Hemisphere, is easily accessibleto regional Victoria. Geelong and Portland, both in the west ofthe state, offer excellent port facilities, and it is anticipatedthat by 1998 a private sector funded general cargo berth willoperate at Hastings, Victoria's deepest port. Most of countryVictoria has excellent access to international air freight andpassenger facilities at Melbourne's Tullamarine, Australia's only24-hour airport. The major cities of Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra are wellwithin reach of all regional centres in country Victoria. Thestate is also conveniently located for trading with all of theindustrial centres and markets of Australia, New Zealand and theAsia-Pacific, the world's fastest growing region. Victoria's road network is the best in the country and iscontinually being upgraded. In recent years, Victorian roads havebecome the world's safest. In much of the state, rail freightis a viable option for transporting bulk products within Victoriaand interstate. Victoria's location at the hub of the new standardgauge national rail network gives the state another advantage. Victoria's energy resources are outstanding. The reservesof natural gas are estimated to be sufficient for at least fortyyears at current consumption rates. The supply network of BassStrait natural gas to country Victoria is already extensive andwas recently extended to regional centres in south-west Victoria. Reserves of brown coal are estimated at 200,000 million tonnes,sufficient for hundreds of years at current consumption rates.Most of this coal has a low ash content, making it suitable forthe chemical industry and power generation. The coal has a lowsulphur content, and emissions are controlled. Eighty per cent of Victoria's electricity is produced by brown-coal-firedpower stations on the coal fields. The balance is generated byhydro and natural gas-fired plants. Large scale industry (around10 mega watts), can have its electricity supplied at well below industrialprices effective elsewhere. For example, electricity prices incountry Victoria are less than half those of Los Angeles and Singapore,and nearly three times cheaper than Bangkok's prices. Victoria's oil fields help make Australia largely self sufficientin oil. Geothermal power is becoming an important energy sourcealong the west coast and in Gippsland, and solar energy is widelyused in the north. In virtually all regional centres of country Victoria, suitablylocated and zoned industrial land is available, at some of themost competitive prices in the Asia Pacific. Regions will cooperatewith potential investors to develop fully serviced industrialland for specific purpose industrial development, if current provisionis not entirely suitable. Victoria's river and water storage systems offer reliablewater supplies to all the regional centres, and agriculture issupplied with water by elaborate irrigation systems in the drierareas. Some regions, such as Colac, have abundant supplies ofhigh quality water, and Victoria is well supplied by Australianstandards. Country communities are very supportive of locally-based industries,and the workforce of country Victoria is well known for reliabilityand dedication. Training and industrial reforms have increasedthe productivity, flexibility and skills of the workforce. Industries prosper in country Victoria Food processing and forestry products are the mainstays of manufacturingin country Victoria. Strengths in dairy processing (82 per centof Australian production) and in processed fruit and vegetables(52 per cent of Australian production) have contributed to a heavyconcentration of the packaging industry in the state. Major dairy manufacturers such as Snow Brand, Nestle, Kraft, Bonlacand Murray Goulburn are expanding production for Japan and otherexport markets. Similarly, fishing operations are exporting specialityfin-fish, abalone, eels and yabbies to Europe and Asia. Thriving wine markets, particularly in Holland, Britain and Scandinavia,create prospects for enormous growth of the wine industry. Theestablishment of the French wine maker, Domaine Chandon, in theYarra Valley demonstrates international interest in Victoria'swine. Increasingly, firms are investing across country Victoria in orderto manufacture non-food products. The manufacturers locatingwithin country Victoria generally have an export focus, they applysophisticated technology and they employ the skills, flexibilityand enthusiasm of their employees. Aircraft, aluminium smelting,wool processing, cement, petrochemicals and computer hardwareare examples of the diverse products being manufactured in countryVictoria. Avalon, near Geelong, is rapidly developing as a centre for theaviation and aerospace industries. Victoria is ideally placedto capture demand from the Asia-Pacific region for product, systemsand services related to the aerospace industry and the emergingmarkets for specialist products such as the GA200 agriculturalaircraft, which is built in Gippsland. Australia's automotive industry has a strong presence in Geelong,Ballarat and Bendigo, and specialist automobile components aremanufactured in other country centres. Gold provided the impetus for Victoria's growth in the mid-nineteenthcentury, and minerals continue to be important to today's economy. Coal, copper, limestone, mineral sands, clay, granite, slate,diatomite and bentonite are mined and quarried throughout thestate. Country Victoria offers excellent opportunities for processing,particularly in dairy, quality meat products (beef, sheep, porkand poultry) fruit and vegetables, wine, cereal products and confectionery. Non-traditional industries taking off In addition to traditional foods, new prima products such as greentea, native flowers, bison, emu and ostrich, sheep milk, deer,game, mulberry silk, krill and shell fish, speciality hardwoods,llama, berries, peppermint and spearmint offer great potentialfor new industries. Downstream processing of the Wimmera's vast mineral sands is consideredpractically and economically feasible, and processing of kaolindeposits in the Ballarat district could be expanded. Vast depositsof china and ball clays offer the opportunity for developmentof the ceramics porcelain tableware industry. Central Victoria's high grade silicon-based quartz and gold alsopresent investment opportunities, as do magnesium reserves fordiecasting and alloying. Victoria's beauty and variety are major tourism strengths andoffer investment opportunities in service industries. TourismVictoria's research shows that a large proportion of Australiansintend to visit Victoria's snow fields, Sovereign Hill, the PhillipIsland fairy penguins, the Twelve Apostles and other attractions.International tourism is expected to grow due to forthcoming majorevents such as the Melbourne Grand Prix and the Sydney Olympics. Outstanding quality of life Country Victoria offers its citizens an excellent quality of life.Generally, country Victoria enjoys a pleasant Mediterranean climateconducive to outdoor activities. Each region experiences fourdistinct seasons, and only the duration of each differs from oneregion to the next. Mildura and Swan Hill on the Murray Riverin the State's north, for example, enjoy more annual sunshinethan Surfers Paradise in Queensland! Recreational facilities include outstanding golf courses, goldheritage areas and superb natural environments that are idealfor horse riding and bush walking. Every town in country Victoriahas tennis courts, picnic grounds and swimming pools.

In advanced manufacturing, high-technology and international serviceindustries, victoria's skilled professionals, managers and technicallyskilled workforce offer very good value. All the professional services required by major businesses, suchas accounting, legal, banking, management consulting, staff recruitment,engineering and marketing are found in Melbourne, to the highestinternational standard. Salaries for professionals and managers are much lower than inmost other locations surveyed in the Advantage Melbourne study. The following tables demonstrate how competitive Melbourne is. Table 1 shows that salaries paid in Melbourne are lowerthan in most countries surveyed: 17% lower than Sydney, 16% lowerthan Singapore, and 17% lower than Stuttgart. Definition: The marketing director is an employee with at leastten years' experience who directs marketing and/or sales activitiesfor a company or larger division, focusing on the achievementsales and profit objectives for the current year and planningfor increased sales in subsequent years. "For a high technology production company like ours,Melbourne's skilled workforce is ideal" Shuji Miyake Managing Director Shimadzu Australia Manufacturing P/L Shimadzu Corporation is a world leader in the manufacture of scientificand medical instruments with a turnover in excess of $US1.3 billion. Its move to Melbourne is the first time in the company's 120-yearhistory that it has located a wholly-owned manufacturing plantoutside Japan. Shimadzu demonstrates considerable confidence inVictoria's suitability as a location for knowledge-based businesses. The company began manufacturing at its plant in Melbourne in May1995. Eleven assembly lines produce gas chromatographs, medicalX-ray systems and 25 other types of machines. The company is already expanding its operation in Melbourne witha new plant, adjacent to the current facility, to come on linein 1996. With the new plant in 1996, Shimadzu will be able to produce 56types of precision machinery on a total of 33 lines. Nearly 100% of production is exported, with 50-75% of its componenetssourced from Australian companies. Shimadzu chose Victoria over alternative Asian locations becauseof the State's greater availability of skilled labour, a vitalelement for making precision- measuring equipment, and the readyavailability of local materials and components. Salaries paid to chief executives in Melbourne compare favourably:15% lower than Singapore, 28% lower than Hong Kong, and 36% lowerthan Shanghai.

Commercial R&D is also concentrated in Victoria, whichprovides38% of national business R&D. Victoria leads Australiain expenditure on R&D by private organisations and in totalgovernment expenditure (State and Commonwealth). In 1992-93, 91% of Victoria's business R&D was carried outfor two industries essential for the State's future ecinomic growth:Manufacturing (71%) and computer software (20%). Victoria hasbeen Australia's leading State for manufacturing R&D sincethe 1980s and expenditure in this area has increased by 182% from$289 million in 1984-85 to $815 million in 1992-93. Over thesame period, expenditure on software R&D has risen from $13million to $226 million. Victoria's universities and technical colleges are important contributorsto the State's R&D effort. Victorian companies and researchinstitutes have considerable research and development strengths,particularly in the areas of food, paper, chemicals and petroleum,transport equipment, electrical equipment and biotechnology. For a company to establish an R&D center in a particular location,they have to be confident that a number of key non-cost factorsare satisfied. These include: The quality of staff the availability of suitably qualified staff the dtrength of the supporting institutional environment, eg,the universities and the availability of technology parks the supportiveness of the taxation regime KPMG asked major firms with global operations to rank other sitiescompared to Melbourne according to these criteria on a responserange from minus 3 to plus 3.

The industry provides goods and services to the Australian Department of Defence and major international companies such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell and Airbus Industrie. Aerospace exports reached $555 million in 1994/95, the main markets being the USA, New Zealand and the UK. Victoria contributed exports of $163 million. Imports were $1442 million, with around 80 % of this total coming from the USA. Expenditure on R&D associated with aircraft manufacturing increased from $7 million to $57 million in the four years to 1992/93. Victoria About half of Australia's aerospace industry is located in Victoria. The sector is characterised by companies which are export-oriented, internationally competitive and with high quality standards. An aerospace precinct has been established in the Fishermens Bend area of Port Melbourne. Located here are the Rockwell, Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) and Hawker de Havilland plants, Australia's most important aeronautical research organisation - the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory - and Australia's largest aeronautical education institution, RMIT Aerospace. Ansett Australia and Qantas Airways have large maintenance bases at Melbourne Airport. About 150 other small companies service the major players. Further south Avalon Airport, near Geelong, provides ideal facilities for aircraft assembly, maintenance and refits as well as aviation training. Avalon is the venue for Australia's premier aerospace and aviation event, the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace Expo.

Industry capacity includes business, tourism, marketing and infrastructure services together with complementary service transport access to major airports, and the long-term enhancement of airport potential through appropriate planning and environmental management. Victoria The two major Australian airlines, Qantas and Ansett, along with other aviation activities including airport operation employ around 12,000 people in Victoria. Melbourne is emerging as a major centre for the industry in the Asia-Pacific region. Ansett Airlines is headquartered in Melbourne. In 1994/95, Melbourne Airport handled 10 million domestic passengers, an increase of 12 % on the previous year, 2 million international passengers and generated a record profit of $52 million before tax and interest. Airports at Moorabbin and Essendon provide general aviation services, while Avalon is part-owned and leased by ASTA and serves as a freight and maintenance centre and as an airport.

The sector includes plastics, rubber products, paint, soap and cosmetics. The sector excludes pharmaceuticals which is treated as a distinct sector below. The CPR sector has rebounded strongly during the economic recovery. Growing consumer spending and the upturn in the building cycle have lifted demand for plastics, paints and other chemical products. Strong sales growth has reduced excess capacity over the last three years. Over the past ten years, output growth has averaged 3 %. During the 1990s, both exports and imports have increased strongly. CPR exports reached $2.1 billion in 1994/95. Victoria The CPR sector accounts for over 3% of Victoria's economy. Reflecting the capital intensive nature of the sector, employment of around 30,000 is somewhat lower as a proportion of total employment at around 1.5%. Victoria produces around 37% of Australia's CPR output, reflecting its advantages of competitively priced power, natural gas and feedstocks. The head offices of many of the major companies involved in the industry are located in Victoria, including BTR Nylex, ICI, Kemcor, Pacific Dunlop, Montell and Hoechst. The CPR sector is sensitive to cost competitiveness and is adjusting to lower levels of protection. Productivity has risen strongly during the 1990s reflecting extensive structural reform but there is still further to go to catch up to the world's most efficient CPR operations. CPR exports from Victoria are around $700 million, having doubled in the past five years. The main exports are paints, plastics, tyres and basic chemicals. Victoria is a major centre for research and development activity. R&D spending by CPR industries (including spending by the petroleum refining industry) in Victoria in 1992/93 was $127 million or 47% of the national total. The Victorian Government worked with the major international petrochemical companies which comprise the Altona Chemical Complex in Melbourne to streamline existing regulation in Victoria and introduce international best practice regulation. Prospects The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected the CPR sector to grow at 4 % over the next ten years. A range of investment opportunities currently exist in the areas of natural gas-based chemicals, petrochemicals and downstream CPR processing.

Australia has 3 million school students and 0.6 million students in higher education as well as 1.1 million technical and further education students. Although the education sector's share of the national economy has tended to level out after increasing in the 1960s and 1970s, the demand for higher education services has continued to increase because of rising participation rates. Around 30% of students now undertake post-school studies compared with 10% a decade ago. The quality of the education system is sufficient to attract students from overseas. Education exports have grown from virtually a zero base a decade ago strongly over the past decade and are worth around $2.1 billion. Around half of the $2.1 billion represents education fees and the other half is spending on other goods and services. The number of full-fee paying overseas students in Australia increased from about 2,000 in 1986 to 70,000 by 1994, comprising around 8,800 in schools, 46,600 in universities, 5,300 in other post secondary education institutions, 2,600 in TAFE colleges undertaking degree level courses and 6,500 in English language intensive courses run at higher education institutions and TAFE colleges. Australia earns around $50 million from the overseas provision of education services. Overseas projects in education services involve the delivery of projects offshore using Australian management and teaching/training experts. These projects typically take place in Asia-Pacific countries and are paid for by loans to the nation concerned from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. Victoria Victoria has a relatively high participation rate in upper secondary education compared with the other states and the number of higher education students is at a record high. In 1994, there were 21,000 fee-paying students from overseas undertaking courses in Victoria, some 30% of the national total. Most were from Asia, particularly Hong Kong, Malaysia, the People's Republic of China and Singapore. Exports of educational services from Victoria are around $650 million, equal to 50% of spending by foreign tourists in the state. While the full-fee paying overseas students market is the major export earner, overseas projects involving the packaging of education and training services for delivery in other countries earns around $20 million a year. Several Victorian educational institutions are involved in joint ventures with educational institutions overseas to conduct courses for students in their own countries. Increasing numbers of institutions and companies are also involved in joint arrangements to provide technical, trade and other workforce-related educational services offshore. Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria (OPCV) manages a number of aid-funded overseas projects relating to training services and education systems through strategic alliances with education and training organisations. In response to the demand from developing countries for access to quality tertiary education and the need to keep costs down, television based distance learning has recently been marketed overseas by Open Learning Agency, a Monash University-led consortium. Prospects Australia has around 1% of the world market for overseas students which is estimated at US$100 billion a year. Scope for export expansion lies mainly in the Asia Pacific region. Innovative programs in telecommunications and distance learning are being developed and delivered by some Australian organisations. Opportunities also exist in providing equipment and software relating to publishing and information technology. The education and training needs of Asian countries vary enormously and are impacted upon by the various cultural, economic, political and social conditions of each country. Those markets which have up to now delivered large number of students to Australia are increasingly demonstrating their desire to develop their own educational infrastructure. In this context, joint ventures with Asian educators will become increasingly important.

Hardware is the largest single market sector ($4.5 billion), followed by services ($3.0 billion), data communications equipment ($2.7 billion) and software packages ($1.7 billion). A high proportion of hardware is imported although Australia's exports are growing. Software and services generate considerable income in Australia and are expected to grow strongly. The telecommunications industry generated carrier revenues of $15 billion in 1995. Equipment sales to telecom operators were worth $5 billion, with much of this sourced locally. Telecommunications services and equipment are expected to grow from $1 billion in 1995 to $3 billion by the year 2000. Australia is increasingly recognised as a location from which to undertake manufacturing, research and development and service activities associated with the information technology and telecommunications industry. It is a cost competitive location. Australia is a net importer of telecom and computer equipment and services but exports have grown rapidly. Australia exports $700 million of telecom equipment and $700 million of telecom services. Computer exports are around $1800 million of computers and computer parts and $200 million of computer services. Victoria The information technology and telecommunications sector is likely to be one of the fastest growing sectors in Victoria and Australia throughout the 1990s. Eight of the 12 main computer and telecommunications hardware manufacturers in Australia have production facilities in Victoria. The IBM computer manufacturing plant at Wangaratta is the largest in Australia. The technologies underpinning the information technology and telecommunications industries are converging and software is increasingly important to both. Victoria has a strong base of specialist software developers and education and training facilities. Victoria's tertiary institutions supply over one-third of Australia's annual graduates in computing and electrical/electronics engineering. Victoria has an extensive research and development infrastructure, which underpins much of Australia's reputation in this sector. Victorian Government established and funded bodies such as the Collaborative Information Technology Research Institute (CITRI), the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) and the Australian Computing and Communications Institute (ACCI), all located in Melbourne, have strong capabilities in advanced computing and communication technologies. Victoria is responsible for some 70% of Australia's expenditure on telecommunications research and development , with Telstra Corporation, Australia's largest telecommunications operator, locating its 550 person research laboratories in Melbourne, where over $60 million is spent annually. Major computing and telecommunications equipment suppliers including, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Ericsson, Nokia Telecommunications, Philips, Fujitsu, NEC and Siemens all have manufacturing and/or R&D establishments in Melbourne, where most of Australia's optical fibre is also produced. Recent investments by Oracle Systems Australia, IBM & Olivetti will total $267 million over five years. Victorian industry will be a significant beneficiary of the plans underway to build a state of the art broadband network to deliver a range of advanced entertainment and interactive services. Telstra Corporation is spending $3.3 billion on network modernisation throughout Australia. Telstra has also announced plans to spend $4.1 billion to build a hybrid fibre and coaxial cable network to deliver a range of entertainment and interactive services. Telstra has entered into a joint venture with the News Corporation, FOXTEL, to deliver entertainment and interactive services. FOXTEL has opened its national customer sales and service centre in Melbourne, and it will eventually employ 1000 people. Optus Vision, a consortium of Optus Communications, Continental Cablevision Inc. and Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, has also announced plans to invest $3 billion on its cable roll-out for the delivery of entertainment and interactive services. Victorian industry will supply all of the coaxial cable that will be used in both the Telstra and Optus Vision roll-outs and the bulk of the fibre optic cable that Telstra and Optus will require for their network upgrading and expansion. Prospects The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected sales of communications services to average growth of 7 % through to 2005. Domestic production of telecom equipment and computers is also projected to increase at 7 %. Spending on services and software is expected to continue to outpace spending on hardware in both the global and Australian markets and this trend has the potential to advantage Australian companies. In the emerging multimedia industry, Australia and Victoria are well placed to provide content for the local and world markets for the new entertainment and interactive services offered by cable TV.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing employs 11,000 people. Sales of pharmaceuticals produced in Australia are $3 billion. Sales have grown strongly throughout the 1990s reflecting the availability of new drugs, the shift in prescribing patterns towards those drugs, growth in utilisation and ageing of the population. Under an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government, known as Factor F, pharmaceutical manufacturers receive an imputed price increase to compensate for constriction of overall pricing by government purchasing monopoly if firms agree to meet increased local value adding and export and R&D targets. Under the scheme, spending on R&D by the pharmaceutical industry reached 7% of turnover in 1992/93 compared with 3% in 1988/89. Exports of pharmaceuticals have doubled over the past five years to around $900 million. Victoria Victoria's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry employs about 3,500 people. Victoria has about 40% of national production, the industry having been developed alongside an internationally recognised biomedical and scientific research and development base. Strong interconnecting links exist between pharmaceutical companies, universities and specialised consultants. Victoria exports around $300 million of pharmaceuticals. The major destinations for exports were New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Victoria also supply markets in the rest of Australia. Prospects The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected average sales growth for Australia's pharmaceutical firms of 4 %. Exports are expected to continue to grow strongly. The government is currently reviewing the Factor F scheme as part of its inquiry into the pharmaceutical industry. The Industry Commission released a draft report on the industry in March and the Government is expected to announce its response later in 1996.

Products exported included medical equipment, measuring instruments, spectrometers and other instruments for chemical analysis. Victoria Victoria has established a significant presence in the rapidly growing international market for scientific and medical equipment. Victoria's strong research and development base provides a platform for further growth. The major products manufactured by local firms include laboratory spectrophotometers and chromatography equipment, environmental monitoring equipment, hospital equipment, surgical instruments, physiotheraphy equipment, orthopaedic appliances and artificial limbs. Sales of scientific and medical equipment manufacturers in Victoria are around 40% of national turnover. While imports supply a significant proportion of the local market for scientific and medical equipment, local firms are export-oriented. Exports from Victoria are around $150 million, representing about one third of total sales. Some of the larger companies located in Victoria include Varian Techtron Australia, Selby Scientific, SGE International, GBC Scientific Equipment, Australian Biomedical Corporation, Denyers and Hendicare Hospital Equipment. Prospects The world market for scientific and medical instruments is growing rapidly with a large number of product niches emerging. The achievement of the sector's growth potential in Victoria will require continued research to develop new technology and an ability to commercialise this technology. The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected sales growth for Australian firms to average 6 % over the period to 2005/6.

The number of foreign tourist visits to Australia has also doubled since 1987 and is approaching 4 million per year. Sales to foreigners by Australian transport operators are an additional $2.3 billion. Foreign tourism contributes just over 2% of national GDP compared with domestic tourist spending of $15 billion or 3% of GDP. The rapid growth of foreign tourism began with a decline in the Australian dollar in the mid 1980s and has benefited from economic expansion in Asia and improved marketing by the Australian tourism industry. More tourist visits are originating from Asia. Japan is the major source of tourists (30% of the total). Other Asian countries now account for 25% of the total. The number of tourists from New Zealand, Europe and North America is rising more slowly. Victoria Spending by both foreign and interstate tourists in Victoria is around $2.3 billion or 2% of Gross State Product (GSP). Spending by foreign tourists accounts for 40% of the total and domestic tourism makes up the remaining 60%. In 1995, Victoria attracted 800,000 visitors from overseas and almost 3 million visitors from other Australian states. Foreign tourist visits have consistently grown faster than domestic tourism since the mid 1980s. Victoria has over 30,000 hotel and motel rooms. Renewed growth in domestic tourist visits to Victoria combined with the on-going growth in overseas tourism lifted takings from accommodation in Victoria in 1994/95 to $493 million, a 12 % real increase on the previous year. Investment in the hotels and other tourism projects in Victoria has rebounded and is set to increase further over the next few years. The construction of the Melbourne Casino hotel and other new tourism-related projects and events such as the Grand Prix will see investment activity return to high levels during 1996 and 1997. Prospects The Bureau of Tourism Research projected overseas tourist visits to average growth of 7% over the rest of the 1990s and reach six million by the year 2000. Rapid economic growth in Asia is expected to be the main driving force behind the expected growth in tourism.

Manufacturing industries in Australia spend over $1 billion on environmental protection and pollution abatement. The biggest spenders are the steel, aluminium, chemicals and building materials industries. Investment in sewerage systems in Australia over the next ten years is estimated at $13 billion. Increasingly, work undertaken for public authorities is being outsourced which will lead to greater opportunities for private companies and consortia to be involved in the provision of infrastructure/services relating to waste water and sewerage systems. The growing commitment to ecologically sustainable development is creating new markets, both locally and internationally, for environmental goods and services. Government and higher education institutions dominate environmental R&D spending. In 1992-93 they spent $138 million compared with business spending of $39 million. Currently 35 public and private companies in Australia export environmental technology and expertise with estimated exports of $250-300 million. Victoria The existence of Melbourne as both a major population and economic centre, with its attendant waste management requirements, has resulted in numerous environmental industries either being based in Victoria or having a strong presence in the State. Victorian manufacturing firms spent almost $300 million on environmental protection and pollution abatement. Around 800 manufacturing establishments sell or produce environment protection goods and services. Recycling of post-industrial and post-consumer waste such as cardboard, plastics, scrap tyres and metal employs over 5,000 people, with an estimated capital investment of $1.5 billion. Commodities such as paper, cardboard, glass, metals and some plastics are converted into value-added products with ready markets. Companies based in Victoria such as Sinclair Knight, Kinhill Engineers, GH & D have developed a diverse range of waste management technologies and services both internationally and locally. Exports of waste materials from Victoria are $30 million. Firms supplying consultancy services and specialised technology are well placed to increase exports, especially in relation to waste water treatment plants and potable water. Future investment in Victoria's waste management and recycling capacity include the construction by Amcor Australian Paper of a $50 million high technology waste paper recycling centre in the suburb of Fairfield. Prospects The international demand for environmental protection services is expected to increase rapidly with estimates that Australia's exports in this sector will increase to around $1 billion by the year 2000. A major potential market is Asia which the World Bank estimates will need to spend at least $200 billion in the next decade on waste control. Exports of recyclable waste materials such as beverage containers, glass, iron, lead, plastics and precious metals from Australia are worth $250 million and there is considerable scope for further growth. The demand for environmental consultancy services should further expand as the need for firms to have accredited environment management systems in place increases.

Australia exports $12 billion of food products. Food and beverage production has expanded strongly during the 1990s. Productivity has risen strongly as spare productive capacity has been used up and efficiency improvements have been put in place although there is further scope for productivity improvements. Innovation among producers and spending on R&D is increasing. Growth in domestic food consumption has been exceeded by growth in export sales. Exports of foods products have increased on average by 10% over the past three years, including even higher growth in dairy products and fruit and vegetables. National investment by the food and beverages sector is rebounding strongly from a downturn during the early 1990s recession to meet increased sales in both the domestic and export markets. Spending over the past few years has been about 50 % above the average sustained during the 1980s. Victoria Victoria contributes 33% of Australia's food and beverage manufacturing value-added, compared with around 25% of national food consumption. Spending on R&D by the food and beverages industry in Victoria is around 36% of the national total. Victoria dominates the manufacture of dairy products, fruit and vegetables, cakes and biscuits, confectionery and pet food. While more than 1000 food processing companies operate in Victoria, the largest 20 companies generate 50% of total food industry turnover and 70% of employment. The 12 largest exporters account for 75% of Victoria's food exports. The ten largest food companies in the world have food processing plants in Australia, the majority being located in Victoria, including H.J.Heinz, Kraft Foods, Cadbury Schweppes, EFFEM (Mars and Uncle Ben's), Bunge, Snow Brand, Campbell's Soups and Nestl�. Food and beverage exports in 1995 were $3 billion or 25 % of national food exports, although this was understated because of a drought in that year which reduced cereal production. The main exports are dairy products, meat, cereals and fruit and vegetables. Victoria's food exports go mainly to Asia, particularly Japan. More than $700 million has been invested or committed recently in the industry, mainly for export sales. Key investors include Kraft ($100 million), Nestl� Confectionery ($60 million), Cadbury Schweppes, Bonlac, Murray Goulburn and Snow Brand. Prospects There is great potential to add further value to the State's agricultural production, particularly for export-oriented processed food manufacturing. The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected sales growth for food to average 3 % through to 2005. The fastest growth is expected in meat, milk products and fruit and vegetables The positive outlook for the industry is due to Australia's comparative advantage in food production, rapid growth in Asian markets and more aggressive and competitive Australian producers.

Output of paper and paper products, including printing, have increased strongly since mid-1993 reflecting increased demand for paper packaging and containers. Production of wood and wood products has declined since 1994 due to the downturn in residential construction. Australia exports $1.1 billion of forest products. Exports of forest products have increased on average by 10% over the past three years, including strong growth in the export of wood. Victoria Victoria's forest products industry has sales of about $3 billion and employs 15,000 people. Victoria accounts for 34% of national paper and fibreboard container production, 29% of furniture production and 21% of wood and wood products output. The hardwood timber industry continues to undergo extensive restructuring and reinvestment. Long-term contracts have facilitated restructuring and a shift toward greater value-adding for both import substitution and export. Softwood timber production has increased as the softwood plantation resource has matured. The pulp and paper industry in Victoria is dominated by Australian Paper, a division of Amcor, which has pulp and paper manufacturing plants at Maryvale (the largest in Australia), Fairfield and Broadford. Pratt Industries manufactures cardboard boxes at its Coolaroo and Reservoir facilities. Bowater manufactures tissue products at its Box Hill plant and mechanical pulp at Myrtleford. Australian Newsprint Mills at Albury and Kimberley Clark at Millicent in South Australia are significant users of Victoria's forest resources. Exports of forest products, consisting mainly of woodchips and pulp, were $250 million in 1995. Pulp and paper exports are mainly destined for New Zealand and woodchips are mainly sold to Japan. Prospects The sawn timber industry remains largely dependent for sales on residential construction activity, although opportunities do exist and are being pursued for increased sales in the international market and for import replacement. Amcor has committed $380 million for expansion of the Maryvale Paper Mill. Other projects include a $70m MDF plant at Dominance Timber Industries, Wangaratta and a $50m box plant at Pratt Industries, Dandenong. The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected that sales of wood and paper products will grow at just over 3% through to 2005-6.

Domestic production employs around 70,000 people and contributes 0.5 % of GDP. The Australian textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry is becoming more export-oriented. Wool processing and textiles have benefited from increased foreign investment and the associated increase in value-added exports. Total TCF exports from Australia are around $1.4 billion. Global trade in textiles and clothing has been growing rapidly and this is forecast to continue with the phased abolition of the Multifibre Agreement and increased demand in Asia for final and intermediate textile, clothing and footwear goods. The clothing and footwear sector continues to rationalise in response to reduced tariffs and increased overseas competition. Victoria Victoria dominates national production of textile, clothing, footwear and leather products. The 1,500 TCF establishments in Victoria produce half of the national output, and generate about 1 % of Victoria's GSP. Employment is around 35,000. The clothing and footwear sector has adjusted since the late 1980s to lower protection and has lifted its productivity. The industry situation has stabilised during the current economic upturn due to a lift in the domestic market and growth in exports. Exports have increased strongly in the 1990s, to be worth around $600 million. The main exports are leather, fabrics and clothing. Recent investments have reinforced Geelong as a major wool processing centre supplemented by other investments by Godfrey Hirst (carpet manufacturer) and Geelong Wool Combing. Other investments include a $90m polyester and fibre filament plant by Leading Synthetics. Prospects The Department of Employment, Education and Training projects growth in the sales of Australian TCF manufactures over the period to 2005/6 to average 1 %. Exports are expected to grow strongly with most of the increase in the textiles industry as a result of continuing foreign direct investment into the Australian wool-processing industry.

It is increasingly focusing on exports ($1.5 billion), given the small scale of domestic production (around 300,000 units per annum). Reduced protection has been a significant factor in the large increase in automotive exports and imports over the past decade. Under the current arrangements, the effective rate of protection on Australian-made motor vehicles and parts will fall from 25% in 1996 to 15% by 2001. Tariff and related arrangements for the passenger motor vehicle industry post 2000 are to be reviewed. The automotive industry has a well-established hierarchical structure of car makers, component producers and a third layer consisting of the suppliers to the component producers. The automotive sector is a major contributor to Australian research and development. In 1992/93, spending on R&D was $166 million, equivalent to 6% of total business spending on R&D and the third largest sectoral component after computer software and electronic equipment. A significant proportion of spending was on tooling up new models. The industry provides leadership to the rest of the manufacturing sector in the adoption of new manufacturing technologies such as robotics and computer-aided design and engineering. Automotive sector output in Victoria has grown solidly over the past few years and profits in 1995 were historically high. Victoria Victoria accounts for 65% of Australia's automotive industry production. Ford Australia and Toyota Australia are based in Victoria as are the majority component manufacturers. General Motors-Holden Australia has its headquarters, engineering designs and development activities in Melbourne. In order to secure its future, the industry is increasingly looking to exports as the world industry restructures and niche markets become more important. Exports of automotive products which reached $900 million in 1995 are being boosted in 1996 by exports to the Middle East of Toyota Camrys built at Altona. Productivity has increased as a result of better work practices and more efficient organisational structures. Compared with the 1980s, output levels have increased while employment is 20% lower. Components produced in Victoria include pressed metal components, aluminium engine castings, upholstery leather, vehicle security systems, panel instrumentation, air conditioners and plastic mouldings as well as more elaborately transformed products such as complete engines, instruments, drive shafts, lighting and braking systems. Almost $1.5 billion of new investment has recently been commenced or announced by Fort and Toyota, along with components manufacturers Air International and Robert Bosch (Aust.). Prospects The trend in the world automotive industry for niche markets will give Victorian manufacturers increased opportunities to compete internationally. Under the tariff phase-down policy, automotive exports are expected to double by 2000. The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected Australian motorvehicle and parts production to average growth of 3 % through to 2005/6. Domestic sales are expected to grow slowly and exports to increase strongly.

Exports of metal products and equipment have increased strongly over recent years to reach $4.7 billion. Exports of engineering services by Australian companies have increased to $200 million. R&D spending by the engineering sector (including basic non-ferrous metals) in 1992/93 was $410 million. Victoria The manufacturing part of the engineering sector has turnover in excess of $8 billion and employs 48,000 people in Victoria, with 34,000 of these in basic engineering, mainly in fabricated metal products, and 14,000 employed in industrial machinery and equipment. Engineering services employs around 5,000. Victoria has around 20% of national iron and steel production, compared with 30% of national fabricated metals production and 34% of industrial machinery and equipment. The tendency for local firms to be smaller and less specialised than those overseas offers some advantages. Victorian firms are increasingly competitive in short production runs for specialised machinery. They can use this experience to exploit a market niche for short run production. Victoria has well developed engineering skills in areas such as automotive tooling and the production of special purpose machinery. Victoria's cost competitive automotive tooling sector is becoming increasingly export conscious. Engineering exports from Victoria are around $1.3 billion, the main products including steel, metal products and machinery. Rapid economic development in Asia will provide export opportunities for Victoria's consulting engineers and for local engineering companies as suppliers or collaborative partners. R&D spending by the engineering sector in Victoria in 1992/93 was $115 million or 28% of the Australian total. Prospects The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected equipment production to grow by 5 % through to 2005/6, metal products to also grow at 5 % compared with only 1 % for steel production. Investment opportunities are available for the engineering sector to provide production equipment and tooling, ancillary equipment to major equipment manufacturers overseas, general process equipment and refurbishing and engineering services. The sectors most likely to require these inputs are automotive, processed food, TCF, CPR, waste management and forest products.

Road transport is the dominant mode in terms of its contribution to the economy followed by air transport which has grown rapidly since deregulation occurred in the 1980s. Productivity has increased significantly in the 1990s but needs to improve further to catch up to world's best practice levels of operation. Rail, which is undergoing restructuring to lift its capacity to compete, is most competitive over long distances carrying freight such as coal, ores, quarry products, grain and petroleum products. In non-bulk categories, rail faces fierce competition from road transport which has grown strongly in recent years. Air plays a significant role in transporting goods that are of high value and are time sensitive. Australian shipping operations are being restructured along with reform of port services. Victoria Victoria is the transport hub of south-east Australia acting as the national distribution centre for major manufacturing and retail chains. It is committed to making the best use of its national rail network (with excellent links to the port), its interstate and instrastate highways, its curfew-free airport and the largest port in the southern hemisphere, by developing further links to build a totally integrated transport hub. This involves 12 special national roads projects, interstate links, the City Link road project, ring roads planned, the Dock Link heavy duty road linking rail to the port, and upgrading of the airport. Support for the use of electronic commerce will assist the integration of these transport services. Prospects The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected air transport to grow at 7 %. Solid growth is also expected for road freight. The growth prospects for rail and sea transport in Victoria depend on the their becoming more competitive. Growth opportunities exist in the transport and storage industry itself, and for industries dependent upon access to an effective transport service.

The raw material sector employs 20,000 and the converting sector 30,000. The industry has restructured to compete internationally. There are now only two major manufactures of corrugated boxes, six commercial can companies, and only one glass manufacturer. Australian-owned companies are becoming global with acquisitions or joint ventures in USA, Europe and Asia. Victoria Most of the head offices of packaging companies are in Victoria. Prospects Opportunities exist in all parts of the industry: import replacements - currently packaging imports are worth over $1 billion; paperboard exports to box plants in Asia could increase; increasing expertise and technology with a view to reducing weight, ensuring environmentally sound materials and practices and rationalising size along the lines of the canning industry; packaging in other growth industries such as food for export markets using innovative materials.

R&D strengths The centre has three major research programs: Stratospheric Ozone. The establishment of the CRC recognised the need to provide government with improved scientific advice on this important environmental issue. The centre's research on ozone concentrates on developing a basis for prediction of the state of stratospheric ozone on time scales of a few weeks to decades. Data is used from orbiting satellites for ozone retrievals and modelling. Global Transport Modelling. This program aims to develop a better knowledge of the processes that determine the atmospheric budgets of the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The CRC is modelling greenhouse gas concentrations, improving transport models and improving mathematical techniques for deducing sources from concentrations. Climate Dynamics and Climate Variability. This research program aims to develop an improved scientific basis for the institutional climate and modelling programs. Fundamental research is undertaken into the Southern Hemisphere general circulation to provide a firm basis for work on climate prediction and forecasts of such phenomena as monsoons, mid-latitude storms, El Nino warm events and droughts. Successes Recent successes include involvement of CRC scientists in the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change and development of new methods for analysing and predicting stratospheric ozone variations. Commercial significance of work The three research areas have strong commercial implications. Systems for forecasting surface UVB radiation exposure and for modelling the impacts of CFCs and other chemicals on the ozone layer are under development.Understanding the global budgets of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will inform regulations on gas emissions.Understanding the predictability of weather and climate, including droughts and other natural climate variations, will have an enormous impact on agriculture. Why Victoria? Victoria is the centre for atmospheric science in Australia, with major research institutions such as the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research located in Melbourne. It provided the obvious base for this CRC. Training and education The education program includes graduate student research opportunities leading to MSc and PhD degrees across the whole field of atmospheric sciences, a comprehensive coursework MSc in Meteorology, links to undergraduate courses, meteorology units for primary and secondary schools, and continuing professional education activities in meteorology.

The CRC carries out geoscience and engineering research for the Australian petroleum exploration and production industry. Its activities are primarily focused on Australia, but some research is carried out overseas in countries such as New Zealand, PNG and Indonesia. R&D strengths The centre pursues seven research programs: petroleum exploration technologies, petroleum geophysics, basin analysis, reservoir characterisation, improved oil recovery, drilling and wellbore engineering, and reservoir testing and stimulation (including coal bed methane).The CSIRO's Division of Petroleum Resources has a major geomechanics laboratory with triaxial compression test cells and a polyaxial load cell, an X-ray CT Scanner for core analysis as well as conventional core test facilities, a mini-hydraulic fracturing system for field tests, and a slim hole well test system. Successes Technological successes with major implications for the efficiency of Australia's petroleum industry include: novel analytical tests to help petroleum explorers identify the most prospective areas for exploration; a potential solution to the problem of multiple attenuation which afflicts much of the seismic survey information collected on the North West Shelf; a breakthrough in the quantitative description of the heterogeneity of reservoir properties measured by well logs; demonstration of effective methods for the hydraulic fracturing of Australian coal seams to stimulate coal bed methane production; development of effective tools for analysing and solving wellbore instability problems that present significant challenges to drilling; development of new insights into the mechanics of three-phase displacement in porous media, which will allow better design of improved recovery projects; development of a three-phase multicomponent reservoir simulation program (SIMED II) designed specifically for coal bed methane work, that is as good as or better than any in the world. Commercial significance of work All of the research programs have industry sponsorship to some degree. In almost all cases the end product is a service, but in rare cases the outcome is a product, such as the SIMED II program.In this case the program has been leased to a customer as a precursor to a likely sale, and negotiations with likely overseas customers are in progress. Export earnings have already been generated from research contracts with overseas companies. Why Victoria? Historically, petroleum resources have been located on the eastern side of the continent and oil exploration companies have been headquartered in Melbourne. Training and education A high level of integration of postgraduate education and research activity has been achieved in the centre. All research thesis students work on projects that fit within one of the centre's programs. The postgraduate degree programs, available at universities in Perth, Sydney and Adelaide, are primarily based on a research thesis.Training courses or workshops are organised by participants ranging from in-house courses presented to a single company to courses with a mixed attendance of industry personnel and post-graduate students. Courses are also conducted in South-East Asia.

These are used in a large range of industries including food manufacturing, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, paints, ceramics and oil drilling. A major aim is to develop a commercial process to produce biopolymers using plant cell culture. R&D strengths Biopolymers are molecules composed mainly of carbohydrates with some protein. Most commercial biopolymers are obtained from tree exudates, seeds and seaweeds. Their availability and performance are unreliable. Plant cell culture offers the potential to produce similar biopolymers of consistently high quality and function. The centre's research groups are: analysing the relationship between structure and function; developing reliable emulsification, formation and evaluation protocols for biopolymers used in consumer products; screening of plant cells to produce chemicals with commercial utility; screening of Australian red seaweeds for commercially valuable agars and carrageens; and cloning commercially important genes which have the potential to increase the productivity of cells producing biopolymers. A well-equipped testing facility has been established at the University of Melbourne to facilitate the relationship between industry and the CRC. Successes Plant cell culture technology has been developed to produce biopolymers at a pilot plant scale in conjunction with the commercial participants. Commercial significance of work The Australian market for biopolymers, used in foods, pet foods, cosmetics and other manufactured products is worth $20 million a year. The international market exceeds $1 billion a year. Why Victoria? Victoria is a centre for many industries in which biopolymers are commonly used. Three of the four CRC research nodes are located in Melbourne together with the centre's core commercial participants. The Melbourne groups have research expertise in plant cell culture, genetic engineering, seaweed taxonomy and other important biotechnological processes. Participants University of Melbourne, School of Botany and Department of Chemical Engineering CSIRO Division of Food Science & Technology Tridan Ltd- Albright and Wilson (Australia) Ltd Partnership Business opportunities The centre has expertise to solve problems commonly experienced by industry in the application of biopolymers.

R&D strengths The CRC is combining data and information collected from many sources and making it accessible through one system or interface. A range of visualisation tools and geology and mechanical modelling packages are being developed to allow researchers and exploration companies to make their own interpretations of how outstanding deposits formed and how the Australian continent evolved. As the delivery vehicle for all of the CRC's research results, the framework is called the Four Dimensional Geodynamic Model of Australia. Successes During the 1994-95 financial year, 14 CRC research projects involved outside groups and/or companies as active researchers, collaborators or financial supporters. Over $400,000 was received as direct project support, as well as substantial data and in-kind contributions. Commercial significance of work The CRC�s strategy is to provide access to the 4D Geodynamic Model via sophisticated graphics computers. Industry geologists will be able to visit CRC institutions to build their own syntheses and models and conduct their own analyses of the evolution of different areas. They will be able to use this advanced interpretive process to make their own assessments of the prospectivity of these areas.A more immediate form of access to this data and capability will be provided via a distributed computer-based network right into the geologist's own office. This network style access will probably be based on the format presented by the World Wide Web on the Internet. The commercial return will come in the future when industry uses the model to discover world-class resource deposits. Why Victoria? Victoria has strategic importance as an important focal point for the mining and exploration community. Leading international geodynamics researchers are located at both Monash and La Trobe Universities. Training and education The centre provides an advanced education and training environment based around its research activities. Thesis topics are generated for postgraduate students; high-quality postgraduate students are attracted from around Australia and overseas; and advanced courses are provided for both postgraduate students and industry professionals.The first course for industry professionals was offered late in 1995. The total number of postgraduate students reached 19 in early 1995 with 13 of these enrolled for PhD studies and six for MSc studies. Significant industry links and support were established for a number of these students, working under joint supervision of university and non-university scientists. Participants CSIRO Division of Exploration & Mining The Australian Geological Survey Organisation Monash University - Australian Crustal Research Centre La Trobe University- School of Earth Sciences Digital Equipment Corporation Australia Pty Ltd Business opportunities The application of the research and its ready adoption by industry and other members of the geoscientific community is critical to the overall success of the CRC. Many projects have been structured to industry�s needs and receive some form of support from industry.The centre is exploring opportunities for secondments of prominent geologists from industry into projects for specified periods. Funding The CRC is supported by Australian Government funding of $16.4 million for a period of seven years, with reviews at years 3 (1996) and 5 (1998). Several exploration companies are actively involved in both research and training, providing financial support to fundamental research and postgraduate students working in specific areas of interest.

It brings together internationally recognised Australian hearing research groups and leading biomedical companies to develop communication devices for the hundreds of thousands of persons worldwide who suffer from severe hearing disability. R&D strengths Major R&D programs include: Advanced Bionic Ear Program: a new generation of cochlear implants with improved benefits to speech perception, and which can help a wider range of hearing-impaired adults and children. Combionic Aid Program: an advanced communication aid combining a cochlear implant in one ear with an intelligent speech processing hearing aid fitted to the other ear. This aid will provide maximum benefits to cochlear implant users who have some residual hearing. Speech Processing Hearing Aid Program: an advanced hearing aid that will make speech more intelligible, particularly in background noise. Computer-Aided Speech and Language Analysis System: software that enables clinicians to quickly analyse speech samples of hearing-impaired adults and children. Tickle Talker Program: an electrotactile speech processing aid for hearing-impaired adults and children who are unable to benefit from cochlear implants. CNS Prosthesis Program: a device, based on the Bionic Ear, which can be implanted directly into the auditory brain stem to stimulate hearing centres. Successes Australia has led the world in developing the Bionic Ear, which currently aids speech perception for over 13,000 adults and children world-wide. The Bionic Ear earns millions of dollars of export income for Australia and provides employment for over 300 Australians in biomedical technology.The CRC also provides internationally recognised research expertise in hearing aid design and electrophysiology. The CRC research expertise is complemented by a proven track record in postgraduate and professional teaching.Critical support is provided by hospital cochlear implant clinics and school programs for hearing-impaired children. Why Victoria? Historically, the work on the Bionic Ear was pioneered by Professor Graeme Clark and his research team at the University of Melbourne. This group has collaborated effectively with Cochlear Limited, who commercialised the cochlear implant. Cochlear Limited maintains an important research group in Melbourne, which works closely with the CRC. The CRC also broadens the research base to include two Melbourne-based Schools for Hearing-Impaired Children, who have long experience working with children with cochlear implants, as well as Australian Hearing Services, which has Hearing Centres throughout Victoria and the rest of Australia. Training and education The CRC provides postgraduate research opportunities in a variety of disciplines including otolaryngology, hearing science, audiology, speech science and bioengineering. Programs are offered leading to Doctor of Philosophy, Master of Science, Master of Audiology and Diploma of Audiology. Surgeons and clinicians from over 15 countries have attended workshop programs providing up-to-date training in cochlear implantation.

For companies wishing to boost their competitive edge through research and development and other forms of innovation, there is no better location in Australia or the Asia-Pacific Region. Victoria is Australia's leading State for business R&D, for total government expenditure (State and Commonwealth) on R&D, and for R&D by private non-profit organisations. With a pro-business State Government helping Victoria to forge ahead and improve its competitive position in the world, companies are reaping the benefits from the expertise which exists and continues to develop in this State. This Guide to CRCs in Victoria has been compiled by Business Victoria, the Government's business expansion arm, as an information resource for companies. It aims to raise your company's awareness of available technology and its benefits, and of Victoria's impressive research and innovation facilities. There are currently 14 Co-operative Research Centres (CRCs) headquartered in Victoria, and 21 with a major research node. They were established to encourage collaboration in research by university research groups, government laboratories and private industry. Specifically, I hope the guide will encourage Victorian companies to take up CRC services; encourage future co-operation between CRCs and domestic industry; and encourage overseas firms to participate in R&D projects at CRCs in Victoria.

What is a CRC? Co-operative Research Centres were established under a Federal Government initiative to encourage research groups in universities, government laboratories and private industry to collaborate in world class research, and so utilise more effectively the considerable R&D resources available to Australian businesses. CRCs in Victoria cover several industry sectors, including food processing, engineering, and information technology and telecommunications. The 14 CRCs headquartered in Victoria represent approximately $186 million or 22% of the total Federal Government funding of $844 million over seven years, and $87 million or 22% of industry funding of $387 million over the same period. This represents a considerable R&D resource in Victoria. The Victorian Government, through Business Victoria, has close links with the State's CRCs, and has developed a $200,000 program to help Victorian businesses and research centres reap the benefits of R&D. Specifically, the program's objectives are to assist small to medium-sized businesses to gain access to CRC facilities and services, and to enhance the commercial and export potential of CRC products and services. By working together with the CRCs and the business community in this way, Business Victoria aims to promote industry development and innovation, attract investment and maximise economic benefits to the State.

The industry is based mainly in Victoria and New South Wales and employs about 14,000 people. Australian turnover for aircraft maintenance and repair is around $500 million. The industry provides goods and services to the Australian Department of Defence which spends $2.5 billion on capital equipment and $1.5 billion on logistic support each year. The next five years will see a dramatic increase in expenditure on new military aircraft projects in Australia. The Australian aerospace industry is becoming more trade-oriented with manufactured exports reaching $277 million in 1993-94, with another $412 million in re-exports. Expenditure on R&D associated with aircraft manufacturing has increased from $7million to $57 million in the four years to 1992-93. Victoria About half of Australia's aerospace industry is located in Victoria. The sector is characterised by companies which are export-oriented, internationally competitive and with high quality standards. Many of these companies have strong relationships with major international companies such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell and Airbus Industrie. Key companies, Rockwell Australia and Hawker de Havilland, have major facilities in Melbourne. Ansett Australia and Qantas Airways have large maintenance basesat Melbourne Airport. About 150 other small companies service the major players. An aerospace precinct has been established in the Fishermens Bend area of Port Melbourne. Located here are the Rockwell, Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) and Hawker de Havilland plants, Australia's most important aeronautical research organisation - the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory - and Australia's largest aeronautical education institution, RMIT Aerospace. Further south Avalon Airport, near Geelong, provides ideal facilities for aircraft assembly, maintenance and refits as well as aviation training. Avalon is thevenue for Australia's premier aerospace and aviation event, the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace Expo. Prospects The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) projects sales growth for aircraft and parts to average 10% through to 2005-06 and employment to double to 32,000. The industry expects to have established export contracts worth up to $800 million by the end of the decade. The BIE projects exports to grow from $300 millionin 1991-92 to $1.7 billion by 2005-06, an annual growth rate of 13%, and exportpropensity to rise from 31% in 1991-92 to 55% in 2005-06.

Demand for air travel is picking up as world economic conditions improve and excess capacity is gradually declining. The Australian aviation industry has the potential to provide airport development, training and consultancy services in Asia where the aviation industry is expanding rapidly and infrastructure needs to be upgraded. Industry capacity includes business, tourism, marketing and infrastructure services together with complementary service transport access to major airports, and the long-term enhancement of airport potential through appropriate planning and environmental management. Victoria The two major Australian airlines, Qantas and Ansett, employ around 10,000 people in Victoria. Other aviation activities including the operation of Melbourne Airport, research and development, and suppliers of aviation equipment employ around 1,300 people. In 1993-94, Melbourne Airport handled nine million domestic passengers and two million international passengers and generated a record profit of $44 million before tax and interest. Airports at Moorabbin and Essendon provide general aviation services, while Avalon is part-owned and leased by ASTA and serves as a freight and maintenance centre and as an airport. Melbourne is emerging as a major centre for the industry in the Asia-Pacific region. Ansett Airlines is headquartered in Melbourne. Prospects The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has forecast the volume ofAustralian air traffic to grow at around 7% over the second half of the 1990s.

The sector has rebounded strongly during the economic recovery. Growing consumer spending and the upturn in the building cycle have lifted demand for plastics,paints and other chemical products. Strong sales growth has reduced excess capacity and expected investment in 1994-95 is up by over 20% in the latest investment survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). During the 1990s, both exports and imports have increased strongly. CPR exportshave doubled since 1988-89 to reach $2.6 billion in 1993-94. Victoria The CPR sector accounts for over 3% of Victoria's economy. Reflecting the capital intensive nature of the sector, employment of around 35,000 is somewhat lower as a proportion of total employment at around 1.5%. Victoria produces around 37%of Australias CPR output, reflecting its advantages of competitively priced power, natural gas and feedstocks. The head offices of many of the major companies involved in the industry are located in Victoria, including BTR Nylex, ICI, Kemcor, Pacific Dunlop, Montell and Hoechst. The CPR sector is sensitive to cost competitiveness and is adjusting to lower levels of protection. Output per employee in 1994 is 20% higher than it was five years ago reflecting extensive structural reform in the early 1990s. CPR exports from Victoria in 1993-94 were $564 million, about double the level in 1989-90. Victoria is a major centre for research and development activity. R&D spending by CPR industries (including spending by the petroleum refining industry) in Victoria in 1992-93 was $127 million or 47% of the national total. The Victorian Government is working with the major international petrochemical companies which comprise the Altona Chemical Complex to streamline existing regulation in Victoria and introduce international best practice regulation. The aimis that operation should be performance based rather than prescriptive regulation - a shift towards self-regulation. Prospects The Bureau of Industry Economics expects a steady expansion of the sector over the next decade. Domestic sales growth is projected to average 3% with exports expected to grow at 6%. The increase in output is expected to be generated by higher productivity and expansion of the capital stock with employment remaining broadly unchanged. A range of investment opportunities currently exists in the areas of natural gas-based chemicals, petrochemicals and downstream CPR processing.

Around 30% of students now undertake post-school studies compared with 10% a decade ago. Education exports have grown strongly over the past decade and are worth around$1.7 billion, including $100 million earned from the overseas provision of Australian education services. It has also been estimated that, with a concerted effort, Australia's share of the market could rise to $5 to $10 billion over the next five years. The number of full-fee paying students in Australia increased from about 2,000 in 1986 to 23,000 in 1989, and to 63,000 by 1993. Overseas projects in education services involve the delivery of projects offshore using Australian management and teaching/training experts. These projects typically take place in Asia-Pacific countries and are paid for by loans to the nation concerned from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. Victoria The education services sector employs around 7% of the total workforce in Victoria. Victoria has a relatively high participation rate in upper secondary education compared with the other states, whilst the number of higher education students is at a record high. In 1993, there were 19,000 fee-paying students from overseas undertaking courses in Victoria, some 30% of the national total. Most were from Asia, particularlyHong Kong, Malaysia, the Peoples Republic of China and Singapore. Exports of educational services from Victoria are around $500 million, equal to50% of spending by foreign tourists. While the full-fee paying overseas students market is the major export earner, overseas projects involving the packaging of education and training services for delivery in other countries earns around $20 million a year. Several Victorian educational institutions are involved in joint ventures with educational institutions overseas to conduct courses for students in their own countries. Increasing numbers of institutions and companies are also involved in joint arrangements to provide technical, trade and other workforce-related educational services offshore. Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria (OPCV) manages a number of aid-fundedoverseas projects relating to training services and education systems through strategic alliances with education and training organisations. In response to the demand from developing countries for access to quality tertiary education and the need to keep costs down, television-based distance learning has recently been marketed overseas by Open Learning Agency, a Monash University-led consortium. Prospects Australia has around 1% of the world market for overseas students which is estimated at US$100 billion a year. Scope for export expansion lies mainly in the Asia Pacific region. Innovative programs in telecommunications and distance learning are being developed and delivered by some Australian organisations. Opportunities also exist in providing equipment and software relating to publishing and information technology. The education and training needs of Asian countries vary enormously and are impacted upon by the various cultural, economic, political and social conditions of each country.

Hardware is the largest single market sector ($4.5 billion), followed by services ($3.0 billion), data communications equipment ($2.7 billion) and software packages ($1.7 billion). Taken together software and services are much bigger than hardware alone and the expected strong growth in software and services could benefit Australian companies. The communications industry will generate revenues of $26.7 billion in 1995, ofwhich $20.2 billion will be carrier revenues. The Australian equipment industrywill generate revenues of $5.2 billion, with much of this sourced locally. The communications industry will achieve exports in excess of $1 billion in 1995, with prospects of this growing to $3 billion by the year 2000. Australia is increasingly recognised as a cost-competitive location from which to undertake manufacturing, research and development and service activities associated with the information technology and communications industry. Victoria The information technology and communications sector is likely to be the fastest growing sector in Victoria and Australia for the remainder of the 1990s. Eight of the 12 main computer and communications hardware manufacturers in Australia have production facilities in Victoria. The IBM plant at Wangaratta is thelargest in Australia. The technologies underpinning the information technology and communications industries are converging and software is increasingly important to both. Victoria has a strong base of specialist software developers and education and training facilities. Victoria's tertiary institutions supply over one-third of Australia's annual graduates in computing and electrical/electronics engineering. Victoria has an extensive research and development infrastructure, which underpins much of Australia's reputation in this sector. Victorian Government established and funded bodies such as the Collaborative Information Technology Research Institute (CITRI), the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) and the Australian Computing and Communications Institute (ACCI), all located in Melbourne, have strong capabilities in advanced computing and communication technologies. Victoria is responsible for some 70% of Australia's expenditure on communications research and development, with Telstra Corporation, Australia's largest communications operator, locating its 550 person research laboratories in Melbourne,where over $60 million is spent annually. Major computing and communications equipment suppliers including, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Ericsson, Nokia Telecommunications, Philips, Fujitsu, NEC and Siemens all have manufacturing and/or R&D establishments in Melbourne, where most of Australia's optical fibre is also produced. Recent investments by Oracle Systems Australia, IBM and Olivetti will total $267 million over five years. Victorian industry will be a significant beneficiary of the plans underway to build a state of the art broadband network to deliver a range of advanced entertainment and interactive services. Telstra Corporation is spending $3.3 billion onnetwork modernisation throughout Australia. Telstra has also announced plans tospend $4.1 billion to build a hybrid fibre and coaxial cable network.Telstra has entered into a joint venture with News Corporation, FOXTEL, to deliver entertainment and interactive services. FOXTEL has opened its national customer sales and service centre in Melbourne, and will eventually employ 1000 people. Optus Vision, a consortium of Optus Communications, Continental Cablevision Inc. and Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, has also announced plans to invest $3 billion on its cable roll-out for the delivery of its services. Victorian industry will supply all of the coaxial cable that will be used in both the Telstra and Optus Vision roll-outs and the bulk of the fibre optic cable that Telstra and Optus will require for their network upgrading and expansion. Prospects The Bureau of Industry Economics forecasts sales of computing and communications equipment to average growth of almost 10% through to 2005. Similar growth is forecast in both export and domestic sales. Spending on services and software is expected to continue to outpace spending on hardware in both the global and Australian markets and this trend has the potential to advantage Australian companies. In the emerging multimedia industry, Australia and Victoria are well placed to provide content for the local and world markets for the new entertainment and interactive services offered by cable TV.

Australias 140 pharmaceutical manufacturing establishments employ 11,000 people with the largest 10 firms having 55% of the market. Sales of pharmaceuticals produced in Australia are $2.2 billion with prescription pharmaceuticals accounting for $1.7 billion. Pharmacists turnover, which includes non-pharmaceutical products, increased strongly in 1993 and 1994.Under an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government, known as Factor F, pharmaceutical manufacturers receive an imputed price increase to compensate for constriction of overall pricing by government purchasing monopoly if firms agree to meet increased local value adding, export and R&D targets. Under the scheme, spending on R&D by the pharmaceutical industry reached 7% of turnover in 1992-93 compared with 3% in 1988-89. Exports of pharmaceuticals have increased strongly over recent years reaching nearly $600 million in 1993-94, with another $125 million in re-exports. Victoria Victoria's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry employs about 3,500 people. Victoria has about 40% of national production, the industry having been developed alongside an internationally recognised biomedical and scientific research and development base. Strong interconnecting links exist between pharmaceutical companies, universities and specialised consultants. Pharmacists' turnover, currently around $1.4 billion per year, including non-pharmaceuticals, has grown by 30% since 1992. Victoria exported $225 million of pharmaceuticals in 1993-94, almost 40% of national exports. The major destinations for exports were New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Victoria also supply markets in the rest of Australia. Prospects The Bureau of Industry Economics projects average sales growth for Australias pharmaceutical firms of 7% to the year 2005-6. Exports are expected to grow at 13%, with employment projected to more than double to 29,000 by 2005-6. The continuation of the Factor F scheme until 1998-99 should facilitate export growth in the 1990s and the expansion of research and development. Growth beyond 1998-99 will be influenced by future government decisions on the arrangements to apply following the expiry of the Factor F scheme in 1999.

The 25 largest companies are estimated to account for approximately 90% of total production and 90% of exports. The industry is export-oriented and is one of the fastest growing segments in the Australian economy, averaging real growth of 6% over the past decade. National exports in 1993-94 were $333 million (with another $195 million in re-exports), mainly to the North American and European markets. Products exported included medical equipment, measuring instruments, spectrometers and other instruments for chemical analysis. Victoria Victoria has established a significant presence in the rapidly growing international market for scientific and medical equipment. Victoria's strong research and development base provides a platform for further growth. The major products manufactured by local firms include laboratory spectrophotometers and chromatography equipment, environmental monitoring equipment, hospitalequipment, surgical instruments, physiotheraphy equipment, orthopaedic appliances and artificial limbs. Sales of scientific and medical equipment manufacturers in Victoria are around $240 million, about 50% of national turnover. While imports supply a significant proportion of the local market for scientific and medical equipment, local firms are export-oriented. Exports from Victoria in 1993-94 were $115 million, almost half of the industry's total sales. Some of the larger companies located in Victoria include Varian Techtron Australia, Selby Scientific, SGE International, GBC Scientific Equipment, Australian Biomedical Corporation, Denyers and Hendicare Hospital Equipment. Prospects The world market for scientific and medical instruments is growing rapidly witha large number of product niches emerging. The achievement of the sectors growth potential in Victoria will require continued research to develop new technology and an ability to commercialise this technology. The Bureau of Industry Economics projects sales growth for Australian firms to average almost 7% over the period to 2005-6. All of the growth is expected to come from exports which are projected to average growth of 13%.

The number of foreign tourist visits to Australia has increased at an average annual rate of 8% over the past eight years to the current annual level of three million. Spending by foreign tourists in Australia in 1994-95 will be around $7 billion.Sales to foreigners by Australian transport operators will be an additional $2.5 billion. Foreign tourism will contribute just over 2% of national GDP comparedwith domestic tourist spending of $15 billion or 3% of GDP. The rapid growth of foreign tourism began with a decline in the Australian dollar in the mid 1980s and has benefited from economic expansion in Asia and improved marketing by the Australian tourism industry. More tourist visits are originating from Asia. Japan is the major source of tourists (30% of the total). Other Asian countries now account for 25% of the total. The number of tourists from New Zealand, Europe and North America is rising more slowly. Victoria Spending by foreign and interstate tourists in Victoria is around $2.3 billion or 2% of Gross State Product. Spending by foreign tourists accounts for 40% of the total and domestic tourism makes up the remaining 60%. In 1993-94, Victoria attracted 800,000 visitors from overseas and two million visitors from other Australian states. Foreign tourist visits have grown consistently faster than domestic tourism since the mid 1980s. Victoria has over 30,000 hotel and motel rooms. Takings from accommodation in Victoria in 1993-94 were $432 million, almost three times the level of ten years ago. Investment in the tourism sector in Victoria has rebounded and is set to increase further over the next few years. The construction of the Melbourne Casino hotel and other new tourism-related projects and events such as the Grand Prix will see investment activity return to high levels during 1995 and 1996. Prospects The Bureau of Tourism Research forecasts tourist visits to average growth of 7%over the rest of the 1990s and reach six million by the year 2000. The Bureau of Industry Economics has forecast spending by foreign tourists in Australia to average growth over the period to 2005-6 of 8%. Rapid economic growth in Asia is expected to be the main driving force behind the expected growth in tourism.

Manufacturing industries in Australia spent $1 billion on environmental protection and pollution abatement in 1991-92. Spending was most significant by the steel, aluminium, chemicals, building materials and mining industries. Investment in sewerage systems in Australia over the decade is estimated at $13 billion. Increasingly, work undertaken for public authorities is being outsourced which will lead to greater opportunities for private companies and consortia to be involved in the provision of infrastructure/services relating to waste water and sewerage systems. The growing commitment to ecologically sustainable development is creating new markets, both locally and internationally, for environmental goods and services. Government and higher education institutions dominated environmental R&D spending. They spent $138 million compared with business spending of $39 million. Currently 35 public and private companies in Australia export environmental technology and expertise with estimated exports of $250-300 million. Victoria The existence of Melbourne as both a major population and economic centre, with its attendant waste management requirements, has resulted in numerous environmental industries either being based in Victoria or having a strong presence in the State. In 1991-92, Victorian manufacturing firms spent an estimated $255 million on environmental protection and pollution abatement. Some 785 manufacturing establishments sold or produced environment protection goods and services. Recycling of post-industrial and post-consumer waste such as cardboard, plastics, scrap tyres and metal employs over 5,000 people, with an estimated capital investment of $1.5 billion. Commodities such as paper, cardboard, glass, metals and some plastics are converted into value-added products with ready markets. Companies based in Victoria such as Sinclair Knight, Kinhill Engineers, GH & D have developed a diverse range of waste management technologies and services both internationally and locally. Victoria's public sector expenditure on pollution abatement and control activities is around $500 million. Exports of waste materials from Victoria were $30 million in 1993-94, about 13%of the Australian total. Firms supplying consultancy services and specialised technology are well placed to increase exports, especially in relation to waste water treatment plants and potable water. Future investment in Victoria's waste management and recycling capacity include the construction by Amcor Australian Paper of a $50 million high technology waste paper recycling centre in the suburb of Fairfield. Prospects The international demand for environmental protection services is expected to increase rapidly with estimates that Australia's exports in this sector will increase to around $1 billion by the year 2000. A major potential market is Asia which the World Bank estimates will need to spend at least $200 billion in the next decade on waste control. Exports of recyclable waste materials such as beverage containers, glass, iron,lead, plastics and precious metals were $240 million in 1993-94 and there is considerable scope for further growth. The demand for environmental consultancy services should further expand as the need for firms to have accredited environment management systems in place increases.

The nationalfood manufacturing sector accounts for just under 4% of the national GDP. Australia exports over $8 billion of food products. Food and beverage production has expanded almost 30% between 1991 and 1994. Growth in domestic food consumption of around 12% was exceeded by growth in export sales. Productivity in the food and beverage sector has risen strongly as spare productive capacity has been used up and efficiency improvements have been put in place. Exports of food products have increased on average by 10% per annum over the past three years, including even higher growth in dairy products and fruit and vegetables. Spending on R&D by the food and beverages industry in 1992-93 was $137 million. National investment by the food and beverages sector is rebounding strongly from a downturn during the early 1990s recession. Spending increased 40% in 1993-94 and further growth is expected in 1994-95 to meet increased sales in both the domestic and export markets. Victoria Food and beverage production accounts for 21% of manufacturing output and almost 5% of Victoria's total economic output. Victoria contributes 33% of Australias food and beverage manufacturing value-added, compared with around 25% of national food consumption. Victoria dominates the manufacture of dairy products, fruit and vegetables, cakes and biscuits, confectionery and pet food. While more than 1000 food processing companies operate in Victoria, the largest20 companies generate 50% of total food industry turnover and 70% of employment. The 12 largest exporters account for 75% of Victoria's food exports. The ten largest food companies in the world have processing plants in Australia,the majority being located in Victoria, including H.J. Heinz, Kraft Foods, Cadbury Schweppes, EFFEM (Mars and Uncle Bens), Bunge, Snow Brand, Campbells Soups and Nestlè. Food and beverage exports in 1993-94 were $2.5 billion or 30% of national food exports. Victoria's food exports go mainly to Asia, particularly Japan. The trade surplus is approximately $1.86 billion. More than $700 million has been invested or committed recently in the industry, mainly for export sales. Key investors include Kraft ($100 million), Nestlè Confectionery ($60 million), Cadbury Schweppes, Bonlac, Murray Goulburn and Snow Brand. Spending on R&D by the food and beverages industry in Victoria in 1992-93 was $49 million or 36% of the national total. Prospects There is great potential to add further value to the State's agricultural production, particularly for export-oriented processed food manufacturing. The Bureau of Industry Economics projects sales growth for processed foods, excluding meat and flour, to average 3.5% through to 2005. Exports are projected to increase at 8.5%. The positive outlook for the industry is due to Australia's comparative advantage in food production, rapid growth in Asian markets and more aggressive and competitive Australian producers.

Output of paper and paper products, including printing, have increased stronglysince mid-1993 reflecting increased demand for paper packaging and containers. Production of wood and wood products increased strongly in 1994 due to increased demand for timber in residential construction. Australia exports $900 million of forest products. Exports of forest products have increased on average by 10% over the past three years, including strong growth in the export of paper containers. R&D spending by the forest products sector in 1992-93 was $55 million. Victoria Victoria's forest products industry has sales of about $3.2 billion and employs 23,000 people. Victoria has 26% of the national industry including 34% of paper and fibreboard container production, 29% of furniture production and 21% of woodand wood products output. The hardwood timber industry continues to undergo extensive restructuring and reinvestment with the number of mills having fallen by 80% over recent years. Long-term contracts have facilitated restructuring and a shift toward greater value-adding for both import substitution and export. Softwood timber production has increased as the softwood plantation resource has matured. The wood-based panel products sector includes a hardboard factory at Bacchus Marsh, particleboard plants at Ballarat and Benalla and a plymill at Myrtleford. The pulp and paper industry in Victoria is dominated by Australian Paper, a division of Amcor, which has pulp and paper manufacturing plants at Maryvale (the largest in Australia), Fairfield and Broadford. The pulp and paper industry is subject to intense import competition and economies of scale are such that new mills need to export a high proportion of output to be viable. Pratt Industries manufactures cardboard boxes at its Coolaroo and Reservoir facilities. Bowater manufactures tissue products at its Box Hill plant and mechanical pulp at Myrtleford. Australian Newsprint Mills at Albury and Kimberley Clark at Millicent in South Australia are significant users of Victoria's forest resources. Exports of forest products, consisting mainly of woodchips and pulp, were $180 million in 1993-94. Pulp and paper exports are mainly destined for New Zealand and woodchips are mainly sold to Japan. Prospects The sawn timber industry remains largely dependent for sales on residential construction activity, although opportunities do exist and are being pursued for increased sales in the international market and for import replacement. Opportunities for the industry in Victoria include Australian Paper's upgrading of its operations as part of Amcor's proposed $1 billion investment in Victoria over the next 5-6 years, as well as a number of developments for processing associated with the increasing availability of both softwood and hardwood resources in the State which will focus on overseas market demands for forest products. The Bureau of Industry Economics forecasts that sales of wood and paper products will grow at just over 3% through to 2005-6, with most of the growth coming from sales of paper.

The Australian textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry is becoming more export-oriented. Wool processing and textiles have benefited from increased foreign investment and the associated increase in value-added exports. Total TCF exports from Australia were $956 million in 1993-94. Global trade in textiles and clothing has been growing rapidly and this is forecast to continue with the phased abolition of the Multifibre Agreement and increased demand in Asia for final and intermediate textile, clothing and footwear goods. Clothing and footwear continues to rationalise in response to reduced tariffs and increased overseas competition. Victoria Victoria dominates national production of textile, clothing, footwear and leather products. The 1,500 TCF establishments in Victoria produce 48% of the national output, 40% of national exports and generate about 2% of Victorias GSP. Employment is around 35,000. The clothing and footwear sector has adjusted since the late 1980s to lower protection, technological change and a flat domestic market. The industry situation has stabilised during the current economic upturn due to a lift in the domestic market and growth in exports. Exports have increased strongly in the 1990s, to be worth $391 million in 1993-94. Textiles comprised 42% of Victoria's TCF exports, clothing and footwear 29% and leather and leather goods contributed 29%. Recent investments in the Victorian TCF sector have reinforced Geelong as a major wool processing centre with Godfrey Hirst (carpet manufacturer) expanding its capacity significantly and Geelong Wool Combing investing $85 million, with 50% of production to be exported. In addition, Austanners will be spending $21 million on establishing a tannery. Prospects The Bureau of Industry Economics forecasts growth in the sales of Australian TCF manufactures over the period to 2005-6 to average just over 2%. Exports are expected to grow from $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion, with most of the increase in the textiles industry the result of continuing foreign direct investment into the Australian wool-processing industry. The average effective rate of protection on Australian-made TCF products is expected to fall from 43% in 1991 to about 13% by 2001.

It is increasingly focusing on exports ($1.3 billion in 1993-94), given the small scale of the domestic market (around 300,000 units per annum). The Commonwealth Government Export Facilitation Scheme has been a significant factor in the large increase in automotive exports and imports over the past decade. Under the current arrangements, the effective rate of protection on Australian-made motor vehicles and parts will fall from 25% in 1996 to 15% by 2001. Tariff and related arrangements for the passenger motor vehicle industry post 2000 are to be reviewed in 1996 for decision during 1997. The automotive industry has a well-established hierarchical structure of car makers, component producers and a third layer consisting of the suppliers to the component producers. The automotive sector is a major contributor to Australian research and development. In 1992-93, spending on R&D was $166 million, equivalent to 6% of total business spending on R&D and the third largest sectoral component after computer software and electronic equipment. A significant proportion of spending was on tooling up to new models. The industry provides leadership to the rest of the manufacturing sector in the adoption of new manufacturing technologies such as robotics and computer-aided design and engineering. Industry conditions and profitability improved in 1994. Motor vehicle sales have increased since mid-1993 and this has lifted domestic production. Victoria Victoria accounts for 65% of Australia's automotive industry production. Ford Australia and Toyota Australia are based in Victoria as are the majority of component manufacturers. General Motors-Holden Australia has its headquarters, engineering design and development activities in Melbourne. Automotive sector output in Victoria has performed strongly during 1993 and 1994. In order to secure its future, the industry is increasingly looking to exports as the world industry restructures and niche markets become more important. Exports of automotive products rose to $695 million in 1993-94, some 54% of national automotive exports. Exports of motor vehicles were $430 million and exports of components increased to $265 million. Productivity has increased as a result of better work practices and more efficient organisational structures. Compared with the 1980s, output levels have increased while employment is 20% lower. Components produced in Victoria include pressed metal components, aluminium engine castings, upholstery leather, vehicle security systems, panel instrumentation, air conditioners and plastic mouldings as well as more elaborately transformed products such as complete engines, instruments, drive shafts, lighting and braking systems. Almost $1.5 billion of new investment has recently been commenced or announced by Ford, Holdens Engine Company and Toyota, along with components manufacturers Venture Asia Pacific, Air International and Robert Bosch (Aust.). Prospects The trend in the world automotive industry for niche markets will give Victorian manufacturers increased opportunities to compete internationally. Under the tariff phase-down policy, automotive exports are expected to double by 2000. The Bureau of Industry Economics projects Australian motor vehicle and parts exports to average growth of 8% through to 2005-6. Domestic sales are expected to be static and employment is projected to fall slightly over the period.

Engineering output has recently grown strongly to a record high level. Fabricated metal production was up 10% and machinery and equipment by 16% in the year toSeptember 1994. The increase in output reflects rising demand for metals in consumer packaging, construction and equipment production. Basic metal production has also recovered, including strong growth in exports. Exports of metal products and equipment have increased strongly over recent years to reach $3.7 billion in 1993-94, with another $800 million in re-exports. Exports of engineering services by Australian companies are growing, reflecting the increasing opportunities in Asia, and contributed $126 million to Australia's export receipts in 1992-93.R&D spending by the engineering sector (including basic non-ferrous metals) in 1992-93 was $410 million. Victoria The manufacturing part of the engineering sector has turnover in excess of $8 billion and employs 48,000 people in Victoria, with 34,000 of these in basic engineering, mainly in fabricated metal products, and 14,000 employed in industrial machinery and equipment. Engineering services employs around 5,000. Victoria hasaround 20% of national iron and steel production, compared with 30% of nationalfabricated metals production and 34% of industrial machinery and equipment. The tendency for local firms to be smaller and less specialised than those overseas offers some advantages. Victorian firms are increasingly competitive in short production runs for specialised machinery. They can use this experience to exploit a market niche for short run production. Victoria has well developed engineering skills in areas such as automotive tooling and the production of special purpose machinery. Victoria's cost-competitive automotive tooling sector is becoming increasingly export conscious. Rapid economic development in Asia will provide export opportunities for Victoria as consulting engineers and for local engineering companies as suppliers or collaborative partners. Activity in Victoria's basic metals and fabricated metals sectors has increased in recent years as a result of growth in the domestic market and rising exports of metal products which reached $520 million in 1993-94. Equipment exports from Victoria have also increased strongly and reached $460 million in 1993-94. R&D spending by the engineering sector in Victoria in 1992-93 was $115 million or 28% of the Australian total. Prospects The Bureau of Industry Economics has forecast growth in steel production to average just under 3% through to 2005-6. Most of the growth is expected to occur inthe domestic market, including increased sales to downstream industries. Industrial machinery and equipment sales are forecast to average growth of 3.5% including export growth of 5%. Mechanical equipment sales are forecast to increase at just over 3% and employment will rise from 95,000 to 107,000 during this period.Sales in the electrical equipment industry are also forecast to grow at 3% with employment projected to rise from 54,000 to 59,000. Overall the investment opportunities are best described as input to other sectors with opportunities available for the engineering sector to provide productionequipment (new and modified) and tooling, ancillary equipment to major equipment manufactured overseas, general process equipment and refurbishing and engineering services. The sectors most likely to require these inputs are automotive, processed food,TCF, CPR, waste management and forest products.

The raw material sector employs 20,000 and the converting sector 30,000. The industry has restructured to compete internationally. There are now only two major manufacturers of corrugated boxes, six commercial can companies, and only one glass manufacturer. Australian-owned companies are becoming global with acquisitions or joint ventures in USA, Europe and Asia. Victoria Most of the head offices of packaging companies are in Victoria. Prospects Opportunities exist in all parts of the industry: import replacements - currently packaging imports are worth over $1 billion; paperboard exports to box plants in Asia could increase; increasing expertise and technology with a view to reducing weight, ensuring environmentally sound materials and practices, and rationalising size along the lines of the canning industry; packaging in other growth industries such as food for export markets using innovative materials.

Australia's freight when measured in tonnes/kilometres was 4,245 billion in 1991, shared almost equally between rail, road and sea, with very little by air. When measured in dollar performance however, air freight accounts for 28% of total import value or 40% of total export value. Road freight dominates freight transport in Australia moving 1000 million tonnes of freight per annum over an average distance of 90 kilometres. Most freight is carried interstate over relatively short distances (47% from Melbourne). Recent studies show that the road freight industry generally operates at a world bestpractice level. Rail is undergoing a restructure to lift its capacity to compete at an international best practice level. Rail is suited to bulk freight over long distances such as coal, ores, quarry products, grain and petroleum products. In non-bulk categories, rail faces fierce competition from road transport. Most of the increase in rail freight (4.5% between 1990-91 and 1991-92) was due to increases in coal volumes. Air plays a significant role in transporting goods that are of high value and are time sensitive. Most freight goes on passenger flights. In 1990-91, 650,000 tonnes were moved by air, about half of this internationally. Victoria Victoria is the transport hub of south-east Australia acting as the national distribution centre for major manufacturing and retail chains. It is committed to making the best use of its national rail network (with excellent links to the port), its interstate and intrastate highways, its curfew-free airport and the largest port in the southern hemisphere, by developing further links to build a totally integrated transport hub. This involves 12 special national roads projects, interstate links, the City Link road project, ring roads planned, the Dock Link heavy duty road linking rail to the port, and upgrading of the airport. Support for the use of electronic commerce will assist the integration of these transport services. The Port of Melbourne handles over one third (by value) of imports and exports.Victoria loads significantly more cargo for sea export than it originates and gains more interstate trade, in both weight and value terms, for sea export. Prospects Opportunities exist in the transport and storage industry itself, and for industries dependent upon access to an effective transport service.

Maximum elevation is about 2000 metres but most of the State is between 200 and 1200 metres above sea level. The Great Dividing Range, running east-west across the State, separates the Murray Basin plains to the north from a complex of uplands and plains in the south. The south of the State tends to receive more rain than the north and is generally cooler in summer. Victoria's temperate climate, topography and diverse soil types allow the production of a wide range of agricultural products, including field crops, cereals, fruit and vegetables, table and wine grapes, and livestock. In the west, fertile volcanic plains make up some of Australia's best farmland. In the south-east lies one of the world's largest deposits of brown coal in the Latrobe Valley, used primarily for electricity generation, while further east the irrigated plains are used for dairy farming. Grain crops are concentrated in the fertile clay plains of the Wimmera and Mallee in the north-west and further north, the irrigated Sunraysia district along the Murray River supports citrus andvine production. As it is characterised by moderate temperatures, without great daily or seasonal extremes, and medium relative humidity, the Victorian climate is conducive to the performance of a wide range of industrial processes. For many of these activities, the climate also serves to minimise energy costs. This is particularly the case where the temperature and relative humidity of significant volumes of air space have to be controlled for product manufacture or storage.

Melbourne's time zone is two hours ahead of Beijing's, one hour ahead of Tokyo's and overlaps with the trading hours of the American west coast, which is a major advantage for firms that have regional business links. Melbourne is home to many of Australia's top corporations. Six of Australia's tenlargest corporations and seven of Australia's ten largest foreign organisations have their head offices in Melbourne. A 1995 summary by the accounting firm, Price Waterhouse and the geographic research company, MapInfo, into Australia's major growth zones found that Melbourne contained 37 such zones, more than any other Australian city. The zones, equating to local government areas, were identified on the basis of low unemployment, high population growth, high retail sales, high disposable income and strong housing commencement activity. With a metropolitan population of about three million, Melbourne is also strategically located in Australia's south-east where most of the nations consumer and industrial markets are situated and where about 70% of the population are living.

The temperate climate allows many sports to be enjoyed, including yachting, swimming, tennis, cricket, several kinds of football (the Australian Rules football grand final in Melbourne is one of Australia's top sporting events), snow skiing, bushwalking and golf. There are around 25 public and 50 privategolf courses in Melbourne, many of them of world standard. Melburnians are strong supporters of the arts with national and international performers assured of large, appreciative audiences. Opera, ballet and theatre companies and orchestras perform at indoor and outdoor venues and Melbourne is thehome of the Australian Ballet, the Victorian State Opera and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The Victorian Arts Centre is one of the most technically advanced opera and theatre complexes in the world housing world-class theatres, a large concert hall and a performing arts museum as well as the National Gallery of Victoria with its outstanding Australian art collection and the country's most important international art display. Shopping in Melbourne is exciting and diverse, ranging from innovative shopping centres (such as Melbourne Central in the central business district) to outstanding boutiques, shopping arcades and department stores - including Myer, the largest store in the Southern Hemisphere. There are several open markets in the metropolitan area, including the Queen Victoria Market, which sell fresh fruit, fish, meat, flowers, vegetables, clothing and furniture in a vibrant and colourfulenvironment. Melbourne's mix of cultures makes it one of the world's great dining-out cities. Victoria's vineyards produce a wide range of outstanding wines - including those from the Yarra Valley, Macedon, Geelong and Mornington Peninsula regions, located within an hour's drive of the city. Melbourne, located on the banks of the Yarra River, has vast areas of public parks and is known as the Garden City, whilst Port Phillip Bay is within easy reach of the city and suburbs for swimming and boating. World-class public and private hospitals and clinics are situated in the Melbourne metropolitan area to serve the medical needs of the population (see Australian health care arrangements). Victoria is at the forefront of medical research and development with world-renowned research establishments based in Melbourne. Top quality educational facilities are available in Melbourne. There are State-run primary and secondary schools plus numerous private schools. Foreign languages are widely taught and many community and ethnic schools offer foreign language courses after hours (see school education). By international standards the quality and affordability of housing is high. It is of low to medium density and the suburbs, because of careful planning controls and regulations, are well laid out. Home rental and purchase prices are very reasonable in the luxury and standard accommodation range. Residential property available includes apartments in the central business district, houses in inner suburbs which feature 19th century architecture, to more modern homes set on quarter or half acre blocks along the bay, by the river or in outer suburbs.

The main regional centres, most of which are within 2.5 hours drive from Melbourne, are all strategically located on major highways and rail transport routes, offering business a diversity of choice unmatched elsewhere in Australia. Regional Victoria contributes over 24% of the State's manufacturing turnover and most of its agricultural and mining production. Its manufacturing strengths include food processing, basic metal production, chemical, petroleum and coal production, textiles, non-metallic mineral products, and paper and wood products. Its agricultural strengths include wheat and other cereal crops, dairy and beef cattle, wool, vegetables, citrus fruit and grapes. Significant mining activities include oil and gas production, brown coal and gold. Business Victoria has a network of offices which deliver business and investment facilitation services for businesses in regional Victoria. Twenty-three of Victoria's regional centres have either regional development bodies which bring together local government, business, education and other community representatives or dedicated economic development units within local government. They provide detailed marketing information and investment facilitation services for prospective investors (see useful contacts).

Located 75 kilometres from Melbourne on Port Phillip Bay, the Geelong region offers big city amenities in a rural environment close to the sea. Deakin University in Geelong was the first university to be establishedoutside the Melbourne metropolitan area. The region has an abundance of land available for residential and business use. The Port of Geelong and Avalon, Victoria's second international cargo airport, are major transport assets in the area. Manufacturing is the major industry, in particular automotive (including Ford), textiles, clothing and footwear, aluminium (Alcoa),steel products, petroleum (Shell Refining), cement, and food processing.The region is seeking to expand business opportunities in such areas as food processing, high technology, research and development, tourism, aerospace and textiles. Latrobe region The Latrobe region is 150 kilometres east of Melbourne with a population of about 74,000. Its main urban centres are Moe, Morwell and Traralgon. It is an industrial area based on large deposits of brown coal. Electricity generated from this coal at Yallourn, Morwell and Loy Yang provides 90% of Victorias needs. The other major resource-based industry is forest and paper products manufacturing (including Australian Paper). These industries have resulted in the development of a highly trained technical and trades-based labour force. The establishment of the Australian Securities Commissions Information Processing Centre in Traralgon is an important example of the diversification of the economic structure that is occurring in the region. Monash University is also a key player. It is a partner in the ceramic fuel cells facility and provides joint training with industry.There is also scope for growth in information processing, energy-related research and development, tourism, furniture and agriculture-based manufactures. Albury-Wodonga Albury-Wodonga, which straddles the Victorian-New South Wales border, is at thehub of the Hume Transport Corridor (with both highway and rail access) and is easily able to service the major markets in both States. Regular air services also connect Albury-Wodonga to Melbourne and Sydney. The operation of an inland port with customs and quarantine services and bond storage facilities permits the direct consignment of exports and imports. The regional population is around 93,000. Manufacturing is a major industry with key sectors including food - predominantly meat processing (Uncle Bens and Wodonga Meats are two large firms located in the area) - paper products (Australian Newsprint Mills) and automotive components (BTR Engineering). Diversification is occurring with a new information data processing service for banks and other institutions being established by Brambles. Tourism is also an important activity in the region while beef cattle production is the major agricultural industry. Ballarat Ballarat, 110 kilometres west of Melbourne and with a population of nearly 76,000, is a major commercial and industrial centre for much of western Victoria. It is linked to Melbourne by dual carriage freeway (the Western Highway) and to rail services providing access to the Ports of Melbourne and Geelong. The economy is based on manufacturing, mining, agriculture, education and tourism. The region has high quality agricultural land which produces wool, meat (beef and sheep), cereals and potatoes. The key manufacturing sectors in the region include automotive components (Bendix Mintex, Australian Timken), food processing (McCains and Mars Confectionery), clay products, engineering, clothing and footwear. Opportunities for further development include mining-related activities (gold, clay and other minerals), food processing, information technology-related ventures, metal manufacturing, tourism and education services.A major new $100 million development is the IBM/BHP Data Centre. Bendigo Bendigo is at the geographical centre of Victoria and is the gateway to the Murray-Darling Basin, a major agricultural region. Local 150 kilometres north of Melbourne, Bendigo is less than two hours travel by road and rail. With its strategic location in the State at the hub of a radiating highway network, Bendigo also offers easy access to the major population centres of New South Wales and South Australia. With a population of nearly 83,000, Bendigo supports a variety of industrial and agricultural enterprises. Important manufacturing sectors include heavy engineering (Australian Defence Industries and the foundry operations of Keech Casting, recently relocated from Sydney), clothing (The Stafford Group), automotive components (Empire Rubber) and non-metallic mineral products.Poultry processing is another important industry. Tourism, largely based on the region's gold mining history, is a growing industry. There is significant potential for growth in the developing customer servicing area of information and data processing, food processing, tourism and poultry production. Shepparton Sometimes referred to as the food bowl of Victoria, the Shepparton region has capitalised on its rich and diverse agricultural base by encouraging the establishment of a high value adding and export-oriented food processing industry. With a population of nearly 54,000, Shepparton is a major commercial centre for the Goulburn Valley region of Victoria and southern parts of New South Wales. As well as food processing - mainly fruit, vegetable and dairy processing (including SPC, Ardmona, Bonlac, Campbells Soups, Henry Jones (IXL) and Unifoods) - there is a range of supporting industries in engineering, packaging and road transport. Other regional centres There are a further 17 regional centres that offer the potential investor many choices. These include Ararat, Colac, Hamilton, Horsham, Mildura, Portland, Stawell, Swan Hill and Warrnambool in the west, with Castlemaine, Echuca, Maryborough, Wangaratta, Benalla and Seymour in the central area, and Bairnsdale and Warragul in the east.

A cost benchmarking study undertaken by the international firm, KPMG Management Consulting, for the Department of State Development, compared major business costs in Melbourne with several other significant cities including Sydney, Brisbane, Auckland, Bangkok, Guangzhou, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Los Angeles, Osaka, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Stuttgart. Comparisons were made in the benchmarking study of the relative costs of utilities (electricity, gas and water), research and development, telecommunications, transport and freight, labour and capital items. The benchmarking study showed that Melbourne was particularly cost-competitive in: industrial land and factory and warehouse construction; factory and warehouse rental; office rental; senior management and professional labour costs; transport; telecommunications; high voltage electricity; and gas. The report also showed that the quality of these resources is very high and, relative to other cities in the region, are readily available. The report shows conclusively that Melbourne is a particularly competitive location for services and manufacturing industries which rely upon highly skilled labour and infrastructure services. The benchmarking study confirmed that business and government in Victoria is internationally minded and that the significant improvements in cost performance that have already been achieved are an on-going process.

It is particularly suited to working in the modern industrial environment which demands international best practice from all companies. Wage setting and industrial relations The overall aim of the Victorian Government is to create an industrial relations environment in which company managements are able to negotiate effectively with employees and their representatives to establish wages and other conditions of employment conducive to high level productive performance by enterprises. This positive employer-employee relations environment is being enhanced by the rapid transition, now well underway, from a centralised arbitration-based system to an enterprise bargaining system under which management and employees in individual enterprises negotiate directly on wages and conditions having full regard for the performance and prospects for their business. This transition is supported by direct State legislation (the Employee Relations Act 1992) and by moves by the Commonwealth Government to make direct bargaining at enterprise level underCommonwealth legislation more widely accessible. As well as individual employers, major representative groups including employer organisations and peak union bodies support the continued expansion of enterprise bargaining. The emergence of enterprise bargaining has been accompanied by, and facilitated major improvements to, work practices in increasing numbers of companies. In recent years, employers, employees and their representative organisations have been working towards improvements in award structures and work practices to increase labour productivity and the quality of the goods and services produced. These changes are taking place at industry and enterprise levels, and involve changes to working hours and payment systems, greater leave flexibility, new job classifications, multiskilling, and clearer links between training, skills and wages, leading to the creation of new career paths. The changes are directly aimed at improving productivity and efficiency to meet best practice standards. In those areas where there is significant union representation (comprising about 30% of the private sector workforce), there are now fewer unions involved in representing workers at particular workplaces. Unions are increasingly organised on an industry and enterprise basis rather than occupationally. The enterprise bargaining initiatives now spreading more widely throughout the workforce will provide greater impetus for stability in employer-employee relations. The system of compulsory arbitration in Australia administered by industrial tribunals, such as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, focuses on dispute resolution. This system is now playing a lesser role for larger numbers of companies, as, increasingly, wages and working conditions are resolved at individual enterprise level. It continues, however, to have significance in setting wages and conditions in a variety of industries. In Victoria, wages and conditions that are agreed under Victorian State law are established under individual or collective employment agreements made between the employer and the employee (or his/her representative). These employment agreements provide for the parties to negotiate freely to establish an agreement that reflects the circumstances and requirements of the particular workplace. Investors who are seeking to establish new business are able to do so in a still evolving but positive environment which is conducive to the maintenance of harmonious employer-employee relations.

Superannuation About four-fifths of Australias employees are now covered by some form of occupational superannuation. A range of schemes exist. Most provide for the employer to make a contribution, and many provide for employee contributions also. Since 1 July 1992, a Commonwealth Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) has been in operation, under which employers who do not provide the minimum levels of contribution for their employees are required to pay a charge to the Australian Taxation Office. The charge is equivalent to any shortfall in the prescribed minimum superannuation contributions plus an additional administration charge and a proxy for fund earnings, none of which are tax deductible. The minimum levels of superannuation increase annually as shown in the following table. Superannuation Guarantee Levy Employer superannuation contributions: minimum level Financial Year Payroll of $1 million or less (%) Payroll in excess of $1 million (%) 1993-94 3 5 1994-95 4 5 1995-96 5 6 1996-97 6 6 1997-98 6 6 1998-99 7 7 1999-00 7 7 2000-01 8 8 2001-02 8 8 2002-03 9 9 About 70% of employees are covered by industrial awards which require employers to contribute an amount of superannuation equivalent to at least 5% of the workers salary. Employer superannuation contributions made under industrial awards contribute to wards meeting the SGC minimum contribution levels. All employer contributions to an eligible superannuation fund and income derived from the fund are taxed at the concessional rate of 15%. WorkCover - Victoria's workers compensation scheme Victorian workers who sustain a workplace injury are covered under WorkCover. A major emphasis of the scheme is on returning injured employees to work. Basic rates of premium payable by employers vary between 0.4% and 7.0% of gross salary paid to employees, depending upon the degree of risk attached to the industrial activity at each workplace. These basic rates are adjusted up or down depending upon the employers claims experience. The standard rates of premium payable by employers in several industries are shown below. WorkCover standard premiums Industry description Rate % Accommodation 2.23 Cereal foods and baking mixes manufacturing 3.26 Chemical products manufacturing 2.23 Photographic equipment and optical instruments manufacturing 1.04 Electrical work 1.84 General engineering 2.70 Market and business consulting services 0.59 Leather, animal skins or fur tanning 3.26 Employers with a good claims record are eligible for reducedpremiums. These reductions may be substantial. In addition, employers withgood claims records who also meet certain financial and minimum sizecriteria may apply to self-insure.

This taxpayer-funded social wage provides a high standard of income support and health care in line with the social justice values that prevail in Australia. Health Care Medicare, the national health scheme, provides access to medical and basic hospital services for all citizens. Taxpayers contribute to the scheme by means of a 1.5% levy on taxable income. Patients attending the doctor of their choice for a medical consultation receive an insurance rebate equivalent to 85% of the Schedule fee for the service. To assist patients who need frequent medical attention, Medicare benefits increase to 100% of the Schedule fee when total potential payments exceed $258.10 in a year. Medicare also provides free hospital services in the public hospital system for public patients, and covers 75% of the Schedule fee for hospital treatment as a private patient. There is no maximum patient contribution for hospital treatment. Reciprocal agreements between Australia and some other countries including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Sweden, Malta, the Netherlands and Finland provide for visitors from these countries to receive immediately necessary treatment under the Medicare scheme while they are in Australia, and for Australian residents visiting these countries to receive health care under the particular country's public health scheme. In addition to Medicare, private health insurance schemes offer a range of cover to suit individual needs. Social security and welfare The Australian social security system is designed to assist people in economic hardship by providing targeted income support to people at risk because they are unemployed or are not expected to work because of age, invalidity, parental status or other factors. Lower and middle income families with children also receive additional support. Assistance is targeted towards those most in need. Most social security assistance is provided in the form of cash benefits payable to recipients who satisfy the relevant eligibility criteria. The amount received will depend on the particular circumstances of the recipient. Most rates of payment are indexed to movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to maintain their real value. Pensions and allowances Aged pensions are payable to women aged 61 and over (the age at which women can qualify will increase incrementally until it is the same as the male criteria) and to men aged 65 years and over, subject to residency requirements. Income and assets tests are applied to determine the rate of pension payable. Disability support pensions are payable to persons below aged pension age who cannot work full-time or support themselves because of a serious, long-term health problem or disability. There are special residency requirements. Disability support pensions, apart from the permanently blind who receive a non-means-tested pension, are subject to the same income and assets test as those applying to aged pensioners. Disability support entitlements are the same as for aged pensions. Sickness and unemployment assistance Sickness benefits are payable to persons who are unable to work because of temporary incapacity, and who have limited alternative means of support. The unemployed are assisted by an income support structure with two components: the Job Search Allowance available during the first 12 months of unemployment, and the Newstart Allowance for those unemployed for over 12 months.

Victoria's extensive university system undertakes teaching and research in the full range of professional and theoretical disciplines. University participation and graduation rates are higher in Victoria than in Australia as a whole, reflecting the State's strengths in knowledge and information-based industries. University students who are permanent residents of Australia generally pay a Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) as a partial contribution to the cost of their education. HECS is payable when students enrol in each year of their course, or it may be deferred until such time as the students income exceeds a prescribed level. A means-test-based grants scheme, known as Austudy, is available to upper secondary and full time tertiary students who are Australian citizens or permanent residents of Australia. The vocational education and training sector (also known in Victoria as the State Training System), is a major source of industrial skills and is also undergoing major expansion. TAFE (technical and further education) colleges provide training at professional, para-professional, post-trade, trade and operative levels. In addition, statewide accredited courses are also provided by more than 450 registered private providers (commercial colleges, industry and secondary colleges). The Victorian State training system, backed by the Victorian Government, provides high quality training focused on the needs of industry and a changing economy. Of key importance in the Victorian TAFE system are Industry Training Boards, which advise the State Training Board and private providers on industry training needs and how training resources should be developed and delivered. The State Training Systems comprehensive resources are also applied in partnership with companies in Australia and overseas as well as with foreign governments to provide commercial training on a fee for service basis. The fees charged at TAFE colleges vary depending upon the training required to meet individual client needs. All colleges charge a minimum enrolment and administration fee. Overseas students may apply for full-fee places in approved courses at Victorian universities and TAFE colleges. On a full fee basis, economics, commerce, law and other classroom-based courses in universities cost between $8,000 and $12,000 per year. Laboratory-based courses, such as science, engineering and agriculture, cost between $11,000 and $20,000 a year. School education Approximately three-quarters of students attend government schools which are generally co-educational and do not charge fees except for full-fee paying overseas students. The annual fees for full-fee paying overseas students attending government schools are in the following range: $4,400 for primary school students; $6,300 for junior secondary school students; and $8,000 for senior secondary school students. In addition to the school systems conducted by the Victorian Government through the Directorate of School Education there are independent or private schools and the school system provided by the Catholic Education Office. The majority of the private schools are affiliated to religious groups. Fees for the independent schools vary between schools and range from $6,000 to $8,000. Most independent schools provide places for overseas students and boarding facilities which range in cost from $8,000 to $12,000. The annual fees for overseas students within the Catholic education system range from $3,000 to $10,000. An independent Board of Studies provides a rigorous curriculum framework from the Preparatory year to Year 12. The schools are responsible for the detailed design of the greater part of their curricula within that framework established by the Board. The Board administers the provision of awards for the Victorian Certificate of Education at Years 11 and 12 in all schools. The International Baccalaureate is available in a number of independent and government schools. The school year of four terms usually commences at the beginning of February and ends in December.

To maintain Victoria's competitive edge, the Victorian Government is committed to measures that will improve performance and reduce costs to transport users. Road transport A network of modern arterial roads and freeways connects metropolitan Melbourne with regional and interstate centres, providing fast, cost-effective transport for goods and people within the State and beyond. Major projects such as the proposed City Link project are constantly maintaining and upgrading the network in urban and rural areas. Road freight is a world best practice support service in Victoria, with 110,000 trucks moving some 250 million tonnes of freight annually. Victorians have a high level of car ownership, reflecting high living standards and easy road access to work, shopping and recreational centres throughout the State. Air services Melbourne International Airport at Tullamarine is a major gateway to domestic and international destinations. The airport is just 22 kilometres from the centre of Melbourne. It operates 24 hours, seven days per week, and has the capacity for expansion to meet foreseeable demand until well into the next century. Melbourne International Airport is served by 42 international carriers and eight domestic carriers which transported some 11.1 million passengers in 1993-94. The airport is also a major freight port with 327,000 tonnes of cargo moved each year, reflecting the importance of air transport to Australia's international and domestic trade. A $247 million redevelopment program for Melbournes Airports international terminal is currently being undertaken, with Stage 2 due for completion by December 1995. The redevelopment includes the creation of significant new retailing facilities, the doubling of the international terminal handling capacity, and expansion of the number of international aircraft gate positions, customs and immigration counters, baggage reclaim carousels and check-in counters. There will also be a $55 million car park redevelopment with the construction of a multi-level car park expanding the current capacity of 1800 to 3200 spaces. An area of 13 hectares of land close to the existing freight terminals has been set aside for the development of new world class freight handling facilities, designed to position Melbourne as a major freight airport in the south-west Pacific region. Freight tonnage is projected to increase from its current annual level of 327,000 tonnes to 311,000 tonnes by 2000. Victorian airport services range from modern regional airports with full navigation facilities to minor airfields on the outskirts of most country towns. Daily scheduled services connect Melbourne with major centres in the more distant parts of the State, particularly in the west and north-west. In addition to its major airport, Melbourne is served by three other airfields, catering for general and specialist aviation services. Shipping The Port of Melbourne is Australasia's largest container and general cargo port. Operating 24 hours a day, it handles 40% of Australia's overseas container trade, almost double the volume of containers handled in Adelaide, Brisbane and Fremantle combined. In 1993-94 it handled 802,552 TEUs. There has been major structural change on the Melbourne waterfront in recent years. Today, most port services such as pilotage, towage, stevedoring, storage and transport are operated by private enterprise. The Port of Melbourne has 41 berths for commercial shipping. The port also offers multi-purpose berths which handle a full range of cargoes, from timber to motor vehicles, and specialised berths for dry cargoes, including cement, briquettes, sugar, soda ash and sulphur, and facilities for handling many liquid cargoes, from molasses to petrochemicals, using the latest bulk handling techniques. Back up support services are located either adjacent to, or within, the port area, and in variety and convenience are unmatched by any other Australian port. Melbourne's container parks are adjacent to berths and the port is also served by a large number of specialist support companies. As well as cool stores and empty container storage, services include delivery, cleaning, repair and maintenance, pre-tripping of reefer containers and road/rail transfer. Container handling rates at the port are among the most competitive in Australia and better than in many overseas ports. Truck queuing has virtually been eliminated and turnaround times have been reduced by approximately 50%. Melbourne offers shippers the advantage of close proximity to 70% of Australia's population. This ensures a favourable balance of imports and exports and guarantees the most efficient cargo exchanges in Australia. Proximity to the National Rail Corporation's Melbourne Freight Terminal at South Dynon is an additional advantage. The major upgrading of the terminal and the construction of a direct road link between Swanson Dock and the rail freight terminal provides for significant savings in the transfer of containers between the port and rail network. The port has also attracted private investment. The two private terminal operators at Swanson Dock (Patricks and Conaust) are committed to developing their facilities to operate at international best practice performance levels. Major investment for redevelopment of these terminals over the next 20 years will exceed $300 million. Victoria's other cargo ports The Port of Hastings, a natural deepwater harbour 65 kilometres south-east of Melbourne on Westernport Bay, specialises in bulk handling of oil, steel and gases. The Port of Geelong, on the western side of Port Phillip Bay, 65 kilometres south-west of Melbourne, handles grain, petroleum products and general industrial goods. The Port of Portland, 350 kilometres south-west of Melbourne, is a deepwater harbour used for exporting grain, live sheep and woodchips. It also serves a major aluminium smelter commissioned at Portland in 1990. Rail Freight Melbourne is linked by high speed rail services to all major industrial centres in Victoria and other mainland States. About 70% of long-haul rail traffic is containerised. Container handling in Melbourne is centralised at a modern rail terminal and intermodal interchange adjacent to the Port of Melbourne and the central business district. Costs of privately owned container movements by rail from Melbourne to major centres interstate are as follows: Costs per container ex Melbourne, 1 October 1995 Destination 6.1m (20ft) container (up to 5 tonnes gross) 12.2m (40ft) container (up to 5 tonnes gross) Per additional tonne Adelaide (South Australia) $276 $552 $13 Sydney (New South Wales) $344 $650 $13 Brisbane (Queensland) $760 $1285 $32 Source: National Rail Corporation Ltd. Costs of road haulage to and from the railhead are additional. Postal and light freight services The national postal service is operated by Australia Post which is headquartered in Melbourne. Australia Post provides a full range of letter and parcel services to all parts of Australia, including remote areas. Urban areas receive deliveries every working day, and twice daily (Monday to Friday) within the central business district of Melbourne. The cost of sending mail in Australia is among the lowest in the world with the domestic basic postage cost of 45 cents. Australia Post's domestic letter service provides customers with world-leading value for money. The letter service is faster, more reliable and more affordable than the leading postal service in the USA, UK, Canada, France, Sweden and the Netherlands. Australia's international mail rates for all classes of mail are also very competitively priced. For example, a standard airmail letter from Australia to Germany costs $1.20, whereas from Japan to Germany the equivalent item costs $2.70. Australia Post has an extensive international network and worldwide affiliations. In addition to standard rates of postage, Australia Post will negotiate substantial discounts for bulk mail and frequent large consignments, including publications. Intense competition in the courier and light freight markets has led to a proliferation of cost-effective services across Australia and to other countries. The world's major light freight operators, including TNT and the US-based United Parcel Service, operate in Australia and offer competitive services. Telecommunications Driven by the needs of a dispersed population on a large continent, which requires reliable and efficient international and domestic communications links, Australia has developed a telecommunications infrastructure the equal of any in the world. The domestic and international telecommunications carrier, Telstra Corporation, provides a comprehensive range of services including direct dial, packet switching, an integrated digital network, the cellular mobile, voice/data PABX, videotext and satellite services. Telstra is playing a leading role in the introduction of revolutionary services based on an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and optical fibre links. The telecommunications industry in Australia has been deregulated, and the increased competition will provide even greater stimulus for the provision of innovative and cost-effective services based on new technology. The second telecommunications carrier, Optus Communications, offers national and international long distance services and both analog and GSM cellular mobile services as well as a range of other business services. A third mobile carrier, Vodafone, also offers GSM digital mobile services.

Melbourne has been an active participant in this growth. The range, quality and sophistication of its financial services match those found in other international centres. Two of Australia's top four retail banks are headquartered in Melbourne, and Melbourne-based banks account for about 33% of national saving and trading operations. Altogether, 16 Australian and 18 foreign-owned banks operate in Melbourne, offering the full range of retail and trading services including commercial loans and leasing, corporate and property finance, money market and foreign exchange services. In addition, many non-bank financial intermediaries operate in Victoria, including seven Victorian building societies and an increasing number of major interstate societies which have recently been authorised to establish their operations in Victoria. A wide range of finance brokers, consultants, together with confirming, factoring and trade financiers and money market dealers also successfully conduct businesses based in Victoria. Futures markets in currencies and traded commodities are available through a network of specialist brokers. Specialist sources of investment finance include the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, which provides financial and other services to encourage development of the State's rural industries, and the Commonwealth-owned Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), which has a mandate to promote Australian industry. The AIDC operates on commercial lines - making loans, equity investment and offering detailed financial advisory services. Australian Stock Exchange - Melbourne The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) operates a national sharemarket linked through an automated trading system known as the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). Together with an automated settlement system known as CHESS, the Australian sharemarket is one of the most efficient in the world. Melbourne stockbrokers account for more than half of all capital raisings on the ASX. Three of Australia's five leading brokers are based in Melbourne.

A simplified zoning and planning permit procedure has been introduced into Victoria's planning system to better accommodate manufacturing industry and improve the investment climate for industry. Development is controlled by the provisions of the Planning and Environment Act 1987, the Environment Effects Act 1978, the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and the Environment Protection Act 1970. The Victorian Department of State Development co-ordinates government and semi-government approvals for private sector development proposals, as well as the provision of infrastructure. The Planning and Environment Act provides for the creation of municipal Planning Schemes, which are administered, in most cases, by the municipal authority. Development is controlled largely by the granting of permits, subject to conditions which must be met to the satisfaction of agencies such as the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the Department of State Development, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) and VicRoads. If a development is prohibited by the relevant Planning Scheme, the developer may ask the municipality for an amendment to that scheme - a rezoning - to allow the development. The Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act establishes a legal process to list and protect threatened plant and animal species and ecological communities. It is most relevant where a development is proposed for a greenfield site. Proposed developments that might impact on a listed species, community or protected flora require a permit from the Department of Natural Resourcesand the Environment. Developments which generate significant waste discharges to the environment are likely to be required to obtain a Works Approval and Licence from the EPA under the Environment Protection Act. The Works Approval process ensures that decisions on cleaner production options and environment management system requirements are resolved before construction. This minimises risks to the environment and provides greater certainty for industrial development. Other approvals or statements that might be required include a Health Impact Statement, a Trade Waste Agreement (for effluent discharged into the sewerage system), a Crown Lease of public land, and an Exploration and/or Mining Licence. An Environment Effects Statement might be required, at the discretion of the Minister for Planning, for projects likely to have a significant impact upon the environment.

These proven reserves can provide for the States electricity needs into the next century and beyond. International comparison indicates that Victoria has a well established record as a supplier of low priced electricity. Efficient and secure supply will be even further enhanced by a planned national electricity grid that will connect Victoria and other States. Victoria's electricity price structure Victoria's electricity supply industry has undergone significant restructure to ensure that its international competitiveness will be further strengthened. The entry of private sector companies has increased competition in the industry leading to lower prices to consumers. The State continues to offer the lowest electricity prices to industry and commerce in Australia. According to the annual survey of Australian electricity prices by energy analysts, NUS International, Melbourne consumers pay 5.74 cents per Kilowatt hour, well below the second lowest price of 6.69 cents per kWh in Adelaide.

Tariff 22 typically covers medium to larger users (consuming in the order of 6,840 GJ per annum). Large industrial and commercial users A competitive contract tariff is available to customers who consume more than 10 ,550 GJ of gas per year. The minimum bill is determined separately for each customer on the basis of annual load and load factors. At present, an industrial or commercial contract customer in Victoria with a steady load profile can expect to pay under $A3.50 per GJ for natural gas. The Gas and Fuel Corporation operates the Energy Management Centre, which provides advice to customers on energy use in industry and commerce. Services include energy audits, process analyses, tariff analyses, energy management systems, co-generation, new plant energy systems, alternative energy options and energy management training courses. Water and sewerage Prior to 31 December 1994, Melbourne Water provided and billed customers for water, sewerage, drainage and parks services. On 1 January 1995, three government-owned regionally-based companies were given responsibility for providing water and sewerage service to customers. Responsibility for metropolitan parks was transferred to a new statutory authority -Melbourne Parks and Waterways. Melbourne Water continues as a statutory authority with responsibility for: Water catchments, storage and bulk supply of water to the three retail companies; Acceptance of sewerage from the retailers, its treatment and disposal of effluent; and Main drainage, waterways and flood prevention. Each of the three retail companies bills its customers for the four charges (water, sewerage, drainage and parks). The moneys collected for drainage and parks are remitted to the two authorities responsible for these services. The water and sewerage charges shown below are fixed until 1 January 1997. Water, sewerage, drainage and planning charges Based on the Net Annual Value (NAV) of property as determined by the local municipal authority: Non-domestic water consumption: Charge is 65 cents per 1,000 litres per annum, less the amount paid in annual rates, equivalent to 2.585 cents in $ of NAV, with a minimum of $102.50. Sewerage: 4.216 cents in $ of NAV. Minimum charge $146.40. Drainage: 0.615 cents in $ of NAV. Minimum charge $44.00. Parks: 0.258 cents in $ of NAV. Minimum charge $41.00. Trade waste Category 1: If Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and/or suspended solids (SS) discharges are less than 1,000 kilolitres per annum, and the BOD and SS concentration is less than 600 mg/l, the charge is a flat rate of $353.00 per year. Category 2: If BOD and SS concentration is less than 600 mg/L and discharge is greater than 1,000 kilolitres per annum, the charge is 48.50 cents per 1,000 litres discharge. Category 3: If BOD and SS concentration is greater than 600 mg/L, the charge is 29.3 cents per kilolitre discharge plus 31.3 cents per kilogram of BOD and/or 15.4 cents per kilogram of SS. Charges also apply for colour of the waste, oxidised sulphur content and nitrogen content. These are in addition to category charges.

The Commonwealth of Australia comprises six States (of which Victoria is one) and two federal Territories. The powers of the Commonwealth Government, some of which are held concurrently with the States, are prescribed by the Commonwealth Constitution. Powers exclusive to the Commonwealth include international relations, defence and trade. Residual powers reside with the State Governments which are responsible for many important functions, including education, health, law and order, management of natural resources, transport and energy. In addition, each State has a system of local government to provide municipal services. In Victoria, local council responsibilities include detailed land-use planning, local health regulations, welfare and recreation services, local roads and traffic control, and garbage disposal.

Legal precedents established by courts under common law are modified by statute law made by Commonwealth and State parliaments within their respective jurisdictions. In their decision-making, the courts are independent of government. Most civil and criminal matters are heard by State and Territory courts. The Federal Court rules on matters associated with certain Commonwealth legislation, and the High Court of Australia hears constitutional matters and acts as the final court of appeal for all other courts. Family law and associated disputes are the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government and are settled in private by the Family Court of Australia. Australia is a signatory to major international treaties and conventions and it accepts the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. The legal profession is based in and regulated by each State and Territory. In Victoria, lawyers are either solicitors or barristers. Solicitors, who are hired directly by clients, carry out the bulk of legal work. If a matter has to go before a court, it will generally be argued by a barrister, who must be briefed by a solicitor on behalf of the client. Solicitors generally work in partnerships. Some are national firms, and the larger firms have international links and provide for the international legal requirements of businesses located in the State.

The Corporations Law regulates corporate entities and the securities and futures industries on an Australia-wide basis, and separate company registration is not required in the various States and Territories. The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is responsible for administering the law. The most common types of companies incorporated in Australia include public, proprietary, no liability, and foreign companies under the Corporations Law. Public companies To raise capital from the public, it is necessary to form a public company. The Corporations Law requires that details regarding directors and their periods of office must be kept and reported to the ASC. Every public company must have at least three directors, two of whom must be persons who ordinarily reside in Australia. An annual return of directors, members, capital and other particulars must be lodged with the ASC. All public companies must also submit to the ASC a copy of the latest balance sheet and profit and loss account, as audited, and a copy of the auditors report. Proprietary companies If there is no desire to raise public capital or loans, and there is no need to have more than 50 shareholders, or if it is desired to restrict the transfer of shares, the company may be formed as a proprietary limited company (commonly referred to as a private company). Distinguishing features of a proprietary company are that it: restricts the rights of its members to transfer their shares; limits membership to 50 (apart from employees and ex-employees); and prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for its shares, debentures or to deposit money with it. The proprietary company's annual return to the ASC must include a copy of the profit and loss account and balance sheet; it must show the capital at latest balance date; and it must certify that since the last return the company has not issued any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company, and that membership has not increased beyond 50. However, the law provides that in the case of a company classified as an exempt proprietary company, it need not include a copy of its financial statements with its annual return, if it is audited. An exempt proprietary company is a proprietary company which, in terms of ownership, is not associated with a public company. No liability companies The Corporations Law provides for a special form of company for mining purposes, the no liability company. Shareholders are under no contractual obligation to pay calls (as they are in a limited liability company), but shares on which calls remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture, and then to sale at public auction. These companies are governed by a special section of the Law. Foreign companies A foreign company wishing to carry on business in Australia must register under the Corporations Law. A foreign company may transfer its place of incorporation to Australia under certain conditions. These include the requirement that transfer of incorporation must be provided for by the laws under which the company was originally incorporated. The company must not be externally administered. If registered, the application for transfer of incorporation will form the application as a company under the Law. A foreign company must lodge annually copies of its balance sheet and its profit and loss account with the ASC. A company that is predominantly foreign owned may increase the level of Australian participation in its operations by entering into a naturalisation process. A company wishing to become a naturalising company must meet certain pre-conditions. It is required to: have a minimum of 25% Australian equity; provide in its Articles of Association for a majority of Australian citizens on its board; and give a public commitment to increase Australian equity to 51%, subject to agreed understandings between the company, major shareholder interests and the Government, and to have regular discussions with the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) on progress towards achieving 51% Australian ownership. On achieving 51% Australian ownership, and on reaching understandings with the Government and major shareholder interests about the exercise of voting powers in respect of the company's business in Australia, a company will be granted naturalised status. Companies that undertake naturalisation may avail themselves of certain benefits. The only criterion for approval of proposals examinable under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act by naturalised companies (other than in the media, banking and uranium sectors, where additional conditions exist) is that proposals be judged not contrary to the national interest. Furthermore, a naturalised company is not required to give notification of proposals to develop a new natural resource project where it intends to proceed on its own or in partnership with other naturalised, naturalising or Australian companies. Company formation Applications for incorporation must be made to the ASC. A Memorandum of Association together with Articles of Association must be drawn up and submitted to the ASC when applying for registration, except in the case of a proprietary company which need not lodge memorandum or articles with the ASC, but must prepare and retain them so that they are available to the ASC if required. The Memorandum of Association sets out the name of the company, number and nominal value of shares, limitation of liability, subscribers names and addresses, and may include a statement of objects. The Articles of Association formally state the rules governing the management of a company. A standard set of Articles is contained in the Corporations Law and a company may choose to adopt these in preference to writing its own. Australian courts will protect the rights of shareholders as set out in the Articles and in the Corporations Law, irrespective of the domicile of shareholders.

Notification The types of proposals by foreign interests to invest in Australia which should be notified to the Government can be summarised as follows: acquisitions of substantial interests in existing Australian businesses with total assets of over $5 million ($3 million for rural properties); plans to establish new businesses involving a total investment of over $10 million; investments in the media irrespective of size; direct investments by foreign governments or their agencies irrespective of size; acquisitions of non-residential commercial real estate valued at over $5 million; acquisitions of residential real estate irrespective of size (unless exempt under regulations); takeovers of offshore companies whose Australian subsidiaries or assets are valued at over $20 million or account for more than 50% of the target companys global assets; and proposals where any doubt exists as to whether they are notifiable. A foreign interest is briefly defined as: a natural person not ordinarily resident in Australia; and any corporation, business or trust in which there is a substantial foreign interest, that is, in which a single foreigner (and any associates) has 15% or more of the ownership or in which several foreigners (and any associates) have 40% or more in aggregate of the ownership. Examination by sector The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 applies to most examinable proposals and provides penalties for non-compliance. Proposals where the target assets or the planned investment outlays exceed the notification thresholds set out above, but below $50 million, will normally be approved without examination. The Commonwealth Government examines proposals to acquire existing businesses (with total assets over $50 million) or establish new businesses (with total investment over $50 million) in the following industry sectors: rural properties, agriculture, forestry, fishing, resource processing, oil and gas, mining (excluding uranium), manufacturing, non-bank financial institutions, insurance, sharebroking, tourism (hotels and resorts) and most other services. No objections are raised to those proposals unless they are contrary to the national interest. Offshore takeovers generally do not raise national interest issues. Investments in real estate, banking, civil aviation, radio and television, newspapers and uranium mining are subject to special guidelines. Those governing foreign investment in real estate are outlined below. Foreign acquisition of real estate Proposed acquisitions of residential real estate are exempt from examination in the case of Australian citizens living abroad and foreign nationals entitled to permanent residence in Australia. Proposed acquisitions of real estate for development (within 12 months) are normally approved unless they are contrary to the national interest. Foreign interests are normally given approval to buy vacant residential land (on condition that construction of a dwelling is commenced within 12 months) and to buy home units, townhouses etc. off-the-plan, under construction or newly constructed but never occupied or sold, on condition that no more than half of the units in any one development are sold to foreign interests. Proposed acquisitions of residential property (both vacant land and existing dwellings), which are within the bounds of a resort that the Treasurer has designated as an Integrated Tourist Resort, are exempt from examination. All other proposals by foreign interests to acquire developed residential real estates are examinable and are not normally approved except in the case of foreign companies buying for their senior executives resident in Australia, and foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for more than 12 months buying for their own use as a principal residence (subject to the sale of the property when they cease to reside in Australia). Proposed acquisitions of developed non-residential commercial real estate above $5 million are approved, unless contrary to the national interest. (Proposals below $5 million are exempt from examination). The FIRB seeks to deal with proposals quickly and efficiently. The majority of proposals are, considered by the Board and decisions reached by the Government within 30 days of a proposals lodgement.

The value of the Australian dollar is determined in a floating exchange rate system whereby foreign exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market. The market for Australian dollars is very liquid - in April 1992 the Australian dollar was the ninth most actively traded currency in the world. In Australia, foreign exchange dealers are authorised and monitored by Australia's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and must meet certain minimum prudential and operating standards. There are a large number of authorised foreign exchange dealers, both bank and non-bank, and the market is highly competitive. A full range of foreign exchange services is available, including foreign currency loans and deposits, foreign currency accounts, forward exchange transactions and derivative products. The Reserve Bank is also responsible for administering the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. In general, Australia does not impose any exchange controls, but it does enforce financial sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, the public is required to report the carrying or sending of Australian or foreign currency (cash) worth $5,000 or more, into or out of Australia, to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).

There is no value-added tax in Australia, no estate or gift taxes and no separate social security level, although a Medicare levy of 1.5% of taxable income is payable. Commonwealth taxes Personal income tax Income tax is levied only by the Commonwealth Government and is assessed on companies, trustees and individuals. Income subject to tax assessment under the Income Tax Assessment Act includes wages, professional fees, profits, dividends, rental income, interest and royalties. Income tax is self-assessed. Residents pay tax on income derived both within Australia and overseas. However, income derived from overseas by Australian residents on which foreign tax has been paid is either exempt from Australian tax or it attracts a tax credit. The marginal rates of personal income tax for 1995-96 for residents and non-residents are: Resident's Income ($ per annum) (%) Tax rate $5,401 - $20,700 20.0 $20,701 - $38,000 34.0 $38,001 - $50,000 43.0 greater than $50,000 47.0 Non-resident's Income ($ per annum) (%) Tax rate $0 - $20,700 29.0 $20,701 - $38,000 34.0 $38,001 - $50,000 43.0 greater than $50,000 47.0 Corporate income tax The Commonwealth Government levies company tax at the rate of 36%. Corporate profits of either a subsidiary or a branch of an overseas company are taxed at the company rate. Dividend imputation A dividend imputation system relieves company income distributed to resident individual shareholders from double taxation. Franked dividends, that is, dividends paid from company income which has been taxed, carry either a full or a partial imputation credit for shareholders. The shareholder who pays personal income tax at a marginal rate of less than the company tax rate receives fully-franked dividend income free of tax because company tax has already been paid at the company level, and receives a tax credit which enables him/her to reduce tax payable on other income in the relevant tax year. The shareholder whose personal marginal tax rate exceeds the company tax rate is required to pay income tax to make up the difference between the two rates. Fully-franked dividends are exempt from dividend withholding tax. In the case of partially-franked dividends, the balance of any dividend that is unfranked is subject to a 30% dividend withholding tax, or 15% (usually) if the shareholder is a resident of a country which has a double taxation agreement with Australia. Taxation of foreign source income Low-taxed passive income (e.g. dividends, interest and royalties) derived by Australian-controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and through certain trusts may be attributed to shareholders or beneficiaries and taxed in Australia on an accruals basis. A non-resident company is defined as a CFC if a control test is satisfied. Income is usually attributed only to shareholders with a substantial interest of 10% or more in a CFC. Attribution of the passive income derived by a CFC depends on the country of residence of the CFC. Most passive income derived by a company resident in a country with a tax system comparable to Australia's is outside the CFC regime, and dividends from subsidiaries in such countries are exempt from tax in Australia. Countries included in the list of comparable-tax jurisdictions are determined by several criteria, such as whether direct taxation is levied on income or profits, whether the tax base is comprehensive, whether special tax incentives facilitate international profit shifting and whether the corporate income tax rate is at least 25%. Some countries may be given a qualified listing where designated tax concessions are identified. Passive income that has benefited from a designated tax concession will normally be attributable. Where a country is not listed as a comparable tax jurisdiction, the passive income of the company will generally be attributable to shareholders unless it is 5% or less of the CFCs gross turnover. Income to be attributed to Australian shareholders is calculated according to Australian tax law and, for this purpose, CFCs are treated as if they are Australian residents. The foreign investment fund (FIF) measures, which apply accruals taxation to certain non-controlling interests held by Australian resident trusts, took effect in January 1993. The measures also apply to certain foreign life assurance policies that have an investment component, such as life bonds. Generally, all other non-export foreign income not attributed under the CFC or FIF measures is taxed on remittance to Australia under the foreign tax credit system. A resident taxpayer whose assessable income includes foreign income is entitled to a credit for the amount of foreign tax paid, up to the limit of the amount of Australian tax that would have been payable if the income were derived in Australia. Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) PDFs are a new type of investment company that attract a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% (see Pooled Development Funds). Offshore Banking Units Taxable income derived from pure offshore banking transactions by an authorised offshore banking unit in Australia is effectively taxed at the concessional rate of 10% from July 1992. Regional Headquarters Approved regional headquarters are able to access certain tax exemptions and deductions. Deductions Business expenses: Expenses are generally deductible to the extent they are incurred in the production of assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Ordinary business expenses include salaries, wages, purchases of trading stock, rents, lease costs, interest paid, bad debts, travelling costs, and repairs and maintenance. Depreciation and amortisation: New plant and equipment is eligible to be depreciated at rates which are accelerated beyond effective life rates. Taxpayers may choose prime cost or diminishing value methods of depreciation although once depreciation has been claimed for an asset under one method it must continue to be depreciated under that method. The rates applying to plant and equipment acquired or commenced to be constructed after 26 February 1992 and the corresponding implied write-off lives are: Effective life class (years) Depreciation rate Prime cost % Depreciation rate Diminishing value % Implied write-off life % Less than 3 100 100 1.00 3 to less than 5 40 60 2.50 5 to less than 6 2/3 27 40 3.75 6 2/3 to less than 10 20 30 5.00 10 to less than 13 17 25 6.00 13 to less than 30 13 20 7.50 30 and over 7 10 15.00 Capital expenditure on the construction of industrial buildings is able to be written off at the rate of 4% per annum on a straight line basis. Other income-producing buildings and structural improvements are eligible to be written off at 2.5% per annum. Tax incentives Research and development tax concession: (see tax concession). Loss carry-forward: Losses incurred before 1 July 1989 may be carried forward for seven years. If incurred on or after that date, they may be carried forward indefinitely provided that more than 50% of the shares held in the loss carry-forward is used, or provided the company continues to carry on the same business it operated prior to the change in ownership. Capital losses may only be offset against capital gains. No provision is made for a carry-back of tax losses for offset against prior year income. Loss relief is available for companies within a group. Treatment of groups of companies: Income losses incurred by a company wholly-owned by a resident group of companies may be transferred and offset against the taxable income of other profitable companies in the group. It is necessary for the loss company and the profit company to be in the same group of companies in the loss year, the transfer year and any intervening period. Group companies are defined to be companies that are 100% owned by the same parent. It is not necessary that resident group companies be owned by an Australian holding company provided they ultimately share a common overseas parent. Capital losses may be transferred to other members of the group to be offset only against capital gains. Excess foreign tax credits may also be transferred. Capital gains tax The capital gains tax (CGT) generally applies only to capital gains realised on the disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985. The CGT provisions are catch-all provisions - the provisions embrace not only capital gains as opposed to revenue gains but all gains that arise on the disposal of assets, subject to certain exceptions, exclusions and limitations. If the gain is also assessable as income under some other provision of the Act, then the amount of the capital gain is accordingly reduced. Except for assets disposed of within 12 months of their acquisition, only real capital gains are assessed for taxation - this is achieved by indexing the cost base of an asset to the Consumer Price Index. For CGT purposes, all capital gains and losses incurred during a year by a taxpayer are netted. If a net capital gain results, this is included in the taxpayer's assessable income; but if a net capital loss results, this is not deductible from assessable income but is carried forward to the next succeeding year of income and used in the calculation of the taxpayer's net capital gain or net capital loss for that year. It should be noted that the loss is carried forward without indexation. Rollovers, that is, deferral of CGT liability when the ownership of an asset changes are allowed for certain involuntary asset disposals (including on the death of a taxpayer) and for certain business reorganisations in which the underlying ownership of the asset does not change or where the underlying assets against which the taxpayer has the claim do not change. Double taxation agreements Double taxation agreements (DTAs) operate to prevent double taxation by assigning taxing rights according to the source of income and residence of the taxpayer, and by limiting certain taxing rights between countries. DTAs also make provision for mutual agreement procedures where the DTA by itself cannot resolve a particular dispute, and contain provisions designed to enable countries to exchange information to combat avoidance and evasion. Australia has DTAs with the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, France, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Philippines, Switzerland, Malaysia, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Korea, Norway, Malta, Finland, Austria, China, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Hungary, Kiribati, India, Poland, Indonesia, Spain and Vietnam. Australia also has airline profits agreements with France, Italy, Greece and China. Taxation of non-residents Non-residents are subject to Australian taxation on their Australian source income. This is generally subject to tax in the same way as the income of residents. Foreign employees working in Australia for an Australian company are subject to tax on all earning from the company. Short-term visitors (less than 183 days) do not qualify as residents for taxation purposes and are subject to income tax at rates applicable to non-resident taxpayers. Long-term visitors might qualify for consideration as residents of Australia for taxation purposes and would be subject to income tax at rates applicable to resident taxpayers. The income of foreign employees working for foreign companies in Australia (subject to the provisions of Australias DTAs concerning the duration of employment) is taxable in Australia. The amount of tax payable will vary depending on whether the visitor is considered to be a resident or a non-resident for taxation purposes. Dividends and royalties paid to non-residents are subject to a withholding tax of 30% (generally limited to 15% and 10% respectively in Australias DTAs). Non-residents are exempt from dividend withholding tax to the extent that the dividend is paid out of projects that have borne Australian income tax, that is, to the extent that they carry imputation credits. Interest withholding tax is generally levied at a flat rate of 10% on the gross amount of interest paid to non-residents. Wholesale sales tax The Commonwealth Government imposes a wholesale sales tax (WST) which generally applies to the last wholesale sale of goods that have not previously been used in Australia. WST also applies where goods are not sold by wholesale (for example, where they are sold by retail by a manufacturer or where a manufacturer applies the goods to his/her own use). WST is paid on the wholesale selling price of the goods or, where there is no wholesale sale, alternative values are used. Services are not subject to tax. Rates of WST vary. As from 1 July 1995, the general rate of tax is 22%. However, a range of household goods (such as whitegoods and furnishings) and certain foods and beverages (for example, confectionery and fruit juices) are taxed at the concessional rate of 12%; certain goods (including furs, jewellery, TVs and stereos) are taxed at 32%, and luxury cars are taxed at a marginal rate of 45%. In addition, many products are exempt from WST, including most food and clothing, medicines and books. Tobacco and petroleum are exempt from WST but are subject to customs and excise duties. Goods for use by certain bodies, such as government departments and public hospitals, may also be exempt, as are a wide range of goods for use as inputs to goods production. People who deal in taxable goods must register and are generally required to lodge returns and pay tax on a monthly basis (21 days after the end of the month), although taxpayers whose annual WST liability is less than $53,959 have the option of lodging returns on a quarterly basis. Importers are required to pay tax at the time of local entry. Registration is encouraged for businesses which do not deal in taxable goods to allow them to more easily gain exemption on their purchases of business inputs (such as primary producers which sell exempt goods and are allowed to purchase a wide range of equipment and materials exempt from WST). Customs and excise duties The Commonwealth Government imposes customs and excise duties. Excise duties apply to alcoholic beverages (but not wine), tobacco and petroleum fuels (although various rebates of excise are available in respect of diesel purchased for off-road use by certain users such as in mining and primary production. In March 1991, the Commonwealth Government announced substantial changes to the assistance arrangements for manufacturing industries. There is a general program of tariff reductions, which began in 1988, with most higher tariffs phasing down to 5% by 1 July 1996; the import quotas applying to textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) have been terminated; the bounties applying to certain TCF goods are to be phased out by 1995; and the tariffs applying to TCF and passenger motor vehicle (PMV) imports are to be substantially reduced by the year 2000. Fringe benefits tax Generally, any employer providing a non-cash benefit to an employee or an associated of the employee is subject to fringe benefits tax. If fringe benefits tax is paid by the employer, the benefits are not taxable in the hands of the employee. From 1 April 1994, fringe benefits tax became payable by the employer on the tax-inclusive value of any fringe benefits and fringe benefits tax became deductible for income tax purposes. Examples of fringe benefits subject to this tax include: car parking facilities provided to employees who use a car to commute to and from work; motor cars provided for employee's personal use; free or subsidised accommodation; low or interest-free loans; discounted goods or services provided by the employer in excess of a specified threshold; payment or reimbursement of private expenses on behalf of employees; waiver of employee loans or debts; a portion of a living-away-from-home allowance paid to an employee. The fringe benefits tax year-end is 31 March. The tax rate for the year commencing on 1 April 1995 is 48.475%. For those with a previous-year tax liability of $3,000 or more, tax is payable in quarterly instalments of 25% of the previous year's liability, with the balance payable when the annual return is filed. An employer generally must file an annual return by 28 April each year. Victorian State taxes Payroll tax Payroll tax is payable in all Australian States and Territories and is administered separately by each State, each having its own legislation with some differing provisions and exemptions levels. In Victoria, payroll tax is a tax on wages (the definition of wages includes wages, salaries, remuneration, commission, bonuses, allowances and fringe benefits) paid or payable by an employer or deemed employer unless the wages are considered exempt under the Payroll Tax Act 1971. The rate of tax, since 1 November 1990, stands at 7% and is payable when an employer's total Australian wages exceed the general exemption level, currently $42,917 per calendar month or $515,000 per annum. Stamp duties Stamp duty is a tax imposed on certain documents and transactions and is payable on documents affecting the purchase of various assets including land, shares and motor vehicles. In addition, there are also document duties on mortgages, leases of non-residential property and deeds. Transactions involving the hire of goods, life assurance and general insurance are also liable to duty. In Victoria, duties charged vary with the type and value of the transaction or document. Most documents are charged stamp duty based on the total monetary value of the particular transaction. However, some documents are subject to a fixed or flat stamp duty charge. Duty on property transfers are levied as follows: Duty for transfer of land Value of property Stamp duty charged $0 - $20,000 1.4% of the value of the property $20,001 - $100,000 $280 plus 2.4% of the value exceeding $20,000 $100,001 - $760,000 $2,200 plus 6% of the value exceeding $100,000 $760,001 plus $41,800 plus 5.5% of the value of the property Land tax In Victoria, land tax is an annual tax on the unimproved value (municipal site value adjusted by an equalisation factor and excluding the value of buildings or other improvements) of all Victorian land owned by a landowner as at midnight on 31 December in the year prior to the year of assessment. Therefore, the amount of tax payable for 1995 is based upon the total unimproved value of all land owned at midnight on 31 December 1995. Any owner possessing land solely, or jointly, with an unimproved value exceeding $200,000 must pay land tax unless the land is considered exempt under the Land Tax Act 1958. The scale for 1995 is set out in the following table: Unimproved value Tax rate $0 - $199,999 Nil $200,000 - $539,999 $60 plus 0.2 cents for every dollar in excess of $200,000 $540,000 - $2,699,999 $740 plus 3 cents for every dollar in excess of the $540,000 $2,700,000 plus $65,540 plus 5 cents for every dollar in excess of $2,700,000 Miscellaneous Victorian taxes and duties There are also a number of other Victorian taxes and charges. Financial institutions duty (FID): generally charged on all receipts of money by financial institutions at a rate of 0.06% of the amount received up to a maximum rate of $1200 on any one transaction. A concessional rate of 0.005% applies to receipts of short-term dealings by registered short-term money market operators. Debits tax: generally charged on all debits to accounts with cheque drawing facilities. The tax rate ranges from 30 cents for debits between $1 to $100 and up to $4 for debits of $10,000 or more. Local government taxes and charges Local councils levy rates for the provision of services to property owners, such as garbage collection, the maintenance of roads and footpaths, and recreational and community services. Rates are set annually by each council, usually as a proportion of the net annual value (NAV) of land or the site value (which includes the value of improvements to land such as excavations, gradings, levellings). Some councils may vary the rate levied and the method of calculation according to the use to which the land is put.

The main vehicle for the promotion and recruitment of investment is the Investment Promotion Program (IPP). The Program is administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST) in conjunction with Austrade. Major activities under the Program involve the promotion of Australia as a location for foreign direct investment to likely investors, the provision of detailed investment briefs for both new investment and reacting to matchmaking opportunities, major project facilitation and the co-ordination of investment missions and site visits. Most of the promotion and facilitation work within the IPP is done by Austrade, internationally through its Investment Commissioner posts in various countries, and locally through its Investment Office (Investment Australia). DIST undertakes the preparation of promotional material and policy development for the Program. The IPP is undertaken within a framework of co-operation with the promotion and facilitation activities of the States and Territories. There are several sub-programs of the IPP that offer specific forms of assistance to prospective investors. Regional Headquarters Marketing Program This initiative, which commenced in September 1993, is designed to encourage companies to invest in Australia as a base for operations in the Asian region. The Commonwealth Government offers various forms of assistance to companies which locate their regional headquarters (RHQs) in Australia: certain foreign source dividends passed through a resident company to a non-resident shareholder will be exempt from dividend withholding tax (DWT); certain costs associated with the establishment of RHQs in Australia will be deductible expenses for Australian tax purposes, being costs which in most cases would otherwise be treated as capital and hence be non-deductible. Where, during establishment and early operations, a RHQ is not an operating business and therefore not a taxable entity, eligible costs will be allowed to be carried as deductions against assessable income in the following year. Also, any tax loss of an operating business will be allowed to be carried forward indefinitely, subject to current arrangements; on a case-by-case basis, the provision of a wholesale sales tax exemption for imported used computer and computer-related equipment for RHQ investment proposals; and a streamlined immigration process for RHQ employees seeking residence. Significant numbers of international companies have established regional headquarters in Melbourne in recent years including both large, well known and smaller firms. These have included Campbell Soups, Oracle Corporation, Dun and Bradstreet, Chiquita and Hella. Research and Development Marketing Campaign This initiative is modelled on the IPP's RHQ campaign and aims to encourage multinational companies to locate their Asia-Pacific R&D activities in Australia and to capitalise on Australia's abilities in science, innovation and leading edge information, telecommunications, multimedia and other technologies. Feasibility Study Consultancy Fund (FSCF) This fund provides support for feasibility studies to encourage new investment in value-adding, advanced manufacturing or internationally traded services. Proposals must have a minium initial capital investment of $10 million or have the support of a State or Territory Government. The Commonwealth provides funds to match those of the State or Territory up to a maximum contribution of $50,000. Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST) The Department of Industry, Science and Technology has several programs to support innovation and research and development in Australian industry. These programs are designed to strengthen the international competitiveness and export orientation of Australian business. New technologies emerging from R&D lead to the creation of innovative products and processes and the identification of market opportunities all over the world. Programs include: Tax Concessions for Research and Development; Competitive Grants for Research and Development; Concessional Loans for Commercialisation of Technological Innovation; Access to Export Finance; Technology Access; Advanced Manufacturing Technology. Agri-food Industries Program Tax Concessions for Research and Development A deduction of 150% is allowable for qualifying expenditure incurred on research and development activities carried on in Australia. A company's total research and development expenditure for the year must be greater than $20,000 to qualify for the full concession. The results of the R&D must be exploited on normal commercial terms and must benefit the Australian economy. The concessional deduction is available to companies, partnerships of companies and to public trading trusts. To be eligible for the concession the company must be registered with the Industry Research and Development Board. As of 6 December 1995, companies must register no later than six months after the end of the financial year in which the R&D expenditure was incurred. There will be a one-off exception period of six months from 6 December 1995 for taxpayers to register in respect of expenditure in 1993-94 to 1994-95. Expenditure directly incurred on undertaking eligible R&D activities can be claimed. Claims should be made on an individual project basis and must be based on actual incurred expenditure. Eligible items include wages, allowances, bonuses, overtime and penalty rates, annual sick and long service leave, superannuation fund contributions, payroll tax and workers compensation premiums. Expenditure on plant, including pilot plant, used exclusively for research and development, is deductible at a rate of 150% over three years. Competitive Grants for Research and Development Companies that are eligible for the R&D tax concession as well as companies that may not currently be profitable, or have carry-forward losses which do not enable them to take full advantage of the tax concession can apply for Competitive Grants for Research and Development. Private discretionary and unit trusts (not eligible for the tax concession) can also apply. The maximum grant is 50% of project costs. Grants are provided on a competitive basis for: market driven R&D in firms needing assistance, but unable to gain full financial benefit from the 150% tax concession for research and development; collaborative R&D activities, that are high risk, but could provide extensive benefit to Australia; trial and demonstration activities between technology developers and potential customers; and collaborative R&D activity between industry and research institutions. Projects must involve research and development or trial or demonstration of internationally competitive products, processes, systems or services, and the results of the project must be exploited for the benefit of Australia. Grants are awarded competitively to eligible projects. Concessional Loans for Commercialisation of Technological Innovation This program is available to companies incorporated in Australia, partnerships and trusts employing less than 100 persons. Concessional loans support the early commercialisation of technological innovation of goods, systems or services. The maximum loan is 50% of project costs. Loans will be made for a maximum of three years from the date of the loan agreement, with repayment commencing after 42 months. Interest is calculated daily at 40% of the Commonwealth Bank Loan Reference Rate and will accrue three years from the date of the loan agreement. Projects must involve early commercialisation of technological innovations for products, processes, systems or services. Support will be limited to: product/process design; trial production runs including tooling-up costs; regulations and standards compliance; protection of core intellectual property; trial and demonstration activities; and product documentation. Loans are awarded competitively to eligible projects. Access to Export Finance The program is intended to identify sources of export finance appropriate to exporter's needs, and to help them obtain assistance in preparing proposals for export finance. Applicants will be reimbursed 50% of the costs incurred in obtaining expert advice on options for financing an export transaction and the subsequent preparation of a proposal for export finance. Small, new exporters employing less than 30 employees who have begun exporting in the last five years and have annual export sales of $5 million or less are eligible. An exporter must first have paid an expert provider of advice for assistance in preparing a proposal for export finance, and must have lodged the proposal with an export finance provider. Technology Access Program This program is designed to facilitate the establishment of an Australian technology network to improve the manufacturing industry's access to technology and technical advice. It is readily accessible by firms at all levels, but places particular emphasis on servicing small to medium enterprises in the manufacturing sector. Funding by way of competitive grants is made available for groups of institutions or centres to upgrade or expand their facilities and services offered to manufacturing firms. Advanced Manufacturing Technology - Investment Evaluation Guidelines This program is designed to address the detailed technology issues confronting many firms and provides a means of determining whether an investment in technology is justified. The Investment Evaluation Guidelines assist firms to focus on priorities and identify technologies which are consistent with their company's strategic objectives. They assist firms to evaluate the technical, operational and financial feasibility of the technologies. Eligible companies can receive a subsidy through AusIndustry to assist them in meeting the costs of employing a licenced consultant to help implement the Investment Evaluation Guidelines. Agri-food Industries Program This is a joint government-industry strategy to improve the international competitiveness of the Australian processed food and other value-added food industries. Priority areas for activity are workplace reform, trade and investment, clean food export, food quality, innovation, links between growers and processors, networking, regulatory reform, transportation, food packaging and import replacement. Pooled Development Funds The Pooled Development Funds scheme assists in making equity capital available for small and medium-sized enterprises. The scheme provides a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% for special investment companies, known as Pooled Development Funds (PDFs). The sole purpose of PDFs is to provide new equity capital in Australian resident companies which have total assets of less than $50 million and are seeking funds to expand production or markets. Dividends paid by a PDF are tax exempt in the hands of the investor. In the case of franked PDF dividends, investors may elect to include the dividends in their taxable income and so gain the benefits of the imputation system. Capital gains on the disposal by investors of PDF shares are also tax exempt. PDFs are not permitted to borrow, except for short term liquidity purposes, nor are they allowed to buy back their own shares. They are permitted to invest up to 30% of their funds in any one enterprise, with investments being for at least 10% of the paid-up capital of an investee company. PDFs are also prohibited from investing in retailing operations, or real estate except for tourism or manufacturing projects. The PDF scheme started in 1992 and was slow to gain acceptance amongst the business community. Only 11 companies were registered under the scheme in the first two years. The Government, in consultation with business, made some changes that were designed to make the scheme more attractive. These changes were introduced in 1994 and in the year since, 16 additional companies have been registered making a total of 27 PDFs with about $61 million under management as at July 1995. Invest Australia Infrastructure Borrowings (Develop Australia Bonds) Invest Australia, a trading name of the Development Allowance Authority, a statutory office within the Commonwealth Treasurer's portfolio, approves access to Develop Australia Bonds. The bonds extend preferred taxation status for investment in important Australian infrastructure projects. Develop Australia Bonds are a specific form of debt used to finance infrastructure projects. The term reflects the role of the bonds in the development of community infrastructure in Australia. Invest Australia does not itself issue Develop Australia Bonds. Its role is to approve proposals that meet the Government's policy aims for provision of specific forms of private sector infrastructure. Develop Australia Bonds is a generic term that includes bonds, debentures, discounted securities and any other form of indebtedness. There is no upper or lower limit on the size of the debt. The key benefits of the bonds are: interest paid to lenders is tax free, or a rebate may be claimed; capital gains on disposal of securities are exempt; expenses incurred by the lender are deductible; interest paid is not deductible by the borrower; and the concession is available for up to 15 years. Infrastructure projects with lengthy construction periods may not produce assessable income for some years and may accumulate tax losses in the early stages of development. When taxpayers borrow to finance the construction of these projects, they are often unable to access interest deductions available to them. By making interest on Develop Australia Bonds non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower, the tax benefit of the interest deduction is transferred to the lender in the form of non-assessable interest income. This enables funds to be raised at a lower interest rate, and borrowing costs are reduced. Specifically, Develop Australia Bonds can lower the cost of finance for private sector infrastructure projects. This is attractive, in straight price terms, to taxpayers with high marginal rates. A tax rebate of 36% is also available as an alternative to increase the attractiveness to low tax rate investors, including superannuation funds. Key criteria for eligibility for Develop Australia Bonds are: the infrastructure facility must be operated commercially; the public must be charged for use of the facility; the facility must be operated by the private sector, or a government body acting on a commercial basis, for 25 years after completion; and the facility must be in an eligible sector comprising water supply or treatment, sewerage and wastewater, roads, railways, seaports (wharves and docks), electricity, air transport, gas transmission, as well as necessary related facilities (e.g. rolling stock in the case of a railway). Austrade Austrade is the agency of the Commonwealth Government responsible for international business facilitation and assisting Australian companies to expand exports. Austrade's services include: the provision of basic information and counselling; planning, market entry/promotion activities; investment advice; the development of industry sector strategies; and export assistance. Austrade's overseas operations concentrate on markets with significant trade opportunities where Australian-based companies face particular problems such as language and cultural differences. North Asia and South-east Asia are of special importance. Fees are charged for most Austrade products. Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) The EMDG scheme aims to encourage Australian exporters to seek and develop overseas markets for goods, services, intellectual property rights and industrial expertise that are substantially of Australian origin. The scheme provides financial incentives to Australian residents in the form of taxable cash grants based on expenditure incurred for the purpose of seeking and developing overseas export markets. Eligible areas of spending include overseas market research, overseas advertising, overseas representation, participation in overseas exhibitions and fairs, bringing overseas buyers to Australia, foreign language training and export education courses. Expenditure related to trade with New Zealand is excluded. Grants are calculated as 50% of eligible expenditure in excess of $15,000, subject to a minimum eligible expenditure threshold of $30,000 with a maximum grant of $200,000 in any one year. A maximum of eight grants are generally payable to any one recipient. However, those claimants who undertake promotions in new markets as defined in the legislation may be eligible for an additional three grants for each new market entered. After grants have been received for two years, the maximum grant is the lesser of the amount calculated according to the above formula and a percentage of export earnings as shown in the following table: Year for which grant is received Percentage of export earnings 3rd 40.0 4th 20.0 5th 10.0 6th 7.5 7th,8th and following 'new maket' claims 5.0 Grants are not paid to claimants with export earnings in excess of $25 million in a grant year. Affiliated companies can only receive grants where the aggregate export earnings of those companies which actually lodge claims are less than $25 million in total. However, total grants payable to members of a single group may not exceed $250,000 a year. Claims for a particular grant year must be made within five months of the close of that grant year. However, during their first three grant years, claimants may lodge claims half yearly. Market Opportunities Unit (MOU) Products and services available under the MOU of Austrade include: the monthly Trade Intelligence Report containing tender details and industry-specific information; the World Import Regulations Directory, a loose-leaf reference guide covering import requirements for around 115 overseas markets; the Import Regulations Unit, which handles complex enquiries regarding foreign import regulations; and TOP On-line which gives Trade Intelligence Reports subscribers electronic access to the latest information on trade opportunities from Austrade's overseas network. Austrade loans Austrade loans provide firms, groups of firms, consortia, or industry associations with financial support for international business activities. The scheme targets financially sound firms with a successful track record in exporting which require assistance in order to expand their exports. To be eligible for assistance, the applicant must be an Australian company, and be prepared and able to undertake at least 50% of the proposed expenditure, where minimum total activity expenditure is $150,000 over three years. The applicant's product or service must be substantially of Australian origin with potential to earn net foreign exchange earnings of at least $3 million over five years. Applicants are selected for funding on a competitive basis. Maximum funding available for any company is $5 million, and support is available for a maximum of three years. Funds are provided either as a low-interest loan or an advance attracting a royalty. The scheme also allows up to $300,000 to purchase capital equipment which is directly related to an export project. This funding is available to small and medium exporters who can demonstrate an innovative approach to export. Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is Australia's official export credit agency. EFIC offers a range of export credit insurance, export finance, bonds, export working capital guarantees and overseas investment insurance facilities to Australian exporters. EFIC's primary purpose is to encourage trade and commerce with overseas countries by giving Australian exporters access to facilities comparable with those available to their foreign competitors. These include: Export Credit Insurance EFIC insures exporters of Australian goods and services against defined risks of non-payment for exports. Its Export Credit Insurance Policy suits varying export products, credit terms and offshore risks. Cover is available for the export of Australian goods and services on credit, leasing of Australian equipment to overseas hirers, non-payment of sums due from overseas employers for goods and services under construction contracts, payment guarantees to overseas agencies and/or an Australian bank financing Australian exports, letters of credit cover and the facility to indemnify Australian companies for losses related to goods stockpiled for sale overseas. Overseas Investment Insurance EFIC insures Australian overseas investment against the non-commercial risks of loss caused by expropriation, war and the inability to transfer monies received on, or return of, the investment. Export Finance EFIC provides a range of finance and bonding facilities to enable overseas buyers to purchase Australian capital goods, related services and stand-alone project management services. It can also finance some associated overseas costs incurred by Australian exporters. EFIC export finance complements facilities provided by financial institutions within Australia and operates under the following criteria: exports financed are capital goods, related services and stand-alone project management services; an eligible contract contains goods wholly or mainly produced in Australia and services wholly or mainly provided from Australia; and Australian origin is certified to EFIC by the exporter. Provided Australian content is the substantial majority of the contract, some non-Australian content can be financed. Bonds EFIC offers Performance Bonds, Bid and Tender Bonds and Advance Payment Bonds against the provision of acceptable tangible security. An exporter may, however, apply to EFIC for support for Performance Bonds and Advance Payment Bonds on an unsecured basis, where the exporter has insufficient collateral. Insurance cover for Unfair Calling of Bonds is also available to the exporter, for cover usually up to 95% of the face value of the insured bonds. Export Working Capital Guarantee EFIC provides Export Working Capital Guarantees. This facility has been developed to assist exporters which have an export transaction in place, or are currently negotiating an export transaction, for most goods or services but which need working capital support to complete the transaction.EFIC will guarantee to the exporter's bank the provision of working capital to enable exporters to complete an export transaction.

The wealth of Colac and District is based on primary production,particularly beef cattle and timber. Colac offers opportunitiesfor further timber processing, dairying, tourism and expansionof its health facilities. The north and south of Colac and District form two distinct areas. The towns of Camperdown and Winchelsea, volcanic plains and extensivewetlands are located in the north, and to the south lie the magnificentOtway Ranges and the coast, with the resort and fishing townsof Lorne and Apollo Bay. Land and high quality water are primary sources of wealth The region's economy is centred on agricultural produce and timberresources. The fertile soils, reliable rainfall and temperateclimate allow local producers to grow organic vegetables, potatoes,onions and oilseeds. There is also extensive cattle and sheep grazing, and goats and deer arebeing farmed in the Otways.The dairy industry is a large employer, and annual milk production is 600million litres.Production of sheep milk is under way in the Camperdown district. Dairy manufacturing in Colac is dominated by Bonlac Foods andRegal Cream Products. Bonlac employs 600 people, and is Australia'slargest exporter of packaged butter, cheese and whole milk powder. Smaller local dairy manufacturers produce cheese, cream and ice-cream. The meat industry is important to the Colac District, and it producesbeef, venison, lamb and pork. Colac is the site of the WesternDistrict Meat Packing Company, a large abattoir processing 23,500cattle, 110,000 calves, 262,000 sheep/lambs and 26,000 pigs annually. Adding value is the key The Otway Ranges are an important timher and recreation resourcefor the whole of Victoria. The timber industry employs largenumbers in harvesting and processing both hardwood and softwoodproducts. The emphasis of the timber industry is increasinglyon value adding. In addition to the supply of locally grown timber, substantialand increasing supplies of timbers harvested from outside thedistricts surrounding Colac are processed within Colac. Colac and District has significant timber milling operations,including kiln drying facilities at Associated Kiln Driers andtimber preservation treatment facilities at Shelton Timber Treatment. Opportunities exist for natural fibre processing using wool, linseedand cereal straw. Speciality fishing Eels are produced by three establishments in the fertile wetlandsaround Lake Colac. All of the eel production from the area isexported to Europe and Hong Kong. Apollo Bay has significantfishing operations, particularly abalone fishing. Advantages in location As the largest centre in the district, Colac is the service centre.Its population of over 14,000 lives on the shores of a freshwaterlake at the foothills of the Otway Ranges. The city has good access to Melbourne and Adelaide markets viathe Princes Highway, and is only 138 kilometres south west ofMelbourne. Health and welfare needs are well cateredfor by the Colac andDistrict Hospital and Colanda Community Services Centre. A majorexpansion of the Colanda mental health facility is being considered. Water quality and quantity Colac's sewerage and waste disposal system is one of the bestcollection and treatment systems in Victoria. Allaspects of treatment, be it volumetric, biological or solid loadare catered for, and excess capacity is available for new industries. The region has a plentiful supply of extremely high quality water,and has Victoria's highest rainfall.The existing infrastructure is expected to meet the water supply demands until the year 2030. Beyond the year 2030, it is estimated that only relatively minorcapital works would be required to provide substantial additionalwater supply capacity to industrial and residential users in thedistrict. Natural beauty is a major attraction Colac is the gateway to the Otway Ranges and the western plains,which offer marvellous recreation and tourist facilities. A numberof National Parks, as well as State and Regional Parks and reservesboast spectacular waterfalls and mountain streams, rugged coastline,magnificent beaches and internationally significant wetlands. Colac and District has been an important tourism area since Lornedeveloped as a holiday destination late in the nineteenth century.The Cumberland Resort development at Lorne ensures thatthe town retains its important position in tourism. The spectacular Great Ocean Road has a world-wide reputation,evidenced by the hundreds of thousands of Australian and internationalvisitors who are attracted there each year. There is still unrealised tourism potential in the area, witha host of summer activities on the coast and the year around splendourof the pristine forests, walks, camping, fishing and picnicking.

Plans are under way for anadditional reservoir to be built within the next ten years. Forward planning has given the city a waste treatment plant tocater for the anticipated population growth and industrial developmentthat will take place within the next fifteen years. The region's commitment to industrial development is demonstratedby the recent creation of three industrial estates. One of theseis strategically situated within the city, close to the WesternHighway, adjacent to the Adelaide-Melbourne railway line. Because of agriculture's significance to the region and the importanceof creating value-added industries that take advantage of agriculturalproduction, a further industrial estate, zoned offensive trade,is being developed specifically for industries like wool. TheCouncil is considering developing a rural industrial zone nearthe city's sewerage farm to make use of the high quality recycledwater available there. Ararat has zoned land around Lake Bolac for industrial purposes,and is carrying out a study looking at the possibilities of rezoningland for industry in other towns like Willaura. The Shire hasset aside funds to develop this land. The region specialises in light manufacturing and engineering,and Ararat provides the locale and infrastructure for such companiesto prosper. Some examples include Ararat Manufacturing Enterprises, whichbegan as a two-man operation producing vehicle communication andsignal distribution systems, and now employs nearly seventy people.

The rush to the Ballarat goldfields and other discoveries nearbygave enormous impetus to Victoria's population growth. It alsoestablished Ballarat as a major business and commercial centre. Today, Ballarat is the natural service centre for a large partof western Victoria, and the City of Ballarat is the region'smain centre for professional, commercial, education, health andwelfare services. With an urban population of more than 93,000, Ballarat is Australia'ssecond largest inland city and the regional "capital city" ofwestern Victoria. Golden beginnings The economic base of Greater Ballarat reflects its past foundationson mining, manufacturing, services and commerce. Secondary industries and manufacturing enterprises have continuedto grow since the 1850s. Initially, capital accumulated from goldproduction was used to establish manufacturing industries servicingthe mines, but as agriculture developed, manufacturing industriesexpanded to produce machinery, equipment and processing for farming. Community services such as health and education, wholesale andretail trade and manufacturing account for 60 per cent of thepopulation's employment. Diverse manufacturing base Ballarat and District has responded to the challenges of structuralchange in manufacturing by expanding and diversifying. Major sectorsof the local economy include: agriculture, tourism, communityservices, manufacturing, wholesale/retail, education and health. Although service related industries have grown over the last tenyears, manufacturing still plays an important part in the region'seconomic future, employing about 15.2 per cent of the total workforce.In 1991, more than 5,000 people were employed in manufacturing. Key industries include food processing, gold mining, clay andmineral extraction, metal manufacturing and agriculture basedindustries. A place to grow Agriculture is the region's major land-use activity and is a significantcontributor to its economy. Because Ballarat has a diversityof soil types, topography, rainfall and weather patterns, theregion's primary industry is diverse and productive. Produceincludes wool, beef, lambs, oats, barley, potatoes and dairy products. Other important enterprises include apiculture, pig farming,oil-seed cropping, fresh fruit, vegetables, grapes and cut flowers. Even though the region has a well developed and diverse agriculturalsector, great potential exists to increase processing and manufacturingof local produce. An excellent example of value-added produce is the McCains Australiaplant, producing French fries and prepared frozen meals. Duringits peak season, McCains employs about 650 people. The companyprocesses more than half the local potato production. Apart from renewed interest by a number of companies in investigatingthe potential and feasibility of future gold mining in the region,extracting and processing clay and minerals offers companies immediateopportunities for development. Local clays are already an important economic resource. SelkirkBrick and the Eureka Tile Company use local clays for their rawmaterials. Potential exists for mining high grade kaolin, whichalso occurs locally. Kaolin deposits at Pittong and Lal Lal aremined by Kaolin Australia Ltd, a subsidiary of English China Clay,and the company's processing plant produces a range of productsused in ceramics, paper, prints and rubber. District advantages The region has a number of advantages attractive to industry. First and foremost are the services and infrastructure that providea sound base from which industry can grow. Four major highways converge at Ballarat. The Western Highwaylinks Ballarat to Melbourne (111 kilometres), by a high quality,continuous, four-lane freeway that reduces travel time betweenthe two cities to about 75 minutes. The Western Highway bypass around Ballarat reduces congestion and gives Ballarat airport's industrialarea better access to Melbourne. The airport has three runwaysand offers 24-hour landing facilities. The Midland Highway gives access to Geelong to the south and Bendigoto the north. The Sunraysia Highway links the region with Mildura,and the Glenelg Highway connects it to Mt Gambier in South Australiavia Hamilton. V-Line provides fast track freight services by road and rail tothe ports of Melbourne and Geelong. More than sixty transportcompanies provide local businesses with an extensive range ofroad transport services. Ballarat's urban sewerage system can accommodate new development,and the town's water supply can cope with a further 40,000 people.The urban area is serviced by two main water supplies: a gravitysystem, centred on the Moorabool and White Swan Reservoirs; anda supply pumped from the Lal Lal Reservoir. The quality of thiswater is excellent for both domestic and industrial use. Electricity is in ample supply to meet the demands of most majorindustries within the developed area, and distribution feederscan be supplied for industries outside this area. A major naturalgas pipeline supplies Ballarat, and can be extended to meet theneeds of industry as required. Community services Ballarat and District offers its residents excellent health, welfareand education services. Health and welfare services include theBallarat Base Hospital, St John of God Private Hospital and theQueen Elizabeth Geriatric Centre. Ballarat's education facilities provide for pre-school to postsecondary education, with a variety of private and public schools.Tertiary institutions include the University of Ballarat, theBallarat School of Mines and Industries and the Catholic UniversityAquinas College. Twenty-six government and thirteen non-government primary schools,and six government and eight non-government secondary schoolsprovide the region with an excellent education system. A solid base for growth The breadth and depth of the region's construction industry attractsa great deal of investment, and the Ballarat Business Directorylists more than 350 construction businesses. They include buildingand construction, concreting, bricklaying and roof and wall tilingcompanies, as well as other companies providing more specialisedtrade services such as structural steel erection and plumbingand electrical work. Ballarat has been recognised by the State Government as a locationto which new, high-technology enterprises will be directed. TheVictorian Government is outsourcing the PublicTransport and Vic Roads computer work to private enterprise inBallarat. The city is also the site for the Victorian Government'sState Data Centre, specialising in geographic information systems. The Ballarat Technology Research and Development Park covers nearlyseven hectares adjoining the University of Ballarat, and tenantsof the Park will have access to the University's facilities. Ballarat has targeted industry with its initiative to establishthe Wendouree Garden Industrial Estate, where blocks are availablefor manufacturing firms. A substantial quantity of industrialland is available locally with all on-site services provided. Commercial activity is dominated by the Ballarat Central BusinessDistrict, and the city draws on a regional catchment populationof more than 120,000. An extensive range of convenience and specialtyshops caters to most needs. Golden future Tourism is a big winner for Ballarat, and plays an important partin the local economy.

More than 80 per cent of Victoria's cereal crops are grown inthe Wimmera-Mallee, and the south-west of Victoria is the state'sbiggest wool and sheep producer. While sheep grazing remains the area's most important pastoralactivity, recent discoveries of mineral sands near Horsham couldsee the creation of a major minerals industry. Mineral sands Wimmera Industrial Minerals (WIM, a subsidiary of CRA) has discoveredone of the world's largest known reserves of mineral sands inthe district - including rutile, ilmenite, zircon and other minerals. Following extensive research, WIM has made a commercial decisionto defer mineral sand mining and possible downstream processinguntil the end of this decade. Commercial mineral sands miningand processing remains a great opportunity for industrial development. Agricultural value adding Potential exists for downstream processing of local agriculturalproduce, such as oil seed processing and refining, wool processing,seed cleaning, legume processing, intensive feedlots, paper pulp,strawboard cereal processing and breakfast cereal foods. The Wimmera Development Association makes extensive data, informationand assistance available to companies interested in agriculturaldownstream processing in the Horsham District. Administrative centre Horsham is strategically situated on the main rail and road routeslinking Melbourne and Adelaide. The Western Highway is the mainartery through the Wimmera, and the Henty Highway connects themain centres in south-western Victoria including Hamilton, Warrnambooland Portland. Horsham is the administrative capital of central-western Victoria.It is surrounded by Dimboola, Dunmunkle, Kaniva and Warracknabeal,all of which possess excellent supporting infrastructures. Horsham is well serviced with a quality water supply for irrigation,stock and domestic use. Excess water supply capacity is availablefor new industries. The city's present infrastructure (water and sewerage) could supportan increase in population of eight thousand. Horsham and District also offers future employees educationalfacilities. Apart from providing comprehensive primary and secondaryschooling (both public and private), Horsham is the base for theWimmera Community College of Technical and Further Education (TAFE),which has close links with the University of Ballarat. The districthas the state's largest concentration of agricultural researchand educational institutions. The individual municipalities in the Wimmera actively encourageand compete for industry and offer various forms of industry establishmentassistance. Industrial estates maximise opportunities Two industrial estates in Horsham provide 206 hectares of servicedland. All municipalities within the Wimmera have land for industrialestates. The Wimmera Development Association is planning a Wimmera centrefor sustainable resource-based industrial development. The proposalis to develop nearly two hundred hectares, including some landset aside for purchase by resource-based industries. Cereals, legumes and oil seeds are the main crops. They provideopportunities for food processing industries to establish themselvesclose to their primary source. Although agriculture is by far the largest employer, manufacturersalso operate in Horsham. The largest is the Holeproof factory,employing 120, and Vulcan Australia's repetition iron foundryis another major employer. In the wider Wimmera region, particularly in the Lowan area, manymedium-sized manufacturers employ between ten and sixty people.These industries cover a cross section of engineering, cerealproduction and meat and poultry processing. Great outdoors offers tourism potential The district's tourism industry has great potential for furtherdevelopment. Apart from indoor and outdoor recreation facilities,the Wimmera has a variety of pursuits for visitors and residents. Recreation facilities include valuable tourist and conservationresources. These include the Grampians National Park, Mt Arapiles/TooanState Park, and the wilderness. The surrounding forests offeropportunities for bushwalking, orienteering, canoeing, fishing,hunting, fossicking, picnics, horse riding, boating, trail bikeriding and pleasure drives.

Every Easter, it hoststhe world's richest professional foot race, the Stawell Gift.Stawell toasts the competitors with Great Western sparkling wine,which is produced locally and is equally famous. Gold and sand The Stawell Gift emerged from carnivals organised by gold minerslast century, and gold mining remains an important industry. Inthe late 1980s, Western Mining Corporation initiated the StawellJoint Venture with Central Norseman Gold Corporation, producingthe lion's share of Victoria's gold. The mine now operated by Australian Gold Mining Investments continuesto provide employment for nearly 150 people in Stawell and Districtas well as presenting opportunities to companies supplying equipmentand services. An opportunity exists to recover ore from tailings. Discoveries of mineral sands in the Horsham/Stawell region havethe potential to support a number of spin-off industries. As inother gold mining areas in Victoria, commerce and secondary industryin Stawell developed early, supplying the infrastructure neededto support gold mines. Stawell is located on the Western Highway, which provides it withan efficient road transport link with both Melbourne and Adelaide.It also has rail links with these cities. Stawell offers a dualrunway airport, situated a couple of kilometres outside the town. Stawell's location on the sunny side of the Great Dividing Rangein western Victoria makes it an ideal base for servicing the populationsof central and western Victoria and eastern South Australia. Its water supply supports the needs of local industry and hasexcess capacity to provide for new industries. Bulk water usersare eligible for discounted rates. The town's sewerage and waste disposal system has been upgradedand plans have been formulated to cater for further growth. Stawell has also promoted the development of two industrial estates,zoned heavy, light and garden industrial. A computer register of business and employment in the town ismaintained to provide firms with detailed information on servicesprovided by established businesses. The Council, the Water Boardand the Development Association provide firms with coordinatedand active support for business development and investment. Broad economy Stawell has responded well to changing economic conditions overthe years by encouraging broad development in the manufacturingsector. This includes the food processing, textiles, non-metallicmineral products such as bricks, which are produced from localclay, and miscellaneous manufacturing. Firms such as Motorway Tyres Pty Ltd, which produces retreadedand remoulded tyres, and Frewstall Abattoirs, the largest lambprocessor in Victoria, are examples of this diversity. The Seppelts and Bests vineyards in Great Western and other Grampianswine makers produce premium wines. Southcorp Wines (Seppelts)has embarked on a major expansion to make the Great Western Winerythe largest producer of sparkling wine in the southern hemisphere. Opportunities Outstanding opportunities also exist for further development ofthe region's tourist industry. The Grampians district is one ofVictoria's major tourist destinations. Growth is expected to continuein the large numbers of people visiting the area. This will createa range of investment and development needs and opportunities.

Property values are markedly lower in Bendigo comparedto Melbourne and some other provincial centres. Renting an averagethree bedroom home costs $140 per week, compared with $200 perweek in Melbourne. These savings on property or rental and transportcosts for employees effectively mean a higher level of disposableincome. R&D centre Bendigo's particular area of expertise is in precision engineeringand natural resource research. Australian Defence Industrieshas a reputation for utilising advanced engineering skills anda strong record of technological development in defence. Studies have identified technology intensive activities that couldbe promoted in specialist fields to extend and reinforce linksbetween enterprises and La Trobe University, Bendigo. Researchand development in Bendigo has had positive results. For example,the university worked closely with the local water authority toupgrade the region's water effluent treatment. Value-added potential The rural sector includes wool production, cereal grain production,pig, poultry, dairying and some horticulture. Bendigo offers great potential to support value-added industrieslike food processing and the processing of hides and skins. Withits access to the north-central rural production, for example,Bendigo offers excellent possibilities for a tanning industryand an abattoir. Pig processing is also big business.Concentrated in the Bendigo District, it offers many opportunitiesfor growth in value-added industries. It also provides an exampleof how local research bodies work closely with industry to improvea product. The Bendigo Regional Veterinary Laboratory has a PorcineResearch Unit conducting research relevant to pig farming. Greater Bendigo's access to Melbourne, availability of land andthe commitment of local councils have made it an attractive locationfor poultry farming. Some major poultry farms and processing unitshave already been relocated or developed there. These companiesinclude Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd, Crystal Egg Company,Loddon Valley Eggs and Hy-Line Australia. Service industries Bendigo's role as a major service centre started with the discoveryof gold in 1851. The rush that followed was an enormously significantevent in the city's history. As it grew to become the centre ofeconomic activity in the region, it also developed its servicecapabilities. Bendigo is now the service centre for northern andcentral Victoria. Bendigo has a strong and vibrant retail base, centred on the CentralBusiness District and well supported by large shopping centresat Strathdale, Kangaroo Flat and Eaglehawk. The retail and commercialsectors have grown rapidly over recent years. Australia's majorretail chains are represented in Bendigo. Bendigo is the largest non-metropolitan financial centre in Australia,because it is home to all the major banks and the Bendigo Bank.Established in 1858, the "Bendigo"has led the growth in the financial sector. Bendigo's retail catchmentarea extends to Cohuna, Deniliquin, Swan Hill, Boort, Seymourand Woodend, with an estimated population of over 140,000. Opportunities exist for speciality shops and personal servicesto be established. Bendigo is a major service provider to ruralindustry, and it has a variety of primary, secondary and tertiaryeducation institutions. Bendigo Senior Secondary College is the largest senior secondarycollege in Victoria, providing Victorian Certificate of EducationYear 11 and 12 and offering 43 out of a total 44 VCE subjects,the most comprehensive provision of subjects in the State. Two major private secondary colleges, Girton Grammar School andCatholic College, as well as several smaller institutions, ensurean excellent choice of nonGovernment educational institutions.

Sixtydoctors and twenty-five dentists practise in the area, and theregion is home to a multitude of paramedical services. An extensive network of community support services and facilitiesis available to all age groups. Tourism a winner One of Bendigo's prime assets is its climate.

Bendigo averages 256 rain-free daysper year and the mean average temperature ranges from 29 degreesCelsius in January to 12 degrees Celsius in July. Extremes of'climate,such as snow and strong winds, are almost non-existent. Taking the region's vast tourist, recreation and leisure attractionsinto account, the industry has huge growth potential.

The city is set in picturesquepark lands beside Lake Benalla. Benalla's central location is just as important now as when itwas a busy trading centre en route to the nearby gold fields. The Midland Highway runs south to Mansfield and west throughShepparton to Bendigo and Adelaide. Benalla and District is the centre of one of the most productiveand diverse rural areas in Victoria. The main enterprises arefat lamb production and broad acre cropping, and wheat and oatsare the dominant grains. The higher rainfall areas of the GreatDividing Range to the south are well suited to prime beef production. Expansion program Benalla was once economically dependent on seventeen State andFederal Government offices, situated there because of its centrallocation. In the 1970s, however, the district embarked on animportant and diverse industrial expansion program. That initiative was further assisted by the State Government'sdecentralisation incentives, and was successful in attractingcompanies such as ASET, an electrical transformer manufacturernow owned by the Schneider Group, Striker Sportswear, a clothingmanufacturer, and Centique, which manufactures plumbing, tapwareand bathroom accessories. Other local employers include Benalla Spinners, now owned by GodfreyHirst, and Monsbent, which converts locally grown softwood intoparticle board for the construction industry. The location of these nationally recognised companies is testamentto the district's suitability as a competitive manufacturing destinationand national distribution centre. Australian Defence Industries has constructed a major facilitythere. The company chose Benalla, following a nationwide search,as the most appropriate location for its $160 million ammunitionmanufacturing factory. Opportunities for value adding A recent study confirmed that opportunities exist for value addingenterprises such as wool scouring, sheep skin tanning and processingfor export markets in Europe, Japan and the USA. There are agrifood,(horticulture, meat), wood and timber products opportunities. Infrastructure Benalla is particularly well placed with transport and distributionand its existing energy infrastructure. The main Bass Strait/Albury-Wodonga gas transmission passes throughBenalla, providing an unrestricted supply. A secure high voltage(22KV) electricity supply is maintained via two 66KV feeders fromthe Glenrowan terminal station. Recent duplication of the WaterBoard's main supply pipeline will cater for the anticipated expandingdemand during the next twenty years.

The range of agricultural activities includes fruit and vegetablegrowing, dairy farming, cereal crops, oilseed and livestock production,particularly sheep and cattle. Major export industry Shepparton and District has a significant export sector, particularlyin food processing. For example, the Shepparton/Stanhope BonlacFoods Ltd, a dairy product manufacturer and marketer, contributesapproximately thirty per cent of Victoria's dairy produce, whileanother manufacturer of milk products, the Tatura Milk Industries,exports approximately $38m worth annually. Shepparton-based company, SPC, markets nearly $200m in cannedfruit annually and more than half of Australia's canned fruitexports. Export of fresh fruit and vegetables is also significant. Otherbig names in food processing in the district are Ardmona, Campbell'sSoups, Kraft, Heinz, Unifoods-Rosella, Nestle, Henry Jones M andthe Murray Goulburn Co-Operative. Although most of the Shepparton/Kyabram/Rodney District is animportant irrigation area, highly fertile dry land areas are usedfor pasture and fodder crops as well as for grazing cattle andsheep. The heart of Victoria Shepparton is the fourth largest provincial city in Victoria andis the hub of the district and the Goulburn Valley generally.It provides for the commercial, industrial, social, and recreationalneeds of a regional population totalling 60,000. Shepparton is also a significant retail centre, serving a tradearea extending into southern New South Wales with a populationof some 140,000. The city is situated in the heart of Victoria, about 180 kilometresnorth of Melbourne, a little over two hours' drive via the HumeFreeway and the Goulburn Valley Highway. The town of Mooroopna is located on the west side of the GoulburnRiver, only minutes away from Shepparton, and it forms a largelyintegrated urban system with Shepparton. The town of Tatura,which is the civic centre for the Shire of Rodney, is locatednearby. Shepparton is connected to Melbourne by excellent train and busservices. Shepparton aerodrome provides air charter services,with pilot-activated lighting and non-directional beacon facilitiesfor safe night landing. The aerodrome is only four kilometresfrom Shepparton, and the runway and terminal facilities have beenupgraded recently. The industrial infrastructure in Sbepparton is first class, particularlyin its basic utility services such as water, sewerage and electricity. Kyabram, about thirty-six kilometres to the north-west of Shepparton,functions as a sub-regional centre. It also has an excellentphysical and social infrastructure to service the rich dairyingand horticultural hinterland. Water and land for industry The water authority's charges for water, sewerage and trade wasteare among the lowest in Victoria. The quality and low cost ofsuch services are a major incentive in attracting industry. A twenty-year plan for a capital works program to upgrade thecity's water supply system at a cost of $3.6m will ensure thatShepparton will be able to cater for both the needs of residentsand industry well into the future. Water and sewerage is comparativelyinexpensive in Kyabram and Mooroopna. The establishment of new enterprises is promoted at a numberof industrial estates. Drummond Road Estate in Shepparton, KyabramIndustrial Estate and Mooroopna Industrial Estates all offer companiesserviced land. Larger tracts of serviceable industrial land areavailable close to urban facilities in Shepparton and Kyabram. Support services As one of the State's largest provincial centres, Sheppartonoffers its residents a diverse range of shopping facilities, andprovides local industry with appropriate support services. Thereare 670 retail establishments in Shepparton employing over 3,000 people, with a sales turnover of $300m annually. The district has an excellent range of community services, withwell-equipped public and private hospitals, each serviced by anextensive range of health providers. Recreational facilities includegolf courses, indoor sports centres, outdoor playing fields, courtsand tracks. Education is amply provided. Post-secondary education is providedthrough Goulburn Valley College of TAFE. The Victorian Collegeof Agriculture and Horticulture (VCAH) Dookie Campus, which islinked with Melbourne University, has developed a world-wide reputationfor specialist training in agriculture. It also provides on campusa complete tertiary education course in nursing. In January 1994 the La Trobe University College of Northern Victoriacommenced operations in the Goulburn Valley College of TAFE campus,offering a range of tertiary courses to local students. Shepparton provides quality, affordable housing.A wide variety of land is available, ranging from the normal residentialsubdivision, rural residential allotments of up to one hectare, hobbyfarms, all in close reach of the Shepparton central business district. Food processing centre Growing and processing fruit is a major industry in the district. Fruit growing provides more jobs than other agricultural sectors,while the canneries (SPC, Ardmona and Campbell's Soups) are thelargest manufacturing establishments in the area. The Goulburn Valley produces 97 per cent of Victoria's pears,90 per cent of its peaches and 76 per cent of its apricots. Nearlyone third of Victoria's tomatoes come from the district, and mostof the crop is grown under contract for local processors. Apart from the opportunities that exist in expanding processingactivities, diversification into fresh fruit and vegetables forexport is providing significant opportunities for farmers in thedistrict. Large dairy processors in the district include Bonlac Foods, MidlandMilk, Tatura Milk Products and PJ Ducat and Sons. Good growthprospects exist in developing specialty cheeses and fresh milkproducts such as yoghurts and dairy desserts.The concentrationof food processing factories in the district provides opportunitiesfor related industries, such as equipment manufacturers, who wouldbenefit by locating close to their customers. Opportunities for manufacturing The location and export orientation of the district's major agriculturaland processing industries make the transport sector very importantin Shepparton. The district exports more than 63 per cent ofits total output. Since most freight is transported by road, opportunities existfor transport companies and associated industries, such as transportequipment and packaging industries, to establish in the district. Fabricated metals is one of the larger manufacturing sectors inShepparton. This sector is dominated by several large firms producingeither metal cans for the food processing industry or buildingmaterials. They include Containers Packaging, Gadsden, DowellAluminium Windows and FJ Furphy and Sons (fabricated structuralsteel). Several other smaller firms manufacture sheds, windows, gates,shopfronts, steel frame homes and similar products. The districtis home to a number of prominent engineering firms such as Furphy,ED Parsons and JN & R Engineering. Solar energy centre A few years ago the Greater Shepparton Area was launched as theSolar Region. The region promotes solar energy, particularlyto assist the horticultural and agricultural industries. Solar-powered equipment designed to counteract cold, heat, drought,insects, birds and other hazards, has considerable market applications,not only for the Shepparton District, but for export markets aswell. Irrigation equipment and frost warning devices with world-widesales possibilities have been developed. The Shepparton Kyabram Rodney Development Corporation is workingclosely with local government authorities to assist firms wantingto relocate, particularly in those industries with a competitiveadvantage, and in solar-power related industries.

The Latrobe Region comprises the LaTrobe Valley and South Gippsland.The region is known for electricity generation, pulp and paperand off-shore natural gas. It produces 85 per cent of Victoria'selectricity, has 200,000 million tonnes of brown coal reservesand produces one third of Australia's natural gas. As one of Australia'smost important industrial areas, it is experiencing rapid transition.South Gippsland is a highly productive farming area. West Gippsland is centerd around Warragul and Drouin. East Gippslandincludes Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Metung and Orbost. Informationon the industrial strengths of these districts of Eastern Victoriais provided in this regional profile. In addition to the major centres, the Eastern Victoria Region coverstowns such as Leongatha and Korumburra, which have significantindustrial features. Leongatha, Korumburra Located close together in the lush foothills of southern Gippsland,Korumburra and Leongatha offer rural lifestyle about an hour'sdrive from metropolitan Melbourne. Because of the proximity of the area to metropolitan Melbourneand its attractive landscape, the district is becoming a majorresidential growth corridor. The district offers new industriesa stable workforce, and offers managers and employees a countrylifestyle - advantages that are usually associated with more remoterural locations. The district around Leongatha and Korumburra is fortunate to havea high level of reliable rainfall and extremely productive agriculturalland that allows for the production of vegetables and a considerableproportion of Victoria's dairy produce. The major employer in South Gippsland is the Murray Goulburn CooperativeCo. Pty Ltd at Leongatha, one of the largest dairy processingoperations in Australia. Long life milk is produced at this plant,and much of the butter, milk powder and casein from this enterpriseis exported. Smaller dairy manufacturing enterprises have established at Korumburrarecently. These produce a range of speciality creams, yoghurtsand cheeses. Korumburra and Leongatha both have well established industrialestates that already house a number of businesses, mainly in thelight engineering and agricultural service sectors. Southern Gippsland is connected to Melbourne via the South GippslandHighway. An excellent road connects the district to the industrialcentres of the Latrobe Valley. Korumburra and Leongatha offer local businesses and residentsexcellent service facilities, with comprehensive retail shopping,education and sporting complexes. The Coal Creek Historical Park at Korumburra is a major touristattraction.

Butit is successful for other reasons as well. All-year-round leisure activities East Gippsland provides lifestyle opportunities for all agegroups, and this has in part contributed to the populationgrowth. The region's temperate climate allows visitors and residentsto enjoy a great variety of activities all year round. Regional population growth is concentrated around the GippslandLakes area and in residential towns close to the major centresincluding Bairnsdale and Maffra. The region's population growth rate has created majordemands for secondary industries, particularly in construction,which has also been stimulated by the growth in tourism and retirementaccommodation in the area. East Gippsland is resource rich East Gippsland is rich in timber,agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, minerals and natural attractions.It has a well developed infrastructure that meets the needs ofindustry. The region, and particularly the major centres of Bairnsdale,Maffra, Lakes Entrance and Orbost, has water supplies of highquality and of sufficient capacity to accommodate most needs. The road system caters for nearly 90 per cent of freight and passengers,and industries in the region use heavy road transport extensively.Improved road access to Melbourne has enhanced the region's attractivenessto industry. The Princes Highway, National Route 1, passes throughthe region and links it with Melbourne and Sydney. Freight andpassenger road/rail links from Bairnsdale to Melbourne are fastand frequent. The region holds many opportunities for manufacturingbusinesses. This is particularly true for firms producing small,light, high value-added products. Primary industries East Gippsland has a well established infrastructure for thetimber and forest products industry. The forests of East Gippslandcontain a wide variety of timber species, and legislation nowallows for integrated harvesting throughout the region. This will result in all harvested timber being directed tothe best end use by allocating logs to the most suitable value-addingoperators. This applies to specialty timbers, high quality sawlogs, low grade saw logs and residual roundwood. The potentialuses of residual roundwood include sawn and treated timber products,chips and pulp. Agriculture is the region's largest employer, with 15% ofthe workforce, and through both the direct earnings and flow-oneffects in service sectors, it is one of the major contributorsto the region's economy. Beef cattle, sheep, both for wool and meat, and dairying havebeen the traditional agricultural mainstays. Vegetable productionis a growing industry, and it has been estimated that only 50per cent of the available quality land for vegetable productionis currently being used. The area has the potential to generate much greater volumesof produce for fresh and processed markets for both domestic andexport consumption. A variety of soils and climates suitable for many agriculturalactivities exists in the region. The most versatile areas arethe coastal river flats and flood plains that have good accessto irrigation, a mild winter climate, and can be used for intensiveproduction. Commercial fishing centre Lakes Entrance is the largest fishingport in Victoria, supporting up to 180 fishing vessels. It isalso home to a number of vessels servicing the industry, as wellas those servicing the Bass Strait oil rigs. The region's extensivecoastline provides a diverse habitat for a variety of commercialfish species and supports many fisheries, including inlet, estuarine,abalone, scallop and in-shore and off-shore trawling. Lakes Entrance'swell established port facilities, including shipyards and thecooperative processing plant, as well as the skilled workforce,could see the region's fishing industry expand and adapt to meetnew market demands. Mallacoota is already the base for the export-orientedabalone industry. Enormous tourist potential The region's tourist potential isenormous. The Gippsland Lakes, 400 square kilometres of shelteredinland waterways, are one of Victoria's premier tourist destinationsfor boating, fishing and waterside activities. East Gippsland'sNational Parks, (Croajingalong, Errinundra and Snowy River) providecoastal, rainforest and alpine reserves. The Buchan Caves systemis a favourite destination attracting up to 200,000 visitors annually,while the 90 Mile Beach offers visitors uninterrupted vistas andbeautiful stretches of beach. The region's climate guarantees year-roundactivities. The coastal and lakes areas have mild, still winters,often with the warmest temperatures in the state, and the mountainsare renowned for their reliable snow season. Bullock Island nearLakes Entrance offers a unique tourist development opportunity. The island is located at the western end of Lakes Entrance, andis connected to the adjacent highway by a bridge. It could incorporateresort accommodation, restaurants, cafes and sports and recreationfacilities. Because of the huge numbers of tourists attracted tothe region, opportunities exist for service-oriented businessesto provide accommodation, restaurants and other attractions.

It is Victoria'smost important resource-rich area, and its list of assets is impressive. The region: produces 85 per cent of the state's electricity and has browncoal reserves of over 200,000 million tonnes; has 63 per cent of Australia's crude oil reserves; has nearly 34 per cent of thecountry's natural gas reserves; is the site of the largest pulp and paper plant in Australia; is home to the largest power-station in the Southern Hemisphere; has 15 per cent of Victoria's water resources; has 12 per cent of Victoria's dairy herd has 9 per cent of Victoria's beef herd. The Latrobe Region has a number of substantial populationcentres, including Morwell, Traralgon, Moe and Churchill in theLatrobe Valley; Sale, next to the Gippsland Lakes; and the SouthGippsland towns of Yarram and Foster. Three major employers operate in the region; the public electricity generation companies,employing 2,500 people in five power stations; AustralianPaper, employing about 900 at its Maryvale mill; and Esso, employingover 800 at Longford and on the offshore rigs in Bass Strait. Primed for industrial diversification The Latrobe Region is going through a period of transition.In the past it relied on few major industries for its economicwell being, but now the economic catch cry in the region is industrialdiversification. The catch cry is catching on. Businesses are establishingin the region in many industries including flower growing, emuand ostrich farming, dairy processing, education services, computerservices, image processing, energy research, transport servicesand tourism. The region offers companies the type of competitive strengthsthat make it attractive to establish a business there. It hasstrong energy industries based on the abundant local coal, oiland gas, and extensive metal engineering and other manufacturingoperations. The region has an excellent infrastructure servicingthese industries. The Latrobe Region has a highly trained workforce experiencedin all types of enterprises, from heavy industry to farming.It has excellent communication and extensive road and rail transportservices. The region is intersected by the Princes Highway, giving itdirect links to both Sydney and Melbourne. The latter is onlytwo hours'drive away. Three airports: the Latrobe Valley Airfield, West Sale andPort Welshpool, provide scheduled passenger and chartered flightswithin Victoria and interstate. Fast, efficient and frequentpassenger and freight rail services operate in the region. Extensive water and sewerage systems can be easily augmentedfor further large users. Natural gas is available in the maintowns of Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Sale, Churchill, Rosedale andTrafalgar. Industrial electricity is readily available, because85 per cent of Victoria's electricity is generated within theregion. Great potential exists for industry and horticulture to tapgeothermal energy. Good quality water between 60 and 70 degreesCelsius is available from geothermal aquifers in the GippslandBasin, at a depth of about 500 metres. Warm water, a bi-productof the Hazelwood Power Station, is already used in horticulture. Plentiful services Major educational institutions includingCentral Gippsland College of TAFE, East Gippsland Community Collegeof TAFE, Monash University Gippsland Campus and Latrobe ValleyBusiness College amply serve the region. They work closely withbusiness and industry to design programs specifically for majornew companies setting up locally. The region has excellent healthservices, including four hospitals. Recreational facilities caterfor most needs and interests, and include three provincial racecoursesat Moe, Traralgon and Sale, an all-weather athletics track inMoe and nine golf courses. The Latrobe Region supports seven newspapers,its own commercial television stations, a major arts complex,five art galleries, a network of state and private schools anddozens of restaurants. More than 1,300 retail outlets cater formost shoppers'needs and provide services to business. The rapiddevelopment of Melbourne into Gippsland has opened up new businessopportunities, as has the growth of East Gippsland. The westof the region is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. Major projects: no problem The Latrobe Region has unequalledexperience in planning and accommodating major projects. In thepast ten years the following multi-billion dollar major projectshave been accomplished: Blue Rock Dam Thomson River Dam Loy Yang Power Station Jeeralang Power Station Brown Coal Liquefaction (Victoria) Pilot Plant Australian Paper, Maryvale extension Esso Bass Strait developments Australian Securities Commission National Data ProcessingCentre Reliable and skilled workforce The region boasts a 45,000-strong workforce that offers firmsa wide variety of skills. Over 13 per cent have vocational training,a substantially higher proportion than the state average of 10per cent. Labour turnover in the manufacturing industry is perhaps thelowest in Australia, and studies conducted by Monash Universityshow a productive and concentrated labour force. Many industriesoperate around the clock, so shiftwork is seen locally as a normalemployment practice. Assistance to business Tailor-made programs and packages are available to assistnew and existing businesses wishing to establish or expand inthe area. Services include: Business advice and assistance; Assistance in identification of a suitable site and its development; Help in organising, training, education, and selecting personnel; Troubleshooting to ensure that the development of a new siteworks for the company; and Assistance with marketing and promotion. Assistance was provided to the Australian Securities Commission(ASC), to design and construct a purpose-built building suitablefor the complex needs of an image processing operation. Appropriatestaff training and ongoing work with the organisation has helpedit run smoothly. A five-year research program has commenced to examine thecommercial feasibility of generating power from ceramic fuel cells,which has a potential world market estimated at billions of dollars.Another local initiative was establishing a centre for engineeringexcellence, which aims to market the region's collective expertise. The local development body identified that water from theHazelwood Power Station was available and suitable for use inhorticulture, and has attracted two businesses to take advantageof the opportunity. A 32-hectare site was secured from GenerationVictoria, and Hazelwood Flowers now produces a variety of flowersthere. Another company grows vegetables for the local and Victorianmarkets. Diversification: a top priority. In addition to pulp and paper, oil, gas, brown coal and electricitygeneration, the Latrobe Region is diversifying its economy intonew areas including data and image processing. The establishment of the Australian Securities CommissionInformation Processing Centre, employing 400 people, is a primeexample and represents the beginning of large scale informationprocessing in the region. Improvements in communications systems have made it viablefor information industries such as this to locate outside capitalcities. The ASC's data, for example, can be accessed via terminalsat any ASC Business Centre throughout Australia. New industries can tap into the region's rich human resources.About 95 per cent of the ASC's staff are from the Latrobe Region.Its establishment in 1991 has helped create flow-on jobs in serviceindustries such as computer software and the legal profession.Lower property costs and a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructurealso help give the Latrobe region a strategic advantage.

West Gippslandclaims with justification to be the "fine food capital of Victoria",as its lush pastures produce much of the state's milk and supportnumerous processors and retailers of value added commodities. West Gippsland is close to Melbourne, and it offers an attractiveregional lifestyle. It has excellent transport connections tothe heavy industrial and power generation centres of the LatrobeValley, and local municipalities are committed to attracting newindustries to the region. The major population centres of the region (Warragul and Drouin)are located along the Princes Freeway (a double highway to Melbourne),and the Gippsland Railway. Rail passengers are served by regular services to Melbourneand Sale in the east, and a V/Line Regional Freight Centre atWarragul handles door to door freight transport. With its plentiful high quality agricultural land and ampleindustrial land and buildings, West Gippsland is well placed toservice the astute investor who wishes to locate in a region thatoffers all the services expected of large centres, but still maintainstraditional rural strengths. Dairy is dominant The dairy industry is dominated by Bonlac Foods, which processesmilk products at Longwarry, Drouin and Warragul.The plants produce a collective annual total of 19,000 tonnesof butter and 12,000 tonnes of milk powder. The Drouin factoryhas been extensively upgraded to allow increased production ofcheese. Smaller dairy manufacturers, such as Tarago River Cheeseof Neerim South, are achievmg prominence for producing specialtycheeses for export. Plastics, clothing and textiles, commercialprinting and services to agriculture are important sectors oflocal industry. Reticulated natural gas is available in the townsof Drouin and Warragul. Major employers already established include Bonlac Foods,AC1 Morapak, a division of BTR Nylex (plastic packaging), MomentumPrinting and Publishing and TCC Corporation (clothing). West Gippsland has expertise in farm equipment engineering.A number of small, high technology producers based in the regionmanufacture products such as tea harvesters, potato machineryand other equipment, often for export. Development Opportunities The horticultural industry provides opportunities for expansion.Vast potential exists to increase value adding to agriculturalcommodities such as vegetables and the locally produced, highquality milk. The Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticultureat Warragul, which provides tertiary level training for primaryindustry students, supports agricultural industries. The timber industry is also beginning to capitalise on thepotential of value-adding, and a number of sawmills in West Gippslandhave installed kilns to dry timber. Drouin West Saw Mills, EricaSaw Mills and Darnum and Stoll Brothers, Rokeby, now provide thekind of high quality specialty timber products that are increasinglybeing sought by export makets, particularly Japan. West Gippsland's economy has a number of other distinctivefeatures. The region produces educational supplies and services,such as educational stationery at Drouin. A number of large poultryproducers operate locally, a commercial trout fishing industryis located in the region, and a number of farmers are increasingtheir exports by growing flowers. Considerable interest is being demonstrated in eco-tourism,and given the excellent transport services and the region's comparativeproximity to Melbourne, the potential is enormous. Gourmet Deli Region Because of its scenic natural appeal, the region enjoys asteadily increasing volume of visitors. The area has developeda number of specialty food manufacturers who market their productsthrough the highly successful Gourmet Deli Region, which encouragestourists to sample local produce. West Gippsland provides a high standard of community services,such as education, retailing, medical care and recreation. The500-seat West Gippsland Arts Centre, located at Warragul, providesa major regional venue for theatre, cinema and live performances.

This is achieved by the conduct of research and development programs on the design, manufacture, test and supportability of advanced composite structures. R&D strengths A primary focus of the centre is to produce demonstrator components which incorporate the technological advances developed in the various research programs. These demonstrators are vital to the transfer of technology from the research engineers to industry. Co-operative research and development programs are undertaken by post-graduate students and staff at the three sites of the CRC and also at those of the participating organisations. Major research facilities are available to some 80 staff working on three major research programs: improved manufacturing, structural performance and operations. Successes The CRC has demonstrated an advanced aircraft-control surface which incorporates improved design and manufacturing technology. This control-surface technology played an important role for Hawker de Havilland in winning a major overseas contract for the design and manufacture of a composite flap.Other technology based on resin transfer moulding and textile-based materials has helped the industry to develop cheaper manufacturing methods for a number of new products. Strong collaborative R&D programs with major overseas companies are based on the centre's design techniques for advanced composite applications. Commercial significance of work The CRC has three commercial partners which have major export contracts. Hawker de Havilland and Aerospace Technologies of Australia export approximately $150-200 million annually of elaborately transformed products.These companies have contacts with all the major overseas aircraft companies. Australian Defence Industries has recently been awarded one of the largest defence projects to build six minehunters for the Royal Australian Navy. The CRC is assisting the company develop the technology so it can become a major structural composite manufacturer. Why Victoria? Victoria is a major contributor to the Australian aircraft industry. Major participants offer access to excellent educational and research facilities. Training and education A Masters degree course has been developed at RMIT. A range of specialised short courses are offered to industry. So far these haveattracted 600 participants. The centre has 20 PhD students involved in its program. Participants Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Australian Defence Industries Hawker de Havilland Monash University Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University of New South Wales University of Sydney Business opportunities The CRC offers smaller companies the opportunity to become involved in the R&D program by becoming Associate Members. This membership offers access to publications, an opportunity to influence research programs and special consultancy rates. The centre is a Registered Research Agency and undertakes contract research and development in all aspects of the design, manufacture and testing of composite structures.

The centre brings together the combined resources, skills and expertise of research and industry groups to tackle major environmental concerns including salinity, flooding, degradation of rivers and streams, and pollution of stormwater in cities. R&D strengths Centre skills and expertise have been focused on four research programs with individual projects developed with industry input: Catchment water and salt balance: studies of runoff and salinity processes in high water-table areas and of water yield from disturbed forest catchment areas. Waterway management and erosion control: projects on the delivery of sediments and nutrients in water supply and the stability of stream channels. Urban hydrology: projects aimed at water quality improvement in urban waterways. Flood hydrology: studies of ways of improving flood warnings and flood runoff volumes. Successes The centre has established an international reputation for its catchment hydrology research. Industry has participated actively in the support of the research, providing pilot or demonstration sites. Active collaboration has been achieved with national and international research centres and scholars.Major contract R&D grants have been awarded to the CRC to investigate sustainable hardwood plantations in salty shallow water-tables and the role of streamside trees and grasses in protecting waterways. Commercial significance of work Australia faces significant losses each year due to land and water degradation. Flood damage is estimated at some $300 million annually, while agricultural production losses due to salinity amount to about $200 million each year.The centre's core research programs have already produced results which are useful to the water industry, such as improved ways of estimating the impact of logging on water yield from forests, and detailed information on urban pollution sources. Why Victoria? Victoria is a focus for hydrology with major activity at Monash and Melbourne Universities. The involvement of Victorian government water and land management agencies and the location of the Bureau of Meteorology head-quarters in Melbourne have been important ingredients in facilitating the collaborative efforts of the Centre. Training and education The education and training program provides a number of options to increase the number and ability of trained staff for the water in dustry. These include workshops for industry staff (water and irrigation authorities, land management agencies, consultants), postgraduate research and courses, seminars on centre research and related work, and staff interchange. Participants Bureau of Meteorology CSIRO Division of Water Resources Department of Natural Resources and the Environment Melbourne Water Monash University Murray-Darling Basin Commission Rural Water Authorities - Goulburn-Murray, Southern, and Wimmera-Mallee University of Melbourne Business opportunities The rapid transfer of know-how to industry users is a major feature of the centre's technology transfer program through such activities as demonstration projects, staff exchanges and software products.There are opportunities for companies to become involved in commercialising products such as software for modelling salinity or effluent. There is also the potential for consulting firms to link with the CRC in specialist tasks on land and water issues. Funding Each of the parties contributes cash or in-kind resources to the centre, which has a seven-year budget of $33 million.

Its major research effort is directed towards the discovery of novel growth factors active on white blood cells and nerve cells. The centre aims to use such information to design new drugs with improved biological specificity or efficiency. R&D strengths Research programs are structured into seven different projects involving scientists from each of the venturers. These projects focus on different aspects of the way cell growth is regulated by the action of growth factors and how this knowledge can be used to devise strategies for treating human disease.To ensure that flexibility is built into the research activities, the centre has established a group of central laboratories to provide expertise in antibody production, molecular biology, protein chemistry and protein expression. Successes The CRC has developed two research re-agents currently on sale worldwide. The potential clinical and commercial use of the agent leukaemia inhibitory factor is currently being evaluated. New screening methods have also been developed to identify and purify novel growth factors based on the receptors they utilise. Commercial significance of work Blood growth factors (some of which were originally discovered by scientists now in the CRC) are among the top selling biopharmaceuticals in the world, generating sales in excess of $2 billion per year. The CRC aims to generate new biopharmaceuticals of this type and to improve on the existing ones. Why Victoria? Victoria remains at the forefront of medical research in Australia with a high concentration of the most prestigious medical research institutes and research hospitals. In particular, the field of blood growth factors originated in Melbourne medical research institutes. Training and education Postgraduate students enrolled at the University of Melbourne may undertake their research studies at the centre. Students are required to obtain support through competitive scholarships. The educational programs of the centre are designed to supplement and expand those already existing in the partner institutes and include various seminar programs and lecture series. Participants Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research - Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch The Biomolecular Research Institute CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering AMRAD Corporation Ltd Business opportunities The centre has only one commercial partner (AMRAD), who acts on its behalf in commercialising projects or in negotiations with other companies. As sole commercial partner it can actively participate in all research programs at all levels without being hindered by commercial confidentiality issues.AMRAD supports individual projects it identifies as commercially valuable by providing research funding and picking up all patent and commercialisation costs. To date 11 patent applications arising from CRC research have been filed. The development of possible pharmaceuticals from these discoveries is a long term objective. Funding In addition to the funding of $14.4 million provided by the Australian Government over seven years, the centre receives funding from AMRAD Corporation for individual research projects.

The centre was established in 1991 and operates on two sites approximately 20 kilometres apart at the University of Melbourne and at the Clayton site of the CSIRO Division of Minerals. R&D strengths Research is carried out within two program areas. The Process Chemistry program is concerned with the high-temperature chemistry associated with the processing of minerals through to refined metals and with the unique molten phases produced during smelting and refining processes - slags, mattes and alloys.The Process Engineering program concentrates on injection of powders and gases into molten phases, the handling and flow characteristics of molten products and heat transfer in high-temperature reactors. Successes A number of research successes are being transferred to industry including: A flow control valve for molten material. Design and application of a novel cooling element for high-temperature furnaces. Selection of slag composition and operating conditions for a number of smelting and refining processes for optimum operation based on thermodynamic modelling and high-temperature measurements. A novel process for carbothermic smelting of aluminium has been developed. A process for recovering sulphur from sulphur dioxide-bearing bases has been developed which uses wastes from mining as reagents. Commercial significance of work The extractive metallurgical industry is process-oriented and research is usually applied by making incremental changes to a small number of large, capital-intensive processes.Transfer of this knowledge takes place through a range of activities, the most important being publication of results, patenting of novel process developments, identification of potential commercialising partners, plant trials to demonstrate concepts, company presentations on-site, movement of higher degree students and post-doctoral fellows into Australian companies, and consulting activities by staff of the centre. Why Victoria? Many mining companies have their head offices in Melbourne, making the city an ideal location for the transfer of research to industry. The centre brought together the two leading pyrometallurgical research groups in Australia, which are both located in Melbourne. There are also three corporate metallurgical laboratories in Victoria. Training and education The centre trains postgraduates and postdoctoral personnel in research techniques, research planning and research management in extractive metallurgy, and contributes to the continuing development of practising metallurgists by providing specialist short-courses, symposiums and workshops. Major international conferences are organised in strategically important areas of extractive metallurgy. Business opportunities The centre can assist metallurgical companies and their suppliers find solutions to their pyrometallurgical problems through collaborative and contract research and consulting activities. It can also provide expert advice and training programs. Funding Funding to the centre comes through the Australian Government's CRC Program ($1.9 million per annum) and the Australian metallurgical industry ($730,000 in 1994-95). Further grant money is obtained through the Australian Research Council.

It brings together major commercial companies and research institutions with expertise in the development of specific food/packaging processes and with technical and manufacturing knowledge.The research program has a realistic promise of creating commercial output of great strategic value to Australia's economic and environmental future. R&D strengths This CRC has developed a balanced program of applied and strategic research with wide-reaching generic outcomes as well as targeted commercial gains. The research is focused on three aspects of the food chain: food manufacturing, novel packaging for life extension, and package recycle/disposal.Industry-driven trials provide practical testing of developments, specific commercial targets and a tangible mechanism for transferring technology from research to industry. Commercial significance of work The research programs have been constructed to solve technical impediments to Australia's exporting of value-added food products, particularly into the Asian market. This market is set to expand by $160 billion by the year 2000 and presents the Australian food industry with an unprecedented opportunity.The industry partners recognise the limited time available to exploit this opportunity because American and European companies are gearing themselves to penetrate the market.New trade barriers, based on environmental issues, are also being applied to packaging, which is the crucial element in obtaining the shelf life required for export. Complex science and engineering solutions are required if these opportunities are to be grasped. Why Victoria? Historically, the CRC for International Food Manufacture and Packaging Science concept was driven by the CSIRO Division of Material Science and Technology and Swinburne University of Technology, both based in Melbourne. Other research organisations and industrial partners already had links with these groups through various collaborations. Victoria will become the hub of a truly international p artnership as products developed in Australia are introduced to the Asian market.The Centre is nurturing a comprehensive education program with both task-oriented and research activities. The provision of well-trained, informed and motivated graduates to the Australian food and packaging industries is a major goal of the centre.

These are being developed worldwide, to meet the challenges facing the use of low-rank coal. The new technologies are the key to reducing the cost of electricity and emissions to the environment. R&D strengths The centre's research program is focused on supporting technologies appropriate for low-rank coals. Research areas include: Process-simulation studies for power-generation processes. Handling and beneficiation of coal. Kinetics of coal, beneficiated coal products, and inorganics during combustion and gasification. Fluid bed studies for the applications of drying, combustion and gasification. Computational fluid dynamic studies, particularly for processes in fluid beds. Detection and removal of vaporised sodium from hot gas. Clean-up of waste water resulting from coal-beneficiation processes. Combustion of low-specific-energy gas derived from coal gasification. Successes Although the CRC has been in operation for only two years, there has been considerable interest from several major overseas organisations in the modelling of two-phase flows in fluid beds using computational fluid dynamic codes. Proposals have and are being developed to enable the CRC to collaborate with these companies on specific projects. Commercial significance of work One-third of the electricity generated from coal in Australia is from low-rank coal, mostly in Victoria and South Australia. The high moisture content of these coal leads to low energy efficiency, high carbon dioxide emissions and high capital costs when used in conventional pulverised fuel power plants.Future power stations fuelled with low-rank coal will need to utilise the technologies under development for economic and environmental reasons. Why Victoria? The major Australian resource of low-rank coal is located in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. The former State Electricity Commission of Victoria, which had a major investment in the research, development and utilisation of the coal resource, strongly supported the establishment of the CRC. Training and education Australia does not have an adequate supply of graduates and postgraduates suitably trained in the science and engineering of power generation. One CRC objective is to provide specialist advanced education and training in low-rank coal utilisation.Four training areas have been identified: postgraduate research, undergraduate teaching and research, continuing education, and technical and further education. Achievements to date are the awarding of 20 postgraduate scholarships and support for undergraduate courses via specialist lectures, research and design projects, vacation projects and development of experimental demonstration equipment. Participants Monash University University of Adelaide Swinburne University of Technology Loy Yang Power Ltd Hazelwood Power Corporation Ltd Yallourn Energy Ltd ETSA Corporation CSIRO Division of Minerals Transfield Technologies Pty Ltd Lurgi (Australia) Pty Ltd Memtec Limited Business opportunities Over the next few years, the CRC expects to contract out to local industry the design and construction of research and pilot plants worth some millions of dollars. Funding The centre has total funding of $32.3 million contributed by the participants and the Australian Government. The Commonwealth and Victorian generating companies account for $20 million of this budget.

It pursues fundamental scientific and engineering understanding leading to novel molecular structures and polymer formulations. These materials are aimed at meeting applications of commercial importance in plastics at reduced cost. R&D strengths The centre has the materials knowledge required to design, specify and manufacture improved plastics products. R&D spans computer design of polymer blend components, analysis of molecular conformation, chemical synthesis and scale-up, chemical modification of polymers by reactive processing, blending and compounding to achieve the desired balance of properties, as well as chemical, physical, rheological and mechanical property analysis. Successes Core technology projects in computing and reactive processing have developed tool kits now being used by industry in tactical work.A number of candidate blends are being prepared for industrial trials and are likely to be added to the grade ranges of an industrial participant. The education program is thriving, marketing is in place, and projects are under way with a number of partners. Commercial significance of work Understanding fundamental mechanisms has led to less expensive formulations of materials for volume applications, as well as for improved processing, thereby enhancing the competitive position of Australian manufacturers. Since the industrial property is Australian-owned, it can be used by manufacturers in Australia or offered to processors in the region, gaining export markets. Why Victoria? Much of the Australian polymer manufacturing and processing industry is based in Victoria, as are many leading government and academic research groups. Successful joint projects before the CRC was established offered a good foundation on which to build. Good people, good facilities and good will exist, together with access to innovative manufacturers, all in a supportive government environment. Training and education The CRC supports 11 doctoral students, contributes to undergraduate education by way of an RMIT Bachelor of Polymer Engineering, and sponsors workshops and seminars by invited experts in fields of interest to manufacturing. Academic participants and the Plastics and Chemicals Industry Association offer a wide range of training and education programs.

R&D strengths The core research program of CAST is concerned with solidification, process technology for casting, tooling and prototyping technology, and alloy performance. The research is undertaken at three laboratories in Melbourne and Brisbane and involves about 80 CSIRO, Comalco and University personnel. Commercial significance of work Australia has significant high-quality magnesium and aluminium resources. The country is already a net exporter of cast aluminium auto parts and its automotive casting industry is world competitive.The world market for aluminium components is expected to double during the decade because of the need to decrease the weight of cars in order to meet legislative requirements for reduced fuel consumption and lower exhaust emissions. The currently small market for magnesium components is expected to grow at an even greater rate. Why Victoria? A major participant is in Melbourne - CSIRO's Division of Manufacturing Technology. The Division has pilot plant facilities for both high pressure and low pressure die casting and offers a comprehensive design and prototyping service. Training and education The Centre aims to provide the light alloy casting industry with skilled personnel at levels ranging from technicians and operators to engineers, researchers and managers. About 25 University of Queensland postgraduate students are supported by the centre. Several short courses are conducted annually. Participants CAST is a joint venture between The University of Queensland, CSIRO Division of Manufacturing Technology, Comalco Research Centre, Comalco Foundry Products, the Australian Automotive Technology Centre and the Australian Magnesium Research and Development Project. Business opportunities CAST's Design and Prototyping Service helps business optimise designs for aluminium and magnesium castings and to make functional prototypes. The methods and technologies aim to provide the lightest weight castings consistent with strength and cost requirements. The latest computer-aided design and prototyping technology is used. Funding The net annual worth of CAST's research is approximately $8 million. This amount is made up of in-kind inputs from the University and CSIRO, the Australian Government's CRC grant of $2 million per year, other grants and industry funds.

It aims to commercialise the therapeutic methods, whether pharmaceutical or mechanical, resulting from that research. R&D strengths Twenty-two of its 25 full-time staff are involved in strong research teams working in four core research programs: vascular hyperplasia, cardiac mechanics and muscle assist, electrophysiology, biomaterials and electrodes. These draw heavily on the expertise of the participating institutions and the growing international network established in the US, Europe and Asia. Successes Ten CRC research results have been published in refereed journals, three patents have been lodged and one licensing agreement is ready to sign. The CRC has introduced an intellectual property disclosure process and formed Cardiac CRC Nominees Pty Ltd to hold its intellectual property. Commercial significance of work The research projects are targeted at commercial outcomes with the industrial participants fully participating in the planning and management of research and education programs.To date, the expertise developed in the fields of materials testing and animal models have already attracted overseas interest and contracting arrangements are being negotiated. Three provisional patents have been filed for anti-restenosis agents and a polyurethane is ready for patent application.Several technologies can have applications outside the cardiac field. For example, the 128-channel amplifier array may have industrial applications and the non-invasive tissue monitoring system could be applied to the study of muscle energetics in non-cardiac fields. Discussions are under way for commercialising these technologies. It is expected that the number of similar, commercially significant outcomes will increase in the future. Why Victoria? Although the CRC has its head office at the Royal North Shore Hospital in St Leonards, NSW, it has a significant partner in Victoria in the CSIRO's Division of Chemicals and Polymers, located in Clayton. Training and education In 1993-94 the CRC oversaw the work of 15 postgraduate students and hosted about a dozen seminars by overseas, local and internal scientists. CRC scientists are encouraged to attend and participate in local and international conferences.

In Victoria, this collaboration extends through CSIRO, La Trobe University and Silenus Pty Ltd.The centre was established in 1995 with the aim of developing diagnostic tests for AIDS, Hepatitis, Dengue virus and Alzheimer�s disease to assist in the building of an Australian diagnostic export industry. R&D strengths The CRC supports research programs for the generation of novel reagents and devices based on either proteins or nucleic acids. Initially the protein-based devices will design and produce genetically engineered antibodies as the core re-agents with unique target specificity and affinity. The nucleic acid-based program will develop DNA amplification and hybridisation technology. Successes Several of the participants have been working closely in collaborations which have led to the development of a number of diagnostic technologies, some of which are currently exported. Examples include the SimpliRED diagnostic kits for HIV produced by CSIRO and AGEN Biomedical Ltd and several diagnostic antibodies developed by CSIRO and Bioclone Pty Ltd. Commercial significance of work The world clinical immunodiagnostic market is estimated at $10 billion per annum with similar estimates for veterinary diagnostics. The member companies of the CRC capture selected market niches (both domestic and international) for their diagnostic products. Why Victoria? In excess of 30 per cent of the Commonwealth funding is going to Victorian-based institutions in the 1995-96 financial year. This percentage is expected to increase significantly. Victoria is a key node primarily due to the scientific expertise of CSIRO and La Trobe University. Training and education Programs have been planned that encompass undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, technical training courses and major international conferences. The CRC intends to become a central node for the dissemination of diagnostic expertise in Australia. Participants Queensland University of Technology, CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering, La Trobe University and the Kolling Institute for Medical Research are participants. Commercial partners are Agen Biomedical, Bioclone Australia, PanBio and Silenus Laboratories, all of which are members of the Australian Diagnostic Manufacturers Association. Business opportunities Options for commercialisation will first be given to the core commercial partners, then to the Australian members of ADMA, then to other Australian or international companies. Funding The CRC has total funding of $14.256 million over a seven-year period. Funding in the financial year 1995-96 is $1.056 million with $2.2 million in 1996-97 and subsequent years.

It is estimated that two-thirds of the world's population requires some form of vision correction. The CRC aims to establish a research base from which an export industry can develop and expand to supply this market. R&D strengths The centre has internationally recognised strengths in lens research, biomaterials, laser development and mechanical design and analysis. Research is concentrated on four interdependent areas: Design and Engineering - high-performance contact lenses, particularly for the Asia-Pacific market. Biomaterials - new biocompatible contact lenses and an artificial cornea. Biological Sciences - control of ocular problems such as inflammation associated with contact lens wear, dry eye conditions and cataracts. Clinical Research - advice on the clinical requirements and performance of the centre's products. Successes In four years, the centre's scientific output includes more than 70 research papers and book chapters. The CRC brought the Asia project to commercialisation stage. This involved the development of a rigid gas-permeable lens designed for the Asian eye that can be easily fitted and safely worn over extended periods. Nine patent applications are in progress. Commercial significance Vision problems are a worldwide phenomena. In the Asia-Pacific region alone an estimated 1.3 billion people suffer visual disorders.This market is being directly addressed by the Asia project. Contact lens manufacture and marketing is a global business worth approximately $3 billion at the manufacturing level, and at least double that at the consumer level. The potential total market for current CRC products is estimated at $1000 million. Why Victoria? The central node of the CRC is at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Victorian participants include the Victorian College of Optometry (National Vision Research Institute) and the CSIRO Division of Chemicals and Polymers.World-class research into ocular biochemistry is being carried out at the National Vision Research Institute, which could lead to treatment and prevention strategies for cataracts and presbyopia.Work at the CSIRO Division of Chemicals and Polymers focuses on the development of extended-wear contact lenses and artificial corneas. The Division has extensive experience in collaborating with industry to produce novel biomaterials and medical devices. The CRC is using the Division's skills in polymer synthesis, materials and surface science. Training and education In 1995 the CRC had 26 postgraduate students, half receiving funding under the Australia Postgraduate Research Awards (Industry) and 11 supported through the centre's postgraduate scholarships. As part of the centre�s commitment to continuing and professional education, a regular seminar series is run.In 1993 the CRC helped establish the Centre for Optometric Education to provide continuing education for the optometric profession.

Its aim is to improve the quality and competitive position of Australian wool and wool products in the world textile fibre market.The centre works closely with the International Wool Secretariat to ensure that the research and development activities are market driven and relevant to the business of improving product quality at all stages of the wool business system. R&D strengths Genetic engineering, molecular and quantitative genetics, wool metrology, wool biology, wool processing, wool production, wool fibre structure and properties constitute the R &D strengths of this CRC. Successes There have already been successes in a number of areas including genetic technologies to improve wool quality and production efficiency, undergraduate education and wool education training for Australia's overseas customers. Commercial significance of work The present value of wool exports from Australia is about $3.6 billion annually. The research and education programs of the Wool CRC are directed at improving quality of product at all stages of wool production.These improvements are vital components of a national strategy to lift wool's share of the textile fibre market and restore the industry to viable levels of profitability.Australia is well placed to expand exports of value-added wool products, particularly in the form of tops which at present constitute only about 5 per cent of the total wool exports. The strategic activities of the Wool CRC in follicle and fibre structure and function will generate the basic knowledge required for the development of improved processing technologies and new wool-based products. Why Victoria? A critical node of the Wool CRC is based in Victoria because of the involvement of the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology, Geelong. Specifically, the CRC's research into fibre structure and follicle function is based at Geelong, and many of the CRC wools are processed in the Division. Training and education The Wool CRC offers an innovative education program including a comprehensive PhD program in wool and core courses for wool science and technology degrees in four universities. The CRC is responsible for the key units in these programs, which are presented live across the four campuses using interactive video teaching methods. Specialist lectures are presented by expert research staff of the CRC. From this base a range of training programs for personnel in the wool industry are being developed. Participants The joint venture parties include the International Wool Secretariat, CSIRO Institute of Animal Production and Processing, the West Australian Department of Agriculture, and the Universities of New England, New South Wales, Adelaide and Western Australia. Supporting parties include NSW Agriculture, Giovanni Schneider & Co Ltd, the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia and the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd. Business opportunities There are strong opportunities for Victorian wool processing and merchant (broking, exporting) sectors to become involved in collaborative research and education/training activities with the Wool CRC.The CRC is actively involved in discussions with Deakin University, CSIRO and IWS regarding a proposed Centre of Excellence in the Textile Industry at Geelong, and welcomes other approaches from Victorian industry. Funding Total funds (in cash or in-kind resources) committed by the parties to the joint venture over the initial seven-year period are around $42 million, with a further $15.5 million in cash provided from the CRC Program. Funding is also provided by the supporting parties listed above and the New South Wales and Western Australian State Governments have made substantial cash grants.

EBN will be significantly faster and carry much greater volumes of data over interstate distances, than has been possible before.The CRC brings together major commercial companies and research institutions with a view to developing Australia's position in the network technology and applications arena. R&D strengths Research focuses on identifying and developing new network services that allow organisations to gain competitive advantage or improve the efficiency and quality of service. Four main research projects explore different technical issues and user needs: Geographically dispersed high-performance computers are being linked to operate as one super-powerful computer. Effective information retrieval systems are being developed for exploiting the information on the world�s databases. Interactive multimedia information is being distributed over network systems. Cost-effective access to advanced information and communications services such as desktop video conferencing and multimedia databases is being developed. Commercial significance of work The Internet and the related World Wide Web undoubtedly represent the single phenomenon most likely to change the face of the world community as we know it today. Commercial organisations who fail to recognise the competitive advantages and organisational implications of emerging network technologies are liable to find themselves struggling in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. The CRC is committed to maintaining Australia's position as one of the forerunners in network technology. Why Victoria? The centre is administered at Monash University in Melbourne, with partners at research establishments in each major city in Australia. This national structure is crucial in establishing an extensive and realistic network testbed for Victorian applications developers and Victorian organisations, with an interest in using networks for communications and data transfer. Training and education The CRC has a range of short courses in telecommunications network technology for industry and research participants and can tailor these to request if demand is sufficient. Given the fast-moving nature of the technology, interaction and suggestions from industry are welcomed.

Its headquarters are in Hobart. R&D strengths The CRC is undertaking three research programs: Genetic Improvement: aims to achieve plantation production gains by improving genetic stock. This involves initially identifying the genetic resource and then deploying this matter into plantations. Soil and Stand Management: examines forest growth and yield with respect to environmental factors such as temperature, climate and the availability of nutrients and water from the soil system. Resource Protection: aims to enhance productivity within native forests and plantations by reducing loss of productivity caused by insects, vertebrates and disease damage. Successes Progress has been made in the areas of evaluating genetic resources and basing selections for breeding and eventual deployment into plantations on this information. Basic understanding of the biological processes within the forest system is enabling better management decisions to be made in order to increase productivity and maintain the inherent capacity of the land for future production. Commercial significance of work Forestry as a business is different to many others as the turn around time between rotations is of the order of decades rather than years. The gain in productivity of eucalypt plantations through improved genetic stock and improved establishment practices has been estimated at more than 200 cubic metres of wood per hectare over 20 years. Implementation of the results of research are shown in dynamic and improved decision making in plantation management and through the incorporation of selected genetic stock within our plantations. Why Victoria? Amcor Plantations, an industry participant in the CRC, is Australia's largest private forestry company, with an estate of over 50,000 hectares of both hardwood and softwood plantations in Gippsland, Victoria.The company is in the process of expanding the area of eucalypt (hardwood) plantation and is aiming for better productivity from existing and future plantation areas through a comprehensive R&D program. A component of the field research occurs on APL�s site in Gippsland, Victoria. Training and education Training is offered in the form of workshops for industry staff and postgraduate studies generally undertaken in Hobart.

The CRC is also addressing constraints to the beef industry arising from community concerns about animal health and welfare and waste management. R&D strengths Three research programs cover the main influences on meat quality: molecular and quantitative genetics; meat science; and growth and nutrition. A fourth sub-program covers major constraints to the industry: animal health and welfare, feedlot waste management and industry economics. Successes A range of products with major benefits for the industry include: tools for predicting meat quality on live animals; better quality carcasses at lower cost from improved breeding techniques; breeding stock with improved feed-conversion efficiency; techniques to eliminate pre-slaughter stress effects on meat colour and tenderness; strategies to manage young cattle to improve finishing on grass and grain; and vaccines to eliminate feedlot-specific diseases. Commercial significance of work With annual earnings of $3.7 billion and exports of $2.6 billion, the beef industry is vital to Australia's economy. New markets in Asia offer potential for further growth, but the market share will depend on the ability to match specification to consumer requirements. In Japan alone, the opportunity to improve carcass grades of Australian beef will earn $200 million more a year.The CRC's objectives are to assist the beef industry become more profitable and anticipate and adapt to changing value-based markets. Activities are closely aligned with industry needs through the involvement of an industry-driven Board and the participation of co-operating breeding herds from the seedstock industry. Why Victoria? The CRC's health and welfare program is located at the CSIRO's laboratory in Parkville. At this site, scientists are developing new vaccines against cattle respiratory disease, a major cause of sickness and death among feedlot cattle in Australia. The group should have a vaccine ready for commercialisation by mid-1996.

It brings together six partners who seek to develop generic technologies for the design of future vaccines, to help industry apply these strategies to specific medical and veterinary vaccines and to provide training to strengthen Australia's vaccine industry. The centre is based in Queensland with a partner in Sydney and four partners in Melbourne. R&D strengths The CRC undertakes five research programs: Identification of the critical proteins of antigens and methods for folding proteins to induce protective immune responses. Induction of cytotoxic or killer T cells to protect against viruses and tumours. Induction of the correct type of immune response such that appropriate effector mechanisms are activated to combat an infection. Construction of multi-meric vaccines that have the ability to protect against multi-strains of a particular pathogen or multi-pathogens. Development of an effective vaccine against influenza that induces both antibody and cellular immune responses. As well as these programs, a number of taskforces exist to focus on particular vaccines as opposed to generic technology. Successes The CRC is currently involved in clinical trials of two vaccines for Epstein Barr virus and malaria. If the EBV trials are successful the technology could be applied to many vaccines. Studies from the malaria trials were reported at the International Congress of Immunology in San Francisco of 1995. Both these trials test generic technology. Commercial significance of work One of the centre's major aims is to maximise the efficacy of vaccines of interest to commercial partners - such as streptococci, Epstein Barr virus, malaria, influenza, cattle ticks, babesia, gastrointestinal nematodes and veterinary hormones. The major advantage of the veterinary vaccines is that they replace chemicals and biologically active substances currently in use to control these diseases.There is increasing public concern over the use of chemicals due to residues in the environment and in the food. In addition, many parasites have developed resistance to these chemicals, requiring new and more potent products to be developed. Vaccination could replace all of these. The potential market for vaccines exceeds the current market for chemicals which is worth several billion dollars per year. Why Victoria? Four of the six partners are based in Australia�s medical biotechnology centre known as the "The Parkville Strip". Training The centre runs seminar programs, staff members lecture at universities and postgraduate students work on research projects supported by the centre. Participants Queensland Institute of Medical Research The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne University of Melbourne CSIRO Melbourne, Sydney, Queensland CSL Limited Biotech Australia Pty, Sydney Business opportunities Local vaccine manufacturers will be able to draw on CRC know-how to design and produce vaccines which significantly improve health and productivity. This may lead to new vaccines in the long term and improvements to existing vaccines within the first seven years of the CRC. Funding The centre operates on a $5.5 million annual budget of which $2 million is provided by the Australian Government. The commercial partners between them provide $0.9 million annually, while the research organisations provide a total of $2.6 million.

The centre aims to produce higher quality, more efficiently grown and contaminant-free grapes for all purposes. R&D strengths Research resources are concentrated in areas where the greatest technological and economic gains can be made. Findings are disseminated and taken up within the commercial grape growing industry. Current projects aim to: Improve grapes and grape products through biotechnology. This involves the development of molecular techniques for identifying grapevine varieties, clones and economically important grapevine pathogens and pests, and the use of molecular methods for genetically transforming grapevines and wine yeasts. Establish optimal viticultural systems through the development of strategic vine management systems which are climate sensitive. These will enable vineyard managers to reduce inputs, particularly agrochemicals, without any reduction in grape quality. Establish systems for the characterisation and control of the ripening processes that determine the quality of the grapes. Successes AusVit: Computer-based systems to support pest, disease, nutrition and irrigation management in vineyards. An assay which provides a simple, objective measure of the most important components of grape quality, needed to make premium quality wine. Commercial significance of work The centre's programs will contribute towards industry achieving its growth targets. Long an important regional industry, Australian viticulture has rapidly enhanced its national economic significance as an export earner over the last decade. Today, rising exports of wine and table grapes are winning new acclaim for our products of the vine - with combined viticultural exports projected to exceed $1 billion by the year 2000. Why Victoria? Australian dried vine fruit production is based around Sunraysia which has a long-standing international reputation for the highest quality. Over 200 wineries operate in Victoria, producing a wide range of boutique and commercial wines. The Victorian wine industry produces more than 15 per cent of Australia�s total wine production. Training Research findings are being presented to the commercial grape growing sector through formal University and TAFE courses, field days, seminars, vineyard-based extension activities and targeted communications within the industry.

The CRC is concerned with the water cycle which commences at the catchment reservoir and finishes at the consumer's tap, ie. the cost-effective provision of safe drinking water. R&D strengths For the first time, experts on epidemiology, risk estimation, reservoir and catchment processes, water-treatment techniques, chemical and biological processes in distribution systems and water-quality monitoring have been brought together in an integrated effort to look closely at the optimum approach to the provision of drinking water. Successes The individual partners in the CRC have a long history of research successes, ranging from the development of new water-treatment and monitoring systems to the dissemination of new knowledge about environmental factors impinging on water quality. They have always be en closely integrated with the Australian water industry and the formation of the CRC reinforces this close industry collaboration. Commercial significance of work The water industry in Australia involves capital assets with a total value around $60 billion. About one-third of this figure is tied up by the provision of drinking water. The new Australian Drinking Water Guidelines will add significant pressure to water authorities to maximise the efficiency of their service provision.There is significant and expanding scope to export the goods and services developed for the Australian water industry, particularly to the rapidly growing and urbanising regions of South-East Asia. Europe and the US also provide export opportunities. Why Victoria? Of the 17 partners involved in the CRC, eight are from Victoria, the largest number from any State. The Victorian partners have significant strengths across the water sector and include a major research group (CSIRO), two universities (Monash and RMIT), a water authority, as well as a consultant, contractor and a chemical supplier. All elements of the industry are well represented in the Victorian partners, thus providing a great opportunity for commercial development and exploitation. Training and education A significant education and training program involves co-operation between universities in Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra. This program aims to develop major educational activities ranging from postgraduate research, through honours and undergraduate coursework to international student exchange and public education. It aims to establish a strong interface with the Water Industry Education Training Authority of Australia (WIETA) and establish a specialty Master's Program in Water Quality and Treatment, with Graduate Diploma and Graduate Certificate Options in distance-education mode. Participants CRC Research Partners: Australian Water Quality Centre, Adelaide CSIRO Division of Chemicals & Polymers, Clayton Australian Water Technologies Ensight, Sydney University of Adelaide University of South Australia Monash University, Department of Social and Preventive Medicine RMIT Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (NCEPH), Canberra CMPS&F Environmental, Melbourne CRC Industry Partners: South Australian Water Corporation ACT Electricity and Water, Canberra West Australian Water Authority Melbourne Water Corporation Water Services Association of Australia, Melbourne Australian Water Services, Sydney Thames Water International, Melbourne ICI Watercare, Melbourne Business opportunities There are many opportunities for the provision of goods and services to the water supply industry, ranging from the provision of complete design-construct-and-operate contracts to the supply of particular pieces of equipment and/or services.While the industry partners in the CRC will have first access to any research outcomes, there will be ample opportunity for small to medium-sized enterprises to develop specialised business opportunities around particular products or services. Leveraged support to develop export opportunities is available through a number of Australian Government programs. Funding The CRC has Australian Government funding support for a period of seven years. After the first year of operation the proposed budget for the CRC will be around $7 million per annum, comprising about $4.8 million from research and industry partners and $2.2 million from the Australian Government.

The CRC for Weed Management Systems was established in July 1995 to conduct and co-ordinate innovative research resulting in practical,integrated weed management systems.These will increase productivity and product quality, decrease costs, enhance sustainability and conserve biodiversity in natural and agricultural ecosystems. R&D strengths Participants have expertise in education, weed-management extension, agricultural economics, weed-management policy, weed biology and ecology, weed-population dynamics and modelling, biological control, crop and pasture agronomy, herbicide biochemistry and herbicide-formulation technology.Industry participants represent the major agricultural industries and the environment protection industry. Resources include state-of-the-art facilities for biological control (in Australia and overseas), herbicide technology laboratories, plant research laboratories, greenhouses, insect-rearing facilities and training facilities. Commercial significance of work Most of the work of the CRC will be carried out for public good. Commercial products will be developed: print and electronic advice, support publications, training courses, transgenic crop and pasture cultivars and, possibly, mycoherbicides and new herbicide formulations. Why Victoria? The CRC for Weed Management Systems is headquartered in South Australia. The Victorian partner is the Keith Turnbull Research Institute (Department of Conservation and Natural Resources). It is a key participant in the CRC because of its extensive experience and resources in the integrated management of weeds in temperate Australia. Training and education Training is a very important role of the CRC. A suite of weed science and weed-management programs is being implemented to offer for the first time in Australia a co-ordinated approach to educating undergraduates, postgraduates, professional land and natural resource managers, and the community.The Communication and Adoption Program aims to interact with researchers and land managers, to communicate the results of weed research and foster the adoption of resulting weed-management strategies. Participants Core Participants: University of Adelaide NSW Agriculture CSIRO Divisions of Entomology and Plant Industry Supporting Participants: Victorian Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (KeithTurnbull Research Institute) University of Sydney Grains Research and Development Corporation Australian Nature Conservation Agency Avcare (representing the agrichemical industry) Funding The following funds will be contributed over the seven-year life of the CRC: participants (cash and in-kind) $31.668 million, Australian Government contribution $14.256 million.

This sector had potential in the first half of the 21st centuryto have a bigger impact on Victoria than the gold rush, the Premier,Mr. Kennett, said today. 'The Victorian Government will be the first in Australia to developa comprehensive public and private sector plan for infrastructureand services to capitalise on the emerging information superhighway. The Premier told Parliament the Government was well advanced witha strategy that would open the way to enormous efficiencies ingovernment, improved service delivery for Victorians and dramaticexpansion across the communicatons and multimedia sector. 'The Government has set the groundwork, for the strategy with: The establishment of a special Cabinet Subcommittee; Formation of a working group of senior public servants toidentify opportunities for application of multimedia technologyin government; The appointment of the Victoriian Communications and MultimediiaTask Force of top level Government and private sector representativesheaded by the Premier; The creation of an Office of Communications and Multimediawithin the Department of Premier and Cabinet to drive and co-ordinate-.vork in this field from a whole-of-government perspective; Provision of $3 million to back up the work of the task force;and The allocation of $80 million in last week' s Autumn EconomicStatement for technological projects across government over theenext year. The task force has set up three subcommittees - to promote businessdevelopment in communications and multimedia, specially in communicationssystems and the software and content required to service the multimediaindustry, to act as an advocate on behalf of Victoria with industryand other governments; and to advise on the Government's use ofmultimedia technologies in its administration, service deliveryand communications. Mr Kennet has detailed Victoria's initiatives in a letter to thePrime Minister this week and sought a prominent role for the Statein the Commonwealth's establishment of the National InformationServices Council, the Australian Multimedia Enterprise and itsCo-operative Multimedia Centres program. The Premier has suggested some overlapping membership beitweenVictoria's task force and the national council and that the multimediaenterprise should be based in Victoria. He also offered an initial contribution of $500,000 and ongoingproject support for the establishment of a Co-operative Multimedia Centre in Victoria. "I am particlarly excited about the possibilities for Victorianfirms to carve out a major role in The global provision of multimediaproducts and services," Mr Kennett said. " addition, the Government will use the power of communications technologyand mullitmed to transform the way it provides services to andcommunicates with the public." "The Government is acting quickly on a wide front to maximiseopportunities an edge on competing locations both within Australiaand in our region." "We have set objectives that over the next six years theGovernment should develop extensive communications and multimedianetworks and services, and that the industry in Victoria shouldachieve pre-eminence in the field." The Government is already trialing new technology in satellitelinks to school, InterNet access, telemedicine in health diagnosticservices and the digitisation of Film Victoria's library. Furthertrials are proposed in delivery technology, including broadbandtrials conducted by carriers, kiosks to provide street-front deliveryof Government services and information, and promotion for the Victorian food industry. Advanced communications networks are being established withinthe public sector, and the Premier said it was envisaged the systemsbeing developed for the Government would be marketable to othergovernments in Australia and overseas and, in some cases, to the private sector.

It is an extremely active branch, with a much higher percentage of members attending meetings than some other branches.Many members work "out bush" at the many mines sites in the NT.Unfortunately, we currently have no members south of Katherine. Thereare area representatives in Gove, Jabiru, Pine Creek, Alice Springsand Katherine. We would like to appoint an area representative for Tennant Creek. The Branch currently has the immediate Past-President (1996) of RACInationally, Dr Barry Noller, as its Past-President. The Branch hosted 13AC/4EC, July 9 - 14, 1995. This, a joint conferenceof the Analytical and Environmental Divisions of RACI, was the first divisional conference to be held in the NT. Copies of the two proceedingsare available at a cost of $25 (Analytical) and $15 (Environmental) from Brian Salter-Duke, at the Branch address below. Further information canbe obtained by clicking on the e-mail address at the bottom of this page, or by phone on 089-466702. Look here for details about the Branch Committee.

The RSC presence in the NT is Brian Salter-Duke at the Northern Territory University. Brian is the NT Local Representative. There are representatives in all the States and Territories. The national local representative is Professor Alan Bond at Monash University. The local representatives have two functions. they select the annual RSC Lecturer and then organise the lecturer's trip to their own State or Territory. In 1995 it wasProfessor Ted Baker from New Zealand. The 1996 lecture has recentlybeen given by Bob Cattrell. they hold some information about the RSC including membership forms and details of RSC Research Grants. It is unlikely that the 1997 RSC Lecturer will visit Darwin. Click here to go to theRSC Home Page. This page is maintained by Brian Salter-Duke,b_duke@lacebark.ntu.edu.au.

It may also be useful to staff of the University and chemists outside the University who wish to advise on the development of courses in Chemistry. Every effort has been made to ensure that the information in the document is accurate, but it is not an official University document, and if it differs from the official University rules, those rules prevail. Chemistry staff are responsible for Chemistry courses in the following degrees and diplomas:- Bachelor of Science Joint Bachelor of Laws/Bachelor of Science Joint Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Economics Associate Diploma of Applied Science Bachelor of Science with Honours Graduate Diploma in Science Graduate Diploma in Chemistry Graduate Certificate in Chemistry Master of Science Master of Science in Computational Chemistry Doctor of Philosophy as well as for bridging units in chemistryfor students who wish to proceed to degree level units or otherwise require a greater knowledge of chemistry. Chemistry courses are the responsibility of the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the Faculty of Science. On official matters, or if in doubt about the correct channel, students should consult the Associate Dean of the School.Course coordinators are identified at various points in thesepages. Chemistry is also taught in the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the Joint Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Science degree.Chemistry staff are sometimes involved in this teaching.

Chemistry is the study of elements and compounds, their laws of combination and their behaviour under various conditions. Changing one substance into another, as well as making substances of desired properties, is the work of the chemist: nylon from coal and petroleum, and nitrogenous fertilisers from air are but two examples. There are five major divisions of chemistry: physical, inorganic, organic, analytical and environemntal. The last two in many places, including the NTU, are often taught together. Analytical Chemistry is the scientific discipline which develops and applies methods, instuments and strategies to obtain information on the composition and nature of matter in space and time. Environemntal chemistry applies aspects of all the other four divisions of chemistry in studying environmental processes. Inorganic chemistry is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of substances formed by metal and non-metallic elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus and chlorine. Industrial inorganic compounds include fertilisers, ores, acids, alkalides and salts. Organic chemistry is concerned with carbon compounds. The designation "organic" comes from earlier days when all such substances known came from organisms. Nowadays many compounds are produced in the laboratory, and often also in the factory: for example plastics and synthetic fibres, medicinal drugs, insecticides, fungicides and dyes. Physical chemists use physical and mathematical methods to study the laws that govern the nature and the rates of chemical reactions and the energy available from them, the forces that bind atoms together, and the effects of electricity and radiation on chemical substances.In every field of chemistry the varied nature of the work challenges young chemists to thought and experiment. The solution of chemical problems gives them a sense of achievement, and the need to find solutions stimulates their intellectual development. Although a graduate chemist in his/her first job may have to become familiar with routine procedures, these are now mostly done with the aid of commercially made instruments such as spectrometers and chromatographs, operated with the assistance of junior staff. Commonly used instruments often cost $10,000 and some cost more than $100,000. The chemist must assess the results obtained from them. The bunsen burner and test tube may still be used, but they are no longer the appropriate symbols of modern chemistry. The sophisticated instruments now available lead to higher levels of understanding and of process control than were possible formerly, and this in turn places new demands on the chemists in charge of the operation or experiment. Consequently chemists aspiring to leading positions should be highly trained. Fully professional chemists are members of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute and are entitled to call themselves "Chartered Chemists" and put the letters "C.Chem." after their name. To achieve this level, you must have a university degree in Chemistry plus 4 years experience. The NTU B.Sc degree with a major in Chemistry allows you to become a graduate member of RACI and go on to obtain the 4 years of experience. Chemists are employed in a number of capacities:- Teaching chemistry in secondary schools, in colleges of advanced education, in technical colleges, in institutes of technology and in universities. Industry. In Australia more than 600 companies employ chemists. Many are engaged in research problems, devising new or better processes for compounds or seeking an explanation of observed phenomena. Others are concerned with the application to industry of the discoveries made by research chemists. Others again are engaged in technical sales and advisory service work. Not only are chemists employed by chemical firms, mining firms, firms manufacturing steel and other metals, motor vehicles and heavy machinery, but increasingly the process industries are involved, eg those which manufacture ceramics, detergents and soaps, adhesives, foodstuffs of all kinds, wines and spirits, petroleum, paint, paper and other forest products, plastics, rubber, tanning and textiles, and pharmaceutical. Some chemists in industry leave the laboratory after some years to become administrators within the company. Government and university research. In the Australian Public Service departments of Supply, Defence, Health, Science, Minerals and Energy, and Northern Development, chemists work in fields such as mineral chemistry, chemistry of natural products, fuels, nutrition and biochemistry. They are to be found also in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and in the CSIRO Chemical Research Laboratories and the Division of Animal Health, Food Processing Technology, Forest Products, Mineral Chemistry, Fisheries and Tribophysics, Soils, and Wool and Meat Research Laboratories. Chemists work also in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Customs and Excise, in Telecom, in State departments of Primary Industry, Health, Mines and Railways, and in local authority departments of electricity supply, sewerage, roads, water, etc. The biggest employer of chemists in Australia is the Department of Supply. About one-third of CSIRO's 4000 scientists are chemists. Northern Territory employers include the Department of Mines and Energy, Transport and Works, Health, Primary Industry and Fisheries, and analytical laboratories in the mining industries. Chemists work also in oceanography, environmental pollution studies, cancer and other medical research, and in operations research. The training in experiment and logical thought which chemistry students receive fits them also for diverse kinds of employment besides those which are specifically chemistry. Education through chemistry gives a real appreciation of the scientific method, and an understanding of our technological society. Good chemistry graduates have a very marketable commodity - themselves. The wide-ranging nature of the subject compels its practitioners to operate from fundamental principles and to be adaptable and flexible, qualities which are today greatly in demand. Degrees higher than B.Sc. are now required for teaching and research positions in tertiary education, for the better positions in research organisations, and for many of those in industry. Good students should seriously consider taking a higher degree, and would be wise to explore carefully all developing employment possibilities so that they remain continuously aware of the areas and levels of employment entry available to them. Chemistry is a vital science for a much wider range of degrees. For this reason Chemistry is offered to nursing and engineering students, as well as the Science students. Chemical industry and research laboratories also offer careers as Technical Officers. The Analytical Chemistry stream of the Associate Diploma in Applied Science offers the appropriate training for these careers. Students frequently study for the Associate Diploma part-time while working as a trainee technical officer in a laboratory. Some Associate Diploma holders move on to study for a degree in Chemistry and may receive appropriate credit towards the degree for the course they have completed in the Associate diploma. The Associate Diploma in Applied Science also leads to professional recognition by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute. Qualified Chemistry Technical Officers can add the letters TRACI after their names. More information about the Royal Australian Chemical Institute is available on the webor from any of the Chemistry staff. Brian Salter-Duke isthe current President of the NT Branch of RACI.

The information given in these pages is intended to be as correctas possible, but if there is any discrepency between the informationgiven here and the information given in the "University Calandar", the latter takes precedence. B.SC AND B.SC(HONS) The B.Sc degree of the Northern Territory University was introduced in 1990. The B.Sc(Hons) degreewas offered for the first time in 1991. A total of 240 credit points are required for a B.Sc. Pass Degree including at least 60 credit points at P level or better from third level subjects. No more than 100 credit points from first level courses may be included. A normal program would include 80 credit points from first level subjects. These very general requirements are designed to provide students with maximum freedom of choice in their course structure. Some students may work to pursue a very general course, selecting subjects in many different disciplines; others may choose a very narrow course spreading in only one subject area (eg Chemistry). You may select courses in Chemistry in such a way that your degree certificate will be marked "Major in Chemistry" or "Minor in Chemistry". You can also obtain a major in two disciplines. To obtain a minor in chemistry, you must complete 60 credit points at P level or better in Chemistry including 20 credit points from third level subjects. To major in Chemistry, you must obtain 40 credit points from chemistry courses at third level at P level or above, along with all required prerequisites and 20 credit points in Mathematics or Physics. An interdisciplinary major in Chemistry and Biochemistry is similar with 20 credit points from third level chemistry courses replaced by 20 credit points from third level biochemistry courses. A major in Chemistry leads to qualifications as a professional chemist and a career in teaching, industry or research. It meets the requirements of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute for Graduate Membership and, after four years of experience, for Associate Membership. Students who have completed units in the University of Queensland B.Sc or the B.App.Sc (both taught up to 1991) will be given credit for these units towards the NTU B Sc. This will be on the basis that 12 credit points in the University of Queensland B.Sc will be equivalent to 10 credit points of the NTU B.Sc. There are chemistry components in the joint degrees, B. Eng. / B. Sc., B. Sc. / B. Econ. and B. Sc. / LL.B. Holders of the Associate Diploma inApplied Science may obtain exemptionsfor up to 80 credit points towards the requirements of the B Sc. B Sc CHEMISTRY UNITS LEVEL 1 These two units, which should be considered together with students strongly encouraged to take both, are designed to give students a thorough and broad introduction to modern chemistry, providing a basis either for continued work in chemistry at degree or associate diploma level or for using chemistry in other disciplines.

The policy is that a grade of PT (Pass Terminal) is just that - a terminal pass. It does not qualify for prerequisite purposes. However, for some units, particularly for SCH101, a PC (Pass Conceded) grade may be used and this is accepted for prerequisite purposes. MAJORS: At least 40 credit points from third level Chemistry units ata grade of P or better. There is a joint major in Chemistry and Biochemistry that requiresat least 20 credit points from third level units in each of the twoareas of study. See the Calendar for details. There is a new joint major inmathematical modelling of physical and chemical systems whichcan contain some chemistry. MINORS: 60 credit points at grade P or above in SCH units including at least 20 creditpoints selected from third level Chemistry. Return to Programs and Units in Chemistry Page.

In order to facilitate the analysis of power plant performance and to produce relevant publications, the data were computerized in 1980, and the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) was implemented. Since then, PRIS has been continuously updated and improved and it now constitutes the most complete data bank on nuclear power reactors in the world. It has been widely used and today constitutes an essential source of information on nuclear power. PRIS covers two kinds of data: general and design information on power reactors, and information about operating experience with nuclear power plants. General and design information covers all reactors that are in operation, under construction, or shut-down in IAEA Member States, and in Taiwan, China. Data on operating experience cover operational reactors, and historical data cover shutdown reactors, in IAEA Member States and in Taiwan, China. In these areas PRIS is considered the most complete and authoritative source of statistical data. PRIS makes it possible to easily identify individual nuclear units and their main characteristics, and to determine nuclear power development status and trends worldwide, in regions, or in individual countries. Since 1990, the IAEA has compiled information on additional technical characteristics. It covers items related to the mode of plant operation, safety characteristics, safety features, existence of safety analysis reports and of emergency plans, and the plant environment, for example. This additional information on plant characteristics provides a better overview of plant design and mode of operation. In order to assess plant performance, indicators are used. PRIS provides information on availability and unavailability factors, load factor, planned unavailability factor, and unplanned unavailability factors due to causes at the plant and externally. Outage analysis provides indications on the reasons for a plant's unavailability. Statistical analysis, as well as studies of individual units or utilities, can provide indications about problem areas and what remedial actions and measures can be applied to achieve performance improvements. PRIS provides data in support of such analyses. Originally, PRIS data were stored using a generalized database management system called Adabas, developed and marketed by Software AG, in Germany. This system used Natural query language to retrieve and process the PRIS data. Recently, PRIS has been re-designed and downloaded to a LAN-based environment using client-server architecture for database systems. The database is now installed on Microsoft SQL server under an OS/2 operating environment. The primary objectives of the new design were to improve flexibility of data entry, reduce complexity of relational operations required, and provide more user-friendly interfaces for database maintenance and users. The graphical user interface was developed using a front-end (client) tool, Object View, that runs using Microsoft Windows. The new system contains two different interfaces, one for database maintenance and a second for data retrieval (the reporting system). Through the reporting system, the user can access detailed information about a country, its reactor sites and nuclear power plants. It presents general and design information for a nuclear power plant, its yearly and monthly production, including performance factors and outages. It also presents information about national electricity production and national nuclear production. The system enables the user to make flexible queries using a set of selection criteria, and it presents tables or charts and enables data to be downloaded to any Windows application. The new system has been used at the IAEA since the beginning of 1995 and is scheduled to be released to IAEA Member States through dial-up or INTERNET by the end of the year. PRIS PUBLICATIONS The PRIS database is used to produce two annual IAEA publications: Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Plants in Member States, published since 1971; and Nuclear Power Reactors in the World, Reference Data Series No.2, published since 1981 It also is used to provide material for other IAEA publications. Statistical analysis are also carried out either for use within the IAEA or on request from Member States and outside organizations. PRIS SERVICES On-line Access. In 1989 the PRIS database was made available on-line for direct access via the international public data networks or public switched telephone system. This service, called PRIS On-line, was kept operating free of charge. Currently, about 70 users in 28 Member States and 4 international organizations have on-line access. This service will be improved with the release of the new system, which enables a direct connection to the PRIS data base under Windows through the INTERNET or through direct dial-up connection to the IAEA. MicroPRIS. In parallel with the on-line access system, the Agency has offered MicroPRIS to Member States, free of charge, since January 1991. This is a personal computer (PC) version of data available on diskette in a form readily accessible by standard, commercially available PC packages. Currently, there are about 200 organizations in 54 Member States and 8 international organizations using MicroPRIS. AD-HOC Requests As noted earlier, PRIS is extensively used in the IAEA as a data source for various IAEA publications and papers. Additionally, PRIS staff respond to requests from IAEA Member States ranging from simple queries to complicated analyses. These requests typically are answered by sending data sets as computer printouts on diskettes or magnetic tapes. HOW TO ORDER PRIS SERVICES PRIS On-line. The IAEA PRIS on-line access has been granted to Member States free of charge until further notice. To get the PRIS on-line access a Subscription Form must be completed and sent to the IAEA. The access authorization is accomplished through the issuance of a password by the IAEA to its Member States and International Member Organizations. MicroPRIS.MicroPRIS is provided to any Member States or International Member Organization free of charge until further notice.

New interface for seeking prospective reviewers. We want as much as possible to carry out correspondence with reviewers and to seek reviews using the internet. If you are willing to review books, please send us some details via a special forms interface or send e-mail to the Book Review account raci@lacebark.ntu.edu.au, giving an indication of the type of book you would like to receive.

RACI-BOOKS - a new e-mail list for reviewers We have developed an e-mail list for everyone interesting in reviewing books. You can request subscription to the list from the forms interface mentioned above. The list will be moderated by the book review editors but general comments on book reviewing, of interest to all reviewers, are welcome. The editor of "Chemistry in Australia" will also be a subscriber to the list. When we get books we will send out details to the list in order to seek reviewers. Of course we will also continue the previous editor's practice of just selecting reviewers in some cases. List messages to web page - NEW! The list has another special feature.

Previous message: listproc@lacebark.ntu.edu.au: "SUBSCRIBE RACI-BOOKS RACIBOOKS"To all book reviewers for "Chemistry in Australia". Greetings, Happy New Year and thanks for your help in 1996. I have established an e-mail list to which I have subscribed all reviewers whose e-mail address is known to me. This is the first message I have sent out to the list. The list is intended for:- 1. Messages from the book review editors indicating books awaiting review and other general matters. 2. Messages from the "Chemistry in Australia" editor to book reviwers. 3. Messages from book reviewers to other book reviewers on matters of general interest. Messages under 3 are moderated - they go first to me for approval to send to the list. As a consequence you will not receive junk messages and in fact the number of messages should be quite small. To send a message to the list, you simply send an e-mail to:- raci-books@lacebark.ntu.edu.au Note that the messages to the list are public in that they are automatically put on a web page which can be reached from the Book Review main page:- http://lacebark.ntu.edu.au/raci/RACIbooks.html This page is made using software called hypermail. The list is run by the software called listproc - the free version 6.0c, often called unix-listproc. To obtain information about listproc you send a one line e-mail message:- help to listproc@lacebark.ntu.edu.au To get information about the list, you send the one line info raci-books To get details of your settings, including a password, which you will probably not need, you send the one line set raci-books If you want to stop getting these messages you can unsubcribe by sending the one line unsubscribe raci-books Note that these messages are sent to "listproc", not "raci-books". You can also do all these things via a web page which is reached by a submit button on the web page mentioned above. If you have unsubscribed, you can resubscribe (actually this asks me to approve your subscribing). This web page can be used by your colleagues to request joining the list if I have not put them on it. The web page is seeking new reviewers. We also have quite a way to go before we have even all known reviewers on the list. All names are concealed. They are not accessible by asking recipients raci-books or "Who is on the list" from the web form. One difficulty is that if the e-mail address I entered on the subscribers list is an alias and not the actual address you use, you may not be able to post or get the information detailed above. Just let me know what your actual e-mail address is and I will fix it. Also e-mail me if you have any other problems. If you are reading this from thr hypermail-created web page and want to subscribe, please use the web interface indicated above. As I said we welcome new reviewers and we want to get all existing reviewers on the list.

H. Peyton Young and Amanda Wolf     This article looks at the role of equity in a global warmingor climate agreement.  We conclude that equity is a "complicated,nuanced business that cannot be reduced to simple recipes likegrandfathering present emissions or handing out equal numbers ofpermits to everyone.  Equity involves balancing variousconsiderations -- past responsibility, present practice, abilityto pay, and need....The proposals that have the greatest chance ofsuccess are those that strike a balance between competingclaims....In this sense, equity is not some utopian idea dreamedup by philosophers; it is the tool that practical negotiators useto forge consensus."  The paper is forthcoming in: The BrookingsReview, Spring 1992 (VOL 10, NO 2).     H. Peyton Young is professor of public policy at theUniversity of Maryland's School of Public Affairs.

High on its agenda willbe global warming, an issue almost unique in its combination ofportent and uncertainty.  By and large, most scientists areconvinced that if emissions of such "greenhouse gases" as carbondioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and chloroflourocarbons gounchecked, average global temperatures will rise several degreesCentigrade over the next fifty years and much more over a longerperiod.  But there is far less agreement about the local effectsof increasing temperatures -- changing rainfall patterns, incidenceand severity of storms, loss of species, and so forth.     Yet another complication is the political dimension of globalwarming.  Sovereign countries, nominative equals at the negotiatingtable, do not perceive themselves as being equally responsible forcontributing to the potential problems or equally able to adapt toclimate-related damages.  The developing world understandablyblames the build-up of greenhouse gases on the developed countries,who have been spewing industrial effluents into the atmosphere forwell over a century.  The industrialized countries, in turn, blamesome of the poor nations for pursuing unsustainable developmentpolicies, such as converting rainforest to low-yielding croplandand allowing unchecked population growth, that have dangerousimplications for the ecosystem.     In spite of scientific uncertainties and politicalcomplexities, the possibility of catastrophic dislocations -- fromstorms, droughts, and rising sea levels -- is a powerful motive totake collective action.  If change were to occur gradually, wecould probably adapt without enormous costs.  But change may notbe gradual.  It is possible, for example, that at some point afurther increase in temperature will cause the permafrost innorthern latitudes to thaw.  This would release a large quantityof methane (a potent greenhouse gas) which could trigger suddentemperature increases severe enough to melt vast areas of polarice.  The cost of such a catastrophe would be so large that itclearly makes sense to try to forestall it.     An agreement to stabilize global climate amounts to taking outan insurance policy against environmental risk.  Insurance will becostly, but exactly how costly is difficult to estimate.  Like mostinsurance policies, present costs may outweigh the expected savingsin a narrow cost-benefit framework.  But insurance still makessense because most people prefer to reduce risk.     Thus, at the center of the global warming negotiations areissues of sharing the costs and responsibilities for reducing risk.Here the terms are not directly those of science or economics, butthose of equity and the fairness of a cost-sharing plan.     Ministers to the 1990 World Climate Conference sponsored bythe United Nations in Geneva acknowledged in their final communiquethe centrality of equity in climate negotiations:  "The principleof equity and the common but differentiated responsibility ofcountries should be the basis of any global response to climatechange."  The success or failure of global warming negotiations mayvery well hinge on the delegates' ability to give satisfactoryexpression to this elusive concept.What to Do about Global Warming     Naturally occurring greenhouse gases reduce the amount of heatthat escapes from the atmosphere.  Since 1850, rising worldpopulation and industrialization have greatly increased the rateat which these gases are emitted.  Over half the warming comes fromcarbon dioxide, which is produced mainly by burning fuels inautomobiles and factories and clearing and burning wood.  Methanecomes from rice paddy residues and other agricultural sources.Chloroflourocarbons are used in the manufacture of refrigerants,foams, and aerosol propellants.  For simplicity, greenhouse gascontributions are often aggregated by country and expressed incarbon dioxide-equivalent terms.     There are three broad types of policy responses to the globalwarming problem.  One is to moderate warming by restrictinggreenhouse gas emissions.  The second is to offset emissions byincreasing the earth's capacity to absorb them.  And the third isto adapt to a changed environment.  Almost all specific proposalswithin these broad approaches involve one or more of the followingpolicy instruments: taxing greenhouse gas emissions, imposing lumpsum assessments on countries according to their contribution to theproblem (or their ability to pay), and limiting emissions througha system of quotas or permits.Emissions Taxes     The usual argument for an emissions tax is that it creates theright economic incentives for producers of greenhouse gases.Producers, whether industrial or individual, will try to reduceemissions to avoid paying the tax until it is cheaper to pay thetax than to make further reductions.  If the tax rate for eachgreenhouse gas could be set equal to the social cost of additionalemissions, the costs of global warming would be internalized in thesystem of economic prices.  Greenhouse gases would be emitted inexactly the "right" amounts -- namely, the amounts at which thecost of further reductions outweighs the anticipated benefits.That is the theory.  The trouble is that it is difficult, given theeconomic and scientific uncertainties, to determine the correct taxrate.     Leaving aside that difficulty, would an emissions tax beequitable?  Implicit in an emissions tax is the assumption thatpeople are entitled to a certain level of well-being -- in thiscase, the one they enjoy in the current climate.  According to thewell-known legal principle of just compensation, people have aright to be free from a "nuisance" created by someone else, or tobe duly compensated for suffering it.  Thus, those who degrade theclimate should pay the social costs associated with their actions.The tax is therefore justified provided that the compensations areappropriate (and actually carried out).  As a practical matter,however, it is virtually impossible to determine how muchindividuals are harmed and how much compensation is due.  So, inpractice, emissions taxes are not very attractive from thestandpoint of equity or of efficiency.Assessments     The premise of the emissions tax is that individuals are"entitled" to the status quo -- in this case, a stable environment.But why should the same right not be granted, instead, toproducers, who have been innocently and legally going about theirbusiness?  If a community wishes to reduce the risk of atmosphericchanges caused by greenhouse gas emissions, should it notcompensate producers for cutting back on their production?Producers should be willing to cut back if they were paid enoughto cover the costs of reduction, and the community should bewilling to be assessed an amount up to the expected damages.     How would the costs of reduction be distributed under such anassessments scheme?  Imagine that the sole source of global warmingis carbon dioxide and that the full costs of reductions are borneby individuals.  In theory, each individual has a tradeoff ratebetween money spent on personal consumption and money spent onensuring a stable environment.  In economic terms, the totalpayment should be such that the social benefit from any furtherreductions is just outweighed by the cost.  At this overall levelof carbon dioxide, all individuals would contribute an amount thatleaves them indifferent between spending one more dollar onreducing carbon dioxide and spending that dollar on privateconsumption or other public goods.     One obstacle to the realization of the assessments approachis the free-rider problem.  The contribution of each person towardreducing greenhouse gases depends on his or her willingness to pay,that is, the tradeoff rate between spending on greenhouse gasreduction and other purposes.  If someone says he is not willingto pay, then he will not be charged.  The free-rider problem alsoapplies to nations: if a country announces a low willingness topay, its citizens will continue to enjoy the reductions being paidfor by everyone else.  Of course, a country facing the prospect ofsevere damage (such as Bangladesh, if sea levels rise) might valuereductions highly but be unable to pay.  The way around the problemis to share costs not according to stated willingness to pay, butaccording to some visible proxy, such as economic output -- thatis, ability to pay.     In the case of global warming, for example, the industrializedcountries might agree to be assessed in proportion to their grossdomestic product.  The funds collected could then be used tocompensate certain producers for cutting back on emissions, as wellas to invest in projects (such as reforestation) that offset globalwarming, to develop energy-conserving technologies, and so forth.Under such an arrangement, the United States would pay about 25percent of the total, while Denmark would pay 0.5 percent.  Thusfor every dollar that the United States contributed, the fund wouldspend $4 on mitigating global warming.  For every dollar thatDenmark contributed, the fund would spend $200.  Because of thismatching effect, it becomes more attractive for everyone tocontribute and the free-rider problem is moderated.     The obvious difficulty with such a scheme (as with therevenues from emissions taxes) is that it places large sums ofmoney in the hands of a bureaucratic agency, which would be chargedwith apportioning it among various activities.  In theory the fundsshould be allocated so that each additional dollar spent on, say,reforestation, has the same benefit as each dollar spent on energyconservation.  But such calculations are difficult to carry outadministratively.  Ultimately, assessments (like emissions taxes)suffer from the defect of trying to achieve a specific level ofemissions through a command system of prices and subsidies, whichis a notoriously difficult task to carry out efficiently.Permits and quotas     The third approach is more direct.  Countries would negotiateoverall target levels of various greenhouse gases and allocate themin the form of permits or quotas.  The question immediately arisesas to who gets how much and why.       Most discussions of greenhouse gas reductions assume thatnations are the claimants.  Admittedly, national governmentsnegotiate the treaties and carry out their terms.  But because itis individuals who will suffer from dislocations caused by globalwarming and who will benefit from a reduction in the risk,individuals must be the ultimate claimants.  Is each individualentitled to the same number of permits?  There are two answers tothis question, each one grounded in some conception of justice.     The "egalitarian" theory holds that everyone is eligible forexactly the same number of permits.  The 1987 Montreal OzoneProtocol, for example, allocated chloroflourocarbon emission quotasequally per capita among the industrialized countries, usingcurrent populations as the basis of the distribution.  A similaridea has recently been proposed to stabilize carbon emissions.     The second theory considers current emissions as a claimestablished by usage and custom.  This "grandfathering" approachis observed in many laws and regulations.  For example, when fishstocks first appeared in danger on the North Atlantic Georges Bankfishing grounds, the United States and Canada used the 200-mileExclusive Economic Zone agreement in the Law of the Sea Treaty torestrict new entrants, while established boats were allowed to fishat customary levels.  Such a policy favored traditional fishermenfrom New Bedford and Nova Scotia, at the expense of Japanese andTaiwanese factory-trawler operations.     If these measures had failed to stabilize fish yields on theBank, established claims would probably have been adjusted downwardby comparable amounts.  Similarly, if greenhouse gas emissions mustbe cut, it could be argued that all countries should sacrificeequally, relative to their status quo position, for the commongood.  This "equal sacrifice" doctrine can be variouslyinterpreted: each country's current rate of emissions might bereduced by an equal amount per capita, or by a fixed percentage percapita, or perhaps according to a progressive schedule, with thegreatest percentage cuts being imposed on those with the highestemissions rates.Who Gets How Much?     The practical implications of these two entitlement theoriesare radically different (see Table 1).  The industrializedcountries, with less that 25 percent of the population, areresponsible for roughly 60 percent of current carbon dioxideemissions and 70 percent of cumulative emissions.  If quotas weredistributed equally per capita, the industrialized countries wouldinitially hold only one-third of the rights that they need tocontinue business as usual.  (If past contributions were countedthen they would receive even less; they might even be in debt.)The less developed countries, by contrast, would hold nearly twiceas many entitlements per capita as they currently need.

Shares of CO2 emissions, population, and GNP for theindustrialized world, 1986.     Under an egalitarian distribution, the less developedcountries would be willing to sell the industrialized world a largeportion of their current entitlements, though not necessarily theirfuture ones.  The purchasers would, in theory, be willing to paya price as high as the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissionsat the source.  (There is always the possibility that populouscountries could form a cartel and use their permits to gaineconomic and political leverage.  The industrialized countrieswould then be faced with the unpleasant choice of accepting thedemands, making drastic cuts in production, or simply reneging onthe agreement.)     The sums of money involved would be enormous.  If theobjective were to cap emissions of carbon dioxide at currentlevels, permits might be worth $25 to $75 per ton, implying atransfer of up to $200 billion a year from the developed to thedeveloping world.  (Official OECD development assistance, bycontrast, amounts to about $50 billion.)  Practically speaking,industrialized countries are unlikely to go along with thissolution, even if it can be justified on grounds of equaltreatment.     Suppose instead that more weight were given to existingemissions patterns.  Emissions could be frozen as of some date forthe industrial countries, and the less developed nations would bepermitted to rise to the per capita level enjoyed by theindustrialized world.  But if this rule were followed, emissionswould increase enormously.  Even if population were not growing,total emissions would eventually triple under this policy.  Anincrease of this magnitude poses grave environmental and economicrisk.A Compromise Proposal     The practical conclusion is that adhering to the status quoallows too little flexibility for capping carbon dioxideproduction, while an egalitarian distribution takes too littleaccount of the hardships (and the political realities) that attendadjustment.  A possible compromise would be to shift, in a seriesof steps, from a status quo to an egalitarian regime.  A particularyear could be chosen as the baseline from which adjustments are tobe made.  The goal would be to keep total emissions of each typeof gas below some established ceiling.  A target rate of emissionsper capita could be set for each type of gas.  The entitlementswould then be allotted as follows.  Countries already above thetarget rate would have their entitlements reduced a specifiedpercentage per capita (or a specified amount per capita) over aseries of years.  Countries below the per capita target rate wouldbe allowed to rise to the target rate.  Emissions entitlementswould be allotted to each nation en bloc, with the internaldistribution of entitlements to be determined by the country's ownpolicies.  The end result would be an egalitarian regime, but thephased transition would rest on the idea that everyone shouldsacrifice equally in moving toward this regime, except for thosewho are already disadvantaged.     Table 2 gives an idea of how such a scheme would look if itwere put into effect now.  For ten years developing countries'carbon dioxide emissions would be allowed to grow at 4 percent(their current rate), while industrial countries' emissions wouldbe reduced enough to keep worldwide emissions at the base-yearlevel.  Industrial countries would have to reduce emissions 3.3percent annually for the first five years and 5 percent annuallyfor the next five.  Over the ten-year period, total industrialcountry emissions would decline 35 percent, while developingcountry emissions would rise 48 percent.  In per capita terms, theindustrial countries would cut back 40 percent and the developingcountries expand 21 percent.  On this trajectory, per capitaemissions would eventually equalize, with citizens of developedcountries emitting about half their current amount and citizens ofdeveloping countries about double.

Phased transition from the status quo to an egalitarianregime, CO2 emissions.     Should the number of emissions permits be adjusted aspopulations continue to grow?  The answer is no -- at least untilthe effects of greenhouse emissions on global climate becomeclearer.  Permits should be considered an inheritance.  The initialquotas would be fixed and divided among succeeding generations justlike other forms of property.  The larger the number ofdescendants, the smaller share, on average, for each to inherit.To do otherwise -- for example, to issue more permits as the numberof claimants grows -- would simply dilute the value of emissionsentitlements to everyone else.Implications for Global Warming Negotiations     Global warming negotiations are greatly complicated by theasymmetric positions of the industrialized and the developingworlds, both in their contribution to the problem and in theirability to do something about it.  What can be fruitfullynegotiated at this stage and how will equity arguments enter?     An agreement could be built up around several points.  Thefirst step would be to identify various patterns of emissions thatparticipating countries believe to carry an unacceptable level ofrisk.  From this one would formulate a set of overall ceilings onemissions that would apply over the next several decades.  Theseceilings could then be adjusted as better scientific informationbecomes available.  It should be openly acknowledged that theceilings may not represent the economically efficient level ofemissions.  We simply do not know enough to carry out the necessarycost-benefit analysis.  Even if we did, we would not automaticallyknow what decision to make, because the decision ultimately hangson the community's willingness to accept risk, and this is a matterof judgment.     The second step would be to identify the general means throughwhich the burden of adjustment would be allocated.  Of the threechoices -- taxes, country assessments, and quotas -- the first twoattempt to achieve a physical target through fiscal policy, whichis extremely difficult.  The amount of money raised in both caseswould be enormous -- several hundred billion dollars.  It isdoubtful that such sums could be spent wisely and effectively.That leaves quotas.  They achieve quantity goals directly withoutrequiring a central taxing authority, and they can be adjusted overtime.  Though it is complicated by competing theories of the properbasis for allocation, the compromise we have outlined between theegalitarian and the status quo positions could be appealing to bothdeveloped and developing countries.     Once the initial allocation is made, should trade in permitsbe allowed?  Although there are theoretical arguments in favor ofsuch a policy, it does not seem practical any time soon.  Onedifficulty is that the issuance of entitlements is necessarilytentative: if global warming turns out to be worse than expected,the permits may have to be taken away.  If it turns out to bemilder than expected, more permits could be issued.  In eithercase, these uncertainties effectively dilute the value of thepermits.  A second difficulty is that there is no way to enforcethe quotas.  Until everyone sees that emissions in excess of permitholdings will not be allowed, it makes little sense to pay anythingfor a permit.  In the international arena, monitoring and enforcingcompliance are far more difficult than they are in domestic policy.Building confidence in an enforcement mechanism will take time,perhaps decades.     Fortunately, tradable permits offer a suitable method fordistributing a country's emission quota within its own borders.The sulfur dioxide permit system in the 1990 U.S. Clear Air Actamendments provides a clear case in point.  Successful domesticexperience could shorten the time needed for effectiveinternational application.     There is yet a third problem with an international permitsmarket.  The argument for temporarily granting higher per capitaemissions rates to the industrialized countries is that anegalitarian distribution would work too great a hardship on them.If permits were freely tradable, however, then sales by these"heavy emitters" would suggest that they had been treated toogenerously and that the initial allocation was unfair.     The phased transition plan proposed above represents acompromise between a radical insistence on absolute equality anda conservative commitment to the status quo.  Yet it virtuallyignores the historical contributions of the industrialized worldto the present build-up of greenhouse gases.  How should these pastemissions be counted in distributing the present costs ofadjustment?  Estimating past emissions with any degree of accuracyis extremely difficult.  Furthermore, any attempt to pin down pastresponsibility must also factor in the benefits that resulted fromthe laissez-faire regime.  For example, oil-producing countrieshave surely benefitted over the past half-century from theunchecked emissions of carbon dioxide.  The accumulated benefits(and blame) are so widely diffused that the true extent of eachcountry's liability is probably impossible to estimate.  A bettersolution, for which there is precedent in the 1987 MontrealProtocol, would be for the industrialized countries to establisha joint fund that would invest in research and technology transferand provide financial aid to help the developing countries adjustto the new regime.     Even relatively modest levels of investment could havesubstantial benefits.  For example, the fund could support thedevelopment of improved global climate models, as well as basicresearch on chemical and biological processes related to globalwarming.  It might also award prizes for promising inventions anddiscoveries that could help remedy the global warming problem.  Ata more ambitious level, the fund could provide credits todeveloping countries that adopt various technologies expected toreduce greenhouse gas emissions.   A reasonable basis for sharingthe costs of such a fund would be a commonly accepted measure ofability to pay, such as gross domestic product, or the UnitedNations contributions scale.  By any such formula, the burden ofcosts would fall squarely on the developed countries.  Not onlywould this be widely regarded as fair, it could prove to be ofstrategic and symbolic value in generating an agreement.  Thedeveloped world would make a visible commitment, not only tocutting back on its own emissions, but also to helping thedeveloping countries deal with a problem that the industrializedcountries are largely responsible for setting in motion.The Role of Equity in an Agreement     Admittedly, the solution that we have proposed is not terriblytidy.  It relies on a mix of approaches: the status quo is takenas the legitimate starting point from which progress could be madetoward a more egalitarian distribution of resources.  Reaching itwill involve a combination of policy instruments -- initialrestrictions on emissions with voluntary compliance, followed laterby the evolution of a market in permits and stricter enforcementmechanisms, with financial help along the way provided to thedeveloping world by the developed one.     The objective, however, is not neat solutions, but equitableones.  Equity is a complicated, nuanced business that cannot bereduced to simple recipes like grandfathering present emissions orhanding out equal numbers of permits to everyone.  Equity involvesbalancing various considerations -- past responsibility, presentpractice, ability to pay, and need.  Delegates at climate changetalks -- those in process now, those in Rio in June, and thosebeyond -- must craft a solution that treats everyone fairly subjectto their disparate circumstances.     Naturally, the negotiators emphasize the justice of solutionsthat tilt in their favor.  But schemes that are too obviously self-serving have little power to persuade others.  The proposals thathave the greatest chance of success are those that strike a balancebetween competing claims.  As Judge Learned Hand once put it:"justice is the tolerable accommodation of the conflictinginterests of society."  In this sense, equity is not some utopianideal dreamed up by philosophers; it is the tool that practicalnegotiators use to forge consensus.     Unless the delegates can accommodate the diverse positions ofthe developed and developing world within a framework perceived tobe fair, the talks will degenerate into a mere contest of willsthat comes to naught.  Given the prospect -- even the improbableprospect -- of calamitous changes in climate, the stakes are toohigh to risk a failure of this magnitude.WT03-B19-370IA005-000053-B046-193http://lacebark.ntu.edu.au:80/j_mitroy/sid101/ipcc/pg2.html 138.80.61.12 19970221172103 text/html 4160HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 21 Feb 1997 16:51:10 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3989Last-modified: Tue, 09 Jul 1996 02:25:59 GMT Chemical & Engineering News Chemical & Engineering News, November 27, 1995 Copyright © 1995 by the American Chemical Society. Higher temperatures in Antarctica have led to disintegration of some iceshelves One of the important unknowns in global warming science is how theAntarctic ice sheet, which covers a land area as large as the continentalU.S. and Mexico combined, would respond to a much warmer world. This icecap, with an average thickness of 2,500 meters, would raise the sea level by74 meters if it were to melt completely. To Enlarge Image To Enlarge Image Antarctica drew notice this year when National Oceanic & AtmosphericAdministration satellite images captured part of the pack ice disintegratingon the Antarctic Peninsula (which extends outward toward the southern tip ofSouth America). Between Jan. 14 and Feb. 27, an ice shelf that formerlyblocked the Prince Gustav Channel between James Ross Island and the peninsulabroke up. During the same period, the northern section of the Larsen Ice Shelf alsodisintegrated, leaving a plume of debris extending 200 km east. In addition,a Rhode Island-sized chunk of ice broke off the Larsen Ice Shelf farthersouth. This iceberg, although large, was a fairly small component of whathas happened overall recently in Antarctica, says David G. Vaughan,glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England. Other iceshelves around the Antarctic Peninsula are also in retreat. Over the whole of Antarctica, temperatures have increased an average ofabout 1 °C in 50 years, Vaughan says. But on the Antarctic Peninsula,temperatures have risen an average 2.5 °C since record keeping beganthere in the 1950s. This change could be a local manifestation of globalwarming, Vaughan says, or "it's possible it has nothing to do with globalwarming." In any event, these warmer temperatures have probably caused thedisintegration of the ice shelves around the peninsula, he explains. Scientists would also like to know whether the entire Antarctic ice sheetmelted during the Pliocene Epoch, 3 million to 4 million years ago, whenglobal temperatures were higher than they are today. Determining the degreeof melting that occurred then would give some indication about how much ofthe Antarctic ice sheet would melt if global warming proceeds unabated,because without curbs on greenhouse gas emissions global warming is expectedto eventually produce a Pliocene-like climate. However, scientists don't even know whether the Antarctic ice sheet isgetting thicker or thinner overall, Vaughan says. "We're completely in thedark. We really have no idea what goes into the ice sheet or what comesout." It is not known how much snow falls, what remains, what sublimes, whatis blown away, or how much ice is lost through calving of icebergs from theice shelves. It is known that a lot of ice is lost from the undersides ofthe ice shelves (which extend over seawater), but that is not being wellmeasured yet, nor are the smaller icebergs leaving the ice shelves beingcounted in a comprehensive way. However, satellite altimetry data now beingcollected should indicate whether the ice sheet is getting thicker orthinner, Vaughan says.

Climate Observations Substantiate Global Warming Models Bette Hileman, C&EN Washington Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and receding alpine glaciers support projected global temperature increase Many people believe that a great deal of controversy surrounds the scienceof global warming. In reality, however, scientists in the field do agree onmany aspects of global warming. For example, on the basis of a variety ofevidence a consensus is emerging among researchers that human beings,primarily through their burning of fossil fuels, are already perturbingEarth's climate - defined as weather averaged across years and large regions. This consensus, and the evidence that supports it, are documented in theUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) latestreport on the science of global warming. The 2,000-plus page report, writtenby about 500 scientists and reviewed by about 500 other experts, will bereleased next month. IPCC was established in 1988 under the auspices of theUN Convention on Climate Change to review the science of global warming andto advise some 70 countries on ways to mitigate and prevent it. IPCC issuesa major report every five years. The report will be available at the Officeof the U.S. Global Change Research Program, Washington, D.C. Global mean temperature hasbeen on the rise since 1880 Climate experts agree that the average global air temperature has risen0.3 to 0.6 Celcius over the past century. This finding is substantiated byother indicators - accelerated melting of alpine glaciers, a sea-level riseof 10 to 25 cm over the past 100 years, and coral bleaching caused byanomalously high sea-surface temperatures - that are all consistent with theincrease in global air temperatures. And according to present indications,the average global temperature in 1995 is likely to be as high as or higherthan in any year since record keeping began around 1860. These experts identify a number of other changes that have occurred inglobal and U.S. climate, some or all of which can be attributed to globalwarming. Nighttime temperatures have generally increased more than daytimetemperatures. Climatic variability, or the frequency of extreme events, hasincreased in some regions, although it is not known whether these have risenon a worldwide scale. For example, heavy rainfall events in the U.S. haveincreased in intensity, and behavior of El Nio - the warming of theeastern equatorial Pacific that sometimes brings severe droughts to someregions and heavy rains to other regions around the world - has been unusualsince 1976. These occurrences fit well with complex mathematical models ofglobal climate change. Almost all specialists agree that without drastic steps to curb greenhousegas emissions, the average global temperature will increase 1 to 3.5 Celciusduring the next century because effective levels of carbon dioxide areexpected to double sometime between 2050 and 2100. This temperature rangeresults from varied economic and population projections as well as climatesensitivity to greenhouse gases. Even with a change of 1 Celcius, the global rate of warming would be greaterthan it has been at any time in the past 10,000 years. Only a few expertsexpect the atmosphere to warm less than 1 Celcius by 2100, and virtually noscientist who has studied the issue expects global temperatures to declineduring the next century. Moreover, the warming is predicted to continue,reaching much more elevated temperatures over the next several centuries,unless bold measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even a 1 Celcius change would be significant. During the so-called LittleIce Age, a period lasting from 1500 to 1850 that was marked by extensiveglacial advances in almost all alpine regions, the global temperature wasonly about 0.5 Celcius lower than it was in 1900. Temperatures before the advent of a global thermometer network aredetermined from a combination of ice core, ocean sediment, tree ring, fossil,and other geologic data. Ice cores drilled in Greenland and Antarctica andon some alpine glaciers give the most useful data. The annually depositedlayers in the ice cores contain bubbles of air trapped at the time the icewas formed, providing a mechanism to determine atmospheric carbon dioxideconcentrations. The layers in the ice cores also contain a record of theocean's temperature in the form of the ratio of isotopically "heavy" water(enriched in 18O) to "light" water in the ice. When the world'stemperature is higher, more heavy water is evaporated preferentially. Fromthe ocean temperature estimate, the air temperature for huge regions can beestimated. TO SIDEBAR: Higher temperatures in Antarctica haveled to disintegration of some ice shelves There is also a general consensus that higher temperatures projected forthe next century will cause more frequent and intense heat waves, wide-scaleecological disruptions, a decline of agricultural production in the tropicsand subtropics, and continued acceleration of sea-level rise. One broad area of agreement, as noted in the IPCC report, is that levelsof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane,nitrous oxide, ozone, and halocarbons, have grown significantly sincepreindustrial times. During this period, the CO2 level has risen30% to nearly 360 ppm, methane 145% to more than 1,700 ppb, and nitrous oxide15% to more than 300 ppb. Implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete theOzone Layer has led to a slowdown in the growth of the atmospheric level ofsome halocarbons. The level of chlorofluorocarbon-11 has plateaued and thatof methyl chloroform has declined. Ozone has increased in the troposphere ofthe Northern Hemisphere but has been somewhat depleted in the stratosphere,primarily in midlatitude and polar regions. The rates of buildup ofCO2 and methane slowed in the early 1990s, but now both areincreasing again. There is also broad agreement that stratospheric ozone depletion andaerosols - small particulates consisting of mainly sulfates from the burningof fossil fuels - act to cool Earth. However, aerosols are different thangreenhouse gases because they have very short lifetimes (mostly less than twoweeks) in the atmosphere, and rather than causing uniform global cooling,they affect primarily the subcontinental pattern of climate change. Becauseof their short lifetimes, they cannot build up in the atmosphere andtherefore, in the long run, cannot offset much of the warming from greenhousegases. The loss of ozone in the lower stratosphere has a net cooling effectbecause ozone absorbs incoming solar radiation. However, these cooling effects would be more than offset by theexpected doubling (over its preindustrial level) in the next century in thelevel of CO2 in the atmosphere. Because many of the greenhousegases remain in the atmosphere for a long time (CO2 and nitrousoxide persist from decades to centuries) their radiative forcing - theirtendency to warm Earth - persists for periods that are long compared withhuman life spans. Even if nations decide to stabilize the globalCO2 level at a relatively high 1,000 ppm, CO2 emissionseventually would have to be cut below 1990 levels because CO2'satmospheric lifetime is so long. The basic theory behind the greenhouse effect is well established.Natural greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily water vapor and carbondioxide, raise Earth's average temperature about 33 Celcius higher than itwould be if these gases were not present. These gases allow solar radiantenergy to pass through the atmosphere to be absorbed at Earth's surface, buttrap in the lower atmosphere much of the radiant heat emitted from thesurface back toward space. Since the greenhouse effect is a permanent partof the climate system, warming from higher than natural levels of greenhousegases should be called an "enhanced greenhouse effect." The current scientific debate surrounding global warming focuses on howsensitive Earth's climate is to an enhanced greenhouse effect and whether theresulting feedbacks will strengthen or diminish the warming from elevatedlevels of greenhouse gases. To determine how enhanced levels of greenhouse gases affect Earth'sclimate, modeling researchers employ three-dimensional numerical models thatcalculate global temperature and precipitation at specified levels ofCO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The families ofthe more complex models are atmospheric general circulation models andatmospheric general circulation models coupled to ocean general circulationmodels of comparable complexity. The atmospheric models were developed from those used for weatherforecasting. "It's a fairly well-developed science," says Jerry D. Mahlman,director of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J. "The models use thesame mathematics that drive today's numerical weather and hurricaneprediction models." Malhman: quantitative predictions difficult Hansen: models closely match real world Conceptually, the atmospheric models divide Earth's surface intorectangles or grid points roughly 500 km on a side, within which cells arestacked about 20 layers deep. The flow of atmospheric gases from each ofthese cells into adjacent cells is calculated. Equations governing the transfer of electromagnetic radiation through aheterogeneous gaseous medium then relate incoming solar radiation withchanges in the content of each cell and the amount of radiation reachingEarth's surface. The exchange of radiative energy and water between theatmosphere and various surfaces - such as snow, ice, oceans, clouds, andvegetation - is included, as is a simple representation of the upper ocean.Supercomputers are used to solve the equations that estimate wind patterns,temperature, sunlight, relative humidity, and precipitation for each gridpoint on the globe. Over the past five years or so, several atmospheric general circulationmodels have been coupled to an ocean general circulation model. The oceanmodel represents various layers of the ocean to its full depth andcirculation among and between those layers. When cold high-density salinewater sinks to the ocean depths in polar regions, the ocean acts to slow downthe rate of warming in the atmosphere by storing heat contained in saltysurface water that moves from the tropics to sink in polar regions.Consequently, a coupled ocean-atmosphere model is able to simulate the lagin greenhouse warming caused by deep-ocean circulation. Mahlman says that despite the criticisms leveled at the models, they workwell in many respects. "They capture a lot of the fundamental physics of howthe atmosphere works, how the daily temperature range works, how the seasonalvariations from summer to winter work, how ice-age climates work, and hownatural variability works," he says. The models simulate the large-scale features of the current climatereasonably well, and they have accurately reproduced some climate features ofthe distant past. They also predicted very well the amount of cooling thatresulted from the Mount Pinatubo eruption in mid-1991. The sulfates andother aerosols from Pinatubo, a volcano in the Philippines, cooled theclimate noticeably in 1992 and 1993 almost exactly as predicted in the modelrun by James E. Hansen, director of the National Aeronautics & SpaceAdministration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York City. When the models account for the cooling from aerosols, they also reproducefairly accurately the global warming that has taken place over the pastcentury. Even more important, Hansen says, when aerosols are included thegeographic pattern of temperature changes more closely matches the changes inthe real world. These tests of the models have given climatologists moreconfidence in their results. The models all project that climate change, once begun, will continue forhundreds of years. Taken together, they indicate that temperatures will rise1 to 3.5 Celcius by 2100, with an associated sea-level rise of 15 to 95 cm.The current temperature projections for 2100 are somewhat lower than thosein the 1990 IPCC report, primarily because the models now account for thecooling effect of sulfates and other aerosols. The models indicate thatwarming in general will be greater over land than over the oceans and thatthe maximum warming will occur in high northern latitudes in winter. But inthe high-latitude Southern Ocean (Antarctic Ocean) and the northern NorthAtlantic, there will be little warming, perhaps even a cooling due to theeffect of changes in ocean circulation. Furthermore, most models project that with global warming, the increase inmean surface temperatures will be more pronounced during the cold season;that precipitation at mid to high latitudes will increase, especially duringthe cold season; that droughts will be more severe and longer lasting,particularly during the warm season; that nighttime temperatures willincrease more than daytime temperatures during the warm season; that agreater portion of warm season precipitation will come in heavy showers orthunderstorms rather than in gentler, longer lasting rainfalls; and that theday-to-day variability of temperatures will decline for mid to highlatitudes. These are changes that are now being observed, if not globally,at least in many regions. But after many decades, Hansen says, "models show that daytime warmingwill be almost as great as nighttime warming." Thomas R. Karl, senior scientist at NOAA's National Climatic Data Centerin Asheville, N.C., has analyzed weather data for the U.S. (excluding Alaskaand Hawaii) over this century to see if the observed changes are consistentwith what models predict for global greenhouse warming. Karl created what hecalls a greenhouse climate response index (GCRI), which is a measure of howwell climate data fit what models indicate for global warming. GCRI is thearithmetic average of four indicators: the percent of the U.S. with muchabove normal minimum temperatures, the percent of the U.S. with much abovenormal precipitation during the cold season, the percent of the U.S. inextreme drought in the warm season, and the percent of the U.S. with a muchgreater than normal proportion of precipitation derived from extreme one-dayevents. Karl found that since 1976, GCRI values have been higher than the averageGCRI for previous years in the century, meaning that "the late-centurychanges in the U.S. climate are consistent with the general trendsanticipated from a greenhouse-enhanced atmosphere." "There is only a 5 to 10% chance that the increase in GCRI results fromnatural variability," he says, which means there is a 90 to 95% chance thatthe U.S. climate is already being affected by enhanced levels of greenhousegases. Although the country's contiguous states cover only 2% of the globe, thechanges in this region are similar to what has happened in many othercountries in the Northern Hemisphere, Karl says. Scientists are nowcalculating precise GCRI indexes for these countries. One of the more important uncertainties in climate modeling is how thecloud system reacts in response to increases in the levels of greenhousegases. In general, high clouds act as a greenhouse and warm the climate,while low clouds, by reflecting sunlight back to space, tend to cool thesystem. Overall, clouds averaged together globally now have a net coolingeffect of - 15 watts per square meter, says Jeffrey T. Kiehl, seniorscientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colo.With enhanced greenhouse gases, clouds could change in such a way that theycool Earth more than they do today - in other words, greenhouse warming couldresult in more low-level clouds - or they could change so they cool Earthless. Another drawback of the current climate models is their inability toproject climate for small regional areas. This is partly because theyprovide average readings for large areas of Earth's surface. Finerresolution would require much more computer power. But when it becomespossible to obtain finer resolution, it will become necessary to incorporateinto the models much more information about land cover, land use changes, andvegetation. "When you get to smaller scales, the uncertainties in landsurface processes and their physics and biology start to come back to hauntyou," Mahlman says. A boulder at the western margin of the Quelccaya IceCap in the tropical Andes or Peru in 1978. The same boulder in 1995 - the extensive retreat ofthe ice cap in that area has been caused by regional warming. If the currentwarming trend persists, the ice cap could be in danger of being lost. In the long run, to gain more certainty in global climate predictions,much more needs to be known about how global warming will affect thebiosphere, especially terrestrial carbon storage. In general, warming isexpected to increase carbon storage in areas where moisture and nutrients aresufficient. In those areas, trees will grow faster. But over decades tocenturies, climate change will also alter the global distribution ofecosystems. For example, forests would spread into tundra and could increasethe warming and the carbon storage there. But trees could die rapidly inother areas that are subject to drought, and their deaths could introduce alarge pulse of carbon into the atmosphere. There has been a lot of speculation recently about whether more frequenthurricanes and more intense and longer lasting El Nios are related toglobal warming. "Until our models become a little more certain, it'sdifficult to conjecture whether hurricanes would increase or decrease withglobal warming," Karl says. "On a theoretical basis, there has been somework suggesting stronger hurricanes," he adds. A warmer sea surface is theprimary feature of global warming that might cause more significanthurricanes, he explains, but ocean circulation changes may counter theeffects of this added warmth. Since 1976, El Nios have been stronger, more frequent, and morepersistent than they were earlier in the century. "Some of the modelssuggest that stronger, more frequent El Nios would be a tendency in awarmer world," Karl says. But there is no consensus in the scientificcommunity about how these would change. Scientists are doing a lot ofresearch to see if they can establish a cause-effect relationship betweenglobal warming and the change in the pattern of El Nios. In the western Caribbean off the coast of Belize, the Cook Islands, and inthe Philippines, massive coral bleaching has been observed since 1983. Coralreef bleaching results from the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae algaefrom the coral reefs. The algae provide reefs with most of their color,carbon, and ability to deposit limestone. Raymond L. Hayes, professor of anatomy at Howard University, Washington,D.C., has investigated coral bleaching and found that it occurs when theocean temperature exceeds 30 Celcius for more than two weeks as shown by NOAAsatellites. This is only about 1 Celcius higher than the normal maximum of 28to 29 Celcius. Once bleached, coral does not receive adequate nutrients oroxygen, Hayes says. If water temperatures return to normal the followingyear, coral reefs may recover, but if the thermal stress is repeated yearafter year, the reefs may die. "I consider coral bleaching on tropical coral reefs as an early warning ofdetrimental changes attributed to global climate change," Hayes says. ElNio events could be the cause of some coral bleaching, he explains,but if Earth continues to warm from greenhouse gases, much more bleaching canbe expected. To enlarge image. Carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 1,000 years determined from icecore records (shown as symbols) appear to have fluctuated little until 1850.Since 1958, air measurements (shown as purple line) taken at Mauna Loa,Hawaii, have supplemented the ice core data. The smooth black curve is basedona 100-year running mean. The inset of the period from 1850 onward showsCO2 emissions in gigatons (billions of metric tons) per year attributed toburning fossil fuels (shown as a blue line). Another graphic indicator of a warmer globe is the accelerated retreat ofalpine glaciers. "In the tropics, every glacier that we have any data on isretreating," says Lonnie G. Thompson, professor of geological sciences atOhio State University, Columbus. "And where we have time-lapse data, therate of retreat is accelerating." In Venezuela, three glaciers havecompletely disappeared since 1972. In the temperate zones, the majority ofglaciers are retreating, even as a few do continue the traditional cyclicpattern of advance and retreat. Peru is particularly concerned about the accelerating melting of glaciersin the Cordera Blanca region of the Andes, Thompson says. The glaciers thereprovide irrigation water to the coastal desert and provide water for riversthat are dammed for hydroelectric power. Loss of glaciers would harm bothpower production and agriculture for the country. It used to be thought that as climate changed in the past - when Earthcame out of ice ages, for example - it happened very slowly. But over thepast decade, and especially during the past five years, evidence has beenaccumulating that climate sometimes has made sudden jumps as regionaltemperatures shifted 5 to 10 Celcius over less than two decades. Measurementsof oxygen isotopes and dust in Greenland ice cores and studies of glaciers inthe Chilean Andes and in New Zealand's Alps show that some of these suddentemperature shifts were felt globally. Wallace S. Broecker, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty GeologicalObservatory at Columbia University, believes the sudden shifts were caused bychanges in the ocean circulation, primarily in the North Atlantic. Hespeculates that the engine for these leaps was an abrupt change in deep-oceancirculation - what he calls the ocean's great conveyor system - which isgoverned by the temperature and salt content of the water. This deep-currentsystem moves 20 times more water than all the world's rivers combined. Forexample, in the Atlantic, warm salty upper waters flow northward reaching thevicinity of Greenland, where the Arctic air cools them and they sink to theocean depths. Broecker hypothesizes that as Earth was coming out of the last glacialperiod, water from the fast-melting Laurentide ice sheet that coverednorthern North America came down the St. Lawrence River into the NorthAtlantic. This water shut down deep-water convection in the ocean waterbetween Norway and Iceland that takes saline water at the surface to thedepths as it cools. Heat energy carried by the Gulf Stream is the majorreason northern Europe is warm compared with other regions at the samelatitude. So a shutdown in this circulation would plunge Europe into suddencold and London would have a climate like Siberia. "Even though a shutdownof the Gulf Stream is a low-probability event," Broecker says, "itsconsequences would be so massive that it is something we should think about." There is some evidence that this North Atlantic circulation has begun toslow. Compared with the 1970s, the salinity of the Norwegian Sea hasdecreased and deep-water production there has virtually ceased. However,because there are no records of the extent of deep-water production before1970, there is no way to tell whether this slowdown is part of a naturalvariation in the climate or whether it is caused by greenhouse warming. There is a broad perception that the science of global warming is muchless certain than the science of stratospheric ozone depletion. However,Mahlman, who has done research in both areas, says the level of uncertaintysurrounding the ozone problem is not much different than it is for globalwarming. What distinguishes the two problems is the number of responsible entities."For ozone depletion, you can blame about 12 companies, more or less,"Mahlman says, "but for global warming you can blame about 5 billion people."Consequently, because it is much more difficult to do something about globalwarming, "people demand more certainty than they required of the science ofozone depletion." More research is needed but is unlikely to be funded, at least by the U.S.In fiscal 1995, federal agencies spent a total $1.8 billion on global changeresearch. A somewhat larger amount was requested for 1996, but Congress hasproposed substantial cuts in the programs of some agencies. For example, theHouse passed a 25% cut in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a major part of itsresearch effort. For NOAA climate and air quality research, the House passeda 41% cut in the request, and the Senate proposed a 33% cut. At press time,it was still not clear how large the final reductions would be because someof the appropriations bills were still in conference and were still subjectto a presidential veto. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency,whose research has focused on the effects of global change, has decided todrastically reduce its participation in the U.S. Global Change ResearchProgram. In a recent talk, John H. Gibbons, director of the White House Office ofScience & Technology Policy, quoted the British novelist and historian C.P. Snow: "A sense of the future is behind all good politics. Unless wehave it, we can give nothing - either wise or decent - to the world."Gibbons went on to say that "increasing our understanding of the climatesystem and the impact of human activities is a necessary part of thisendeavor to gain a sense of the future." Without research, mankind will notunderstand the impact of its activities or how to stop its "uncontrolledglobal experiment" - elevating the levels of greenhouse gases in theatmosphere.

The deteriorating health of our forests can be attributed several causes, among which air pollution is very important. The most discussed theories claim that the main cause of forest damage is both the impact of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), both of which contribute directly and indirectly; indirectly by affecting the soil, or for NOx, also by contributing to the formation of damaging ozone in the forest air. Transboundary pollution, especially SO2 and NOx, is considered to be the major cause of damage to life in thousands of lakes and water courses. Scandinavian soils has a limited ability to neutralize acid rain due to their thin topsoil layers and lime-deficient bedrock. Runoff from acidified soils contain high concentration of aluminium ion which can be toxic to fish and other organisms. The mercury content also increases in runoff from acidified soils, and this can accumulate in fish and in the next steps in fish consumers.

Climate models can offer useful scenarios of climate change at the global level, but they are still unable to make reliable and credible regional and national forecasts. Nevertheless, researchers can determine the likely effects of global warming on a particular country by considering its sensitivity to current climatic extremes, variations, and trends. Like other developing countries, Vietnam is heavily dependent on natural resources, and any change in the prevailing environmental conditions is likely to have serious consequences. If economic development plans are to prove sustainable over many years, policy-makers must take the potential impacts of long-term climate change and sea-level rise into account. Population pressures make Vietnam highly vulnerable to global warming. With a current population of around 64 million that is likely to expand to around 80 million by the year 2000, Vietnam is already densely populated. The country�s long, narrow shape has been likened to a length of bamboo with a basket of rice carried at each end - an apt image for an agricultural nation whose two main population and farming centres are connected by a narrow, mountainous central region that is unsuitable for intensive farming. The northern Red River Delta and the southern Mekong Delta regions will come under increasing pressure if climate change has its predicted effects. Sea-level rise would pose a serious threat to Vietnam�s extensive coastline. The sea level along parts of Vietnam�s coastline of over 3,000 kilometres has already risen by around five centimetres over the past 30 years. With more than half of Vietnam�s people living in the low-lying delta regions, any further rise would seriously threaten the nation�s farming, fishing, transport, and industrial activities. Many of the rich natural resources and ecosystems on the coast would also be threatened. In particular, the destruction of mangrove forests, which afford natural protection to low-lying areas, would exacerbate the consequences of sea-level rise. Climate change could lead to an increase in weather extremes throughout the country. Vietnam has a tropical, monsoon-influenced climate with marked variations in temperature and rainfall. With its long, narrow land mass stretching from north to south, Vietnam�s various regions have mean annual temperatures ranging from 13 C to 28 C. The strongest variations in temperature and rainfall occur in the northern plains of the Red River Delta and in the coastal areas of central Vietnam. These areas are already vulnerable to weather-related disasters such as typhoons, flooding, and cold spells. Drought too can be a problem, particularly in the south. All of these weather variables could change, particularly if, as computerized climate models suggest, global warming affects the strength and location of monsoons. If the monsoons shift northward, for example, the rainfall in northern Vietnam would increase. In the south, meanwhile, water availability would probably decline as warmer temperatures encourage evaporation losses. Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector of the economy. Around 80% of Vietnam�s population is rural. Rice is the main food crop and contributes significantly to the national economy, particularly since increased production in recent years has turned Vietnam into one of the world�s major rice exporters. The nation�s fertile agricultural lands, located in river basins and dependent on irrigation, are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in water levels. The Cuu Long Delta in the south already experiences frequent droughts and, every seven years or so, severe flooding. The flow of the great rivers that bring water to Vietnam�s farmlands would be affected by changes in temperature and rainfall, as well as by measures taken by neighbouring nations in response to water shortages. This could result in lower crop yields and growth rates, the weakening or extinction of particular crop species, increased activity by pests and viruses, and a loss of soil fertility. As the sea-level rises, the intrusion of saline water into fresh-water aquifers would affect the availability and quality of water resources vital for irrigation and human consumption. All of these impacts would further stress Vietnam�s already limited area of intensively farmed agricultural land. A National Climate Action Plan has been established by the Hydrometeorological Service at the request of the Vietnamese government. The Action Plan aims to balance development needs with environmental protection. Its priorities include strengthening the collection of data on climate, weather, and hydrology; assessing greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for reducing them; and raising awareness of the causes and likely impacts of climate change. These activities would promote the formulation of policies for improving Vietnam�s ability to withstand the likely impacts of climate change and to reduce its own emissions of greenhouse gases. Vietnam�s greenhouse gas emissions are low by world standards but they are likely to rise. The country�s major source of emissions is deforestation and other changes in land use which, according to one estimate, produced some 60 million tonnes of carbon a year during the late 1980s. This was ten times more than the quantity released by its burning of fossil fuels. Massive deforestation resulted from the doubling of the population from the 1940s to the 1980s as well as from the ravages of war. In response, the government has initiated a National Conservation Strategy for limiting population growth, encouraging agro-forestry and reforestation, and establishing more nature reserves. But while greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation are likely to start declining, economic growth and industrialization will increase emissions from energy use, perhaps by a factor of three by the year 2010.

In general, the most destructive climate-related event is drought. For example, droughts associated with the major 1982-84 El Ni�o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) anomaly cut Australia's wheat harvest in half, caused distress to some 14 million people in Brazil's Northeast, and cost southern Africa almost US$1 billion. Too much rainfall, on the other hand, can also wreak havoc. It can wash out crops, make fields unworkable, and prevent access to remote areas. In addition, high humidity can encourage plant diseases and ruin stored food, frosts can harm young plants and fruit before they can be harvested, and strong winds and severe storms can damage standing crops and contribute to flooding. The risk of extreme weather varies over time and from region to region. Most agricultural systems can cope with a reasonable range of weather conditions, but destructive weather occurs in all climates. For example, a region with a rainy climate may face a small probability in any given year that rainfall will be less than the minimum required for a particular crop. The seasonal distribution of rainfall can be just as critical as the year-to-year variation: an extended dry spell when crops are flowering may be more detrimental than a drought just before the harvest. In much of the world, periods of drought or flood have been associated with large-scale fluctuations that occur every few years in the global circulation of the atmosphere, such as the El Ni�o/Southern Oscillation. In most of Africa, rainfall in the 1950s and 1960s was fairly plentiful and regular - but variability doubled in the 1970s and 1980s in some regions. By altering temperature and precipitation patterns, greenhouse gas-induced climate change may create new climate conditions that in many regions would currently be considered extreme. Climatic conditions often interact with socio-economic conditions to undermine food security. Climate variability tends to have the greatest impact on people who are landless, poor, or isolated. Changes in socio-economic conditions can lead to dramatic changes in food security. Disadvantageous terms of trade, poor infrastructure, and armed conflict also make it more difficult for people to cope with the effects of climatic extremes. For example, while food security would anyway have been a problem in Sudan during the severe drought of the 1980s and 1990s, economic recession and civil strife were major causes of the widespread famine. In China, on the other hand, land reform and economic growth during the same period substantially reduced food poverty. Some one billion people may be at risk of hunger, although estimates vary widely. The diagram below shows relative food security by country, based on such social indicators as per capita food production, per capita GNP, and child/infant mortality rates. Countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Mali, and Haiti are the least food-secure, in marked contrast to developed countries, the newly industrialising countries of Southeast Asia, and most of Latin America. Such chronic food insecurity can evolve into a food crisis or, if not controlled, a famine. In general, a 30% decrease in the production of a nation's staple food, or a drop in annual food supplies below 150 kg per capita, greatly increases the risk of famine, since internal redistribution can no longer solve the problem. The key cause of hardship is the persistence of a food shortage over a number of years. In North Kordofan, Sudan, for example, accumulated wealth declined by 80% during 1983-1985 and hardly recovered in the following three years. Increasingly, it seems that many of Africa's poor are unable to recover fully from one crisis before the next one is upon them. Effective policies can minimise the climate's impact on food security. Thanks to dramatic improvements in our ability to forecast and monitor extreme events and food security (particularly the risk of famine), the prospects for reliable and timely warnings are quite promising. But even the best forecasts of climate variability will still require effective "hazard management" policies. Key policies include maintaining the productivity of the land and other agricultural assets, diversifying income sources to prevent total dependence on one or two crops, setting aside strategic reserves in good years, and motivating farmers with good market prices and other production incentives. When such strategies fail, the next step is "crisis containment", including such measures as consuming assets needed for future production (female livestock for example). If disaster looms despite such efforts, people will be forced to cut back dramatically on eating, sell their possessions, and migrate. Unfortunately, disaster relief efforts in developing countries have not been encouraging. Civil strife, as in Somalia, or the sheer size of the imminent disaster, as in Bangladesh after its 1991 cyclone, too often render emergency services ineffective. Strategies for coping with climatic extremes may be relevant to future strategies for adapting to climate change. Ongoing efforts to deal with persistent climatic trends resulting from other factors besides greenhouse gas emissions (such as desertification caused by overgrazing) suggest a range of practical options. In fact, climate change researchers often use the current impacts of today's climate extremes as analogues of future possibilities.

The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization WMO) established the IPCC in 1988 with a three-fold mandate: To assess the state of existing scientific knowledge on climate change; to examine the environmental, economic, and social impacts of climate change; and to formulate response strategies. The IPCC set up three working groups and issued a highly influential First Assessment Report in 1990. Working Group I concentrated on science, Working Group II studied impacts, and Working Group III analysed possible response options. The Panel also established a special committee to explore how to promote the full participation of developing countries in its work. A trust fund was set up to cover the expenses of the Panel�s work and to enable developing countries to play a role. The IPCC held seven sessions between November 1988 and February 1992. The resulting First Assessment Report and the 1992 Supplement have been widely hailed as the most authoritative statements on climate change made by the scientific and expert community so far, and they served as an important basis for the climate treaty negotiations. The first, four-volume report includes an overview, policy-maker summaries by the three working groups and the special committee, plus the full reports of the three working groups. The Science Working Group confirmed the scientific basis for global warming. After bringing together virtually every scientist who has made a significant contribution in the field, the working group concluded with certainty that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing, and that if this trend continues it should lead to a warming of the earth�s surface. It issued a number of specific projections and indicated the degree of certainty it attributed to each one. For example, it stated that to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause over half of the man-made greenhouse effect, current emissions would have to be reduced by 60-80%. Under a "Business as Usual" scenario (i.e. no changes in current policies), the group forecast a 0.3 C-per-decade rise in global mean temperature and a six-centimetre-per-decade rise in the average sea level. It also indicated how different regions of the world could be affected by these developments. The Impacts Working Group concluded that climate change could have highly destabilizing effects on human society. The group analysed the impact global warming will have on agriculture, forestry, natural eco-systems, water resources, human settlements, oceans, coastal zones, and so on. It concluded that these impacts are likely to vary widely from region to region, and that rising populations, technological advances, and changes in natural events such as El Ni�o could influence regional impacts. The working group emphasized the need for further research on these issues, and remarked that more definitive impacts assessments would be made as more precise predictions of regional climate change become available. The Response Strategies Working Group proposed specific measures for limiting and adapting to global warming. Emphasizing the common but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries, the group outlined both short-term and long-term measures, the most important of which is to limit greenhouse gas emissions. It recognized that its proposed policy measures could only be successfully achieved through international cooperation. Four subgroups were set up to address each of the following issues: Energy and industry; agriculture, forestry, and other human activities; coastal zone management; and resource use and management. The reports of these subgroups were included in the final report of the Response Strategies Working Group. The Special Committee on the participation of developing countries emphasized the Third World's need for financial and technical assistance. The committee pointed out that, since about 75% of greenhouse gas emissions originate in industrialized countries, these countries must take the lead in adopting policy measures against climate change. For their part, developing countries lack the resources and information to respond to the threats posed by climate change. Nevertheless, developing countries could be even more affected than industrialized countries by climate change. For these reasons, the committee considered it important that the industrialized countries offer financial and technical assistance to developing countries. This would enable them to participate in the international treaty negotiations, to implement effective measures to reduce their own emissions of greenhouse gases, and to protect themselves against the impact of climate change. The IPCCitself organized a series of seminars in developing countries to promote these aims. In November 1992, the IPCC established a workplan for its continuing work and a new structure. While Working Group I still concentrates on science, Working group II is responsible for both impacts and response options, and Working group III focuses on economics. This restructuring will improve efficiency and enable the three reorganized working groups to help governments meet the challenges of Agenda 21 and the requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. One of these requirements is the development of a standard methodology for measuring each nation's sources and "sinks" of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In addition, IPCC will review methodologies for conducting country studies on climate change impacts and response options at the national, as opposed to the global, level. It will also focus on assessing research into drought, desertification, and water resources, and it will expand the scope of its activities to include theoretical and applied economics. Capacity building in developing countries will be an integral part of the work of all three working groups. The new work plan calls for IPCC to produce its next major assessment report in late 1995. It also commits IPCC to provide certain information needed to support the implementation of the Convention in time for the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which is likely to occur in early 1995.

The climate change debate as it takes place through the media and other public fora is not always based on sound science. Statements and opinions can be freely expressed and quoted, but they do not necessarily undergo rigorous scrutiny. The IPCC's reports, on the other hand, are subjected to triple scrutiny. First, most of the research that is assessed has already been published in peer-reviewed scientific and technical journals. Second, the resulting draft assessment report itself is peer-reviewed by a large and diverse group of experts. Finally, the report is reviewed by governments. This painstaking process ensures that IPCC's reports are objective, transparent, and based on the best information available world-wide. The forthcoming Second Assessment Report will review and summarise the current state of knowledge about climate change. The Report will be published in late 1995 and will update the influential 1990 First Assessment Report and its 1992 Supplement report. Some of the issues that will receive particular attention are 1) the effects of sulphates from power plants and other anthropogenic aerosols; 2) the problem of calculating global warming potentials (GWPs) due to uncertainty about how long carbon dioxide emissions stay in the atmosphere; 3) how to improve predictions of climate change at the regional level; 4) water resources, desertification, and drought; 5) impacts (such as sea-level rise) and response options (particularly with regard to energy, human activities, and economics); and 6) methodologies for studying impacts and making inventories of (listing and quantifying) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks. The IPCC network of experts is being continually expanded and reinforced. The IPCC is an intergovernmental scientific and technical body consisting of a very small secretariat and a world-wide network of 2,500 scientists and experts who are leaders in their fields. These experts are nominated by Governments or inter-governmental or non-governmental organisations. The IPCC is organised into three working groups: Working Group I assesses climate change science, Working II examines impacts and response options, and Working Group III addresses economics. As was the case with the First Assessment Report, the lead authors, contributors, and expert reviewers for the Second Assessment Report are all drawn from this unique and growing network. A team of lead authors and contributors is assembled for each chapter. Governments and organisations submit lists of experts for consideration by the appropriate Working Group or Subgroup. Three to five lead authors are then chosen for each of the 50 or so chapters. Every team must represent a range of viewpoints and include at least one expert from a developing country. The authors write a first draft based mostly on peer-reviewed papers from academic and technical journals. They also consider the most recent scientific findings and reports from expert organisations within the UN system, carefully weighing any lack of previous peer review. Diverging viewpoints that are scientifically sound are clearly identified in the draft text. The authors work together closely as a team, which has the additional benefit of building capacity in developing countries. The teams also rely on "contributors" who, based on the published literature, prepare technical information in the form of text, graphs, or data for assimilation by the lead authors. Thousands of experts review the first drafts. The first drafts of each chapter are circulated to expert reviewers and specialists with significant publications in the field. Non-governmental organisations and international organisations with relevant expertise are also invited to review the drafts. The reviewers comment on the completeness and objectivity of the scientific and technical content. References within the draft are carefully checked. When time permits, the review comments are incorporated into a second draft which is sent back to the reviewers. Based on all the draft chapters assigned to a particular Working Group, the lead writers and the Working Group's bureau (executive board) also write an Executive Summary plus a non-technical Summary for Policy-makers. These summaries are reviewed as well. Governments review the expert-approved chapters and the summaries. They may organise their own groups of experts to carry out this review. The Government-level review is essential because it promotes and demonstrates a broad, international acceptance of the technical conclusions. As of mid-1993, many more countries and organisations are involved in the earliest stage of the work cycle than was the case with the First Assessment Report. The expert- and Government-reviewed drafts go back to the appropriate Working Group for final approval and acceptance. Special meetings of the Working Groups are held to review the summaries line by line and grant "approval", which signifies that they are consistent with the full scientific and technical assessment. The chapters themselves are not approved line by line, but their general content is "accepted". Finally, the summaries of the three Working Groups are reviewed by the entire IPCC and formally accepted. A synthesis report highlighting the key points, including those that may be controversial, is drafted by the IPCC chairman and approved line by line by the entire Panel. A Special Report will be released in advance in November 1994. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC) needs information from the IPCC before the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP), likely to take place in early 1995. The IPCC will therefore write a Special Report for the COP; this Report will pay special attention to methodologies for GHG inventories, aerosols, GWPs, and the assessment of available emissions scenarios. The Special Report will undergo the same rigorous review process as the Second Assessment Report. This fact sheet was written by Dr. Narasimhan Sundararaman, Secretary of the IPCC. The IPCC was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

At one extreme, some people argue that no policy on climate change is needed because not enough is known about the problem. At the other extreme are those who contend that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases must be stabilized whatever the cost. Economic analysis takes the middle road: it argues against inaction because the cost of a very modest policy would be less than the expected benefit. It also advises against drastic action, as the expected benefit of a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be smaller than the cost. The most economically efficient approach would be to adopt a range of policies. Further research is clearly needed to reduce the scientific uncertainties of climate change and to gain more insight into possible policy responses. In the meantime, action should be taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, to increase the environment�s capacity for absorbing gases already present in the atmosphere, and to adapt to climate change. These policies should all be subject to the same economic calculus. Society should not spend more money on reducing emissions by one ton than it could on creating "sinks" to absorb the equivalent amount from the atmosphere, because these different actions have the same net effect. Similarly, the cost of these activities should not be greater than the cost of reducing damage by an equivalent amount through adaptation to climate change impacts (e.g. constructing dikes and sea walls). Climate change policies should be as comprehensive as possible and should apply to as many different greenhouse gases as practical. Policy-makers should consider two points. First, although making the first small reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would be inexpensive, the marginal cost1 (i.e. the per-ton cost of successive reductions) would rise steeply for further cuts in emissions. This would also apply to the other greenhouse gases: CFCs, methane, nitrous oxide, and so on. Second, each gas has a different global warming potential (GWP), depending on how potent it is, how long it remains in the atmosphere, and other factors (fact sheet 7). Scientists use GWPs to determine how releasing one ton of a gas would affect the radiative properties of the atmosphere relative to the release of one ton of carbon dioxide. Based on this measure of "CO2-equivalence", and the fact that it is cheaper to reduce the emissions of many gases by a little than to reduce one gas by a lot, policy-makers can attempt to lower emissions of all greenhouse gases to the point where the cost of abating an extra unit of GWP for each gas just equals the expected damage avoided. Some abatement should be undertaken. . . It is widely accepted that a small reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would produce a positive benefit and yet would not cost very much. Eliminating the first few tons of carbon dioxide emissions, for example, would require just a tiny move away from carbon-intensive fuels. This suggests that at least some reduction should be undertaken. but not as much as would be required to stabilize current concentrations. Scientists have estimated that CO2 emissions would have to be cut by some 60% to stabilize atmospheric concentrations at their present level. The cost of such a policy would be huge. According to one study, the marginal cost1 of stabilizing CO2 concentrations (i.e. the cost of cutting the last ton of carbon) would be about $1,600 in the year 2020.2 Modest reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are clearly justified. The question is, how much of this reduction should be achieved by reducing emissions, and how much through enhancing or creating "sinks". The figure below shows how one leading economist3 estimates the incremental costs of cutting a certain percentage of net greenhouse gas emissions through a combination of abatement and sink enhancement. One curve shows the marginal costs of reducing CO2 emissions, another the marginal costs for reducing CFCs, and a third the marginal costs for achieving equivalent reductions by planting trees to create a carbon sink. These three curves are summed up to create the fourth curve, which is the total marginal costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through both abatement and sink enhancement. The three horizontal lines represent estimates of the marginal damage that would be caused by climate change. Each one represents a scenario based on different assumptions about how much damage would result from a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations (calculated in CO2 equivalents).4 According to this analysis, a medium-damage scenario justifies an 11% reduction in CO2-equivalent emissions, of which about 2% comes from CO2, 9% from CFCs, and virtually nothing from tree planting. The high damage case would justify a one-third reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but even this amount would not be sufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations. Policy-makers must be careful when they interpret the results of this analysis. The great virtue in the above economic analysis is that it explicitly represents costs and benefits. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to measuring the costs and benefits of climate change policy (fact sheets 228 and 229). What�s more, the above analysis assumes that small changes in emissions would only lead to small changes in climate change impacts. If there exists a threshold beyond which small changes in greenhouse gas concentrations would cause a rapid worsening of climate impacts, then the best policy may be one that would be strong enough to avoid that threshold. Scientists have not yet identified such a threshold, however, so economists continue to recommend policies that are modest and flexible. For further reading: W.D.

Schelling, "Climate Change: Implications for Welfare and Policy", in "Changing Climate: Report of the Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee", Washington DC: National Academy of Sciences (1983). Notes: 1 The marginal cost is the cost of reducing emissions by one additional unit (e.g. a ton). Economists derive marginal costs on the assumption that the cheapest option for abatement would be exploited first, followed by the more expensive ones. This results in the marginal cost rising as the level of greenhouse gas abatement increases. 2 OECD, "The Costs of Policies to Reduce Global Emissions of CO2: Alternative Scenarios with GREEN", OECD Comparative Modelling Exercise, September 1991. 3 Nordhaus (1991). 4 Different assumptions are also made about the rate of discounting.

Sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization WMO), the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), and other international organizations, the conference was held in Geneva from 29 October to 7 November 1990. The Conference�s main objectives were to review the UNEP/WMO World Climate Programme (WCP) and to recommend policy actions. With various international climate conferences stressing its importance, expectations for this conference were high. The Conference was held at a crucial time in the climate treaty negotiation process. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had completed its First Assessment Report in time for the conference, which in turn was to provide critical input for the first session of the International Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC). The resulting Ministerial Statement, however, disappointed many of the participating scientists as well as other observers because it did not offer a high level of commitment. Nevertheless, the statement did represent, by virtue of its high political level and wide-spread participation, a critical step on the road to a treaty on climate change. The scientists and technology experts at the Conference issued a strong statement highlighting the risk of climate change. The first part of the Conference consisted of a series of non-governmental scientific sessions attended by 747 scientists and technology experts from around the world. In addition to 18 Expert Panels and Task Groups, the participants established a Consultation Group on Special Needs of Developing Countries. The resulting Statement of the Scientific and Technical Sessions made specific recommendations on the significance of greenhouse gases for climate change; the use of climate information in assisting sustainable social and economic development; priorities for enhanced research and observational systems; public information; the impact of climate change on water resources, forests, agriculture and food, oceans, fisheries, and coastal zones; necessary changes in energy production and consumption patterns; the impact of climate change on land use, urban planning, and human health; and the implications of climate change for sustainable development. The scientific statement also noted that the First World Climate Conference had urged states to foresee and prevent changes to the climate that might have adverse effects. In the 11 years since then, it continued, a clear scientific consensus had emerged on the estimated range of global warming that is to be expected during the 21st century. Accordingly, the Second World Climate Conference science meeting agreed that it was time for the world community to take strong measures to reduce sources and to increase "sinks" of greenhouse gases, despite the remaining scientific uncertainties: "If the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations is not limited, the predicted climate change would place stresses on natural and social systems unprecedented in the last 10,000 years." The Conference issued a Ministerial Declaration only after hard bargaining over a number of difficult issues. The second part of the Conference consisted of discussions among heads of government and ministers from 137 states and the European Community. These discussions were preceded by preparatory negotiations between government officials, which were convened to prepare a text for submission to the ministers. A key issue was whether or not to set emissions targets and to refer specifically to carbon dioxide. The final declaration, adopted after hard bargaining, did not specify any internationally agreed targets. This omission provoked some criticism from delegates and observers who considered the EC target of achieving 1990 emissions levels for carbon dioxide by the year 2000 to be the minimum basis of an acceptable policy for developed countries. Despite their difficulties, the participants did agree on a number of points. The key agreements, included in the Declaration, were that participants recognize a number of principles that had emerged in international climate discussions, including the concept of climate change as a common concern of humankind, the principle of equity and the common but differentiated responsibility of countries at different levels of development, the concept of sustainable development, and the precautionary principle; stress the need for further scientific research on the causes and effects of climate change and recommend that this be done mainly through support of the World Climate Programme (WCP); state that response measures must be adopted without delay, despite remaining scientific uncertainties; urge developed states, which are responsible for 75% of the world�s emissions of greenhouse gases, to "establish targets and/or feasible national programmes or strategies which will have a significant effect on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases ..."; recognize that the emissions from developing countries must still grow to accommodate their development needs; nevertheless, these states should, with support from the developed nations and international organizations, take action; and call for elaboration of a framework treaty on climate change and the necessary protocols - containing real commitments and innovative solutions - in time for adoption by the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992.

Many international conferences have declared that the UN is the appropriate forum for dealing with such a large-scale enterprise. The General Assembly helps to coordinate and direct the UN system�s work on climate change. It adopts resolutions at its annual meeting that lay down or confirm fundamental (but non-binding) principles that are afterwards elaborated by other institutions. The General Assembly also requests the relevant specialized agencies and other bodies within the UN system to undertake specific duties. It then provides support for their work and reviews their reports. The first General Assembly initiative relevant to climate change was the establishment of the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983.1 Chaired by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, this independent body became known as the Brundtland Commission. Its 1987 report "Our Common Future"2 analysed the state of the global environment and identified priority areas for an institutional and legal response. It called for international negotiations for a climate treaty, research into the origins and effects of climate change, scientific monitoring of the climate, international policies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, and measures for coping with the effects of climate change. In 1988, the General Assembly adopted a resolution that recognized climate change as a common concern of mankind".3 It urged the world community to treat climate change as a priority issue, reaffirmed a 1987 resolution approving an initiative by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to cooperate on this issue4, and endorsed the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The resolution also encouraged the convening of national and international climate conferences and asked UNEP and WMO to put the IPCC to work immediately on a comprehensive review of the state of the global climate. In 1989 the General Assembly decided to convene the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992. Climate change was to be a top priority at this high-level forum.5 By 1989, a number of international and regional conferences had been held to discuss climate change. The UN General Assembly welcomed these efforts and endorsed the decision by UNEP and WMO to start work on a climate treaty. It proposed that this work start as quickly as possible and take into account the conclusions of theSecond World Climate Conference, to be held in 1990.6 (See fact sheet 221.) The Assembly�s 1989 resolutions on climate change emphasized the concerns of developing countries7 and of low-lying coastal and island states.8 They called for technology transfers and funding mechanisms to ensure the full participation of developing countries in the climate negotiations. The resolutions also urged the world community to help the developing states, especially those most affected by rising sea levels and other climate change impacts, to adapt to the situation. The Assembly�s 1990 "climate resolution" established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC)9. The INC�s task was to formulate an international climate Convention. The General Assembly asked the INC to finalize and adopt the Climate Convention in time for it to be opened for signature at UNCED in June 1992. It reaffirmed this request in December 1991 and asked states to continue contributing to the funds established for financing the participation of developing countries in the work of the IPCC and the INC.10 The INCsucceeded in adopting the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in May 1992 in compliance with the Assembly's request.

The 1989 Tokyo Conference strongly supported international negotiations for a climate treaty. Held from 11-13 September, the Tokyo Conference on the Global Environment and Human Response Towards Sustainable Development addressed two major areas of global concern: Development and environment in developing countries, and the changing atmosphere. Its conclusions, intended as a contribution to the process leading to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED - see fact sheet 207), are set out in the chairman�s statement.1 The Tokyo Conference statement stresses the importance of international cooperation in environmental protection. Particular reference was made to research, technology transfer, strong implementation mechanisms, and innovative approaches to international funding (such as "debt-for-nature swaps"). It identifies the emission of harmful gases from industrial sources and from current land-use practices as a possible cause of global warming, and it urges all states to participate fully in the current international negotiations on a climate treaty (fact sheets 208 and 209). The statement also outlines actions that should be taken by developing and developed countries to protect tropical forests. To this end, it recommends the strengthening of relevant international programmes. Although not directly aimed at the issue of global warming, this recommendation is relevant since tropical forests act as "sinks" for carbon dioxide. Finally, the conference statement addresses a number of recommendations to industry, asking that business practices reflect environmental considerations. The 1989 Langkawi Declaration on Environment of the Commonwealth Heads of Government identifies the greenhouse effect as a serious environmental problem.2 Adopted on 21 October 1989 in Langkawi, Malaysia, the declaration does not deal exclusively with the problems of developing countries. However, it does emphasize the importance of sustainable development and of economic growth, and it expresses deep concern over the degradation of the environment. The participants discussed the issue of global warming on the basis of the findings of the Commonwealth Expert Group on Climate Change. In their view, the responsibility for environmental measures should be equitably shared by countries, although the ability of developing countries to respond should be taken into account. The Commonwealth Heads set out a programme of action and asked the Commonwealth Secretariat to put it into effect. The commitments with a relevance for climate change include: Advancement of policies and programmes for sustainable development; Strengthening of international funding mechanisms for responding to environmental threats, including assistance to developing countries; Support for the work of IPCC and active participation in the international negotiations on a climate treaty, which should be concluded as soon as possible. To this end, the Commonwealth�s Secretary-General was asked to establish an experts group which would keep up-to-date on the ongoing climate work; Promotion of improved energy efficiency, the reduction and eventual phase-out of ozone-depleting substances, afforestation, and development of new agricultural practices; Support for developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustainable forest management; and Support for low-lying coastal and island states in their efforts to protect themselves against the threat of sea-level rise. The 1991 Beijing Conference emphasized the special needs of developing countries. At the invitation of the Chinese government, 41 ministers from developing countries met in Beijing in June to discuss issues related to environmental protection and sustainable development. The Beijing Ministerial Conference of Developing Countries on Environment and Development highlighted global climate change as one of the serious environmental problems facing the international community. The resulting Beijing Ministerial Declaration emphasizes the need for technology transfer to developing countries on a preferential, non-commercial basis, and for the provision of new and additional funds. The future framework climate treaty should incorporate "firm commitments by developed countries" on these issues. The Beijing declaration states "developing countries cannot be expected to accept any obligations in the near future" under a future climate treaty. Instead, they should be "encouraged", through financial and technical assistance, to adopt response measures. The declaration expresses support for the ozone convention and protocol (fact sheet 224); however, it states that compliance by developing countries is contingent on the provision of financial resources. The declaration also stresses the common but differentiated responsibility of states at different stages of development and the sovereign right of states to exploit their own natural resources.

The 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer do not directly address the issue of climate change. However, they do seek to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, an important group of greenhouse gases. Elaborated under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), the Vienna Convention commits its parties to protect human health and the environment against the "adverse effects" of human-induced modifications of the ozone layer. The Convention�s definition of "adverse effects" is very broad and includes "changes in climate". The Convention entered into force in September 1988 and, as of January 1993, 105 states and the European Community are parties to it. As a framework convention, the Vienna Convention sets out broad principles . . . It requires states to cooperate on research into the causes and effects of ozone depletion and its possible climatic effects, as well as on alternative technologies; to cooperate on the adoption of legal and policy measures to counteract activities that are harmful to the atmosphere; and to facilitate the transfer of technology and the transmission of information, especially to developing countries. ...while the Montreal Protocol regulates the details. The protocol entered into force on 1 January 1989. As of January 1993, 100 states and the European Community - accounting for over 95% of the world�s consumption of the substances controlled by the Protocol - had become parties to it. The Montreal Protocol was amended and adjusted in June 1990 and November 1992 to incorporate stronger measures.1 Whereas the Protocol originally obliged parties to reduce their production and consumption of CFCs by 50% by mid-1999 and to freeze their use of halons, the 1990 amendment provides for a complete phase-out of some of the controlled substances by the year 2000. The changes made in 1990 entered into force in 1992. At their 1992 meeting, the parties accelerated the phase-out, banning some gases by 1994 and others by 1996. In addition, they targeted some new substances for phase-out. The Montreal Protocol regulates the production and use of CFCs, halons, and carbon tetrachloride, which are all greenhouse gases. It obliges states to totally phase out these substances in accordance with the schedule. Because this may also help to reduce the greenhouse effect, many international climate meetings have strongly urged states to ratify the Montreal Protocol. The most relevant mechanisms of the Protocol, as amended in 1990 and 1992, are the following: A schedule is established for phasing out the target chemicals; Countries may "exchange" the rights to produce a particular substance as long as the total production permitted by the schedule is not exceeded; The trade in controlled substances with non-parties will be banned in accordance with a schedule set out by the Protocol. Parties must discourage exports of technologies for producing the controlled substances, and refrain from granting subsidies or aid for such production, to non-parties; Developing countries whose annual consumption of CFCs and halons is less than 0.3 kilograms per capita may delay their compliance with the control measures of the convention for 10 years if their consumption never exceeds this level. Thus the Protocol establishes a dual standard for developed and developing countries; Parties must regularly assess and review the provisions of the Protocol by, for example, convening special panels of experts; An elaborate financing mechanism, including a Multilateral Fund initially containing US$160 million, was set up on an interim basis in January,1991 to provide financial assistance to developing countries. The fund is financed by the developed-country parties and was increased to US$240 million when China and India acceded to the Montreal Protocol. It was established on a permanent basis in 1992; Various institutional mechanisms were also established, including an Implementation Committee (given a strengthened role in 1992), an Executive Committee, and an Ad Hoc Technical Advisory Committee on Destruction Technologies; The Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol could serve as a model for the further development of the Climate Convention. Like climate change, damage to the ozone layer is a global environmental issue of considerable complexity. The regulatory approach adopted in this case was to set out general principles in a framework treaty (the Vienna Convention) and to lay down specific rules in the Montreal Protocol. Measures were gradually strengthened as scientific findings influenced the political will to act. Due to the similarities between the two issues, climate change also lends itself to this formula: future protocols could provide more specific measures to strengthen the Convention. Indeed, as some of the problems that the two issues pose for developing countries are also similar, the Climate Change Convention already adopts some similar approaches. Some of these problems are that developing countries, although at present producing only a small share of the harmful substances, will produce an increasing share as they develop economically; that developing countries may be impacted more severely than developed countries by climate change, since they have less capacity to adapt; that reducing the consumption of harmful substances used in industrial processes may adversely effect the economic growth of developing countries, but growth is a priority for these countries; and that developing countries will need technical and financial assistance to implement the measures imposed by the treaties.

Although most scientists believe that human activities are changing the climate, they do not agree on the rate at which it will occur, nor on its specific impacts (fact sheets 1 and 9). This makes it difficult to put a "price tag" on either climate change or on policies to prevent it (fact sheets 228 and 229). Nevertheless, the seriousness of the potential damage and the availability of cost-effective policies are strong arguments for taking immediate action to minimize climate change. Action is necessary because the damage caused by climate change may be catastrophic and irreversible. Estimates of the probable damage from climate change vary widely, from moderate to overwhelming. However, if the earth�s surface warms by several degrees centigrade over the next 100 years as predicted, it seems clear that millions of people would become vulnerable to the effects of famine, drought, coastal flooding, and more. Nasty surprises, such as changes in certain ocean currents that strongly influence regional weather patterns, could not be ruled out. Once such disasters started to occur, it would take at least several generations before measures to reverse climate change could have significant results. The money spent on taking action now could be viewed as an insurance premium for protection against a hard-to-measure but potentially devastating risk. The first cuts in greenhouse gas emissions would be relatively cheap. Some 10% of emissions could be eliminated by raising industrial and energy efficiency and by removing counter-productive policies, such as subsidies for clearing forests. The longer such steps are delayed, the more expensive it will become to achieve identical results with future policies. Furthermore, by the time these early reductions are completed and more expensive decisions must be made, the scientific evidence concerning climate change should be clearer. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions would have additional benefits unrelated to climate change. Fuel efficiency would save money. Lower emissions of pollutants from factories and automobiles would improve air quality in urban centres and reduce acid rain. Putting a stop to deforestation would reduce soil erosion, offer aesthetic and economic benefits, and protect biodiversity and subsistence forest dwellers. One study suggested that while a hypothetical carbon tax (fact sheet 230) might cost Norway 2.75% of its GNP in the year 2010, 70% of that cost would be recouped through such non-climate benefits.1 For further reading: David Pearce, et. al., "Blueprint 2: Greening the World Economy", London: Earthscan (1991).

Hosted by Norway and co-sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), the Conference was one of a series of regional meetings1 held in advance of the June 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). The Conference participants discussed a variety of environmental subjects, but the central issue was climate change. Taking their cue from the Conference theme of sustainable development, the Ministers focused on the need for industrialized countries to limit emissions of greenhouse gases through more efficient and environmentally sound energy use. The Ministers recognized that the ECE countries of North America and Europe consume about 70% of the world�s energy. They declared their willingness to "assume a major responsibility to limit or reduce greenhouse gases." A large majority of the industrialized states represented at the conference also agreed that they would stabilize the emission of CO2 and other important greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Due to opposition from the United States and a few other countries, however, the conference did not adopt a commitment to specific emissions targets. The resulting Bergen Declaration2 details concrete measures necessary for combating the causes of climate change. These measures address the transport sector, energy efficiency and conservation, environmentally sound and renewable energy sources, and regulatory tools such as taxes and emissions charges. Additional proposals debated during the preparatory discussions to the Conference are summarized in the Joint Agenda for Action. The Declaration expresses strong support for the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It calls the IPCC "the principal forum for scientific assessment related to climate change". It repeated the request made by other international conferences that the IPCC examine the feasibility of a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005. The Declaration also lends its support to two key principles. These are the precautionary principle and the principle of the common but differentiated responsibilities of states for responding to climate change. Finally, the Declaration advocates finding new ways and means for providing financial resources to developing countries to help them implement environmentally sound practices. The Ministers could not agree, however, on a specific financial pledge. The Bergen Declaration was an early indication of the commitment that the leading economic powers are willing to make to confront climate change. Although an agreement on specific quantitative limits for greenhouse gas emissions was not reached, the Declaration proposes concrete measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

About three quarters of human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - the most important man-made GHG - are caused by the use of fossil fuels, including oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels also account for a significant part of man-made releases of methane, nitrous oxide, and several GHG "precursors" (gases that indirectly encourage the formation, or discourage the destruction, of GHGs), notably carbon monoxide, other oxides of nitrogen, and hydrocarbons. New technologies that improve the efficiency of fuel-using equipment can significantly reduce GHG emissions. While pollution control devices can be used to reduce emissions of GHGs and their precursors (but not CO2), those currently available typically have several drawbacks. Not only are they costly and effective for only a limited range of machines and gases, but they tend to reduce overall energy efficiency. Catalytic converters for automobiles, for example, reduce carbon monoxide emissions but, by reducing energy efficiency, can effectively increase automotive emissions of carbon dioxide. A better approach may be to develop technologies that improve the efficiency of fuel use. If the same amount of fuel can be converted into more useful energy, less fossil fuel must be burned to achieve the same productivity. Examples would include power plants that produce more electricity per tonne of coal, cars that travel further on a litre of petrol, and light bulbs that produce more light per watt. And unlike pollution control devices, which generally target a particular gas, higher fuel efficiency has the additional advantage of simultaneously reducing all unwanted emissions, including GHGs. It must be remembered, however, that by lowering costs, efficiency improvements may encourage people to make greater use of cars and other products, so that at least a portion of the energy savings would be offset by increased demand. Improved technologies for extracting, processing, and distributing fuels can also lead to large reductions. While fossil fuels release most of their GHGs when they are burned, they start emitting gases as soon as they are unearthed. Improved maintenance of gas pipelines and of oil and gas wells can reduce leaks of methane from natural gas. Methane emissions from coal mining can be cut if wells are drilled into the coal-bearing rock to tap and capture methane trapped in the rock before it escapes during mining. At remote oil wells, natural gas that is now vented into the atmosphere or burned off, releasing methane and carbon dioxide respectively, can be captured and used as fuel or converted into fertilizer or other easily transported products. Fossil fuels can often be replaced with renewable energy sources that produce less or even zero GHG emissions. New technologies are being developed that produce heat, electricity, or motion using non-fossil fuels. Some of these energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells or wind-generated electricity, produce essentially no GHG emissions. Others, notably biomass or biomass-derived fuels such as ethanol (used as a motor fuel), produce some GHG emissions as a result of incomplete combustion, fuel impurities, or chemical reactions during burning, but much less than do fossil fuels. While these non-fossil fuel sources are much cleaner than fossil fuels, however, each one also has its own drawbacks. Some, such as photovoltaic panels, are still not economically competitive for most applications. As for hydro-power, it requires dams that flood the land and dislocate people; wind and solar power require areas with high winds or regular sunshine; and fuel-wood depends on the availability of (sustainably-managed) forest-land. In industrialized countries changes in lifestyle could lower energy use and thus GHG emis- sions . . . Increased energy consciousness would encourage people to adopt any number of minor changes in their habits, such as car-pooling or riding public transport instead of driving alone to work, reducing average lighting levels in stores and offices, taking care not to leave lights or televisions on when not in use, reducing unnecessary driving, and re-using materials to reduce the need for manufacturing. Lifestyle changes could also be major, such as adopting a less materialist lifestyle, restructuring communities to place people closer to offices and shops, redesigning dwellings and schedules to take maximum advantage of sunlight and solar heating, and making use of dispersed, renewable energy sources such as wood stoves and wind pumps. It is difficult to tell how acceptable and practical such lifestyle changes will be in the absence of compelling economic incentives. although such opportunities will prove rarer in much of the developing world. In countries pursuing development policies geared to reducing poverty, energy use will probably need to rise to support basic services such as electric lighting, refrigeration, and so on. Technologies that would enable developing countries to grow economically while reducing or stabilizing energy use are currently of limited availability. What�s more, even when such technologies are economically competitive over the long-term, they tend to require more up-front capital than developing countries can afford, unless they receive support from aid agencies or other international sources.

The Declaration was issued by a conference of heads of state and government convened in the Hague in March 1989 at the initiative of the Dutch, French, and Norwegian governments. Because a number of major countries were not invited, the resulting declaration cannot claim to reflect the opinion of the world community. Among the states that were not invited were the US, the USSR, China, Belgium, and Greece. The United Kingdom declined to attend. The Declaration emphasizes the need for new institutional mechanisms. It advocates "a new approach, through the development of new principles of international law including more effective decision-making and enforcement mechanisms", to counter the unprecedented challenge to the atmosphere. The conference participants discussed the need for an institution within the framework of the UN that would have the main responsibility for combating further global warming. After some debate, the question of whether this should be achieved by creating a new institution or whether existing UN bodies, notably the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), should be strengthened, was left open. The Declaration also spelled out specific features of the proposed new institution. The signatories pledged to promote the following ideas: The institution should have the responsibility to combat global warming and should be empowered to make effective decisions, even if unanimous agreement has not been reached. This institution should be responsible for undertaking the necessary studies, for which it should be granted appropriate information. In addition, it should promote the exchange of information and technology transfer. It should develop standards and then monitor states� compliance. Disputes regarding the institution�s decisions should be decided by the International Court of Justice. Countries for whom measures to protect the atmosphere are a special burden should be compensated early and equitably. Legal instruments, including institutional and financial mechanisms, need to be developed to provide a foundation for application of these principles.

The sky and the weather do not have the same importance in all cultures. In Judeo-Christian cultures, the sky is strongly associated with the divine and with all-powerful and infinite cosmic powers. Animist and Hindu cultures, on the other hand, tend to associate their deities with creatures of the earth. These religious differences might make some cultures more sensitive than others to �changes in the skies�. Changes in the climate would tend to affect "traditional" and rural cultures more than modern urban societies. While all cultures associate the climate with the cyclical nature of life on earth, as expressed in the changing of the seasons, some are closer than others to these cycles. Industrialized cultures tend to be guided by a more linear concept of time, and they emphasize the concepts of �progress� and permanent change. Because they are already used to rapid change, they might even interpret climate change as yet another phenomenon to adapt to or to cope with, comparable to unemployment or the information-technology revolution. On the other hand, cultural values may change as people in industrialized countries become more aware of planet Earth as a single system, a fragile biosphere upon which all of humanity depends. Erratic weather, droughts, and other phenomena of climate change would probably affect the psyches of individuals. In addition to the physical and economic stresses caused by climate change, societies and institutions may also have to cope with the psychological problems of individuals. Research into such problems has been done in the context of the threat of nuclear war in industrialized Western societies.1 Individuals from different cultures, however, are likely to be affected in different ways. In Western, individualistic societies, people are likely to experience a growing sense of the individual�s fragility and dependence. As they become more aware of humanity�s dependence upon the biosphere and of the barriers to effective global action, they may suffer a growing feeling of powerlessness. This feeling of powerless dependence may have already been prompted by such issues as radioactive pollution and depletion of the ozone layer. The psychological stress of climate change may lead to dysfunctional responses. When people experience a widespread problem that they feel unable to do anything about, they often develop some sort of psychological defense. A problem as overwhelming as climate change is likely to generate such counter-productive responses as cynicism, denial, and aggression. When people respond to a desperate situation by becoming cynical, they lose their interest in the problem and withdraw from activities that might help to alleviate or solve it. When they deny that the problem exists, they deny having any responsibility for causing it; as a result, campaigns that, for example, encourage people to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by driving their cars less, would fall on deaf ears. Finally, if people try to vent their frustration through aggression, they may become destructive and seek to sabotage efforts to combat climate change. Notes: 1 H. E.

Economists define total climate change damages as the compensating payment that would be needed to make society as well off with climate change as without it. The benefits of a climate change policy, however, must be measured against the damages avoided by actions taken now and in the future; because past actions are not considered, these benefits will always be less than total climate change damages. This distinction is important, and is based on the scientific conclusion that the historical build-up of greenhouse gas concentrations already commits us to at least some climate change, no matter what policies we adopt now. To properly assess a policy�s benefits, we must recognize that climate change is likely to produce gains as well as losses. For example, if temperatures rise, the global demand for air conditioning will increase, but the demand for heating will fall. More significantly, crop yields are likely to fall in some regions and to increase in others (fact sheet 101). When measuring the benefits of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, then, the damages avoided must be measured as a net of climate change gains and losses. Whatever policy is adopted, people will respond to climate change by modifying their behaviour to increase gains and reduce losses. People naturally adapt to changing conditions. So if climate change reduces the growing season, people will substitute early-maturing crops so that output will fall by less than it otherwise would. Similarly, if sea-levels rise substantially, the damage will not be the loss of downtown Shanghai, but the much lower cost of protecting this area. These natural efforts to adapt will reduce climate change losses and increase gains, thus having the effect of lowering the benefit of policies to abate greenhouse gas emissions. This effect will be particularly important in the long run, as research uncovers new technologies better suited to the emerging climate conditions. Some of the benefits of a climate change policy can be derived from national income statistics for climate-sensitive sectors . . . The economic sector most vulnerable to climate change is agriculture (including forestry). This sector accounts for only 2% of US GDP but for more than 60% of GDP in Somalia, Uganda, and Nepal. This does not necessarily mean that poorer countries will always experience the greatest relative losses. For example, climate change could lead to increased rainfall and food production in some now-arid countries. Furthermore, developing countries are likely to become less dependent on agriculture over time; from 1965-1988, the share of agriculture in the output of low-income economies fell from 44% to 33%. That said, poorer countries are clearly more vulnerable simply because they are still more dependent on climate-sensitive economic activity than are the industrialized countries and they have a weaker capability for adapting to negative impacts. but the value of a decline in the quantity and quality of non-marketed goods and services can not be easily measured. GDP data provide only a rough indication of a country�s vulnerability to climate change. They do not reflect changes in human health, biological diversity, environmental quality, and amenity values. These changes can be either positive or negative; for example, although human health may worsen in warm countries, it may actually improve in cold ones. Such changes are much harder to estimate because the values people place on health and environmental quality are not reflected in market prices. The direct benefits of reducing sea-level rise would be very high for some countries but negligible for others. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC - see fact sheet 208) has predicted that there will be a 30-110 centimetre rise in sea-level by 2100. One US study suggests that a one-metre rise in sea-levels would cost the US about $11 billion annually, or 0.2% of current GDP.1 Relative damages would be even greater for island nations and for low-lying countries such as Egypt and Bangladesh. One study estimates that the cost of protecting the Maldives from sea-level rise would be about 35% of that country�s GNP.2 When considering these figures, it is important to remember that they refer to total damages, and not to the (smaller) damages that would be prevented by a new abatement policy. Because the climate system responds slowly to changes, the benefits of the policies we pay for today will not be realized for many years. Costly climate change policies would reduce our wealth today but, if they are successful in reducing climate change damages, they would increase our wealth in the future. Economists ask: if normal economic growth will make people better off in the year 2100 than they are today, wouldn�t an extra $1 in consumption be valued less by people living in 2100 than it would be by people living today? If so, in order to maximize human well-being across generations, the current generation should spend less than $1 today to reduce damages by $1 in 2100. In other words, when comparing current costs with future benefits, we should discount the latter. Calculating the appropriate rate of discount is complicated and depends on ethical concerns as well as empirical facts. The important point, however, is this: any discount rate that is chosen greatly reduces the benefits that economists would attribute to climate change policies.3 The long-term benefits of abatement policies may be extremely important. Most researchers into the benefits of climate change policy assume a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations. However, unless emissions are cut sharply, it is likely that atmospheric concentrations will rise by more than this later in the next century. Taking a long-term view could potentially produce a much higher calculation of the benefits of policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of the long view depends on whether the future is discounted and on whether damages are non-linear - that is, whether damages double with a two-fold increase in CO2-equivalent concentrations, or whether they increase by much more.

In 1990, the Heads of State or Government of the Group of Seven leading industrial states (G-7)1 noted that "one of our most important responsibilities is to pass on to future generations an environment whose health, beauty, and economic potential are not threatened". This marks an important transition from the traditional stance, which gave overriding priority to economic growth. The Economic Declarations of the last five Summit meetings all stress the need to integrate environmental considerations into economic activities. They also include concrete proposals and commitments on various environmental issues, including climate change. Although these declarations do not have legal force, they do indicate the group�s level of political will for dealing with environmental problems. The G-7 first highlighted climate change at its 1988 Toronto Economic Summit. The Summit welcomed the convening of the Toronto Conference on the Changing Atmosphere as well as the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The 1989 Paris Economic Summit (Summit of the Arch) stressed the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The Summit Declaration noted that industry has a crucial role to play in preventing environmental degradation. It addressed the issue of financial and technical assistance to developing countries to help them cope with environmental problems, and it advocated economic incentives such as the use of aid mechanisms and technology transfers for specific environmental projects. It stated that in special cases, debt forgiveness and "debt-for-nature swaps" can play a useful role in environmental protection. The declaration also contained a catalogue of environmental problems requiring action by G-7 members and by the international community. Problems relating to changes in the atmosphere figure prominently on this list. The declaration supports the work of the IPCC, and stresses the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency. Another important aim is to preserve forests, as deforestation also damages the atmosphere. The 1990 Houston Economic Summit emphasized the role of industrial countries in protecting the environment. Declared the G-7 heads, "We as industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in meeting these challenges. We agree that, in the face of threats of irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in their own right". Stating that "climate change is of key importance", the Summit declaration expressed the G-7�s commitment to undertaking common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). Unlike some other conference statements, however, the declaration did not set specific emissions targets. It repeated the earlier support of the UN-sponsored negotiations on a climate treaty, welcomed the decision of the parties to the Montreal Protocol to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000, and emphasized the need for forest conservation, on which the G-7 members declared themselves "determined to take action". The 1991 London Economic Summit supported UNCED. The G-7 members reiterated their previous stance and placed special emphasis on the preparations for the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). They stressed their aim to achieve, in time for UNCED, "an effective framework convention on climate change, containing appropriate commitments and addressing all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases", and to expedite work on implementing protocols to reinforce the convention. They declared their intention to promote the mobilization of funds to help developing countries tackle environmental problems, using existing mechanisms for this purpose. Support was also expressed for "an improved flow of beneficial technology" to developing countries. The 1992 Munich Economic Summit called for decisive action to follow-up on the results of UNCED. The G-7 members urged all states to incorporate sustainable development and the interests of present and future generations into their policy-making. The Summit also specifically called for the ratification of the newly signed UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by the end of 1993.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the first binding international legal instrument that deals directly with climate change. The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 after 15 months of tough negotiations by the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC). It was opened for signature at the Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro the following month, where it was signed by the representatives of 154 states and the EEC (now the EU). By 19 June 1993, when the treaty was closed for signature, 165 states (plus the EEC) had signed. The 50th ratification was received on 21 December 1993, triggering the Convention's entry into force 90 days later on 21 March 1994. The Convention's ultimate objective is the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." To achieve this objective (Article 2), the Convention sets out a series of commitments. The adequacy of these commitments will be periodically reviewed in light of the treaty's objective, new scientific findings, and the effectiveness of national climate change programmes. As a framework treaty, the Convention sets out principles and general commitments, leaving more specific obligations to future legal instruments. The key principles incorporated in the treaty are the precautionary principle, the common but differentiated responsibility of states (which assigns industrialised states the lead in combating climate change), and the importance of sustainable development (Article 3). The general commitments, which apply to both developed and developing countries, are to adopt national programmes for mitigating climate change; to develop adaptation strategies; to promote the sustainable management and conservation of greenhouse gas "sinks" (such as forests); to take climate change into account when setting relevant social, economic, and environmental policies; to cooperate in technical, scientific, and educational matters; and to promote scientific research and the exchange of information (Article 4, para. 1). The Convention also establishes more specific obligations for particular categories of states. It distinguishes between members of the OECD1 (listed in Annex II to the Convention), countries in transition to a market economy (Eastern European countries which, together with the OECD countries, are listed in Annex I), and developing countries. The Convention requires OECD countries to take the strongest measures, while the states in transition to a market economy are allowed a certain flexibility. The Convention recognises that compliance by developing countries will depend on financial and technical assistance from developed countries; in addition, the needs of least developed countries and those that are particularly vulnerable to climate change for geographical reasons are given special consideration (Article 4, paras. 2-7). This approach is consistent with the widely recognised principle of the common but differentiated responsibility of states at different levels of development. Developed countries and states in transition to a market economy must take the lead in adopting measures to combat climate change. They should take measures designed to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, with the aim of returning to 1990 emissions levels by the year 2000. However, the differing economic circumstances of these countries are to be taken into account, and several states may together adopt a common, joint target. (Article 4, para. 2). The OECD countries must facilitate the transfer of technology and provide financial resources to developing countries to help them implement the Convention. The Convention requires OECD countries to finance the costs incurred by developing countries for submitting reports on their greenhouses gas emissions and measures for implementing the treaty. This financial assistance is to be "new and additional", rather than redirected from existing development aid funds. In addition, OECD countries are to provide financial resources for other Convention-related projects that are agreed to by both a developing country and the Convention's financial mechanism. This financial mechanism will initially be administered by the Global Environment Facility, but the Convention's parties could agree in the future to transfer the administration of the mechanism to another international body. As for technology transfer, the Convention does not specify the terms of the transfers, such as whether they should be made on commercial or non-commercial terms. The Convention establishes institutions to support efforts to carry out commitments and to monitor compliance. The Conference of the Parties (COP), in which all Parties (states that have ratified) are represented, is the Convention's supreme body. It will meet for the first time in March 1995 and on a yearly basis thereafter. It will promote and review the implementation of the Convention and, if appropriate, adopt amendments, annexes, and protocols (Articles 7 and 15). The Convention's Secretariat will provide administrative support and ensure the flow of information among Parties (Article 8); the INC/FCCC Secretariat is providing these services on an interim basis (Article 21). The COP will be assisted by two subsidiary bodies, one for scientific and technological advice (SBSTA) and the other for implementation (SBI) (Articles 9 and 10). The COP can also set up additional bodies if it so decides. The Climate Change Convention is a major step forward in the international response to climate change. Much work remains to be done, however. Many states still need to ratify the Convention and formulate national laws and policies that will enable them to meet their commitments. Until the first session of the COP, the INC/FCCC will continue to meet and work on outstanding issues. The COP itself will have an enormous amount of work to do to ensure that the Convention is a success in the years and decades to come.

If we take measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions substantially or to adapt to climate change impacts, we will have to pay for these efforts by diverting resources away from other activities. If climate change impacts are still felt despite our efforts, then we will have to suffer the consequences of environmental damage. The economics of global climate change is primarily about how to balance these sacrifices. A balanced policy response must seek to reduce both greenhouse gas concentrations and the damage they cause. Atmospheric concentrations can be lowered by abating emissions and by creating new "sinks" for absorbing greenhouse gases (by planting trees for example). Meanwhile, the damage from the remaining greenhouse gases can be lessened by constructing dikes and sea walls or by developing new seed varieties that are better suited to a changed climate. Because there is no feasible policy response in the short term for bringing greenhouse gas concentrations back to pre-industrial levels, some measures for adapting to the expected impacts of climate change will be essential. The optimal balance between abatement and adaptation will depend on each policy�s costs and benefits. One economic study shows that, while some abatement of emissions is warranted, it would be less than the amount required to stabilize concentrations at their current levels. (See fact sheet 227.) The cost of a climate change policy can be estimated by calculating the change that it produces in human well-being. One way to estimate this change is to determine the additional income that would be required to make society as well off with the policy as it would be without it. Economists generally agree that the per-ton cost of making the first modest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would be small. However, after the cheapest solutions for reducing emissions have been exhausted, the per-ton cost would start rising steeply as further reductions are made via more expensive solutions. Estimates vary widely of just how much total abatement would actually cost, and of the point at which incremental costs would begin to rise steeply. There is even substantial disagreement over the cost of cutting emissions by just one ton (the first "unit of abatement"). Some analysts argue that this cost would actually be negative because the first reductions could be achieved by reforming policies that currently discourage energy conservation. Others disagree. In any case, most economists believe that the total cost of reducing emissions by a significant amount would be high - more than one percent of gross domestic product (GDP). (See fact sheet 228.) The benefits of a climate change policy can be estimated by calculating how much the policy reduces environmental damage. Calculating the benefits of a climate change policy is even more controversial among economists than is estimating the costs. An order-of-magnitude estimate can be obtained by asking how much of an economy would be seriously affected by climate change. For some industrialized countries, it seems that the answer is not more than 1-3% of GDP. However, for other countries - including island nations and countries with very large agricultural sectors - the percentage could be much higher. One weakness of estimates based on GDP is that not all goods and services that would be affected by climate change appear in conventional national-income statistics. A loss of biological diversity, for example, would not be captured in GDP figures. Finally, the benefits of a particular policy may not be realized for many years because the climate system responds slowly to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. This lag raises the issue of whether the value of benefits should be discounted and, if so, at what rate (economists use discount rates to put a current value on a future benefit). (See fact sheet 229.) Once policy-makers have determined what their objectives are, economists can offer insights into how to craft the most cost-effective policies. Economists generally prefer economic instruments to direct regulation. Two particular proposals for economic instruments have received the most serious attention. The first is to impose a tax on carbon dioxide emissions (fact sheet 230). Several countries - including Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands - already levy a national carbon tax, and the European Community too may soon adopt a uniform but nationally-administered tax. The second proposal is to set a quantitative limit on the global emissions of a greenhouse gas and then to allow emissions permits to be traded like ordinary goods and services (fact sheet 231). To date, no country has implemented a scheme of tradable permits for emitting greenhouse gases. However, a conceptually identical approach is being used in the US to limit the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the emission of gases that cause acid rain. Making a significant reduction in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will require international coordination and agreement. When one country reduces its emissions, all countries benefit. But the country reducing its emissions will incur a substantial cost and will receive only a fraction of the total benefit achieved by its actions. Clearly, the economic incentive for any nation to reduce emissions unilaterally is very small. At the same time, assuming that no country is a net gainer from climate change, all countries would benefit from a greater reduction in global emissions. Nevertheless, negotiations for a climate change convention proved extremely difficult, and the resulting treaty contains only limited commitments for stabilizing emissions. While a few strong agreements for reducing emissions have been negotiated in the past - the best-known example being the Montreal Protocol for phasing out CFCs (fact sheet 224) - climate change is a much more complex and challenging issue, particularly because of the difficulties over sharing costs and benefits.

Most studies are designed to satisfy one of four general objectives. Studies following a specific storm, drought, or flood offer immediate and practical benefits. They count lives lost; estimate the cost to families, companies, and governments; and assess the need for and effectiveness of emergency assistance. Other impacts studies seek to improve forecasting and preparedness in order to avert the worst catastrophes. Still others identify regions, people, and economic activities (such as agriculture ) that are particularly sensitive to climatic variations and thus in need of development and other assistance. Studies in the final category identify the potential impacts of climate variability under future conditions of global change, including higher population densities, desertification, and climate change. The specific objective agreed by the research team strongly influences the study's focus, structure, and methodology. Impacts studies focus on how specific climatic conditions affect specific people or resources. For studies of severe storms and other types of climate episodes, researchers must make accurate measurements of location, intensity, and duration. Time series and risk analyses are used to estimate the probability of such anomalies (departures from average conditions) as well as trends in frequency and severity. With this climatic information in hand, the researchers then analyse the impact on a resource (for example, timber losses due to wildfire), population (perhaps counted as lives lost or population-at-risk), or organisational level (individuals, households, firms, nations, or administrative units). The world-wide economic costs of climatic hazards - including droughts, winds, cyclones, floods, and lightning - rose dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s, exceeding US$50 billion in 1992 alone. But measuring costs, as well as the relative benefit of efforts to reduce vulnerability to impacts, is difficult. Many of the costs are dispersed, borne by individuals, or not readily valued in financial terms. While most warning systems are clearly cost-effective, costly engineering schemes, such as large reservoirs to increase the food supply through irrigation, are sometimes not. The most effective impacts studies are cooperative efforts among researchers, policy-makers, and the public. Because climate impacts are so multi-dimensional, involving the climate system, geo-physical processes, economic activities, and human impacts and responses, impacts studies require the collaboration of experts from many research disciplines. The involvement of policy-makers ensures that the research has useful and practical applications for solving real problems. The participation of a broad spectrum of the public, including companies and communities directly affected by the hazard, also improves the project's relevance. Researchers use a variety of scientific methods to assess sensitivities to climatic fluctuations. They can review and synthesise the existing research describing climate events and impacts and interview local people, whose knowledge and perceptions of climate hazards can be more detailed and profound than the most sophisticated models. They can conduct individual case studies and field surveys of a specific episode, or a series of studies permitting rigorous comparisons of many different episodes or regions. Finally, they can use quantitative modelling based on simulation, empirical-statistical, or spatial models. Modelling typically requires a great deal of time and effort for collecting the necessary data and validating the results. The most thorough studies use all of these methods together to create as complete a picture as possible. In addition to studying the actual impacts, researchers must consider what would have happened without the unusual climatic conditions. In other words, they must project the baseline conditions in the absence of the climate anomaly. For example, cereal prices must be seasonally adjusted in a drought impacts study to reflect that prices tend to be lowest just after the harvest. Mortality figures for a famine can be based on the number of people not born - that is, the difference between fertility rates during average years and during the crisis, rather than an actual count of the people who died as a direct result of the crisis. The trend in an underlying baseline may be significant, and not necessarily related to climate. For example, although the baseline trend for cereal yields in the US has been a steady increase over the past 100 years due to improved methods and technologies, the yearly variability about the trend-line is still significantly related to climatic variations. While some studies are strictly descriptive, many others are proscriptive, focusing explicitly on what people could do to reduce the negative impacts of climate. Their aim is to improve preparedness and warning systems in advance of a climate event and resiliency afterwards. The range of effective responses can be tested through a series of "what if" scenarios. For example, would earlier warnings of drought in Africa lead to more effective responses? Individual climate episodes naturally provoke immediate response measures: might the cumulative effect of such responses lessen vulnerability to some hazards while increasing the potential for catastrophe? Controlling floods, perhaps with channels and embankments, may eliminate damage from most floods, but increase the potential for a rare flood of catastrophic proportions. This could occur if people believe that the risk has been controlled and so proceed to settle in greater numbers in the flood plain. Studies of climate variability can offer insights into climate change impacts. Climate change may alter the patterns of climate variability and the frequency of extreme events in particular areas. At the same time, other forces of global change - population and economic growth, consumption patterns, policy-making, environmental deterioration - may displace vulnerable populations and undermine their ability to cope with extreme events. By studying the impacts of natural climate variability and the range of response options, researchers can also shed light on possible climate change impacts and adaptation strategies.

The AOSIS proposal Climate change poses uncertain risks for many vulnerable countries. Scientific uncertainty makes it impossible to know just how climate change will affect different parts of the world over the coming decades and centuries. Some of the expected consequences, such as sea-level rise, would clearly wreak economic havoc in many countries. Warmer temperatures and changes in storm and precipitation patterns would also cause widespread damage. Although the signatories to the Climate Change Convention have accepted the need for providing financial and technical assistance to help developing countries cope with the consequences of climate change, the enormous scale of the possible damage could render such assistance inadequate. Insurance schemes could be set up to protect countries from the costs of devastating impacts. Individuals, companies, and governments often use commercial insurance to share risk with others and so protect themselves against losses. If climate change has its expected effects, however, the resulting disasters might be too extensive to be commercially insurable. Already, the number of major natural disasters recorded in the 1980s was five times higher than in the 1960s.1 Moreover, the damage caused by each disaster has risen as population pressure, environmental degradation, and poverty have rendered greater numbers of people more vulnerable. As a result, the total economic cost of natural disasters has increased three-fold since the 1960s, while insured losses have risen by a factor of 4.8. Insurers are responding by reducing their risks; some insurers, for example, withdrew completely from Western Samoa and American Samoa in 1992 after the devastation of Cyclone Val. The withdrawal of insurance threatens to leave financially strapped states to cover the entire costs of natural disasters as well as those related to climate change. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has proposed that an "International Insurance Pool" be established to cover climate change impacts. The Pool would take the financial burden suffered by affected developing countries and distribute it amongst the industrialised countries. The members of the Pool would be divided into two groups. The first group would consist of low-lying coastal countries and small island states that would receive insurance coverage from the fund. The second group would include industrialised countries who would contribute funds. While the AOSIS proposal addresses the concerns of its members about sea-level rise, the same principal could be applied to other groups of countries and other possible climate change impacts. Similar international insurance funds have already been established. The AOSIS insurance proposal is similar to mechanisms contained in the OECD Nuclear Damage Convention of 1963 and in the Oil Pollution Damage Convention of 1971. It calls for basing 50% of contributions on GNP and 50% on national CO2 emissions. The initial target proposed for the fund is up to 0.1% of the OECD's GNP. An alternative approach would be to calculate contributions according to each country's current commercial insurance expenditures. Annual insurance expenditure world-wide is US$858 billion, 72% of which is spent by the US and Europe. This second method would produce similar results to the first.2 The AOSIS proposal calls for Pool contributions to be collected ten years after the Climate Change Convention enters into force - provided the rate of global mean sea-level rise has by then reached an agreed figure. This ten-year delay would give the funding countries sufficient time to make their initial investments. If sea-levels have not risen too much by the time the ten-year period expires, a review of conditions would be undertaken. This would give time to improve the scientific understanding of climate change and its risks. Meanwhile, the insured countries would be required to make an inventory of assets in threatened areas, to register them, and to periodically update the registry. Non-market values such as biodiversity would be included in the valuation. (The AOSIS proposal was presented to the negotiators of the Climate Convention but was not included in the final treaty.) AOSIS argues that this approach would be less expensive for the funders than providing aid in the event of a major disaster . . . Moreover, knowing that the damage done by sea-level rise is going to involve compensation, the industrialised countries would have an incentive to work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, the fund will never pay out if the predicted consequences of climate change do not take place. and that it would not discourage vulnerable states from taking precautions. Commercial insurance sometimes creates the problem of "moral hazard" whereby the insured party acts in a riskier fashion than it would otherwise. The proposed Pool, however, would avoid this risk in several ways. The insured countries would have to prove that the cost of preventing the damage caused by sea-level rise, even with international funding, would have been greater than the damage incurred. The loss of commercially insured assets could not be claimed from the Insurance Pool, and limits to coverage would be imposed to prevent any one country depleting the fund with a major claim. Finally, if total claims in any one period happen to be greater than the size of the Pool, compensation payments would be made on a pro rata basis.

Global climate change could cause Brazil's current climate extremes to occur more often. Most scientists believe that man's emissions of greenhouse gases will affect the average global climate. However, they are still unable to predict how climate change will impact particular regions. To provide national policy-makers with some early insights into the potential regional impacts of future climate change, researchers can study present-day climate variability, especially extreme events such as droughts and floods. This can enable them to draw conclusions about the relative vulnerability of different sectors of the population to climate change and about what policy responses may be needed. It was with this goal in mind that a recent climate study was undertaken in Brazil.1 Brazil's semi-arid Northeast is highly vulnerable to the effects of droughts. This region is one of the country's poorest. In normal years agriculture is a major source of employment. However, the already dry climate means that droughts can have a very serious impact on production, with recorded losses sometimes exceeding 60%. Such dramatic drops reduce employment opportunities on large commercial estates and destroy the livelihoods of subsistence farmers. Sometimes, when shortfalls in production cause food prices to rise, the only way for much of the rural population to avoid destitution is to migrate to the cities in search of low-paid jobs or to seek relief from the government. During the drought of 1983, for example, one million people - representing 48% of the total state labour force - were employed in public works programmes in the state of Ceara. Such programmes entail a huge cost to the economy and, while they enable people to survive, they cannot fully compensate for lost production or prevent increased hunger and malnutrition. Floods create problems throughout Brazil but cause particular devastation in the major cities. In areas such as the Pantanal (Great Swamp) of Eastern Brazil moderate flooding is vital for restoring vegetation and for destroying certain weeds. However, exceptional floods can result in great hardship, displacing people from their homes and causing severe damage to the cattle ranching business. In 1988 floods killed 20% of the total herds and caused massive damage to infrastructure. In the same year, 300 people were killed and over 1,000 injured in floods in Rio de Janeiro. In some areas the equivalent of three months' rain fell in under twenty-four hours and caused hundreds of landslides, especially in the densely populated slums (favelas) on the hillsides surrounding Rio. Thousands of people were made homeless, health and sanitation problems worsened dramatically, and the World Bank estimated that damages, including lost production, were close to US$1 billion. Despite the approximately US$400 million now being spent on rehabilitation, the lack of basic infrastructure and drainage in the city means that it remains extremely vulnerable to future climatic extremes. Unusually high or low temperatures cause extensive damage to crops. Coffee, which is Brazil's principal export product, is particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Its ideal growing range is a narrow 16 C to 23 C. In 1981 a frost affecting all of Brazil's coffee growing states reduced overall production by 54%. Growers have traditionally been protected from the worst effects of such shortfalls by government intervention but, with the economy undermined by the debt crisis, support has been withdrawn. Citrus, another important cash crop, is also at great risk from frost. Deforestation is increasing Brazil's vulnerability to climate variations. Using computerized climate models, researchers have tried to model the regional climatic consequences of replacing rainforest with degraded pasture. The results of such regional modelling are considered uncertain, but they suggest that surface temperatures would rise by 1-3 C and rainfall would decrease by 20-30%. This hotter and drier climate would encourage more forest fires, further raising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. But tree-cutting doesn't only affect climate. It reduces the ability of forests to act as protectors of bio-diversity; the Amazon is host to around one-half of the world's species. Furthermore, cleared land erodes more easily. The cycles of flood and drought in the Amazon region have become notably more severe since massive clearing began; a ten-year drought that began in 1963/64 was followed by fourteen years of floods. The same policies that can improve society's ability to cope with climate variability today could also be critical to dealing with climate change tomorrow. While most areas of Brazil suffer adverse weather conditions from time to time, they do not all experience equal degrees of social upheaval as a result. For example, the effects of drought in the Northeast are particularly severe because of the endemic poverty in the region. Since 60% of the population has a year or less of schooling, employment opportunities are hard to find, suggesting that educational and jobs programmes would help to reduce the region's vulnerability to climate. Similarly, energy planning in the area must take climate hazards into account. Because the Northeast relies heavily upon hydroelectric power from the Sa� Francisco river, rationing is required in drought years. This can put close to 16% of the manufacturing workforce of the state of Ceara out of work. Diversification of power sources is thus essential. The benefits of policies for adapting to climate variability have already been demonstrated in the agricultural sector, where research has led to the development of several new crop varieties more resistant to climate extremes. If global climate change causes today's climate extremes to become more frequent, such policy approaches will become ever more essential.

No one has the moral right to deny to others the benefits it can bring. But because climate change is likely to do just that, it raises the issue of how various countries should contribute to efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. More to the point, who should finance these efforts? This essentially political question of responsibility can be expressed in a 'responsibility index', but there is no generally agreed framework for quantifying responsibility in this way. Should the index be based on past, present, or future emissions? Should it include only carbon dioxide, or all greenhouse gases? Should emissions be calculated on a GNP, per capita, or some other basis? Should a country's forests and other carbon dioxide "sinks" be counted as "negative emissions"? The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change points out that "the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries." The developed countries have contributed about 86% of the cumulative world total of fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide emissions to date. But historical emissions occurred in ignorance of the consequences of the greenhouse problem. Are current generations responsible for their country's unwitting mistakes of the past? What's more, policies devised now can only affect present and future emissions, not those of the past. On the other hand, since the developed nations have achieved their prosperity without concern for the build-up of GHGs, why should the developing nations now have to face these extra constraints without international economic assistance? The Convention also states that emissions of all GHGs are important and should be included in emission reduction plans. Ideally, then, all greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs, and so on - should be included in a "responsibility index". Considering all GHGs as part of one overall reduction target would be cost effective, as making the first, small reductions of each gas would be cheaper than large-scale reductions in just one gas. But this advantage must be balanced against the fact that measuring emissions of methane and some other GHGs is extremely difficult. Because there is much better information about emissions of carbon dioxide, by far the most important greenhouse gas, it would be more practical to develop an index that only requires the monitoring of CO2 reductions. However, countries for whom CO2 emissions form a large percentage of total GHG emissions would be penalised by such an index, whereas those for whom methane (typically developing countries) or CFCs (industrialised countries) are particularly important would benefit. Current emissions of GHGs can be expressed on either a per-country or per-capita basis. Since about 55% of current GHG emissions come from the industrialised countries, which contain less than 25% of the world's population, these countries have high per-capita emissions. So too do many small oil-producing states and countries with high rates of deforestation. The largest developing countries, though contributing a significant percentage of global emissions, disappear entirely from a list of the 50 largest per-capita emitters. The Climate Convention notes "that per capita emissions in the developing counties are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs". A related issue is whether or not emissions caused by people with low incomes should be classified as "survival" emissions, which could not easily be reduced, and those from wealthier people as "luxury" emissions, which could. Scientific uncertainties about present emissions complicate efforts to allocate responsibility. The main problem concerns natural GHG sources (such as plants and animals) and sinks (notably forests and the oceans). Without a better understanding of these natural processes, it is impossible to be sure that only man-made emissions are being measured. Current data are either specific to local sites and climatic regions or not well documented. Data on land use and changes in land use, particularly deforestation in the tropics, are frequently disputed. As a result, it is easier to calculate gross emissions than net emissions (gross emissions minus absorption by sinks). Despite these problems, the major rankings of GHG emissions are based on CO2 emissions from both deforestation and industrial sources, as well as on methane and CFCs emissions (but only CFC-11 and CFC-12). Existing rankings reflect these complex scientific and political issues. The best-known rankings are by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Shown in the table below, the rankings add up each country's annual emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and CFCs. WRI and IPCC differ only over how each gas is "weighted" according to "potency" and atmospheric lifetime. The weighting used in the IPCC ranking is the Global Warming potential (GWP), while WRI uses the Greenhouse Forcing Contribution (GFC). CSE uses a much different approach that emphasises per-capita emissions. It calculates natural sinks for carbon dioxide and methane on a global basis, allocates a share to each country according to its population, and then determines whether a country emits more than this sink allocation. As there are no natural sinks for CFCs, all CFC emissions are included. Notes: * Percentages show the country's share in global emissions. ** German emissions data in WRI and in IPCC include both the former Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. The CSE data consist of only the Federal Republic of Germany. For further reading: A. Agarwal and S.

They have been outlined at numerous conferences specifically addressing the environmental concerns of developing countries. The priorities of developing countries vis a vis climate change have also been addressed at major political conferences, including the Ninth Conference of Heads of State of the Non-Aligned States,1 the Twentieth South Pacific Forum,2 and the Langkawi meeting of the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth,3 all held in 1989, and the Second Ministerial Conference of Developing Countries on Environment and Development, held in April 1992.4 Other statements, such as the Caracas Declaration of the Group of 77,5 the Amazon Declaration,6 and the Declaration of Brasilia,7 did not directly address climate change, but they did highlight the general environmental concerns of developing countries. The declarations and statements adopted by developing-country confer-ences consistently feature the following four principles: Principle 1: International cooperation on climate change is essential, but industrialized countries should accept the main responsibility. All nations must take action to minimize and respond to climate change and other environmental challenges. However, industrialized countries have been the leading cause of climate change. They also have greater financial and technological resources for responding to the problem. Consequently, industrialized countries must shoulder most of the burden. This principle is also known as the principle of common but differentiated responsibility of states. Principle 2: Industrialized countries should transfer funds and technology to help developing countries respond to climate change. Due to both geography and poverty, developing countries are more vulnerable to the likely impacts of climate change. Arid regions and low-lying coastal and island states are at the greatest risk. Given their superior resources and their role in causing climate change, industrialized countries should help poorer countries. They should transfer environmentally sound technologies on preferential, non-commercial terms. They should also contribute additional funds, over and beyond existing development aid, so that developing countries can better respond to the negative impacts of climate change. Principle 3: Sustainable development strategies can alleviate poverty while minimizing environmental damage. In developing countries, poverty is a leading cause of environmental degradation. Short-term economic development remains a more pressing concern for poor countries than long-term environmental protection. Measures to address environmental problems such as climate change must take this into account by promoting sustainable development. International action on climate change must not interfere with the sovereign right of states to exploit their own natural resources. Principle 4: Climate negotiations require the full involvement of developing countries. Because climate change is a global issue, all states of the world must participate in the negotiations. Funds must be made available on a bilateral or multilateral basis to ensure that developing countries are able to participate fully in international climate change negotiations. These four principles strongly influenced the Climate Convention negotiations . . . Repeated consistently in statements adopted by developing country conferences, these principles reflect a consensus among developing countries. They were also addressed in conferences with universal participation and by the United Nations General Assembly.8 The needs and concerns of developing countries received special attention during the Climate Convention negotiations and special funds were established to finance the participation of developing country respresentatives. The INC accepted that states should take action based on their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities". While industrialized countries also recognized the need for offering financial and technical assistance, there was disagreement among the Convention negotiators over terms for technology transfer and the levels and mechanisms of funding. and were to a large extent incorporated into the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, the Climate Convention establishes different levels of commitment for developed and developing countries. It recognizes the need for sustainable development and requires developed states to provide new and additional funds to developing countries. It also encourages the transfer of technology, although there is no commitment regarding preferential and non-commercial terms. The Convention defines a financial mechanism to administer funding and technology transfer. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was entrusted with the operation of this mechanism on an interim basis. Notes: 1 Held in Belgrade (Yugoslavia) in September 1989.

Reducing net greenhouse gas emissions significantly will require the diversion of resources away from other activities. Money spent on a policy to reduce emissions and enhance carbon "sinks" cannot be spent on education, health care, or other environmental programmes. Consequently, our economic well-being would be reduced (setting aside the benefits of reduced climate change impacts). The cost of a climate change policy is defined by economists as the monetary value of this reduction in well-being, or as the compensating payment that would be necessary to make society as well off with the policy as without it. A policy for reducing net emissions should achieve its objective at the minimum possible cost. To be cost-effective, an abatement policy must be comprehensive, reducing not only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions but the emissions of other greenhouse gases as well. The reduction of each individual gas must also be achieved at the lowest possible cost. For example, CO2 emissions can be reduced by various means: banning the use of coal, mandating energy-efficiency standards, imposing petrol taxes, and so on. But while each of these policies would reduce emissions, some would do so more efficiently than others. Most economists believe that economic instruments such as carbon taxes and tradable emission entitlements would be more cost-effective than regulatory policies (fact sheets 230 and 231). Estimates of how much it would cost to reduce CO2 emissions vary . . . There is even disagreement about the cost of reducing current emissions by just one ton. Some analysts believe that this cost would be negative because it could be achieved simply by getting rid of distortions in energy markets. Others believe that if it were possible to reduce energy consumption at a negative cost, it would already have been done. There are also differing views about a variety of important variables: how quickly emissions would increase in the absence of a climate change policy, what improvements in energy efficiency could be expected to occur independently of price changes, how easily fossil fuels can be substituted for one another, whether and how other energy sources can be substituted for fossil fuels, and the likely availability and cost of new energy technologies that do not emit CO2. With all these uncertainties, it is not surprising that there are also different views about the long-run costs of cutting net CO2 emissions. ... but economists generally agree that the cost of making rapid or substantial reductions in net CO2 emissions would be high. Estimates of the costs vary widely. As an example, a 1989 Manne-Richels study indicates that the US would have to sacrifice 0.8-4.0% of its GNP by the year 2100 to reduce its CO2 emissions by 77% compared to the level that would result from current trends (or by 20% relative to 1985�s emission level). For the purpose of comparison, all the environmental regulations adopted by the US in the 1970s are together estimated to have reduced US national output by about 2.6%.1 The error bounds for such cost estimates are large. Most of the studies so far completed on the costs of reducing net emissions assume that the adopted policy would be efficient. If this were not the case, costs could be several times higher. On the other hand, policies that abate CO2 emissions would also reduce other harmful emissions, and this additional benefit is not considered by these studies. Another source of error is the reliance on assumptions about future technologies. Important assumptions must also be made about the ease of substituting one energy source for another and the possibility of price-independent improvements in energy efficiency. An OECD study shows that changes in these two assumptions can change the estimated cost by 100 per cent.2 Similar economic principles would also apply to policies for reducing the emissions of other greenhouse gases and for enhancing sinks. As with CO2, the marginal cost3 of abating CFCs, nitrous oxide, and so on would rise as a higher and higher percentage is reduced. The same principle also applies to creating or enhancing sinks for absorbing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. For example, policies that remove uneconomic incentives for cutting forests without replanting them would reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at little or no cost (the cost is thought to range from US$2.30 per ton for Brazil to US$15 for Indonesia). Creation of additional carbon sinks through reforestation, however, would be much more costly, particularly if applied to land that has alternative productive uses; estimates for the US rise to over US$45 per ton of absorbed carbon.4 The total cost of reducing emissions will be lower if there is international cooperation. Since the costs of incremental reductions in emissions increase with the level of abatement, the total costs of achieving a particular global target would decline as more and more countries commit to reductions. The same OECD study cited above shows that, for the industrialized countries, the costs of reducing emissions would be about five times higher if they proceed on their own than it would be if there is a global agreement. This higher cost would also impose additional indirect costs on non-OECD countries, because fuel-exporting countries would lose income and developing countries would lose trade opportunities. For policy-makers, the clear conclusion is that modest efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions are economically justified. The foregoing economic analysis suggests that small reductions in emissions and small improvements in sinks would not be very costly. However, the incremental costs of large reductions in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would be large - unless better technologies are developed. Given our knowledge of the benefits of such policies, it seems that small reductions in emissions and small improvements in sinks would be justified. However, these activities should be achieved efficiently using economic instruments, and they should be coordinated internationally. Such policies should be supplemented by research into new technologies that would help to reduce the costs of reversing man-made climate change in the long run. For further reading: P. Hoeller, A.

The population is expected to rise from 47.6 million in 1985 to 66.7 million by the year 2000, making Egypt the fifteenth most populated country in the world. This expanding population will remain concentrated in a narrow strip along the fertile banks of the Nile river and delta. The increasing population density of this area will reduce Egypt's flexibility and options for responding to climate change impacts. Egypt does not grow enough food to feed its current population. Although the Nile River valley contains fertile land, most of Egypt is arid. The government is attempting to convert some of the desert to agriculture, but this new farmland is relatively inefficient and water-intensive. Meanwhile, the country's prime farmland is under intense pressure from the housing needs of an expanding population; this has led to an annual loss of 30-50 thousand feddan over the last 20 years. The net result is that the annual increase in population (2.8%) exceeds the annual increase in agricultural production (2.6%). Egypt's imports of food absorb most of its foreign currency, which is therefore not available for development. If climate change makes Egypt drier or warmer, pressure on agriculture - much of which is dependent on irrigation - would intensify. The country's water resources are limited. Egypt relies on the Nile for 90% of its water needs, but it cannot control the quantity and quality of this water, which depend on activities upstream. Although it is one of the world's major rivers, the Nile's average annual discharge into the sea is just 86 billion cubic metres, while the Zaire, for example, discharges some 1,400 billion cubic metres. The Nile loses a considerable amount of water to swamp areas and to evaporation during its 3000-kilometre course through the arid lands of Northern Sudan and southern Egypt. When the remaining water reaches its territory, Egypt consumes 48 billion cubic metres of the Nile annually, but, as with Ethiopia and Sudan - the other large-scale users of the Nile and its tributaries - its demand will increase along with population and development. Competition among these states for water could escalate even without climate change. If climate change results in increased warming, droughts, and evaporation, reduced flow in the Nile would further exacerbate Egypt's problems, and the country could face an explosive situation. Egypt's Mediterranean Coast and the Nile Delta may be vulnerable to sea-level rise. The most likely result of climate change is a rise in global average temperature, which would in turn cause sea-levels to rise by up to one metre by the year 2100, inundating coastlines (fact sheet 102). Scientists are unsure how a general sea-level rise would impact Egypt's coastline. Some argue that the Nile Delta would "float" upwards with rising sea-levels, while others suggest that the Mediterranean may or may not share in a global sea-level rise. What is clear, though, is that if sea-water inundation did occur, densely-inhabited areas of the Delta would be affected, leading to the displacement of people and the loss of fertile land. If instead the delta "rises" with the sea, new problems with water flow may occur; already, the Aswan High Dam and other river control schemes along the Nile have reduced the flow of water and sediments to coastal areas, depriving them of material to mitigate coastal erosion. While Egypt is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, it contributes just a fraction of 1% of mankind's total greenhouse gas emissions. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), in 1988 Egypt emitted 18,617,000 tons of carbon dioxide (mankind's leading greenhouse gas) by burning fossil fuels, representing 0.34% of total worldwide fossil-fuel emissions. Per-capita carbon dioxide emissions were 0.36 tons, compared with 5.44 for the US and 2.13 for Japan. National figures for other greenhouse gases are more difficult to calculate, but Egypt also emits small quantities of methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases. National environmental policies are coordinated by the Environmental Affairs Agency. The Agency was established ten years ago and has a small budget of some E�8.4 million (US$3.5 million). The Agency pursues a variety of policies of relevance to climate change. For example, it has supported research into gasoline and diesel engine motors to determine the best parameters for CO2 and other emissions. The agency is also seeking Egypt's compliance with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer (ozone-depleting CFCs are also greenhouse gases - see fact sheet 224); by 1989, the national consumption of CFCs had been reduced from 8,000 tonnes annually to 5,000. The Agency is also helping to increase carbon "sinks" by promoting the creation of new public parks, planting more trees along the main roads, and establishing green belts around all of the big cities. Egyptian society is increasingly aware of environmental issues, including climate change. Serious research work and projects on climatic issues are being pursued by Egyptian universities and institutes, most notably Cairo University. Seminars, workshops, and meetings on climate change and other environmental issues are also held regularly. For example, in January 1992 the US Environment Protection Agency, the University of Colorado, and Cairo University held a climate change workshop, and Cairo University held a seminar on the Nile Delta. Meanwhile, a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are investing their energies in environmental issues. In the political arena, the parliament has debated environmental issues and promulgated several environment-related laws, and a Green political party has been formed. The Egyptian media is paying more and more attention to environmental issues such as climate change. The most important example is probably the Weekly Environment Page published every Sunday in Al Ahram Daily, but other daily and weekly newspapers also feature regular articles and interviews on environmental subjects. A weekly programme on environment is broadcast on an Egyptian radio network, and a new weekly television programme called "Environmental and the People" is being planned by the editor of the Al Ahram Daily' Weekly Environment Page. In addition, religious television programmes often deal with environmental issues and the emphasis that the Koran places on environmental balance.

On the initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization WMO), and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), scientists from 29 developed and developing countries met from 9-15 October to assess the impact of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide on the world�s climate. Follow-up workshops were held in 1987 in Villach and in Bellagio, Italy. As essentially scientific gatherings, the Villach Conference and the two workshops did not make concrete recommendations for a legal approach to climate change. However, drawing on their scientific evaluations, they did offer politicians and lawyers some general proposals for action. The Villach Conference urged further research into both the causes and effects of climate change. The conference statement1 presented a consensus view on the current basic scientific understanding of the issues. The consensus was that, despite major remaining uncertainties, there was sufficient scientific understanding of the climate change phenomenon to justify studies of new policies. Long-term monitoring and interpretation of causes and effects of climate change should also be undertaken. Research into the impacts of climate change should start immediately, possibly in the form of pilot projects in selected regions of the world. Governments and funding agencies should support climate research. The statement also recommended that the conclusions of the Villach Conference be made widely available, thus contributing to public understanding of the climate change issue. Follow-up meetings should be held to continue the work started at the conference and to consider the possibility of a climate treaty. Two workshops were held in 1987 to follow up on the scientific consensus reached at the Villach Conference. A science-oriented workshop was held in Villach from 28 September to 2 October, and a workshop for policy makers was held in Bellagio from 9-13 November. The two workshops produced a joint report2 recommending that immediate steps be taken: to limit greenhouse gas emissions by promoting implementation of the Montreal Protocol and adopting new energy and deforestation policies; to limit the impact of sea-level rise by elaborating river and coastal zone policies based on studies of the vulnerability of particular areas; and to promote understanding of the greenhouse effect through the use of management tools and monitoring and research programmes. At the Bellagio workshop of 1987, the scientific community offered an early estimate of the rate of global warming. The estimate for how much the earth�s surface may warm was based on a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide.

Scientists have discovered that the amount of methane in the atmosphere began to rise two or three centuries ago. They now believe that current methane emissions will account for over 15% of man-induced climate change over a 100-year time frame (because methane has a relatively short life-time in the atmosphere, the impact of current emissions will be less over longer time frames). In descending order of importance, the human activities that result in methane emissions are livestock farming, production of fossil fuels, wet rice cultivation, biomass burning, landfills, and domestic sewage.1 Domestically raised cattle, deer, buffalo, sheep, and goats contribute 15-20% of the methane emissions caused by human activities. Much of the food eaten by these hoofed animals cannot be digested until it has been fermented. This process takes place in the part of the digestive system called the rumen. Amongst the various micro-organisms found in the rumen are bacteria that produce methane as a by-product of the fermentation process. Under certain conditions, additional methane is also released from the animals� wastes. Cows account for around 70% of the methane from domestic animals. Researchers with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) base their forecasts of methane emissions on estimates that worldwide meat and dairy production will increase by more than 45% by the year 2025. With demand for red meat and dairy products static or falling in the industrialized world, most of this increase it is expected to occur in the developing countries as incomes and populations grow. New technologies can both raise the productivity of cattle and lower their methane output. Most cattle are raised on poor quality fodder and on land that cannot support other types of farming. The resulting deficiencies in various nutrients encourage the production of methane. Studies have shown that supplementing a cow�s diet with substances such as urea (a source of ammonia) increases the animal�s ability to digest food. This has two beneficial effects. First, by reducing the amount of fermentation taking place during digestion it can cut methane emissions per unit of forage by 25-75%. Second, by raising the productivity of each animal it allows dairy cows to produce more milk and beef cattle to fatten faster. This means that the same amount of market demand can be satisfied by smaller herds. In some countries, especially in Latin America, this might confer the additional benefit of reducing the clearing of forests to create land for cattle ranching (deforestation increases atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide). Pilot projects in India have had impressive results . . . Adding various supplements to cattle feed has reduced methane emissions per unit of digested food by 30-50%. Furthermore, thanks to improved feeding practices, draft cows used as beasts of burden became stronger and breeding cows were able to produce more calves (the interval between births was reduced by almost half, from 24 months to 12-15 months). As a result, fewer breeding cows were needed to maintain the same herd size and a smaller number of draft animals could do the same amount of work. India�s National Dairy Development Board estimates that the total number of cattle in the country could be reduced from 300 million to 120 million with no adverse effect upon production. In addition to reducing methane emissions, this would also increase economic efficiency. ... but persuading farmers to adopt the new technology may sometimes be difficult. Disseminating information on new techniques is particularly difficult in the agricultural sector because of the large number of farmers who must be reached and the relatively poor communications in rural areas. Farmers also tend to be highly risk averse. What�s more, the new foodstuffs will cost an Indian farmer almost twice as much as the old ones and, although they raise productivity, the initial upfront investment can be a strong deterrent. Finally, while the ammonia contained in the new products improves digestion, it can also be dangerous to livestock if wrongly administered. In some countries efforts to reduce the number of cows could conflict with certain social needs. Because richer farmers can more easily afford the cash outlays required for the improved new feeds, they are more likely than poorer farmers to benefit. This could lead to the loss of land and livelihood amongst subsistence farmers. In many countries fewer cows might also conflict with the goal of families to own at least one cow as a secure source of essential nutrients in an often vegetarian diet, as a source of fuel (cattle dung is an increasingly important fuel as timber has become more scarce), and for the status that ownership imparts. Furthermore, cows have religious value in some cultures and frequently form an important part of a dowry or bride-price. For Further Reading: R.A.

Thailand is extremely vulnerable to potential climate change impacts and has a strong interest in supporting international response strategies. Scientists believe that mankind's emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to cause the earth's surface to warm by 1.5-4.5 C over the next 100 years. Although the temperature change experienced by Thailand could be less than this global average figure, any additional warming in a humid, tropical country could damage agriculture. Crops yields would probably be reduced by the additional heat stress and by reduced moisture levels and soil quality. At the same time, scientists expect sea-levels to rise by some 65 cm by the end of the next century. Much of Thailand's most economically productive land, including the capital city Bangkok, is situated on low lying plains and would be exposed to inundation. Farm land, tourist beaches, infrastructure, industrial projects, and housing areas would be threatened. The country might lack the necessary resources to respond or adapt to rising seas by, for example, building costly sea walls. Likewise, if poor people lose their jobs or their land, they may not have the money to relocate or to seek alternative employment. (See fact sheets 101, 102, 104, and 121.) Sustainable development would help to control the country's rising greenhouse gas emissions. With the Thai economy growing at the remarkable rate of 7% annually in recent years, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases are on the rise. While Thailand will continue to pursue economic growth, the government recognizes the importance of environ-mentally sustainable development. To reduce its emissions while simultaneously realizing other economic and environmental benefits, Thailand will need to emphasize economic efficiency. Per capita emissions vary widely among industrialized countries, suggesting that development can take place without necessarily increasing pollution or greenhouse gas emissions. The Government has responded to this challenge by setting up a National Committee on Long-term Global Environmental Issues, which recently undertook a study on changes in land use and energy consumption and their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Thailand is supporting international efforts to reduce global emissions. The country is responsible for around 1.4% or 1.5% of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions.1 Since Thailand's emissions are just a small fraction of global emissions, its own reduction efforts will not be effective if they occur in isolation. However, as a signatory to the 1992 Climate Convention, Thailand has signalled its intention to support international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Improved agricultural methods would reduce Thailand's emissions of methane. Most of Thailand's past greenhouse gas emissions have come from agricultural sources (including forestry). The largest man-made source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is expected to cause around 15% of climate change over the next century, is wet rice cultivation. Of the estimated 72 million tonnes of rice generated by the world's paddy fields in 1989, Thailand accounted for about 5.7 million tonnes, or 8% of the total (surpassed only by China and India). About 20% of Thailand's land area is dedicated to rice production. Industrial emissions are beginning to replace deforestation as Thailand's leading contribution to net carbon dioxide emissions. During the late 1970s Thailand lost about 3% of its forests every single year. This rate of shrinkage fell to about 2.4% in the early 1980s but still resulted in the annual destruction of some 379,000 hectares. In February 1988 the government imposed a logging ban and the rate dropped to 0.3%. Meanwhile, a government study has shown that CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have risen steadily as the demand for energy has grown. Energy consumption increased by 4.6% annually in 1981-1986 and 8.4% annually in 1986-1988, and it is expected to continue rising at an annual rate of 6% through the year 2011. The ratio of emissions from deforestation compared to the burning of fossil fuels declined from 13.7 in 1979 to 2.2 in 1988. This pattern suggests that, while Thailand's overall CO2 emissions are presently falling as deforestation slows, they will increase again as industrialization expands. This U-shaped emissions curve could be typical of many countries that are making the transition from economies based on natural resources such as forests to economies driven by industrial production. The country's net CO2 emissions could be partly stabilized through a tree-planting programme. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that an average hectare of forest can absorb 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. This means that if the government were to plant 160,000 hectares (1 million rai) of forest annually, by 2030 the new trees would have absorbed 300 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. However, nearly eight million people have already settled on land which was formerly covered by forests, and massive reforestation would interfere with these settlements. To be successful new plantings will have to serve as a source of income and employment for the rural poor. The Thai National Energy Authority has estimated that improved energy efficiency could save some 10% of industrial and domestic energy use. Developing countries tend to use far less energy per capita than do industrialized countries. However, they are often able to achieve percentage energy savings that are equal to or even greater than those of developed countries since much of their equipment is so much less efficient to start with. Greater use of modern energy-efficient technologies, such as florescent light bulbs (which are 70-85% more efficient than normal bulbs), and the development of new technologies must therefore be a priority. Moving towards low- and non-carbon fuels is also important. Although Thailand has limited reserves of its own natural gas (which is less carbon intensive than oil or coal), additional supplies could be imported from neighbouring Burma and Malaysia. Cooperation with Laos on hydropower projects and the development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power are also attractive options.

By 1990, numerous international conferences had issued urgent calls for a binding global treaty addressing the problem of climate change. The United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization WMO) responded by establishing an intergovernmental working group to prepare for treaty negotiations.1 Meeting in September 1990 to discuss the format for the negotiations, the group proposed that all negotiations under UN auspices take place within a single forum.2 The UN General Assembly confirmed this proposal in 1990 and set up the INC to draft a framework convention, as well as any related legal instruments it considered necessary.3 The INC was given the formidable task of having an "effective" Convention ready in time for the Rio "Earth Summit" in June 1992. The UN General Assembly established a Trust Fund to cover the costs of the INC's work as well as a Special Voluntary Fund to enable developing countries to participate. The INC became the central forum for the international effort to develop a climate treaty, with some 150 states and numerous intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations participating in the negotiations. The Climate Convention was negotiated during five sessions between February 1991 and May 1992. This rapid progress was possible in part because the ground had been prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose First Assessment Report served as a basis for the INC's work, as well as by international meetings such as the Second World Climate Conference. The treaty was drafted by two working groups established by the INC at its first session. The groups met in parallel and submitted draft treaty elements to the plenary. Working Group I elaborated elements relating to commitments, while Working Group II focused on legal and institutional mechanisms. The negotiators had to decide whether the Convention should contain specific implementation mechanisms and commitments for limiting emissions or only basic obligations and general principles. Some states argued that specific emissions-control measures could be included later in protocols, as was done with the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol. Others, fearing that such protocols would be long in materialising, urged that concrete measures be incorporated into the Convention itself. The question of different standards for different categories of countries was also discussed. Many developing countries were prepared to agree to specific commitments as long as they applied primarily to industrialised countries. The issue of emissions targets for greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (C02), was vigorously debated. Although the IPCC report had concluded that a 60-80% reduction of CO2 emissions would be needed to stabilise atmospheric concentrations, the strongest proposal considered by the INC was to freeze CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. This proposal was put forward by the European Community and supported by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and by some EFTA states. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some Nordic states supported stabilisation of emissions of all GHGs not controlled by the Montreal Protocol (notably CFCs), while the US and the oil-producing OPEC states opposed the inclusion of any specific emission targets in the Convention. (The final agreed text refers to the desirability of developed countries returning to earlier emissions levels but does not specify a firm target.) There was also some discussion about how emission targets, if any, should be defined, and about the possibility of allowing groups of states to jointly implement such targets. There was general agreement on the need for financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Many developing countries pushed for an obligation to provide financial assistance from "new and additional sources" to prevent money simply being diverted from existing funding sources. They also argued that technology should be provided on preferential, non-commercial terms. Some industrialised countries, however, did not want to be pinned down to such commitments. The negotiators had to choose between establishing a new financial mechanism for the Convention or using the existing Global Environment Facility (GEF). The first option, prompted by concerns over the GEF and the way it is administered, was supported by virtually all developing countries. Some industrialised countries, however, argued that the creation of a new institution would generate additional and unnecessary bureaucracy. In the end, it was agreed that the GEF would operate the Convention's financial mechanism on an interim basis and be accountable to the Conference of the Parties. By agreeing to compromise solutions for these contentious issues, the INC negotiators were able to adopt the Climate Change Convention on 9 May 1992. The fifth and last session of INC was held in two parts separated by a few weeks to enable states to complete the work. In most areas of disagreement, solutions were found somewhere between the initial opposing viewpoints. After being adopted by the INC, the Convention was signed at UNCED by 154 states and the EC, demonstrating a wide acceptance of the INC's work. Additional states have signed since then, and a growing number have ratified. The treaty will enter into force three months after the 50th ratification, and within one year of the entry into force the first session of the Conference of the Parties will be held. During the current interim phase the INC is preparing for the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.4 It will be assisted by an interim secretariat in Geneva. The INC held its sixth session in Geneva on 7-10 December 1992, its seventh in New York on 15-20 March 1993,5 and has scheduled its eighth session in Geneva on 16-27 August 1993. Until the Convention enters into force, probably in early 1994, the INC will continue preparing for the communication and review of information as called for by the treaty, monitoring the interim arrangements involving the IPCC and the GEF, and overseeing technical and financial support to developing countries. The INC will be dissolved when the Conference of the Parties first meets and begins the lengthy process of implementing the Convention. For further reading: Bodansky, D.
