(2136 words) CREATIVE DESTRUCTION IN GLOBAL PUBLIC NETWORKS (988 words) CopyrightTELECOM PERSPECTIVES via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   PLAYING FOLLOW THE LEADERIN OSSBy:Gayle GaddisToday's operations support systems vendors need a role model. Those vendorswho have taken the largest share of the OSS market in the past--most ofthem network equipment vendors like AT&T, Bellcore, Nortel, Siemens,Ericsson, and Alcatel--have suddenly found themselves in a changed OSSmarket, one that values service over technology, one that expectsguarantees, and one that does not need to be told what its needs are. Forthese traditional vendors--many of whom still believe that providing thetechnology is the same as providing service--a new market strategy must befound. They could develop this new strategy on their own, but that would bereinventing the wheel; Andersen Consulting (along with some smallerindependent network management vendors) has already begun to set theparadigm that OSS vendors will need to follow into the year 2000.Certainly it would seem that Andersen, which has entered the telecom marketthrough the side door (i.e., business consulting), would have little toteach AT&T, which practically founded the U.S. telecom market and has thelargest installed base of operations support systems to date. Yet AT&T,like some of its fellow manufacturers, still suffers from anequipment-based mentality that does not encompass service arrangements likerisk-sharing or joint marketing with customers. Andersen, on the otherhand, has pioneered some of these arrangements for OSS. Vendors like AT&Talso suffer (although AT&T less than some other OSS vendors) from anattachment to the concept of management systems, rather than frameworks.Alcatel still wants to sell the customer a box, where newer softwarecompanies and integrators like OSI and TCSI want to sell the customer afoundation upon which applications can be built (and thus are not sellingthe customer any applications it does not need). Essentially, the OSSmarket is moving in directions dictated by customers, and no longer byvendors. And now that AT&T et al. can no longer tell customers what theyshould need for OSS, they would do well to follow the lead ofcustomer-driven players like Andersen.Changing the RulesIt is the OSS customers themselves--the local and global service providers,whether wireline, wireless, or cable--that have instigated thetransformation of OSS, by beginning to demand the same types of guaranteeson performance and delivery from their vendors that end customers aredemanding from them. Until only a year or two ago, most telecomcarriers--and particularly wireline carriers, many of whom already hadyears of engineering expertise upon which to rely--did a substantial amountof their OSS development or customization in-house, thus reducing the needfor vendors to be concerned with customized approaches to OSS. Recently,however, most of these carriers doing substantial portions of OSS workinternally have begun seeking outside sources, not only for systems, butfor customized applications. BellSouth, for instance, is now in transitionfrom having done 90% of OSS work internally to doing only 60% internallyand 40% on a contracted basis. With the drive to improve bottom lines,carriers are seeking outside solutions in order to reduce the cost of OSSdevelopment on the books. Given this fact, carriers are very sensitive tocost issues for OSS, and price has become one of the key points on whichcarriers are demanding guarantees, especially in light of the hidden coststhat had become a frequent occurrence as OSS contracts became morecomplex.   BT, for instance, found out first-hand that certain vendors would rathertell the customer what it wants to hear about time and cost than risklosing business by giving an accurate, if costly, estimate. BT purchasedproducts with the understanding that they represented a full, end-to-endOSS solution, only to hear later from the vendor that additional equipmentor software would be required, thus adding both cost and time to theimplementation. Ultimately, the vendor lost business by telling thecustomer what it wanted to hear, and increasingly, all OSS vendors withthis mentality will similarly be losing key clients. Stentor faced similarsituations with vendors, specifically with vendors who began to neglectcustomer service once they had established a strong, embedded position inthe market (again, traditional manufacturers like AT&T and Bellcore, andcomputing vendors like IBM and Digital are the chief culprits). As aresult, Stentor is now in the process of introducing supplierreviews--which it characterizes as like a report card--to keep vendors ontheir toes and let them know when service is beginning to slip. Suchstringent attention to service, cost, and time commitments will become thenorm as the decade wears on. Carriers today have had to become far tooservice-conscious and technology-savvy in their own customer contracts tosimply accept what they are given by vendors.Setting an ExampleIn order to meet these newly stringent requirements, OSS vendors mustsignificantly change the ways in which they do business, devising specificschemes by means of which they can provide customized service andguarantees to customers without compromising their own economies of scaleor their bottom lines. One such scheme is risk-sharing, which can takedifferent forms but nearly always results in increased customersatisfaction. One form might simply involve project time-tables. If thevendor completes the project (satisfactorily, of course) earlier than theagreed-upon date, it receives a bonus. Completing the project later thanthe agreed-upon date results in a penalty. GTE is beginning to require suchagreements with its OSS vendors, with an eye to the strict timetables underwhich it plans to complete its business process re-engineering. Anotherversion of risk-sharing can result in a bigger payback for both carrier andvendor alike, but also involves greater risk--that of joint development andjoint marketing of an OSS product or platform. It is in this latter formthat Andersen has taken a lead and provides a strong example for vendorsthat are grappling with ways to both increase customer service and staylean in the OSS market.   Co-development and marketing of a product not only allows customers morecontrol over the OSS development process at a point at which they wouldotherwise feel control was being lost (with the cuts in funds for internaldevelopment), it also increases customers' trust in the vendor. Under othercircumstances, the vendor has a perfect opportunity to resell anapplication developed for a specific customer many times over. This makesuse of the customer's specs and expertise, but cuts the customer out of theadditional profits. While a great way for vendors to create economies ofscale, it has angered some customers. Because Andersen works so closelywith customers, however, getting to know their business organizationsintimately, it has recognized hot buttons like these, and hence hascapitalized on strategies (like risk-sharing) which avoid them. Andersenhas a steadily growing list of cost- and profit-sharing agreements withhigh-profile carriers: Pacific Bell, Bell Atlantic, and BellSouth amongthem (Andersen in fact does business with all the U.S. RBOCs; BellSouth wasthe last holdout).   Similarly, smaller, independent vendors of OSS software and serviceshave something to teach the traditional vendors as well. By necessity theseproviders have a strong customer service ethic like that of Andersen, onlyon a smaller scale. When one large carrier makes up a full 10%-20% of thecustomer base--as is the case with some smaller vendors--clearly everythingpossible must be done to keep that customer happy. These small vendorsoffer another lesson as well to vendors like Siemens or Alcatel: how tobuild economies of scale in an increasingly customized OSS market. Theanswer is in the development of management frameworks, rather than thetraditional boxes that these more established vendors are accustomed toselling.   OSI, for instance, a vendor which is just beginning to make a name foritself in OSS, has already begun to capture a significant portion of theemerging market for wireless OSS. This is not because it built a systemspecific to the management of wireless networks, but because it built aplatform on which wireless management applications could be built, as couldapplications for legacy integration on wireline networks, or applicationsfor emerging network technologies, like AIN (OSI's NetExpert platform hasin fact been used for several AIN implementations already). To address thesame variety of applications, Ericsson would require that a customerimplement several different versions of the same system, and some othervendors might require multiple different systems and still not be able toaddress emerging applications such as PCS or AIN. (AT&T's ability to dothis particular OSS juggling act is still in question; the slow progress ofits OneVision platform suggests that this capability may be down theroad.)At a Standstill?While Andersen, OSI, and a few other vendors have taken these steps towardincreasing customer involvement and satisfaction, they constitute aminority in doing so. Exhibit 1 illustrates the position of various OSSvendors vis vis increased levels of customer service and willingness topartner with the customer through risk-sharing arrangements (i.e., thewillingness to actually put their money where their mouths are, rather thansimply calling any contract a "partnership"). The cluster of vendorsscoring low on both fronts should question their long-term viability in theOSS market; there is no doubt that their customers are. And long-termviability is nearly as important to OSS customers as customer serviceitself. These vendors should take their cues from players like Andersen,which itself will undoubtedly be in the market for a very long time.Illustration(s):Illustration: Evolution of OSS Vendors in Terms of Customer OrientationSource: Northern Business Information.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM PERSPECTIVES via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   CELLULAR DATA ...READY TO TAKE OFF AT LAST?By:Mirva AnttilaThe wireless data market has not taken off as quickly as many industryexperts predicted. The rapid growth of cellular voice subscribership todate has not led to a similar expansion of cellular data usage.   Cellular data users (both circuit- and packet-switched) represent asmall portion of total cellular voice subscribership. Despite anticipatedgrowth over the next few years, cellular data users will remain a smallsubset of the larger cellular voice subscriber population (see Exhibit 2).Reasons for slower-than-expected development of cellular data are numerous:the existence of multiple wireless data platforms (making it difficult andconfusing for customers to choose the right one); the unreliability ofcircuit-switched data transmission; lack of standards for Cellular DigitalPacket Data (CDPD) software development; non-ubiquitous data networkcoverage; clumsy, heavy end-user devices (some with no communicationscapability and some with awkward handwriting recognition technologies);incompatible modems; high-priced service; and a lack of cooperation in theindustry.   Moreover, cellular data service differs greatly from cellular voice, andthe two services simply cannot be promoted in the same manner. The salescycle for wireless data solutions is much longer than the sales cycle forvoice users. Most of today's data users are corporations that mustcost-justify expensive new technology, with the result that the technologymust live up to its promise. At the same time, both users and cellular datasalespeople must be educated about the need for, and utility of, cellulardata solutions.What Cellular Data Users Need To KnowThe following items are the minimum requirements for cellular data users:  -- Ubiquity of Service: Interconnect to wireline tele-phone networks orto (other) packet-switched networks; use with a variety of termin-als;adaptability to current in-house protocols (systems).  -- Coverage: In-building capabilities.  -- Portability: Small, light-weight terminals; reasonable battery life.  -- Features: Voice backup; privacy and security; wide range of datacapabilities and applications.  -- Price: Low pricing for ser-vices and terminals.  -- Circuit-switched Data Problems and SolutionsHaving been created for voice communications, analog cellular networks arevulnerable to interference that causes fading and breakup, and that canresult in dropped calls. For voice communications this is irritating, butfor data communications these problems are fatal since the signal maybecome so corrupted by interference that some information is lost. Thesuccess rate on each data transfer attempt is estimated to be only about55-60%, and if the user moves during a data call, normal circuit-switcheddata transfer will be disrupted. Digital signals convert the analog waveform into a numerical code (1 or 0) and are therefore more resistant toerrors. When signal corruption does occur, error-correction logic at thereceiving end can often reconstruct the corrupted signal. The digitalenvironment also allows the use of processing techniques that improvesignal strength without requiring any increase in power, so signals can betransmitted over longer distances.   To improve the success ratio, circuit-switched data transmissioncellular carriers have begun to install modem pools at mobile switchingcenters in major metropolitan markets, thereby increasing the reliabilityand transmission speed of circuit-switched data service. This developmentenables cellular users with dissimilar modems to exchange data at speedscomparable to landline rates.   Operators are also introducing new pricing approaches. To date,operators have been pricing circuit-switched data transmission inone-minute increments (like cellular voice). However, this tariff structureis not economical for users sending large numbers of short messages thatare less than one minute in duration. So operators are exploring thepossibility of offering specialized pricing packages for circuit-switchedcellular data. For example, Cellular One in Buffalo (an AT&TWireless/Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems joint venture) introduced aseparate pricing plan for cellular data. The "Data Gateway" service isavailable for $4.95/month plus airtime fees: $0.15/minute during peak timesand $0.03/minute during off-peak hours. The network uses modem pooltechnology developed by Primary Access Corp. that can differentiate betweenvoice and data calls for the purpose of separate billing.CDPD Problems and SolutionsIt's now widely recognized that technology developers are often prone tooverlook the marketing aspects of new services rollout and behave as if themere existence of a new product or technology is all that is required toensure market demand. A few years ago, CDPD was widely heralded as the"next big thing" in wireless. However, as has been the case with otherheavily hyped new telecom technologies, the market has not developed yet.Thus far, the primary barriers to the spread of CDPD services have been thelack of ubiquitous network coverage and the lack of standards for wirelessdata applications development. Recently, however, cellular carriers havegotten the message and have begun to implement solutions.Ubiquitous Network CoverageCDPD had been commercially deployed in 41 U.S. markets by October 1995.This translates to approximately 14% penetration in the country's 306Metropolitan Statistical Areas. As illustrated in Exhibit 3, five of thetop nine U.S. cellular carriers have deployed CDPD. Nevertheless, theestablishment of an effective nationwide CDPD "network" has proceededslowly. To date, only two interoperability or "visiting" agreements havebeen formed among the carriers. In mid-1995, GTE Mobilnet and AmeritechCellular entered into an agreement to provide CDPD service in each other'smarkets, initially covering Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Houston, and SanFrancisco. In late 1995, GTE Mobilnet and Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile (BANM)concluded a similar agreement including all of GTE's metropolitan marketsand BANM's Connecticut market. BANM plans to expand its area in 1996,pending regulatory approval. Under these agreements, each company retainsits own tariff structure but customers receive only one bill from theirhome service provider. Before seamless nationwide network coverage can beachieved, however, the cellular operators must coordinate their CDPDbilling and accounting efforts. Several operators forecast that 1996 willbe a big year for interoperability agreements and that a nationwide CDPDnetwork could be in place in late 1996 or early 1997.   Most operators agree that it is vitally important for the carriers towork together to create seamless nationwide data coverage instead offighting against each other. Nevertheless, several of the largest cellularcarriers--AirTouch Communications, BellSouth Cellular, Southwestern BellMobile Systems (SBMS), and U S West--are not "sold" on CDPD. Most cite lackof market demand as the major reason for not deploying CDPD. Some are alsonot convinced that CDPD will ever be the packet data technology choice forthem. AirTouch and U S West, both deploying CDMA in their cellularnetworks, are exploring CDMA's data transmission capabilities. Similarly,BellSouth and SBMS are reviewing packet data options using TDMA, theirchosen digital cellular standard. Moreover, BellSouth has an ownershipstake in RAM Mobile Data, which provides wireless packet data services on aMobitex-standard network, and views CDPD as a competing technology.   Lack of Standards for Wireless Data Applications DevelopmentIn the short term, the success of wireless data depends on the softwaredevelopers' ability to create applications that satisfy customers' needs.Circuit-switched data technology allows the modification of wirelineapplications fairly easily, but CDPD currently lacks the software standardsthat would encourage developers to create programs. A major industryproblem is that most software applications are specifically created forcertain wireless data platforms. Consequently, some customers are afraidthat once they sign up for certain CDPD applications, they will be stuckwith them (and who knows if CDPD is going to be around in five years).Wireless data applications today can be divided into vertical (industryspecific, database/host connectivity), horizontal (messaging, fax,information/news services, file transfer, Internet backbonecommunications), and networking (desktop, LAN, and database access). Mostof today's CDPD solutions are specialized applications for verticalmarkets, but the demand for horizontal applications is growing.   One solution to the software problem may be the emergence of middleware,a software engine that allows data applications to run on multiple, diversenetworks. Middleware bridges surface incompatibilities between differentmobile technologies that all have different protocols. Middleware alsofosters cooperation by allowing multiple applications to run concurrently.   Some middleware solutions are broadly oriented toward creating fullyopen-system telecom platforms with a common application programminginterface; others simply enable land-line applications over wireless ortarget multi-platform applications for specific activities like electroniccommerce. Middleware is also helpful for networks employing the sameprotocol. It can be used to provide sign-in scripts that suit differenttypes of CDPD modems. Most wireless data carriers support the middlewareconcept because it encourages applications development and gets morecustomers into the wireless data mode. In the future, middleware functionsare likely to be integrated into network protocols as carriers realize theimportance of allowing customers to access multiple networks.End-user Device Problems and SolutionsUser-friendly hardware is as important as service reliability, ubiquitouscoverage, and reasonably priced service. The cellular data market willdevelop hand-in-hand with the growth of the notebook/laptop computermarket. Some of these products have been streamlined and simplified duringthe last few years. Instead of using external modems and interfaces, manynotebook computers today employ Personal Computer Memory Card InternationalAssociation (PCMCIA) modems. The cellular phone is connected to thiscredit-card sized modem via a slim cable and quick-release data cradle thatholds the phone during data transmission. In the future, the cellular radiochip-set may even be incorporated into the PCMCIA modem card. Another wayto integrate the cellular data device and the radio is to design productslike IBM's PC Radio, which has an RF data unit comprising a cellular radio,modem, and antenna.   One of the first attempts to combine computing and communicationsfunctions was the introduction of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) inspring 1993. The early PDAs, such as Apple's "Newton Message Pad,"EO/AT&T's "EO-Personal Communicator," Tandy's "Zoomer," and Motorola's"Envoy," had the form factor of a handheld computer. The products were notsuccessful due to premature launching. Early end-user device developers andpromoters made many mistakes with the technology, overhyped the industry,set unrealistic expectations, and targeted the wrong market (the consumerinstead of the business market). Many of these mistakes were typical of theearly stages of high-tech product development.   Most early PDAs were too awkward to use, too bulky and too heavy tocarry around, and too expensive. They were like sophisticated electronicorganizers with limited communications features, primarily allowing usersto write notes, keep appointment calendars, and maintain telephone/addresslists. In some cases, users could send and receive wireline and wirelesse-mail and faxes with optional modems and cellular phones, but the devicesdid not provide wireless connectivity as a standard feature. The problemwith these early PDAs was that they were not designed for communicationsand both end-user devices and applications were computing- anddata-centric. Some of the new products (to be introduced in 1996), such asCompaq Computer's "WinPad," still concentrate on the computer form factorand emphasize the backward compatibility with corporate desktops.   One step in the right direction was the introduction of a cellularphone-type device. In late 1994, BellSouth rolled out "Simon," a productcombining voice and data functionality. However, Simon was still tooawkward to use, relied on inadequate handwriting recognition, lacked aclear screen display, and had insufficient battery capacity.   Motorola's newest versions of "Envoy" and "Marco," and PCSI's newprototype "PAL," can also be included in this category ofcommunications-centric devices. In late 1995, Air Communications Inc.introduced an "AirCommunicator" device that combines cellular voice, datamessaging, and fax functionalities. Several operators, including AirTouchCommunications, Ameritech Cellular, Sprint Cellular, and U S West Cellular,decided to bundle their analog cellular services with this multi-functioncommunicator. For the cellular data market to take off significantly,additional voice-centric devices, more appropriate for the largely untappedmobile executive market, must be available.Systems Integrators to the Rescue?To expand usage of cellular data services, carriers can increase networkcoverage, introduce additional features, support the development ofuser-friendly devices, and intensify their marketing efforts to betterreach the target business user market. However, the carriers cannot do thisalone. Cellular operators will rely increasingly on systems integrators toprovide a complete service solution. Systems integrators will package thevarious elements: the cellular data service, the communications device(cellular phone, cellular/radio modem, pager, etc.), communications"middleware" (interfaces computing environment to communicationsenvironment), applications software (horizontal, vertical, networking), andcentral processing unit (CPU). To ensure the widest possible distributionfor wireless data solutions, systems integrators have certified resellerswho in turn sell the solution to the marketplace. Unlike cellular voiceservice (which appears to "sell itself"), cellular data service,particularly CDPD, requires more coordinated efforts on the part ofhardware and applications developers, distribution agents, and the cellularoperators themselves.Illustration(s):Illustration: Cellular Data Subscriptions, 1994-1999Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Illustration: CDPD Deployment by OperatorSource: CDPD Forum and Northern Business Information.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM PERSPECTIVES via NewsNetJanuary, 1996   CREATIVE DESTRUCTION IN GLOBAL PUBLIC NETWORKSBy:Michael Arellano, Vern Mackall, and Courtney MunroeThe title of this article is taken from Josef Schumpeter, a 19th Centuryeconomist who said that entrepreneurs create "new combinations" that canrapidly create wealth for risk-takers and, in the process, undermine theposition of established competitors. Overall, economic activity increasesand wealth is created, but competitors who cannot adapt fast enough willsee their assets decline markedly in value: hence, "creative destruction"or "productive chaos."   These phrases are apt descriptions of today's global public networkmarket in the sense that established and emerging carriers, in the U.S. andglobally, seek to expand their current service portfolios to provide voice(both local and long distance), video, high-speed data, home shopping andbanking, and other types of communications services. As operators seek toenter new markets and protect their positions in their existing markets,old ways of doing business, as well as the infrastructure used to deliverservices, will undergo radical transformation.   Given regulatory changes and technological development, stablemonopolies and guaranteed market share are things of the past.U.S. Local Services MarketIn the U.S. market, the long-awaited reform of the telecommunicationsindustry appears increasingly close to reality. As a result, telecomoperators can become "one-stop shops," offering customers several differenttypes of services, provided they can raise the capital for the necessarynetwork upgrades.   Exhibit 4 illustrates what is at stake in terms of revenue. Although thepie is getting bigger, competition means that the current size of each typeof operator's slice is not guaranteed. Exhibits 5 and 6 show the same setof services by carrier group market share in 1995 and 2000, respectively.Local exchange carriers (LECs) provide local phone service (the first fourrows); interexchange carriers (IXCs) offer long distance service;Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) also offer local service; and MultipleSystem Operators (MSOs) are large cable TV operators.   These carriers currently operate primarily within their own well-definedmarkets, but distinctions between the different carrier groups will becomeless meaningful following the implementation of telecom reform. Indeed,combinations between operators from different groups are inevitable. TheIXCs will compete in the local access market by offering local loop andwireless bypass solutions. The LECs will lose billions of dollars as IXCstarget business markets with private line alternatives and, eventually,provide switched access for both wired and wireless communications.   In the residential market, LECs will continue to lose market share inthe toll call segment to IXCs. Pacific Bell, which already facescompetition in the toll call segment, has experienced revenue declines inthis area as new rivals exert pricing pressure. The same pattern will nodoubt be repeated in the other Local Access Transport Areas (LATAs).International Service MarketsA similar transformation will take place in international markets. Exhibit7 presents global telecom service revenues and shows that wired voice anddata services, the "bread and butter" markets of incumbent operators(PTTs), will represent the major source of revenue over the next fiveyears. However, many incumbent national operators' markets are beingtransformed by liberalization, modernization, and competition. OtherLicensed Operators (OLCs) such as Mercury in the United Kingdom and Optusin Australia, as well as Global Carriers (GCs) such as Concert (MCI and BT)and WorldPartners (AT&T and other carriers), are challenging the economicsand cost structure of the traditional monopoly telecom operator.   Exhibits 8 and 9 illustrate each carrier group's share of the differenttelecom service segments in 1995 and 2000, indicating that asliberalization and competition proceed worldwide global carriers and otherlicensed operators will make substantial gains at the expense of thetraditional PTTs. As a result, incumbent operators are preparing theirstrategic responses, which include privatization (both to augment financialresources and to increase managerial flexibility), new business practices,introduction of new services, and entry into new lines of business. Someincumbent operators are also positioning themselves as global carriers. Forexample, Deutsche Telekom is gearing up for competition in Germany whileworking with France Telecom and Sprint as part of the Phoenix globalcarrier alliance. Incumbent operators such Deutsche Telekom and FranceTelecom will rapidly lose wired voice and data market share to thecompetition, and will lose it much faster than AT&T did in the UnitedStates. The global competitors have the advantage of greater experience andagility in scaling national boundaries, while other licensed competitorswill have the advantage of newer, state-of-the-art networks.   Service operators' responses to loss of market share and management ofpotential new opportunities will be key to their success and survival. Themain issue is for carriers to move from high-cost/low-revenue sectors tohigh-margin sectors. This will vary depending on market sector andposition. New entrants must target the low-cost, high-revenue customers.Incumbent operators whose monopolies are being attacked must, at a minimum,ensure that their service tariffs match their cost structures. Operators inmarkets that are already competitive must understand potential entrants'cost structures and increase their service differentiation and pricecompetition efforts. For new entrants in all types of markets, the name ofthe game is "cream skimming," at least in the early days. The creativedestruction wrought by telecom reform, market liberalization, andcompetition will result in short- to medium-term turmoil, with many newplayers. In the end, however, we could see a case of "deja vu all overagain," with "supercarriers" providing all types of services to allcustomers.Illustration(s):Illustration: U.S. Service Revenues, 1995 and 2000Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Illustration: U.S. Share by Carrier Group, 1995Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Illustration: U.S. Share by Carrier Group, 2000Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Illustration: Global Service Revenues, 1995 and 2000Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Illustration: Global Share by Carrier Group, 1995Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Illustration: Global Share by Carrier Group, 2000Source: Northern Business Information estimates.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List WT03-B14-2IA086-000622-B041-166http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te75.html 205.156.212.5 19970122052519 text/html 10963HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:23:27 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:57 GMTContent-length: 10776Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te75.html Sample Issue Copyright TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALERT via NewsNet January 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES E-MAIL TAP HELPS CLOSE CELLULAR FRAUD RING (200 words) FTC TELEMARKETING RULES TAKE EFFECT (222 words) FLA.

House and Senate lawmakers couldconsider a telecom legislative compromise shortly after theyreturn to Washington for President Clinton's State of the Unionaddress, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23.  If that window ofopportunity is missed, Congress may not consider the measureuntil after the Feb. 20 presidential primary in New Hampshire.          HIGHLIGHTS:  Pressler plans to introduce foreign ownershipmeasure soon...Conferees clarify facilities-based competitionrequirement for Bell company market entry...Conference agreementwill not supersede antitrust consent decrees...Rural advocatesconcerned about effect of geographic rate averaging language onbusiness services...Draft calls for "explicit" universal servicesupport mechanism.          Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), Chairman of the telecomconference committee, acknowledged last Friday that a vote maynot occur until March.  "I hope it doesn't go that long, but Iwant all the conferees' concerns to be dealt with," he saidduring a televised "roundtable" discussion of the measure.            Progress on telecom legislation remains frozen untilcongressional leaders reach a deal breaking the budget impasseand sending furloughed federal government employees back to work. Upcoming presidential primary elections also may slowconsideration of the legislation.          Industry sources last week said Senate Majority Leader BobDole (R., Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) may beunhappy with some provisions in the compromise.  Sen. Dolereportedly wants to see language reinserted into the measure thatwould preempt states from maintaining rate-of-return regulation. Speaker Gingrich reportedly is troubled by the removal oflanguage addressing the foreign ownership of common carrier radiolicenses and provisions addressing radio spectrum, Internetregulation, and media concentration issues.           Sen. Pressler said last Friday that a majority of Senateconferees will approve the legislative compromise crafted latelast month (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  A draft of the 280-pagecompromise and an accompanying 93-page explanatory statementbegan circulating last week.  "We have essentially nine of the 11Senate conferees," he said.  "We don't have all of thosesignatures yet, but we have indications that we will."  Heacknowledged that Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) likely will notsign the report.          Sen. McCain has criticized the compromise measure becauseprovisions amending current restrictions on foreign ownership ofcommon carrier radio licenses were removed.  Industry sourcessaid they believe Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is the otherSenate conferee who remains unhappy with the compromise. Referring to House conferees, Sen. Pressler said, "I know thereare some problems over there, but we hope to work those out."          Additional telecom bills may be introduced in the nearfuture, he predicted, adding that he still hopes to introduce abill addressing foreign ownership of common carrier radiolicenses.  "My original bill had that in it but I had to give upsome things I wanted," he said.          Although he had declared the pending telecom legislation"dead as Elvis," House telecom subcommittee Vice Chairman MichaelG. Oxley (R., Ohio) said last week that the compromise measurecould "very well come to life with some resuscitation."  Houseleaders have been preoccupied with budget negotiations and havenot had much time to focus on telecom legislation, he said. Until the budget impasse is resolved, telecom legislation willremain "in limbo," he said.          Industry sources last week said a majority of House telecomconference committee members have committed to sign theconference report.  But the compromise language apparently stillhas not been circulated for their signatures.  House CommerceCommittee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley (R., Va.) is reluctant todistribute the report for signatures before telecom subcommitteeChairman Jack Fields (R., Texas) returns to Washington anddecides whether to support the compromise measure, industrysources said.  Rep. Fields returned to Texas late last month tobe with his pregnant wife right after the "framework foragreement" on the final telecom bill was announced.  Shortlybefore departing Washington, he criticized the compromise measureas too regulatory.  It is unclear whether Rep. Fields nowsupports the compromise.          Meanwhile, a draft of the proposed conference report's"joint explanatory statement" began circulating on Capitol Hilllast week.  Language addressing Bell company entry into theinterLATA (local access and transport area) service marketexplains the conferees' intent in imposing a requirement thatBell companies face facilities-based competition and comply withthe legislation's local exchange competition "checklist."          The explanatory statement says that "with respect to thefacilities-based competitor requirement, the presence of acompetitor offering the following services specifically does notsuffice to meet the requirement:  (1) exchange access service,(2) telephone exchange service offered exclusively through theresale of the [Bell company's] local telephone exchange service,and (3) cellular service."  To trigger Bell company entry intothe interLATA service market, the legislation requires that acompetitor "offer telephone exchange service either exclusivelyover its own facilities or predominantly over its own facilitiesin combination with the resale of another carrier's service," thestatement says.          The "predominantly over its own facilities" language wasincluded to "ensure a competitor offering service exclusivelythrough the resale of the [Bell company's] local telephoneservice does not qualify, and that an unaffiliated competingprovider is present in the market," it adds.Conference Agreement Does Not Supersede Consent Decrees          Conferees believe that the AT&T Corp. and GTE Corp.antitrust consent decrees and the decree which permitted AT&T toacquire McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc., are "continuinginjunctions rather than final judgements."  To avoid possibleconstitutional problems, the proposed legislation does notsupersede these "continuing injunctions."  Rather, thelegislation provides that activities now subject to the consentdecrees will be subject to the "requirements and obligations"imposed by the Communications Act of 1934, which the pendinglegislation will amend.          "The conferees intend that the court shall retainjurisdiction over the three consent decrees for the limitedpurpose of dealing with any conduct or activity occurring beforethe date of [the pending measure's] enactment," the statementsays.  "Nothing in the language eliminating the prospectiveeffect of the two consent decrees should be construed aseliminating the jurisdiction of the court to deal with pre-enactment conduct or activities under the consent decrees."  Thelegislation also should not be "construed as creating orcontinuing in any way the GTE consent decree's prohibition on GTEor its operating companies' entry into the interexchange market."          The legislation will prohibit Bell companies from enteringthe alarm monitoring service business for five years.  AlthoughAmeritech Corp. will be permitted to continue providing alarmmonitoring services, it will not be allowed to expand thatbusiness until after Nov. 30, 2000.           The conference agreement modified language regarding theprovision of pay phone service.  If the FCC makes a "public-interest" determination, it may choose "not to allow the [Bellcompanies] to have the same rights as independent pay phoneproviders" in negotiating which interLATA carriers will be"presubscribed" at the companies' pay phones, according to thestatement.  "In addition, the conferees clarify...that thelocation provider has the ultimate decision-making authority indetermining interLATA services in connection with the choice ofpay phone providers."          The explanatory statement also clarifies the conferees'intent in adding a provision barring states from exercisingregulatory authority on issues on which the FCC has decided to"forbear" from exercising its own regulatory authority.  "Theconferees intend this subsection to limit state enforcement offederal statutes and regulations from which the Commissiondetermines to forbear," the statement says.  "This subsection isnot intended to limit or preempt state enforcement of statestatutes or regulations."           Trade groups seeking to protect the interests of ruraltelephone companies are concerned about a change in legislativelanguage addressing geographic rate averaging for interexchangeservice.  The latest draft of the measure requires interexchangecarriers (IXCs) to charge residential subscribers in rural andhigh-cost areas the same rates they charge to such customers inurban areas.  A previous draft of the legislation did notspecifically refer to residential customers, but the industrygroups had understood that it applied to both residential andbusiness subscribers.          Rural telecom advocates are worried that the new languagecould result in geographic rate deaveraging for business servicesbecause those services are not mentioned specifically in thebill.  In the draft report, conferees note that they do notexpect the legislation to alter geographic rate averagingpolicies now enforced by the FCC.          Conferees expect that interexchange carriers makingunauthorized changes to a subscriber's primary IXC ("slamming")will reimburse the original carrier for forgone revenues.  Butthey also expect the FCC's rules to "provide that consumers aremade whole" when they are slammed.  "Specifically, theCommission's rules should require that carriers guilty of`slamming' should be held liable for premiums, including travelbonuses, that would otherwise have been earned by telephonesubscribers," the statement says.          It clarifies that states may require a carrier seeking tooffer services in a rural area to meet the legislation'srequirements for designation as a carrier eligible to receiveuniversal service support payments.  "That is, the state mayrequire the competitor to offer service and advertise throughoutthe service area served by a rural telephone company," the draftsays.  The provision would not apply if the rural telephonecompany has received an exemption, suspension, or modificationthat effectively prevents a competitor from meeting the "eligiblecarrier" requirements.Conferees Would Like `Explicit' Universal Service Support          Conferees intend, "to the extent possible," that anyuniversal service support mechanisms maintained or created by thelegislation will be "explicit" rather than "implicit," thestatement says.  Conferees do not view the FCC's existing docket80-286 federal-state joint board proceeding on jurisdictionalseparations issues as an "appropriate foundation" for theuniversal service proceeding required by the legislation (TR,July 17, 1995).  Within 15 months of the legislation's enactment,the FCC must act on a federal-state joint board's recommendationsfor defining the services to be subsidized by federal universalservice support mechanisms.          The legislation requires all carriers of interstate telecomservices to contribute to the "preservation and advancement" ofuniversal service.  The FCC may exempt a carrier from therequirement if its contribution would be "de minimis."  Eligibletelecom carriers can receive federal support only to "provide,maintain, and upgrade facilities and services for universalservice in the area for which the support is received," thestatement says.          The conference committee included legislative language to"ensure that the Commission could, if future circumstanceswarrant, include commercial mobile service providers whichprovide telephone exchange service or exchange access in thedefinition of `local exchange carrier,'" the statement continues.          It also explains the conferees' compromise on controversialproposals to protect minors from gaining access to "indecent"material through the Internet.  "Use of the indecency standardposes no significant risk to the free-wheeling and vibrant natureof discourse or to serious, literary, and artistic works thatcurrently can be found on the Internet, and which is expected tocontinue and grow," the statement says.  "As the Supreme Courtitself noted when upholding the constitutionality of indecencyprohibitions, prohibiting indecency merely focuses speakers torecast their message into less offensive terms but does notprohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of communication. Likewise, requiring that access restrictions be imposed toprotect minors from exposure to indecent material does notprohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of the indecentcommunication.  It merely puts it in its appropriate place:  awayfrom children."          The draft statement also outlines the conference committee'sreasoning in streamlining the regulatory obligations imposed onoperators of "open video systems."  The conference panel expectsthat common carriers will be encouraged to deploy open videosystems, introducing "vigorous" competition in entertainment andinformation markets.  Conferees also recognize that commoncarriers deploying such systems will be new entrants inestablished markets and "deserve lighter regulatory burdens tolevel the playing field," the statement says.  In addition, thedevelopment of competition means "that government oversight andregulation can and should be reduced."          Regulation of the "cable programming services" tier of cableTV offerings will sunset March 31, 1999, the statement says.  Itdescribes a new "effective competition" test for determining whenderegulation of both the cable programming and basic servicetiers should occur.  The test concludes that effectivecompetition is in place when a telephone company or anymultichannel video programming distributor is offering comparablevideo programming services "directly to subscribers by any means"in an unaffiliated cable TV operator's franchise area.

Evans,to the team's Chairman, Dan Winters of Southwestern BellTelephone Co.  The Jan. 5 letter says Mr. Winters "indicated toMCI that the cause of this delay is largely due" to BellCommunications Research's "missing the due date for delivery. . .of the [service control point] software to the first fieldverification site."          Mr. Evans added, "We demand that the March 1, 1996, date bemaintained."  At TR's Friday news deadline an FCC-industry 888meeting slated for Jan. 10 at 9 a.m. in Bellcore's Washingtonoffices was scheduled to proceed as planned, despite the partialgovernment shutdown.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AT&T's Workforce Cuts Could Trigger Industry-WideJob Reductions, Streamlining, Analysts Predict          AT&T Corp.'s recent announcement of massive job cuts likelywill trigger further workforce reductions--and other forms offinancial belt-tightening--throughout the telecommunicationsindustry, particularly among the seven Bell regional holdingcompanies and GTE Corp., industry observers told TR.  They alsosuggested that other U.S. interexchange carriers, and even someforeign service providers, may further streamline theiroperations in the wake of AT&T's action--the largest single jobreduction in the U.S. telecom industry's history and one of thelargest ever announced by an American corporation.  But analystsdiffered over the scope of further job cuts, with some observersnoting that many companies already have trimmed their payrolls inrecent years.          HIGHLIGHTS:  AT&T to cut 40,000 positions, 13% ofworkforce...Company will take $4 billion post-tax charge against1995 earnings...Analysts warn that job cuts could be double-edgedsword...Wall Street bulls say move will make AT&T morecompetitive...CWA's President calls job reductions "demoralizing"to AT&T workers.          Recognizing that it will be operating in a dramaticallychanged competitive environment in the future, AT&T last weekannounced plans to eliminate 40,000 jobs over three years, areduction of more than 13% of its total present-day workforce ofabout 300,000.  The 40,000 figure was double the amount that manyanalysts had expected (TR, Oct. 2, 1995, p. 9).            AT&T also revealed plans to close, sell, or consolidate somefacilities and write off some assets.  Last week's announcementrepresented the "next step" in AT&T's plan to restructure itself,explained Rick Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer at AT&T, during a Jan. 2 press briefing.  Fourmonths ago (TR, Sept. 25, 1995), AT&T stunned many industryobservers by unveiling plans to divide itself into three separatecompanies:  a telecom services provider, a systems and technologycompany, and a computer manufacturer.          The job reductions, will enable the spun-off companies to bemore "focused," make decisions faster, develop competitive coststructures, and become leaders in their respective industries,Mr. Miller said.  AT&T will retain employees with "the right setsof skills" to keep the three spun-off operations competitive inthe future.  Meanwhile, he said, savings stemming from the jobreductions "will allow the three companies to be competitive." Sources agreed that the three future spin-off companies will beable to operate with relatively small corporate staffs.  Mr.Miller emphasized that AT&T now will be well-positioned to buildout its personal communications service operations this year.  Henoted that in its third quarter 1995 earnings report, AT&T hadsuggested that restructuring charges could be expected.  Analysts See `Ripple' Effect Throughout Industry          William H. Gaik, National Director of Deloitte & ToucheConsulting Group's Telecommunications and Electronic Servicespractice, said AT&T's announcement could put pressure on all ofits competitors to eliminate more positions and furtherstreamline operations.  Noting that major telecom serviceproviders now compete in a global marketplace, he told TR thatFrance Telecom and Deutsche Telecom, which have not undertakensignificant restructuring programs yet, may now feel pressured todo so.          A Communications Workers of America spokesman predicted,however, that AT&T's move will not trigger massive telecomindustry layoffs.  During the past three or four years, carriers--particularly major local exchange carriers (LECs)--have been"downsizing" in an effort to prepare for a more competitivemarketplace, he noted.  The CWA spokesman maintained that LECsalready have pared away too many jobs--to the point that they areundermining their service-quality performance.  Because AT&T isso much larger than most carriers, any job reductions at othercompanies likely would be on a smaller scale, he added.          The job reductions concern the group but they neverthelessappear to be "in line" with the restructuring plan announced lastfall, the spokesman said, adding that AT&T has been "managementtop-heavy" for too long.  CWA analysts believe the spun-offcompanies will begin hiring back management personnel once theybegin operating separately, he said.          Philip Sirlin, a telecommunications analyst with SchroderWertheim & Co., Inc., told TR that the AT&T announcement couldgenerate more job cuts in the telecom industry because "CEOsdon't want to be perceived as being asleep at the switch."  Inparticular, he predicted further workforce reductions among theBell companies.  MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. alsomay need to "reexamine" the operations of their long distanceservice units, Mr. Sirlin added.          But AT&T's action may be a double-edged sword, someobservers suggested.  Although it likely will make AT&T morecompetitive in the short term, the job-cutting move couldbackfire if AT&T's service quality slips, they explained.  Mr.Gaik told TR that the job cutbacks could create a "highlydisgruntled workforce," a result that could "spill over" tocustomers in the form of poor service.  That, in turn, could helpAT&T's competitors.  Mr. Gaik added that savings stemming fromthe job reductions will enable AT&T to price its services moreaggressively and to invest in new technologies.Wall Street Views AT&T's Action as Necessary Step          Wall Street analysts generally praised AT&T's action.  In astatement, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., said the "cost-cutting moves should improve margins, increase cash flows, andfurther solidify the company's Aa3 senior unsecured rating."  Itadded that AT&T is "well-positioned to meet the competition andpotentially can improve its credit rating over the long term." But Moody's warned that AT&T "faces many long-term challenges asderegulation and increased competition...exert pressure ontelecommunications margins."  Although the "ultimate" capitalstructure of the spin-off companies has not been established,Moody's is "confident that AT&T's credit quality will not beseriously impaired."          Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. reaffirmed AT&T's seniordebt rating of "AA+" (Double-A-Plus) following the company's Jan.2 announcement.  It said the action reflects AT&T's progress inrefocusing on communications services.  While its core telecomservices business may face growing competition as LECs enter theinterLATA (local access and transport area) service market,AT&T's restructuring "will help position it to cope with theadded competition," Duff & Phelps said.  "The reduction inbusiness risk associated with the divestiture of [certain]enterprises will strengthen overall credit quality.  Meanwhile,the proceeds raised will give the company added financialflexibility and allow it to capitalize its remaining units in amanner consistent with its current rating level."          In an investment analysis released prior to last week'sannouncement, Merrill Lynch had predicted that AT&T wouldannounce job cuts early this year.  It had suggested that thecompany might target some of its savings "to fund the longer terminvestments they need to make."  Those would include "enteringthe local telephone business, investing overseas as a new entrant(e.g., Mexico), adding to its marketing staff and promotions, andrebuilding billing systems" to reduce its dependence on LECbilling and collection services.AT&T Takes `Charge' Against Earnings To Cover RestructuringExpenses          AT&T will take a post-tax charge of about $4 billion againstfourth-quarter 1995 earnings to cover the cost of implementingits plan to restructure into three independent companies.  Thecharge will be about $6 billion before taxes and "will reducefourth quarter net income by approximately $4 billion or about$2.50 a share," AT&T said.  Those figures could change by thetime AT&T closes its 1995 fourth quarter books later this month,it added.          About 70% of the 40,000 jobs will be eliminated this year;the remaining positions will be terminated in 1997 and possibly1998.  Sixty percent of the eliminated jobs will be managementpositions.  Eighty-five percent of the job reductions will affectAT&T's domestic operations, and the remaining 15% will beallocated among several foreign operations, AT&T officials said.          About 30,000 of the job cuts will be involuntary. Meanwhile, 6,500 AT&T managers already have accepted a voluntaryseverance package, and an additional 4,000 employees likely willremain with business units the company intends to sell.  Theseverance package was offered to 72,000 managers before the endof last year.  AT&T officials said last week that the package maybe extended to an additional 40,000 managers, potentiallyreducing the number of lay-offs.  A decision to extend thevoluntary severance package will be made within the next 60 daysor so.          AT&T did not provide information about the planned jobreductions disaggregated by country, state, or company facility. But it did reveal plans to cut 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in New Jersey,where it is headquartered.  The spun-off AT&T telecom servicescompany will have 110,000 employees after job reductions of about17,000, AT&T said.  The systems and technology company would have108,000 employees after reductions of 23,000.  Of the 40,000 jobsto be eliminated, 10,000 will be corporate-wide staff positionsin the present-day AT&T information systems, human resources, andfinancial operations units.  AT&T does not anticipate significantjob reductions in the future, but small-scale job-cutting actionswould occur, a company spokesman said.  AT&T said the fourth-quarter charge will cover:          *  Workforce reductions resulting in severance pay andrelated costs totaling about $2.6 billion before taxes;          *  The "write down" of the value of assets, estimated tototal about $1.7 billion;          *  The closing, selling, or consolidation of facilities thatwould not be "strategic" for the spun-off companies' operations(total costs could reach $1.1 billion); and          *  Other unspecified actions totaling $700 million.  Thiscould involve a variety of miscellaneous costs pertaining to therestructuring, the spokesman said.          AT&T officials would not comment on what facilities might beclosed or sold, saying that announcements will be made in "duecourse."  AT&T already has unveiled plans to sell its Paradyneunit, a Key Largo, Fla.-based manufacturer of modems for personalcomputers (TR, Oct. 23, 1995).  The actions related to the chargemainly will affect the new AT&T services company and the newsystems and technology company, which will provide network,business, and consumer technology and equipment.          AT&T already had announced last year (TR, Sept. 25, 1995, p.2) that it will eliminate 8,500 jobs at AT&T Global InformationSolutions, which will become part of the spun-off computercompany.  Those jobs are in addition to the 40,000 jobsreductions announced last week.  AT&T had taken a $1.5 billioncharge against third quarter 1995 earnings to reflect the cost ofthe GIS restructuring.          The new AT&T services company will reduce its workforcethrough the "continued application" of new technologies,consolidation of operator services, and a reduction of marketingand sales support positions.  It also plans to reduce the valueof some investments, such as its stake in Canadian carrier UnitelCommunications, Inc. (TR, Oct. 2, 1995).  Plans also call foraltering several of the new AT&T services company's onlineservices by adopting Internet-based technical platforms and formodifying some messaging services.  Those plans will require AT&Tto write down "the value of some unneeded network facilities--such as microwave towers--and refocus some of its undersea cableoperations," AT&T said.Allen Expresses Regret, CWA's Bahr Expresses Bitterness          AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Allensaid in an electronic mail message to AT&T employees last weekthat the job reductions are driven by changes in the marketplace,as well as by customers' needs, new technology, and publicpolicy.  "I understand how wrenching it will be for employees andtheir families," Mr. Allen said.  "But the actions we areannouncing today are absolutely essential if our businesses areto be competitive."  For workers leaving the company, AT&T willprovide a severance package, access to a job database, supportfor retraining and education, and workshops on financial planningand stress management.  Employees may be considered for jobs inthe new companies six months after they leave.          In a statement, CWA President Morton Bahr used unusuallyharsh words to criticize AT&T's action.  "AT&T has started offthe New Year by demoralizing its workforce and delivering asetback to the joint cooperative program we have been attemptingto build with the company over the past three years," he said.            Mr. Bahr added that CWA did not receive "the courtesy ofadvance notification of today's mass-cutback announcement, whichin the past has been the usual practice prior to suchannouncements."  It may take up to 60 days, he said, for AT&T toprovide details on the jobs and locations that will be affected.          "This is yet another case of the kind of mindless jobdestruction that has terrorized working Americans in recent yearsas corporate executives play to Wall Street and manipulate theirstock prices," Mr. Bahr said.            AT&T "apparently pulled a number out of the air, a bignumber that will give their stock price a boost, while theydecide over the next few months what their real employment needswill be for the new corporate structure."  He added that AT&Temployees and their families "will live in fear not knowing whenand where the ax will fall."  Mr. Bahr said that if AT&T wants toensure the success of the three spin-off companies, it shouldwork to improve employee morale instead of fostering "a climateof bitterness."          AT&T plans to file a "registration statement" with theSecurities and Exchange Commission late this month or early nextmonth for an initial public stock offering for the plannedsystems and technology company.  An AT&T spokesman said thecompany hopes to offer the stock by the end of the first quarter. In addition, AT&T last month asked the Internal Revenue Serviceto issue a ruling allowing it to distribute stock in the newsystems and technology company tax-free to AT&T shareholders.  AnIRS ruling against AT&T's proposal could "complicate" plans tospin off the systems and technology company and force AT&T to"revisit" the spin-off plans, an AT&T spokesman told TR.

TimeWarner gained about 1.3 million cable TV subscribers, bringingits total subscription to 11.5 million customers.  The deal,announced last year as a stock transaction valued at $2.7 billion(TR, February 13, 1995), also allows Time Warner to complete itscable TV "clustering" plan.          "Our dramatically strengthened cable clusters will keep TimeWarner in the forefront of the core cable business as we roll outenhanced advertising, pay-per-view, cable online services,telecommunications services, and interactivity throughout thesystems," said Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer.  He added that as a result of the transaction,more than three-quarters of Time Warner's customers will belocated in 34 groupings of more than 100,000 customers each.  TheCablevision properties will augment Time Warner's existing cableTV holdings in New York, Florida, and North Carolina, he said. Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996AT&T To Sell Circuit Board Plant in Restructuring          AT&T Corp. will sell its Microelectronics business unit'scircuit board manufacturing plant in Richmond, Va., as part of aplan to reduce its workforce and close or sell certain facilities(see separate story).  AT&T announced last year that it willdivide itself into three separate companies focusing ontelecommunications services, systems and technologies, andcomputer manufacturing (TR, Sept. 25, 1995).  The Richmond plant,which manufactures printed circuit boards and "backplanes," hasabout 1,950 employees.  Printed circuit boards, also calledprinted wiring boards, contain several layers of wiring paths toconnect integrated circuits and other electronic components. Backplanes connect circuit boards within electronic devices.          AT&T said it hopes that few, if any, of the employees willlose their jobs under new ownership.  "We plan to initiatediscussions with potential buyers in the next few weeks," saidAT&T Microelectronics President Curtis J. Crawford.  "We hope tofind a company that is committed to keeping theRichmond...workforce substantially intact."  He added that thelargest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network Systems,"expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works as a majorsupplier after the sale."          Tommy Thurston, President of Local 2260 of theCommunications Workers of America--which represents nonmanagementemployees at the plant--said, "We had just turned the corner onmaking the plant profitable for the first time in a long time,and this is the thanks we get."  A CWA spokesman in Washingtonsaid union officials have been assured that CWA will have"successorship rights" under a new owner, allowing it to continueas the employee's bargaining agent.  But it is uncertain whetherthe union's three-year contract, negotiated last summer withAT&T, would continue to apply.          AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems andtechnology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997. Asked to explain why AT&T is selling the Richmond plant, aspokesman for the business unit said company planners havedecided that "there's no strategic advantage in owning thefactory."            "When we look at how Microelectronics should invest ourresources for the greatest leverage and competitive advantage, wefind it makes more sense to invest in some of our otherbusinesses...Historically AT&T has been extremely verticallyoriented--we tended to make everything we needed," the spokesmansaid.  "But over the years, we've reevaluated and asked whetherwe really need to be making these [products] ourselves.  In thecase of these circuit boards, we decided we didn't."          He added that AT&T hopes to complete the sale by year-end. Ideally, the buyer would be a company already manufacturingcircuit boards and seeking to expand both its market share andmanufacturing capacity, he said.  An industry source told TR thattalks with one potential buyer are well advanced.  "I've heardthat the negotiations are down to the final wrangling overprice," the source said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Shareholders Approve Disney-CapCities/ABC Deal          Shareholders of The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC,Inc., overwhelmingly have approved Disney's planned acquisitionof CapCities (TR, Aug. 7, 1995).

Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Md. PSC Adopts `Phase II' Competition Rules;CLECs Praise `Favorable' Interconnection Rates          In a decision praised immediately by competitive localexchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commissionhas established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions forcarriers planning to compete in the provision of services tobusiness end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission saidthat "an essential service such as interconnection should not bepriced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commissionare "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlinedterms for offering unbundled network elements, established aninterim local number portability method, and began a separateproceeding on universal service issues.          The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the statein 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application forpermission to provide local exchange service (TR, May 2, 1994). In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, itestablished interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensationfor call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland tointerconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem andcentral office switching facilities.          In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantichad proposed an interconnection rate structure consisting ofthree parts:  (1) a per-minute rate mirroring intrastate,interexchange access charges, minus the carrier common linecharge; (2) a monthly per-line rate designed to capture thedifference between the revenues received from the per-minute rateand Bell Atlantic's costs for building a "ubiquitous network" inthe state; and (3) a universal service component to be determinedin the universal service proceeding.          Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on theco-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnectionrates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitousnetwork" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier oflast resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all localexchange service providers be required to charge each other thesame cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued thatestablishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient andwould promote fair competition.          Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," thecommission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection ratespaid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not fullrecovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedentcertainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recoverjoint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples inexcess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," thePSC said.            It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data ontraffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specificinterconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.          The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnectionprovided at tandem switching offices, saying that suchinterconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted arate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection atBell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU forinterconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay thesame 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on theCLEC's networks.          Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previousinterim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companieshave in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnectionbut have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating callsthat originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.          Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it hadproposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would haveallowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on BellAtlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The flat-rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' truecost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport'sproposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an MOU-based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-ratearrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commissionsaid it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based ratesystem before reconsidering other rate schemes.          The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of BellAtlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFSand Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundledvoice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on thosetrials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business linksand services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  Thecommission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directingthe telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a ratestructure proposed by the PSC's staff.          Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be setat levels that would be less than or equal to the price ofequivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, thecommission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the pricesfor unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios betweenthe direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That willallow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of theamount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone servicerates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs tocompete, the PSC reasoned.PSC Bans Bundling of InterLATA Services          To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlanticoperates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA (localaccess and transport area) services bundled with local exchangeservices.  CLECs had contended that new entrants should be ableto offer such service packages because Bell Atlantic retainssignificant competitive advantages over them.  The PSC said newmarket entrants may provide interLATA services but cannot packagethem with local exchange service until the interLATA line-of-business restriction on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs wereallowed to delay providing equal access for intraLATA toll callsuntil Bell Atlantic is required to do so.  The PSC also:          *  Directed Bell Atlantic to file tariffs to offering remotecall-forwarding as an interim number portability system,determining that rates for that service should be priced at theincremental network costs of providing it;           *  Allowed CLECs to adjust their local calling areaboundaries; and          *  Gave CLECs the option of (1) providing their own trunksconnecting their end offices to Bell Atlantic emergency "911"tandems or (2) purchasing trunks from the telco at tariffedrates.          The commission denied AT&T Corp.'s request that it setinterim "wholesale" rates for resale of local exchange services,citing the need for further study.  AT&T has sought authority toprovide local exchange services to business and residential usersin the state (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The commission is scheduled todiscuss AT&T's application Jan. 17, a PSC spokesman said.                                                                       A separate proceeding was initiated to explore universalservice issues.  The commission noted, however, that the decisionto launch that proceeding is not a "predetermination that auniversal service fee of some sort will be necessary."  The PSCwill examine whether Bell Atlantic needs a "special" level ofsupport to serve some customers, but it said, "The evidencepresented in this proceeding leaves us believing that far frombeing a negative factor in its operations, the ubiquitous natureof Bell Atlantic's network in Maryland presents [the telco] withmarketing and business advantages not enjoyed by itscompetitors."          Growth of the local exchange market also should provide BellAtlantic with competitive opportunities even if competitorscapture some market share, it added.          Dan Whelan, President of Bell Atlantic-Maryland, said thecommission recognized that the telco is at a competitivedisadvantage until it can compete in additional interexchangemarkets.  The order, however, left "many questions unanswered,not the least of which is how Bell Atlantic-Maryland can continueto provide affordable service to all Marylanders when the newcompetitors serve only the lucrative business markets," Mr.Whelan said.  The decision "significantly lowers many of thetechnical and economic barriers to local exchange competition,"said Larry Burgden, Vice President and General Manager forTeleport's Maryland network.  But "full-blown competition willnot exist in Maryland until the [PSC] acts on other items beforeit, such as number portability," he added.

The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some networkservices.  Discounts would vary for different network elementsand services and would increase with volume and term commitments,an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject toPSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.          Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting therequirements of the recently passed Michigan TelecommunicationsAct (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on localusage rates for residential services and 11% discount on localusage rates for business services.  The discount rate forintraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services wouldbe 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritechspokeswoman said.          Competitors also would be able to purchase for resale suchenhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as well asadvanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN (integratedservices digital network) offerings.  Wholesale discounts wouldallow competitors to operate without having to build their ownfacilities, giving them "an avenue for entering the marketplacerapidly," said Jim Wilkes, President of Ameritech-Michigan.          Meanwhile, AT&T announced last week that it plans to competewith Ameritech and other local exchange carriers in Wisconsin,pending the adoption of local exchange competition rules by thatstate's Public Service Commission.  AT&T said it initially wouldprovide service through resale but eventually would offerfacilities-based service.  The company wants to enter the marketby the middle of this year.  "Based upon the [Wisconsin] PSC'srecent decision giving customers the ability to choose the short-haul long distance provider of their choice, we're confident thatthe PSC also will rule in favor of maximum competition," saidBonnie Manzi, AT&T Vice President-central region.  She called onthe PSC to adopt rules fostering "commercially feasible resale"of local exchange service and "reasonable" networkinterconnection arrangements. Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Wireless Industry Pledges To ResolveHearing-Aid Compatibility Problems          Conceding that all digital wireless communications systemspotentially may cause interference to hearing aids, wirelessindustry representatives have pledged to develop ways to maketheir services accessible to the 6 million U.S. wearers of suchdevices.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4 inWashington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipmentmanufacturers and service providers should have the flexibilityto determine what transmission technologies they will use in thefuture.  But the Commission must ensure that people withdisabilities have access to telecom services, he added.          Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called theEuropean model of mandating the use of specific digital wirelesstechnologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us intomandating their particular technology for the use of theairwaves," he said.  But market forces will not necessarily leadto the resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must beready to protect the interests of groups that traditionally havewielded little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.          Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacygroups should work together to identify compatibility problems,he continued.  "This will be a continuous process becauserepeatedly we will find incompatibilities between wirelessdevices and hearing aids."  He said the Commission anticipatesthat specific "action items" will be generated by the two-daysummit meeting, which was sponsored by the PersonalCommunications Industry Association.          The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year byhearing-aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested thatthe FCC initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systemsusing the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digitalwireless standard to interfere with hearing aids (TR, June 12,1995).  Wireless industry representatives, however, told theCommission that it would be premature to launch such a rulemakingproceeding before conclusive test results were available (TR,July 24, 1995).          During last week's meeting industry representativesemphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibilityalready is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and ChiefExecutive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications IndustryAssociation, reported that the Center for the Study ofElectromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will releasethe initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also isconducting a field evaluation of bystander interference problemsusing the personal communications service (PCS) network recentlyactivated in the Washington, D.C., area by American PersonalCommunications.  Results of that research are expected to beavailable Feb. 15.  Mr. Wheeler said digital-service interferenceproblems are no more daunting than those the cellular industryfaced when it introduced analog wireless equipment more than 10years ago.          Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wirelessphones meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids thatare designed and tested to meet the requirements of the EuropeanCommission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard forhearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised atechnical standard for phones based on the code-divisionmultiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers canturn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,which can be a source of interference for some types of hearingaids.          According to panelists at the meeting, several devices areavailable that enable hearing-impaired people to use digitaltelephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, forexample, can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-coil" (t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on thehearing aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals touse the mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a"JABRA" device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearingaids.          George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,said the availability of such devices does not mean the wirelessindustry should stop developing other alternatives for peoplewith disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or theywill pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some22 million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "andthere isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough toignore 10% of the population."          Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officerof CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted itsresponsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wirelesstechnologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs,who wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientificresearch will provide us with long-term solutions for resolvingelectromagnetic compatibility issues."          Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research anddevelopment arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a SeniorEngineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aidinterference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitudemodulated, he explained.  Such pulse signals are common withmobile phones based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said,adding that all PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitudemodulation.  "Higher RF output increases the range ofinterference, but that is why the FCC has set limits on outputlevels," Mr. Williams said.          Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering forthe Advanced Products and Technology Division of the CellularSubscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving fromthe use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to theuse of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will leadmanufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devicesthat can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

AnAlcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, buthe said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, consideringthat Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS)in up to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services,Sprint must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbentlicensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.          Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrumrelocation projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Lastyear STV won PCS licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, andIndianapolis "Major Trading Areas" (TR, March 20, 1995).  Alcatelplans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment designed tooperate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul equipmentinterconnecting cell sites.          Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell MobileServices, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipmentfor the spectrum relocation of public safety wireless facilitiesoperated by the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  The Alcatelspokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend about $1 millionto relocate five microwave links for the county.  That estimateis in line with other industry estimates, which put the cost ofrelocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.  Alcatel--which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees planning toupgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to announce similarrelocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and BellSouthPersonal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He said thereis a roughly $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Washington Commission Clarifies Local Competition Rules          Responding to requests by several potential local exchangemarket entrants, the Washington Utilities and TransportationCommission has amended rules for local exchange competitionadopted last November (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The potential localexchange competitors had asked the commission to modify severalrule provisions and to clarify that GTE Northwest, Inc., isrequired to file tariffs for unbundled local loop and numberportability offerings.  The commission denied requests that GTEand US WEST Communications, Inc., be required to offer all oftheir services for resale.          In the November order, the commission had directed US WESTto file an unbundled loop tariff, but that order had notmentioned GTE.  In a Dec. 27 order, the commission clarified thatGTE also must file an unbundled loop tariff within 30 days.  Thetariff must offer line-side interconnection and two-wireinterconnection from an end-user's facility to the GTE centraloffice.  The commission also granted requests by TeleportCommunications Group, Inc., and Electric Lightwave, Inc., that itrequire GTE to file an interim number portability tariff within30 days.  Rates for that service must be set at GTE's incrementalcosts.          The commission said further network unbundling--beyond thatneeded to make unbundled loops and line-side interconnectionavailable--likely will be necessary, but "an immediate need formore extensive unbundling was not shown in this docket."  Itrejected requests from AT&T Corp. and MCI TelecommunicationsCorp. that US WEST and GTE be directed to file a "generallyavailable tariff for any elements unbundled for any competitor inresponse to a bona fide request."          Competitors also had asked the commission to require that USWEST offer a four-wire facility, rather than a two-wire facility,for its unbundled network offerings.  They had argued that a two-wire facility would limit the ability of competitive localexchange carriers (CLECs) to provide business and data servicesand that four-wire facilities are needed to offer digitalservices.  The commission said, however, that two-wire loops willallow CLECs to serve the "vast majority of residential customersand business customers without having to buy bundled [US WEST]services or facilities."            AT&T and MCI also had asked the commission to require thatincumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) remove all restrictionson local exchange service resale.  The interexchange carrierssaid their ability to compete in local exchange markets dependson their ability to resell the incumbent LECs' bundled andtariffed services.  US WEST had argued, meanwhile, that therecord in the proceeding did not support any action directingLECs to offer all services for resale.  The commission ruled thatalthough the general prohibition on resale should be eliminated,any such action should be considered as part of a general ratecase.          AT&T called the commission's Dec. 27 order "another steptoward achieving the goal of widespread local competition inWashington."  Greg Allen, AT&T Vice President-government affairs,added, "Expanding competition in local telephone service is inthe public interest, since it will mean more features, fasterinnovation and better value--all the things that customerscurrently enjoy in the competitive long distance market."

Party-Line Conversion Deadline          Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, USWEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-partylines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  Theconversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission'sorders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities ImprovementProgram (TR, Feb. 8, 1993; and Dec. 11, 1995).  The companyearlier had sought a waiver from the requirement, indicating thatit did not expect to complete the conversions last month.  ThePUC had been considering late last year whether to direct US WESTto eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to recover thecost of the conversions.  The rider charges on subscribers' billsrepresent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a US WEST spokesman toldTR.  US WEST said its employees made an "extraordinary effort" tocomplete the upgrades by Dec. 31.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Time Warner Seeks Mediation in Ameritech Talks          Expressing frustration over Ameritech-Ohio's intransigencein talks on interconnection terms, Time Warner Communications hasasked the Ohio Public Utilities Commission to mediate thenegotiations.  Time Warner said agreement has been reached on"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snagover "economic" issues.  Last summer the PUC gave Time Warnerauthority to provide local exchange services in the 37 countieswhere it operates cable TV systems (TR, Aug. 28, 1995).  TimeWarner requested PUC mediation in its second 60-day report to thecommission on the status of its interconnection negotiations withAmeritech and other telephone companies.          Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for TimeWarner, said negotiations with Ameritech began in December 1994. An interconnection agreement must be concluded "by the partieswith commission intervention, or by commission directive, by mid-January 1996 or the promise of local telephone competition inOhio will be even further delayed," she said.  Ameritech appears"unable or unwilling to negotiate" a reasonable resolution of theremaining issues, Ms. Schermer said.          In its request for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some[Ameritech] charges for key services, for which there are notcurrent substitutes, are excessive."  Ameritech also has failedto provide "cost justifications" and has proposed some one-timecharges that are "not appropriate," Time Warner added.            It appears that Ameritech's negotiating team, whichrepresents its Information Industry Services (AIIS) unit, is"hindered by a lack of authority to revise and modify proposals,"it told the commission.  Negotiations were "unilaterallyterminated" for several months in May 1995 by "someone atAmeritech," Time Warner said, adding, "that decision did notappear to be a decision of AIIS."          In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriateinsistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a mannerwhich insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remainingissues, "if Time Warner is serious."          It suggested that Time Warner may have other motives forfiling its mediation request.  James C. Smith, the telco's VicePresident, pointed to the "combination of Time Warner raising newissues at the bargaining table, publicly complaining to the[PUC], and conducting a media blitz."  Time Warner appears to beemploying a "tactic to create negative publicity" in an effort to"stall finalization of our cable TV franchise agreement" inColumbus, Ohio, Mr. Smith said.  Time Warner officials seem "moreintent on delaying competition in the cable TV market thannegotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can provide localtelephone service," he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Brooks Fiber, NYNEX Reach Interconnection Pact          Brooks Fiber Communications has reached an interim agreementto interconnect with NYNEX-New England's local exchange networkin Springfield, Mass.  The companies set reciprocal compensationrates for call termination and agreed on an interim local numberportability arrangement.  The pact paves the way for Brooks tooffer local exchange service on an interim basis, pending thedevelopment of permanent interconnection rules by theMassachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this year,Brooks said.  The company plans to begin providing such servicein Springfield early this year.          "The NYNEX co-carrier agreement was the last major hurdle inproviding local dial-tone [service] in Springfield," said RobertJ. Shanahan, Vice President-northern region for Brooks.

Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Court Tells Pa. PUC To Rethink Price Cap Index          A recent ruling by Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court on BellAtlantic-Pennsylvania's intrastate price cap plan could lead torate reductions for the telephone company's customers.  The courtoverturned part of a Public Utility Commission order establishinga price cap formula for Bell Atlantic, freeing the company fromrate-of-return regulation.  It ruled that the PUC had not takeninto account the difference between the general inflation rateand the specific inflation rate for economic inputs used by thetelephone company.          State Consumer Advocate Irwin Popowsky, among others, hadchallenged the June 1994 commission order that established aninflation "offset" factor of 2.93% for the telco's price capformula.  The commission's order forbade any rate increasesthrough 1999 and required the telco to reduce rates if the annualinflation rate (as measured by the gross domestic product priceindex, or GDP-PI) falls below 2.93%.  When the company eventuallyis allowed to increase rates, those increases must be limited tothe GDP-PI minus 2.93%.  Rate decreases will continue to berequired whenever the GDP-PI is below 2.93%.          The court, while rejecting some of the Consumer Advocate'sarguments for a higher offset factor, agreed in its ruling latelast month that the figure fails to reflect Bell Atlantic's"input price differential."  The inflation rate for BellAtlantic's inputs is lower than the GDP-PI, Mr. Popowsky told TR. Although the PUC had agreed in principle that there was adifferential, it had not been able to determine the correctfigure.  So the commission effectively had set the differentialat zero by not accounting for it in calculating the offsetfactor, Mr. Popowsky said.          The PUC has not yet decided whether to appeal the court'sdecision, commission attorney Alan Kohler said.  Other partiesthat had challenged the commission's order include AT&T Corp.,MCI Telecommunications Corp., the Pennsylvania Cable &Telecommunications Association, the Central Atlantic PayphoneAssociation, and the city of Pittsburgh.

Theinternational operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off intoa new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  Thetransaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service"telecommunications provider, the company said.  BrooksTelecommunications had owned 15% of Brooks Fiber, a companyspokesman said.          The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and softwareexpertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth ofconsultative support," according to James C.

In a recent letter to the Justice Department'sAntitrust Division, AT&T said the Bell companies have made noattempt to show that their requests for "wholesale" decree reliefdo not raise "different factual and legal issues" than thoseconsidered when the initial waivers were granted.  In many cases,the original waivers were granted only because they werejustified for a particular Bell company in a particularcircumstance, AT&T said.          Bell Atlantic Corp. filed the first generic me-too waiverrequest late last year, seeking decree relief equal to thatgranted by the U.S. District Court in Washington in all previouswaiver orders (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).  Bell Atlantic volunteered toabide by all terms and conditions set by the court in thoseorders.  Since then, several other Bell regional holdingcompanies (RHCs)--including BellSouth Corp., US WEST, Inc., SBCCommunications, Inc., and NYNEX Corp.--have sought thedepartment's support for similar waivers.          Those companies "have simply asserted--without any analysisor support--that the wholesale extension of all previouslyapproved waivers to them `does not raise any factual or legalissues that are significantly different from those raised by thepreviously approved waivers' themselves," AT&T told thedepartment.  "But [that] assertion is false."            Although it acknowledged that some Bell companies may bejustified in seeking me-too waivers in specific cases, AT&Tstated that many existing waivers were granted by the court"solely because they would apply to only one" Bell company andwould not be extended to others.          As an example, it cited the court's 1989 decision to allowPacific Telesis Group to acquire a 10% interest in a transpacificcable system.  AT&T said that waiver likely would not have beengranted had the court believed that each of the seven RHCs laterwould be allowed to obtain equal 10% shares, thus allowing themcollectively to control 70% of the cable system.            "Similarly, the prior waiver orders that authorized deminimis foreign exchange or private line services across LATA[local access and transport area] boundaries generally rested ona ground unique to the [Bell company that] requested the waiver,"AT&T added. Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Interference Problems          American Personal Communications has rejected claims thatits personal communications service (PCS) system is interferingwith the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In arecent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "seriousinterference" to the communications operations of light rail andbus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations. The letter was made public by UTC, the TelecommunicationsAssociation, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representingincumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertzspectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it haddistributed the letter without the MTA's consent.          Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs,expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems toother spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators hasbeen a contentious issue since the FCC first drafted rulesrequiring 2 GHz licensees to clear that band to make way for newPCS licensees (TR, Sept. 21, 1992; and July 19, 1993).  TheCommission recently clarified rules adopted in the Engineeringand Technology docket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding,further defining "good faith" negotiations over relocation issuesbetween licensees (TR, Oct. 16, 1995).          The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions lastfall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transitcommunications systems.  "These communications interruptions haveposed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letterstated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costsincurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesmanAnthony Brown declined to comment further on the interferenceproblems, noting that it involves "a possible issue oflitigation."            Ms. Schelle told TR that interference problems with themass transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter tothe MTA, an APC attorney said mass transit engineers havereported no public-safety problems resulting from interferencebetween the two radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have aresponsibility to respond to frequency coordination notices in atimely manner, the attorney added.            The MTA received at least six such letters indicating thatAPC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officialsfailed to respond to a single one.          "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordinationnotices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCSlicensees can only protect licensed facilities if they areinformed of the complete parameters of those facilities'operations.  APC fully protected the facilities represented onMTA's FCC license and could not have known, without beinginformed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from thoseparameters."

About 280,000 federal employees had been furloughed, and480,000 others had worked for three weeks without pay.  At TR'sFriday news deadline, the House passed, 401-17, a GOP-sponsored"targeted continuing appropriations" measure (HR 1643) to end the21-day partial government shutdown resulting from failed budgetnegotiations between President Clinton and congressional leaders. The measure also was expected last Friday to receive Senateapproval and a Presidential signature.          If enacted, the measure would allow employees to collectcurrent and back pay, but it would not provide the funding thatfederal agencies need to operate.  Late Friday afternoon,however, House leaders took up another proposal to fundgovernment operations through Jan. 26.  If enacted, that measurewill not take effect until President Clinton submits a balancedbudget proposal that has been "scored" by the CongressionalBudget Office.          Earlier last week the House failed to override PresidentClinton's veto of HR 2076, which would have provided fiscal year1996 funding for the Commerce Department and other federalagencies, including the FCC.  Lawmakers voted 240-to-159, fallingshort of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.          The GOP measure adopted by the House last Friday representsonly a temporary truce in the ongoing budget battle.  It wouldguarantee the payment of government workers' salaries throughJan. 26, when another continuing resolution may be required. Office of Management and Budget officials told TR that theRepublican-sponsored measure would permit all furloughedemployees to return to work.  OMB also planned to furnish federalagencies with guidelines specifying what activities thoseemployees could perform while appropriations bills are pending.          Other government sources told TR that the FCC would be ableto conduct a substantial portion of its regular businessactivities, despite the continuing appropriations lapse. "Basically, the FCC regulates, and that doesn't cost thegovernment anything," one source told TR.  The Commission shouldbe able to adopt orders and conduct rulemaking proceedings asusual, the source said, adding that FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundtwants to proceed with its scheduled Jan. 18 public meeting.  Thatmeeting appeared to be in jeopardy as long as the partialshutdown persisted, but the Chairman wants to conduct as muchbusiness as possible once FCC staffers return to work, TR'ssource said.          Anticipating the government's reopening, the FCC Jan. 5released a public notice revising document-filing deadlines.  Alldocuments due to be filed with the agency during the shutdown"will be due no later than 5:30 p.m. on the second day after theCommission reopens," the notice stated.  "Documents receivedduring the government shutdown via mail...will be deemed filed onthe first day that the Commission is authorized to reopen," itstated.  Upcoming filing deadlines will remain in effect unlessthe Commission or its bureaus decide otherwise, the notice added.          GOP leaders predicted last Friday that the House wouldapprove the second resolution to fund the FCC, the CommerceDepartment, and other federal agency operations.  That measure,however, would not take effect until President Clinton submitteda plan to balance the federal budget in seven years, HouseSpeaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) said last Friday.          Meanwhile, the government spending freeze could remain ineffect this week.  And although federal employees are expected tobe paid their regular salaries through Jan. 26, governmentcontract workers are not covered under the measure restoringfederal workers' pay.  In effect, FCC employees could return towork, but they may not be authorized to spend government money todo their jobs.  It remained unclear at TR's deadline whatfunctions the employees would be able to perform under theexpected OMB guidelines.          Harris Miller, President of the Information TechnologyAssociation of America (ITAA), told President Clinton that theinterim GOP measure was "outrageous."  He said:  "While we arepleased this proposal helps federal workers, the plan is bothshort-sighted and unfair."  In a Jan. 5 letter he criticizedCongress for treating federal contractors as "second-classcitizens."  ITAA represents some 6,700 companies that providecommunications services to government agencies and private-sectorbusinesses.          On Friday President Clinton renewed his pledge to submit abalanced budget plan to Congress.  "I gave them my word I wouldwork with them to pass a plan which would bring our federalbudget into balance in seven years," he said as the House begandebating the plan to reopen parts of the government.  ThePresident said he was "ready" and "willing" to continue budgetnegotiations with congressional leaders.          While the FCC remained closed last week, "essential" staffin the wireless bureau and several attorneys in the Office of theGeneral Counsel were working.  OMB previously had exempted staffmembers in the wireless bureau's Auctions Division from theshutdown.  Attorneys working on FCC briefs for cases pending infederal courts also were deemed essential by OMB.

Arianespace recentlyunveiled plans to order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launchvehicles to meet the growing demand.  It plans to establish itsown finance company to help clients fund satellite launches, thespokeswoman added.  Its insurance unit, S3R, also will bereactivated to help market the Ariane 5, the company's morepowerful, next-generation rocket.          Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches willgrow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  Thecompany plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans wouldinvolve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.          The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergotwo technical verification flights in May and September of thisyear, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially bythe end of the year if all goes well.

Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996S&P Revises Financial Guidelines for Wireless Companies          Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising thefinancial guidelines it applies to ratings of wirelesscommunications companies.  The business risks associated withcellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to theextent that many firms can sustain less stringent financialratios for the same credit ratings as companies in otherindustries, S&P concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply tocellular and personal communications service (PCS) companies,although PCS operators are expected to face many of the samestart-up risks as the early cellular companies.          That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat worse-than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringentfinancial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It citeddramatic growth in cellular subscribership as the reason thatbusiness-risk profiles of cellular companies have improved.          The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be usedto assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecomcompanies that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  Theseinclude AT&T Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holdingcompanies, and major independent telecom companies such as GTECorp.  "Although the wireless segment does not represent amajority of these companies' assets, it is their fastest growingsegment," S&P observed.  "Under the revised benchmarks, companieswith significant cellular holdings are now viewed as beingsomewhat less risky, while those with a major commitment to PCSare viewed as still having significant credit risk for the PCSportion of their wireless business."           S&P will use the following measurements to determine thecredit ratings of wireless communications companies:          *  Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement ofincome before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--thatindicates "earnings protection."          *  EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement ofcellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earningsbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relativeto total i nterest cost.  This measures a company's minimumability to meet interest costs using available cash.          *  The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relativeto cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determinea company's debt "exposure" relative to cash flow.          *  Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt tototal "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continueto be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimategenerally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-pop ratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.          *  Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellularsubscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurementof financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number ofsubscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company'srevenues are used to service debt costs.          In determining the business risk profile of wirelesscarriers, S&P considers a number of market factors, includingcapital intensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies,economic conditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (whichmeasure the loss of subscribers to competitors), and theunregulated nature of the industry.

The company said it needs the rateincrease--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly toinstall and maintain the service.          ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near centraloffices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet andonline services--along with increasing popularity oftelecommuting--has led to more residential installations.  Thecompany's current ISDN rates will remain in place pending thePUC's decision, which could take six months or more, she added.          ISDN service demand in California increased 200% during thelast 10 months, the spokeswoman said.  Pacific Bell has installedabout 60,000 ISDN lines in the state so far--about 30% of whichare in high-cost areas, she said.  A year ago only 5% of ISDNinstallations were in high-cost areas (those three or more milesfrom an ISDN-equipped central office).  By the year 2000, morethan 70% of California ISDN lines will be installed inresidential areas.  Pacific Bell must recoup its risinginstallation costs, but it does not want to discourage potentialsubscribers by implementing an even higher installation fee, thespokeswoman said.  It also does not want to penalize residents ofhigh-cost areas by charging them more than it charges other ISDNsubscribers.          In addition to implementing the $125 installation feethroughout its service area, Pacific Bell would begin levyingper-minute charges during off-peak, night, and weekend hours.  Itplans to end its provision of free ISDN use in all off-peak timeperiods, substituting a variety of service packages offering acombination of free and billable usage at various times, thespokewoman said.  "We want to place the maximum amount of controlfor billing in the customer's hands."Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996S.C. Regulators OK Price Cap Plan for BellSouth          In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouthTelecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public ServiceCommission properly has "recognized the need" for alternativeregulation of local exchange carriers, a BellSouth official hassaid.  Greg Morton, the company's Director-corporate and externalaffairs for South Carolina, told TR, however, that a five-yearprice freeze imposed on basic local service rates "is too long ina competitive environment."  BellSouth had proposed a freeze ofonly three years.            Mr. Morton added that BellSouth is "disappointed" that thePSC included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its price capformula, which was adopted by the commission Jan. 2.  "We feltour plan" as originally proposed "had a built-in productivityfactor," in that BellSouth could "never go back and recover"revenues from price increases it was forbidden to make during thefreeze, he said.          After the plan's fifth year, the company will be allowed toincrease basic service rates by an amount equal to the rate ofinflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  BellSouth'sintrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)services, the company will have pricing flexibility, subject to a10% annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintainoversight authority and can refuse to allow rate increases, Mr.Morton emphasized.          BellSouth most likely will ask the commission to reconsiderparts of its decision regarding the productivity factor and thefive-year price freeze, he said.  He noted, however, that thecompany has not reviewed the PSC's order yet, which has not beenreleased publicly yet.  BellSouth currently faces no basic localexchange service competition in South Carolina, but there arecompetitive providers of access and short-haul toll services, Mr.Morton said.  Callers must use "dial-around" access codes toreach BellSouth's competitors in the state's intraLATA (localaccess and transport area) toll service market.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Intelsat Will Consider Restructuring Plan This Year          By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have"a better idea of the future structure" of the internationalsatellite consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory ComsatCorp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions theboard took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  A specialIntelsat "working party" and a "special committee" of the boardare exploring the future structure of the consortium, heexplained.  The working party will meet three times this year--after each board meeting--to develop general policies based onthe board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.          As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customerservice, the board decided at its December meeting to establishfour regional service support centers (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  Theboard will review the support centers' performance at its March1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open anyadditional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  Plans for improvingcustomer service also include restructuring Intelsat's sales andmarketing division and establishing new internal accountingprocesses, he added.          The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-Aseries satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-Asatellites will be deployed in February, and the last bird in theseries will be deployed later this year.  Work by Lockheed MartinCorp. on the VIII series of satellites continues, and the boardrecently approved a "minor modification" of the contract withLockheed that "won't affect the scheduled delivery," he added.          The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805satellite to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "Whilethe current design of the Intelsat 805 satellite providessufficient land mass coverage over all of Africa, intersystemcoordination constraints may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805satellite at 33 degrees East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained. At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March 14-19,the board will consider releasing a request for proposals for twonew satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellitescovering the Indian Ocean region, he said.          Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said theboard approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876million in total revenues and $496 million in capitalexpenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase inrevenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenuestotaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000under budget.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Sprint Shareholders To Vote on Phoenix Deal           Sprint Corp. shareholders will meet Jan. 12 at the company'sWestwood, Kan., corporate headquarters to vote on three proposalsto consummate Sprint's alliance with France Telecom and DeutscheTelekom AG.

(TR, Sept. 25 and Oct. 16, 1995).  The groups areconcerned that the proposed "mega-merger," which would create oneof the world's largest media companies, could result in excessivemedia company concentration.  They are also worried that it couldlimit video programming diversity.          The request is contained in comments on an earlier, similarrequest by the U.S. Telephone Association (TR, Dec. 11, 1995). The comments were prepared by the Media Access Project (MAP) onbehalf of the Consumer Federation of America and the Center forMedia Education.  The groups intended to file their comments lastweek at the FCC; they will be submitted, instead, as soon as thepartial federal government shutdown concludes.  The groupsreiterated concerns raised in USTA's "request for imposition ofconditions."  They said Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) shouldnot be allowed to use its ownership stake in Turner Broadcastingfor anticompetitive purposes.  TCI is the nation's largest cableTV company.  The groups also proposed that the FCC hold an enbanc hearing on issues raised by the proposed merger.          The groups specifically are requesting that the FCC imposeconditions to ensure programming diversity and access and toguard against anticompetitive conduct.  But they did not specifyexactly what form those conditions should take.  Conditions couldbe attached to any television license transfers that must beapproved by the FCC for the transaction to be finalized, a MAPsource explained.  The FCC also may have the authority to imposeconditions on the provision of cable TV-related services by anewly merged company, he added. Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Court Should Consider Mtel License Separately, FCC Says          The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washingtonthat it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme forprivate paging licensees in its deliberations on whether MobileTelecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for alicense obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission'sauthority to charge a $33 million fee for the company'snarrowband personal communications service (PCS) license withoutfirst receiving congressional authority (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).          During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the companyshould not have to pay for its two-way paging license because theFCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that willcompete with Mtel.  The court had requested supportingdocumentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paginglicenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is alicensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newlyallocated frequency band," the agency explained, adding that allother licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paidsubstantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.          The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop anadvanced two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge,Mtel did not apply for a private paging license at 929-930[megahertz]," it said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commitsubstantial amounts of money to its narrowband PCS licenses whenprivate paging licenses were `free' undercuts its assertion inthis court that the Commission is applying different rules toidentical licenses," the agency added.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp.

The unit of General Electric Co. said the government ofGibraltar has filed "applications for these orbital locations onbehalf of GE Capital Satellites International" with theInternational Telecommunication Union.  "Satellites constructed andlaunched to these locations would be operated from a plannedsatellite control facility on Gibraltar," which is a Britishdependent territory.     A GE Americom spokesman told TRI that most of its proposedsatellites would operate in the Ku-band frequency with theexception being one orbital slot covering the Pacific Ocean. Satellites covering Africa would operate in both C- and Ku-bandfrequencies, he said.     GE's statement said current plans envision using thesatellites mainly for video programming distribution, includingdirect-to-home services and transmissions to cable TV systemheadends and broadcast stations.  GE Americom said the plannedsatellite design "would accommodate both analog and digital videoformats, as well as other uses, including VSAT [very small apertureterminal] and data networks."     To register plans to use geostationary orbital slots inspecific frequency bands, member government administrations notifythe ITU years in advance of government and business proposals fornew satellites.  Generally, administrations forward suchregistration notices on behalf of national government entities orcompanies under rules agreed to by ITU member nations.       In addition, the U.S. government notifies the ITU of Intelsatsatellite plans, and the United Kingdom government does the samefor new Inmarsat satellite proposals.       Previously, an agreement under which the Pacific islandKingdom of Tonga registered slots for use by satellite operatorsnot based in Tonga led to calls for an update of the ITU "advancenotification" and registration procedures.  The ITU currently isconsidering such reforms.     Scott Blake Harris, Bureau Chief of the FCC's InternationalBureau, told TRI that the bureau was not "surprised that a U.S.corporation chose to file with the ITU through anotheradministration" rather than through the FCC.       He said, "Under no circumstances will we permit any enterpriseto be disadvantaged by having decided to file with the U.S. ratherthan another administration."  GE Americom's spokesman could notcomment on the reasons for not filing with the FCC.       Mr. Harris said it is not clear that the agreement between GEAmericom and the government of Gibraltar is "improper or untoward." He noted that the move "may be appropriate," particularly "if theydon't intend to use the satellites to provide service to the U.S."     Commenting on the need for ITU reforms, Mr. Harris said the"whole ITU registration process is in serious disrepair.  I knowthe ITU intends to look at it, but in my view, it's urgent that itdo so."       He added that "it's critical" that the ITU review include U.S.government and industry participants.  Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Satellite Services:New Loral Unit To Be Globalstar Managing Partner      As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to acquiremost of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected industryleader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit) mobilesatellite services market.       Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of Loral, will become Chairman andChief Executive Officer of Loral Space and Communications Corp., anew company to be formed in connection with the LockheedMartin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the managing generalpartner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31% stake in Globalstaras well as other assets.     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from anunprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollarindustry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management teamdiminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said RobertKaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg Harrisin New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a focusedmanagement team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.       Mr. Schwartz said at a Jan. 8 press conference announcing thedeal that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  HavingMr. Schwartz championing Globalstar "strengthens" the globalcommunications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar commentsregarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record is"very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and CEOof Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and ViceChairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded thenews, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on Jan. 8.     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martinwill buy Loral's defense electronics and system integrationbusinesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumeddebt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity positionin Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share.  LockheedMartin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral shareholders througha tender offer that was scheduled to begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Loralshareholders also will receive one share of Loral Space for eachshare of Loral.  The transaction is expected to close by the end ofFebruary.     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million incash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will provideLoral Space with support in key technologies while remaining amajor maker of military and commercial satellites.  In addition tothe 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will receive Loral's 33%interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial satellitemanufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries, Inc., anaircraft brake company.     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral'sGlobalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, andBrazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving domesticand international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and broadbanddata services.       Mr. Schwartz said Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loralholdings to expand the new company's DBS business.     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8billion or $7.80 a share.  After backing out cash, Globalstarrepresents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  LoralSpace's book value is broken down as follows:     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),     *    $700 million in cash, and     *    An undetermined value for the service providerfranchises.     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquireall of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interestin Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a globalcommunications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed outthat globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone service,and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone.       If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr.Schwartz predicted that the company would have three millioncustomers and $2.7 billion in annual revenues by the year 2002.     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equityfrom its initial public offering in February 1995 (TRI, March 3,1995, p. 13), according to Globalstar's Mr. Ross.  Loral Space isthe largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public shareholdersas a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8% stake.       Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new bankfinancing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional internalfinancing--payments from exclusive service providers (the localtelephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute another $350million over the next two to three years, Mr. Ross said.     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million inadditional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said Globalstar wouldtry to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to LoralSpace and Globalstar's other investors for the funds.       Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering fromthe market in October (TRI, Oct. 13, 1995, p. 12).  Mr. Kaimowitzsaid this happened not because of a lack of investor interest, aswidely believed, but because Globalstar could get "debt at acheaper price" from the banks.     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debtprovides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project invery creative ways, with less need for traditional financingmethods."     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and Europeanantitrust and other approvals, and it also requires at leasttwo-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.       Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz do notexpect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction, especiallysince Loral's space business will remain a separate company.  Mr.Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses Lockheed Martin isacquiring from Loral have very little overlap with its existingoperations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for Lockheed Martin isbeing led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank of America, andCiticorp USA.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Satellite Services:Comsat Plan To Merge Service Units Approved     The FCC's International Bureau has approved Comsat Corp.'sreorganization merging its Comsat Mobile Communications (CMC) unitinto its Comsat International Communications (CIC) unit (TRI,August 4, 1995, p. 9).  Comsat Mobile handles Comsat's Inmarsatsignatory functions.  Comsat World Systems, which handles itsIntelsat signatory functions, already was part of CIC.       Under the reorganization, the World Systems and MobileCommunications units will be housed in the same CIC division butcontinue as separate units to conduct the separate Intelsat andInmarsat businesses, respectively.       Each line of business will have its own Vice President andGeneral Manager, who will report to CIC's President.  CIC also willcontinue to hold Comsat International Ventures.     Financial, legal, and human resources support services for theIntelsat and Inmarsat units will be combined into CIC as part ofthe reorganization.  U.S. signatory functions for both of theinternational satellite organizations will be consolidated into asingle office, which will be headed by a VicePresident-international affairs.       In an order issued Jan. 16, the bureau said Comsat ensuredthat a separate accounting system would guarantee that WorldSystems and Mobile Communications ratepayers do not bear any"nonjurisdictional" costs of the consolidated CIC unit.       The bureau found that the reorganization is consistent withthe public interest and the Commission's 1982 policy findings onComsat's corporate structure and operations.     Addressing concerns raised by AT&T Corp., the bureau notedthat World Systems will not offer Intelsat earth station services.      AT&T also voiced concerns that ongoing Intelsat and Inmarsatprivatization efforts could lead to conflicts of interest for theconsolidated organization.       Comsat believes issues relating to privatization of the twosatellite organizations "clearly overlap" so that the same staff"should be able to handle these issues, subject to appropriate costallocation procedures," the bureau noted.       It added that "internal conflicts are a normal part of anylarge business enterprise" and stressed that the bureau has theauthority to review "any instance in which violations of Comsat'sstatutory responsibilities and Commission policy may be alleged."      The bureau also addressed concerns raised by C-band maritimesatellite services provider MTN and separate internationalsatellite operator PanAmSat Corp.       MTN had argued that Comsat's provision of maritime C-bandservice violates the Maritime Satellite Act and the FCC'sstructural separation requirements.  The bureau said, "We see noneed to withhold action on Comsat's proposed reorganization pendingconsideration in separate proceedings of MTN's contention that CMCshould not provide C-band maritime services over non-Inmarsatfacilities on an unseparated basis."     While PanAmSat did not oppose the reorganization, it askedthat a partial waiver of the structural separation requirementsgranted to CMC in 1993 not be granted to CWS for "value-added"services that could be sold in conjunction with its fixed satelliteservices.  PanAmSat also called for a "single comprehensiveproceeding" to consider Comsat's entire enterprise.       The bureau said it will consider the request for acomprehensive review separately.  It noted that approval ofComsat's reorganization "does not extend the partial waiver grantedto CMC to provide a discrete class of maritime services on anunseparated basis."Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Satellite Services:Arianespace Needs More Rockets To Meet Demand     Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expectedincreased demand for launch services in the coming years, a companyspokeswoman said recently.  Arianespace recently unveiled plans toorder additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch vehicles to meet thegrowing demand.       It plans to establish its own finance company to help clientsfund satellite launches, the spokeswoman added.  Its insuranceunit, S3R, also will be reactivated to help market the Ariane 5,the company's more powerful, next-generation rocket.     Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches willgrow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  Thecompany plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans wouldinvolve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.     The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergotwo technical verification flights in May and September of thisyear, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially bythe end of the year if all goes well.       Meanwhile, fueling problems on the launch of Malaysia's firstnational satellite, MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9launch date.  The Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSatCorp.'s PanAmSat 3R satellite.  The new launch date was set forJan. 12.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Satellite Services:Intelsat Board To Consider Restructuring Plan This Year     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have "abetter idea of the future structure" of the international satelliteconsortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-internationaland regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat Corp.       Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the boardtook at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.       A special Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee"of the board are exploring the future structure of the consortium,he explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on theboard's decisions.  The special committee then will do the"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customerservice, the board decided at its December meeting to establishfour regional service support centers.       The board will review the support centers' performance at itsMarch 1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open anyadditional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.       Plans for improving customer service also includerestructuring Intelsat's sales and marketing division andestablishing new internal accounting processes, he added.     The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A seriessatellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A satellites willbe deployed in February, and the last bird in the series will bedeployed later this year.       Work by Lockheed Martin Corp. on the VIII series ofsatellites continues, and the board recently approved a "minormodification" of the contract with Lockheed that "won't affect thescheduled delivery," he added.     The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805 satelliteto provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While the currentdesign of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides sufficient land masscoverage over all of Africa, intersystem coordination constraintsmay restrict the use of the Intelsat 805 satellite at 33 degreesEast Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained.

The commission rejected a request from a consortium of cableoperators led by Shaw Communications, Inc., to operate a DTHsatellite distribution service.  It also rejected a proposal byPower DirecTV to operate a French-language DTH pay-per-viewservice.     The two DTH satellite service licenses went to ExpressVu andPower DirecTV.  BCE, Inc., and Tee-Comm Electronics, Inc., each own33% of ExpressVu.  Canadian Satellite Communications, Inc., owns19% of ExpressVu, and another 14% is owned by WIC WesternInternational Communications Ltd.  Power DirecTV is 80% owned byPower Corp. of Canada and 20% owned by Hughes Aircraft Co. ofCanada.       That company, in turn, is owned by General Motors Corp.'s GMHughes Electronics Corp., which also owns U.S. satellitebroadcaster DirecTV, Inc.     Licenses for four English-language DTH pay-per-viewprogramming services were awarded to providers of the"Sports/Specials" and "Power DirecTicket" services, which will beoffered nationally, and to regional operators of the "Home Theatre"and "Viewer's Choice" services serving western and eastern Canada,respectively.     A license for a French-language DTH pay-per-view service wasgranted to Canal Premiere, allowing national distribution ofprogramming.     The CRTC said it rejected the Shaw Communications group'srequest to operate the "Homestar" DTH satellite service because it"had significant concerns as to whether the Homestar proposal couldbe implemented as proposed, in light of the uncertainty related tothe availability of authorized U.S. services via the Primestarsatellite."       The agency said it rejected Power DirecTV's request to operatea French-language DTH pay-per-view service "because of thecommission's concern that this service would not meet theobjectives of the Broadcasting Act."     The commission also outlined requirements for the DTHlicensees' provision of basic service and "fair and equitableaccess" for programming services.  "In particular, the Commission'spolicy requires DTH satellite distribution undertakings to maintaina predominance of Canadian programming in the total packages theymake available to subscribers," CRTC said.  It will require DTHdistributors and pay-per-view services to contribute 5% of theirannual gross revenues toward the production of Canadianprogramming.       CRTC said it will not regulate the DTH licensees' rates,reasoning that "competition between the two new DTH satelliteservices, the cable industry, and other distribution technologieswill create sufficient market pressure to discipline rates chargedto subscribers."Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Survey of the Americas:Canada Reverses Order Cutting Long Distance Rates     Industry Canada (the country's industry ministry) hasoverturned, in part, a recent decision by the CanadianRadio-television and Telecommunications Commission requiringtelecom carriers to reduce basic long distance rates.       Seven regional telephone companies had asked the government toreverse the CRTC's decision, which also required them to raisemonthly local rates by $2 (Canadian) on Jan. 1, 1996, and Jan. 1,1997.  Long distance rates were to be lowered by the same amount. The telcos had argued that CRTC's order was an "unwarrantedinterference with market forces," the ministry said.  The localrate increases will go into effect as ordered, it added.     Industry Minister John Manley said in a statement that thegovernment took action "to ensure more investment and sustainablecompetition in the telecommunications industry. . .The governmentbelieves this decision will help the industry achieve a greaterstability in the marketplace and increase their investment in R&D."

The measure wouldpermit foreign investors to purchase up to 49% ownership stakes inBrazilian satellites and cellular telephone service providers.       If enacted, the legislation could lead to a tripling ofstandard telephone lines to 40 million and could increase thenumber of cellular phone lines from 800,000 to 17.2 million overthe next eight years, the official said.  The measure also wouldaddress cable TV regulation.     Over the next three years the Brazilian government wants toconsolidate the nearly two dozen regional phone companies--one foreach Brazilian state--into a "smaller number like five, six, orseven," the official said.       Consolidation could lead to privatization, although ownershiplikely would remain in Brazilian hands, the official added.

Itis seeking permission to establish an interconnection point on theU.S. West Coast to transport international calls originating orterminating in the U.S.  Then it would hand off calls to U.S.interexchange carriers (IXCs).     TCNZ wants to compete with MCI Telecommunications Corp. andSprint International, which provide a full circuit between the U.S.and New Zealand through their affiliates.       A full circuit would allow TCNZ "to compete more vigorously inthe market for calls from New Zealand and would allow it to offerAmerican [IXCs] an additional, low-cost choice for the transport ofoutbound international calls," Bell Atlantic and Ameritech saidlate last year in their joint motion.     In its recent response, AT&T told the court that the proposedwaiver modification would enable TCNZ, Bell Atlantic, and Ameritech"to impose even greater costs on U.S. carriers" and to gain acompetitive advantage "illicitly."  If the Bell companies were"genuinely concerned about the consumer harms that result frominflated accounting rates, they would agree to reduce the currentaccounting rate on calls between the U.S. and New Zealand," AT&Tsaid.       Granting the motion would allow TCNZ to preserve inflatedaccounting rates and permit Bell Atlantic and Ameritech to usetheir operating companies' local exchange service monopolies tohinder competition and harm customers in the U.S.     In transmitting calls originating in New Zealand over fullcircuit "private lines" to the U.S., "TCNZ would avoid its duty toreturn to each U.S. IXC a proportionate share of the traffic [theIXC] sends to TCNZ," AT&T argued.       "That, in turn, would exacerbate the settlement deficits ofthese U.S. carriers--and increase the surplus of TCNZ--by denyingU.S. carriers the return traffic on which they would earn paymentsfrom TCNZ."       AT&T estimated that if the motion were granted, net paymentsfrom U.S. carriers to TCNZ would increase by 75%--even if only 30%of TCNZ's traffic were carried over full circuits.

Clearnet Communications, Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, andMicroCell Network, Inc., of Montreal, each were awarded 30megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers Cantel Mobile, Inc., and MobilityPersonacom Canada Ltd., were awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.       Industry Minister John Manley said the four new licensees willinvest more than $3 billion to develop their PCS systems.  Heestimated that 8,500 new jobs will be created over the next fiveyears as the PCS market develops.     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses tononcellular companies will create a sound industry structure, whichshould facilitate the development of enhanced competition andinnovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.Simmonds.       Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile radionetworks for businesses in major metro areas.  NextelCommunications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholdersin Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with itsPCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in twoCanadians is interested in using PCS.     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is astart-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.

CTA, Inc., of Rockville, Md., asked the court to issue a staybarring the FCC from proceeding with a Jan. 24 auction of twoconstruction permits for building and operating a direct broadcastsatellite (DBS) system.  Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Emerging Services:DBS Permits Extended for EchoStar, Directsat, DBSC      The FCC's International Bureau has extended the period duringwhich EchoStar Satellite Corp. and Directsat Corp. may construct,launch, and operate direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems.       In an order signed Dec. 21 by Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris,the bureau gave EchoStar until Aug. 15, 1996, to begin operating aDBS satellite at its eastern orbital location.  In a separateorder, the bureau gave Direct Broadcasting Satellite Corp. (DBSC)until Nov. 30, 1998, to construct a DBS system.     To date, DBSC has paid 2.9%, or $2 million, of the totalsatellite contract price, and it is slated to pay 27.2% of thecontract price on Dec. 29.  DBSC also has moved up the schedule fordelivery of its first and second satellites to July 1997 and July1998, respectively, from September 1998 and March 1999.       "Extending DBSC's permit until 1998 will allow sufficient timefor construction of both of its satellites under its modifiedconstruction contract," the bureau said.  "Because we grant thisextension based in large measure upon DBSC's expedited constructionschedule, we will condition the grant upon DBSC's remaining insubstantial compliance with that schedule."     The bureau deferred ruling on EchoStar's request for afour-year extension to begin DBS operations from its westernorbital slot.  The recent partial U.S. government shutdownprevented the bureau from reviewing that request.       A ruling will be made when the bureau has had time "to make adue diligence determination," it said.  Mr. Harris was among thefew FCC employees permitted to work during the partial shutdown.     On Dec. 28, 1995, EchoStar successfully launched its"USABSS-3" satellite--part of its planned DBS system.  Thesatellite will be positioned in EchoStar's assigned eastern orbitallocation at 119.2 degrees West Longitude, and the company plans tostart transmitting in early 1996, the order notes.       The bureau also granted EchoStar authority to use in-orbit,fixed-satellite service C-band (4-6 gigahertz) frequencies for alltelemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) functions on the spacestation.  TT&C functions are needed for general orbital maneuversand spacecraft control operations.  EchoStar had planned to useKu-band frequencies for TT&C functions but sought authority to useC-band frequencies instead, citing lower costs.     Directsat--which was merged into EchoStar Satellite's parentcompany, EchoStar Communications Corp., in 1995 (TRI, Jan. 20,1995, p. 11)--is scheduled to operate its system on a "companionbasis" with EchoStar's DBS system, the order states.  With theextension, Directsat now has until Aug. 15, 1999, to beginoperating its DBS system at both of its orbital locations. Directsat plans to launch its first DBS satellite into the 119degrees W.L. orbital location this summer, the order says.       It has asked the bureau for permission to modify its DBSlicense application to permit TT&C operations in frequency bandscurrently allocated for government use.       The bureau said that request is under consideration "pendingcompletion of coordination with government users of that spectrum."Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Emerging Services:Ameritech VDT Plans Grow Dimmer; Applications Pulled     Ameritech Corp. has hammered another nail into the coffin ofits video dial-tone (VDT) plans, formally withdrawing fiveapplications for Communications Act section 214 authority to offercommercial VDT service.       Ameritech officials said the decision to withdraw theapplications, which were approved a year ago by the FCC's CommonCarrier Bureau was prompted by the agency's delay in adopting finalVDT rules.       Commission officials have said they will address VDT issuesafter Congress completes action on pending telecommunicationslegislation.     While forging ahead with plans to deploy stand-alone cable TVsystems over the past few months, Ameritech officials have hintedthat they might abandon their VDT plans.

A meeting for shareholders to approve the investment agreementand related charter and bylaws changes technically was scheduled tobegin Friday, Jan. 12.  Then it will adjourn temporarily until Jan.29, when the Phoenix deal will be considered, a Sprint spokesmanexplained.  The "adjournment" will not change the Nov. 13, 1995,record date for shareholders to be eligible to vote at the meeting,the spokesman noted.     The postponement stemmed from long lead-time scheduling of theproxy distribution and the meeting, which were linked to expectedFCC action to approve the deal, the spokesman said.  When the FCCacted a week later than had been expected, "some things were pushedback" in closing procedures, he said.       Sprint said the price France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom willpay for new class A Sprint stock will be $48.704 per share.  Thatwas the maximum price possible under a formula pegged to theclosing price of Sprint common stock during a 20-day trading periodending 15 trading days before closing of the transaction.     During its regular meeting Dec. 15, the FCC granted Sprint'srequest for a declaratory ruling that the combined 20% investmentby the European carriers would not conflict with Communications Actsection 310(b)(4) restrictions on foreign ownership of commoncarrier radio licensees.       Presenting the recommendations to the Commissioners, stafferKerry E. Murray said the bureau found that France Telecom's andDeutsche Telekom's acquisition of 20% of Sprint for as much as $4.2billion would not constitute a transfer of control of Sprint.       The bureau found that the transaction would be in the publicinterest, subject to several conditions described by Ms. Murray andInternational Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris as "strict."     Ms. Murray said the bureau found that France and Germany donot offer "effective competitive opportunities" under theCommission's recently adopted standard for analyzing foreigncompanies' requests to enter U.S. telecom markets (TRI, Dec. 8,1995, p. 1).       But she cited "two important countervailing public interestfactors" for approving the proposed venture.  "Both France andGermany have begun to implement wide-ranging liberalization plans,including the introduction of full telecommunications competitionon Jan. 1, 1998," she noted.  The investment by France Telecom andDeutsche Telekom "will enable Sprint to become a more potentcompetitor in a wide range of U.S. markets," she added.     Mr. Harris stated more than once the bureau's conclusion thatthe Phoenix alliance will give both Sprint and its French andGerman partners short-term competitive advantages in the U.S.,French, and German markets that will not be available to other U.S.international carriers.       But the conditions imposed by the Commission would mediatethat advantage over the near term and eliminate it by the time theEuropean Union implements full telecom liberalization on Jan. 1,1998, he said.     As explained by Ms. Murray, the conditions are required to"address the potential for France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom toengage in anticompetitive conduct and the possibility that thetelecommunications liberalization anticipated in France and Germanymay not be fully implemented on schedule."  She said the bureaurecommended making a public interest finding favoring the Sprintventure under the following conditions:     (1) Sprint is regulated as a dominant carrier on the Frenchand German routes;     (2) Sprint is not allowed "to increase the number of circuitsit operates on the French and German routes until these countriesallow the use of alternative infrastructure [i.e., private networksoperated by utility companies, railroads, etc.] to provide alreadyliberalized services, and France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom makeavailable basic switched voice resale";     (3) Sprint complies with specified nondiscrimination andreporting requirements;     (4) "France Telecom commits to lowering its accounting ratewith the U.S. to that of the United Kingdom and Germany within twoyears"; and     (5)"Sprint reports to this Commission in 1998 whether theanticipated liberalization occurred in France and Germany.  If ithas not, the Commission will take further action, includingdesignating for hearing whether certain of Sprint's facilitiesauthorizations should be revoked."     Asked about the circuit activation restriction, Mr. Harrisexplained to Chairman Reed E. Hundt that beginning with the closeof the joint venture transaction, "all three [carriers] can offerthings to large customers that, in essence, nobody else can."       He cited single-party billing, billing in a single currency,and one-stop problem resolution.  The bureau staff believes thatconstitutes an "unfair competitive advantage," he said.       The circuit activation restriction, therefore, was imposed asan inducement for the French and German carriers to allow otherU.S. carriers to provide resale services in their home markets.       Mr. Harris said French and German government authorities "havesaid it's OK" if the carriers agree to permit resale.  Implementingthat policy would enable other U.S. carriers to develop businessrelationships with end-user customers before the widespread EUliberalization in 1998, he added.       Similarly, the restriction should provide an incentive forFrance and Germany to stick to the July 1996 timetable agreed to innegotiations with Mr. van Miert to permit competitive carriers toaccess alternative infrastructure networks and to roll out servicesthat already are liberalized in the French and German markets, Mr.Harris said.       That will enable other U.S. carriers to use networks otherthan those of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, and thus avoidbenefitting their competitors in those markets.  "The alternativewould have been simply to walk away from the problem for two years,and two years is a very long time," he added.     A DT spokesman told TRI after the Commission meeting that therequirement that DT open the German market to switched voice resalecould be problematic.  "The question is whether they mean simple'rebilling' or genuine resale," he noted.       He explained that although resale of services to "closed usergroups" such as corporate private networks is permitted in Germany,"if it's real resale outside of corporate users, it's still areserved monopoly service until 1998."   The resale requirement wasone of several outlined by the FCC that may not "reflect the actualsituation in Germany," he said.     Briefing reporters, Mr. Harris said the inducement for Franceand Germany to stick to their alternative infrastructureliberalization deadline of July 1996--and for the French and Germancarriers to enter into agreements with other U.S. carriers toprovide public voice resale--will be the circuit activationrestriction on Sprint.       He clarified that the restriction will not apply to Sprint'sacquisition of new circuits but rather to its activation andoperation of new circuits on the French and German routes.     Asked how the restrictions differ from anticompetitivesafeguards sought by the Justice Department in a proposed antitrustconsent decree to allow the Phoenix venture to go forward (TRI,July 21, 1995, p. 1), Mr. Harris said, "The two overlap at theedges," differing largely because the responsibilities of DoJ andthe Commission are different.  While Justice oversees antitrustlaw, the Commission's statutory mandate to make public interestfindings enables it to "push for additional conditions" to ensuregreater competition, Mr. Harris said.       Both the FCC decision and the consent decree require thatSprint obtain no special concessions and receive nondiscriminatorytreatment vis-a-vis other U.S. international carriers, he said.       But the circuit activation restriction, the imposition ofdominant carrier regulation, and the requirement that the Phoenixalliance meet the Commission's new "effective competitiveopportunities" test for foreign market entry are unique to the FCCdecision, he explained.     In an introductory statement at the meeting, Mr. Harris notedthat "several weeks ago, this Commission adopted new rulesgoverning the entry of foreign carriers into the U.S. market.       "We said then that the new rules would both open our market tomore competition and create powerful incentives to open foreignmarkets to competition. . .This is the first opportunity we have toapply those rules, and it may be the most important suchopportunity we have for a long time to come."       He said the strict conditions proposed for an order approvingPhoenix constituted a recognition that "France Telecom and DeutscheTelekom are still monopolists operating in closed markets."     Asked by Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett whether there is arisk that the FCC may have to back-pedal on the decision if Franceand Germany do not stick to their liberalization timetables, Mr.Harris responded, "We do not offer you certainty, but this is ourbest judgment of where we think these things are going."       If the French and German market-opening commitments are notmet, the FCC might decide in 1998 to "pull" Sprint's CommunicationsAct section 214 facilities authorizations on the French and Germanroutes, he said.       That would adversely affect Sprint, but the test before theFCC is the impact  on "the U.S. public, consumers, and industry--not just one corporation," Mr. Harris said.  "Keep in mind thatSprint is getting $4 billion and is entering a relationship withtwo monopolists.    The key to approving this transaction today isthat those monopolists today will not be monopolists for all time,"he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996U.S. Regulatory Scene:Satellite Licensing Roundtable     The FCC International Bureau's "roundtable discussion" onsatellite licensing policies has been rescheduled for Jan. 26.  Themeeting has been postponed twice because of the U.S. governmentshutdown and the Blizzard of 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996U.S. Regulatory Scene:PanAmSat Seeks Satellite Licensing Policy Changes     PanAmSat Corp. has urged the FCC to prevent the "hardening ofthe competitive arteries" in the domestic fixed C- and Ku-bandsatellite industry by limiting the number of orbital resources asingle company may control.       That would "reinvigorate" the Commission's policy of allowingcompetitive entry into the domestic fixed satellite market,PanAmSat said.  It outlined its proposal in comments it planned tofile once the FCC reopened after the heavy snowfall that struckWashington recently.      Specifically, PanAmSat proposed three steps the FCC shouldtake "to correct the imbalance in competitive opportunities betweenexisting operators and new entrants" in the domestic satelliteindustry.  It suggested the following:     (1)  Limiting to five the number of domestic arc orbitallocations that any one entity or its affiliates may control;      (2)  Making the domestic-system financial qualificationsconsistent with those currently in place for separate internationalsatellite systems; and      (3)  Imposing strict requirements, at both the beginning andend of a satellite's life, to prevent the "warehousing" of orbitallocations.     PanAmSat said the domestic satellite industry is dominated bythree major players:  Hughes Communications, Inc., GE AmericanCommunications, and AT&T Corp.       Those players collectively control about 23 of the 31 domesticorbital arcs, it told the FCC.  As a result, it added, there is a"severe shortage" of domestic C- and Ku-band capacity, which inturn has led to "sharply increased rates" for capacity.       PanAmSat asserted that the FCC's own satellite replacement,system expansion, and financial qualification policies have"exacerbated" the scarcity of domestic arc resources.     The FCC's satellite replacement policy generally allowscompanies to launch a replacement satellite into the same locationas a previous one, PanAmSat noted.       Operators also are permitted to expand existing satellitesystems by acquiring additional orbital slots.       "The replacement and expansion policies, in tandem. . .haveallowed existing operators to lock up the vast majority of domesticarc orbital positions, and in turn, block the competitive entriesof newcomers," PanAmSat said.       "The replacement policy effectively has given incumbentssquatter's rights to their long-held orbital positions, [making] itvirtually impossible to dislodge existing operators from thelocations already under their control."     PanAmSat called the FCC's domestic "financial showing"standard--which requires operators to produce a current balancesheet showing sufficient assets to sustain a multimillion-dollarproject--an "insurmountable barrier to entry to smaller companies."      Application of the two-step separate international satellitesystem financial qualification standard will "encourage thedevelopment of a vibrant separate satellite system industry withoutburdening the Commission with laggards or speculators," the companymaintained.     Noting that the FCC had imposed limits on direct broadcastsatellite (DBS) orbital slots, PanAmSat said similar limits shouldbe imposed on the number of domestic orbital arcs controlled by oneentity.       Setting a limit of five slots would "strike the proper balancebetween preserving the Commission's long-standing competitive entrypolicies and rewarding existing operators for the substantialfinancial risks and significant investments associated with theestablishment and operation of existing satellite networks," ittold the FCC.     To prevent warehousing of orbital slots, PanAmSat suggestedthat the Commission require all satellite applicants to meet "clearconstruction and operational milestones."       Construction permits for satellites should be awarded on aconditional basis, subject to cancellation if entities do not meetsuch milestones, it said.  A permittee would become a licensee onlyif it successfully followed its prescribed timetable.       Also, when a satellite nears the end of its useful life, theCommission should examine whether the traffic it is carrying couldbe consolidated with traffic carried by other satellites owned bythe same operator, PanAmSat said.

Specifically, he highlighted the scheduled connection of TokyoTelecommunications Network (TTNet)--NTT's local loop rival in theTokyo metropolitan area--to NTT's subscriber network this month andthe agreements expected to be reached with cable TV telephonyproviders in February for similar network connections.     Mr. Kojima also stressed the benefits of concentratingresearch and development efforts in a single organization.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996Japan Telecom Survey:Personal Handyphone Use Expected To Lag Forecasts      TOKYO--Despite recruiting almost 620,000 subscribers in thefirst six months after starting service, Japan's personalhandyphone service (PHS) providers are playing catch-up with theirinitial subscriber forecasts.       Expectations of hitting the 2-million subscriber mark by theend of fiscal year 1995 in March 1996 likely will be dashed. Observers believe the actual figure could be as little as half thatnumber.      At the current pace of 130,000 new subscribers a month, PHSproviders will just top the 1 million level within the fiscal 1995time frame.  The below forecast results can be attributed to quicksteps taken by conventional cellular phone competitors to bringtheir prices down in order to keep customers away from the cheaper,newer PHS service.       In the past year, cellular providers have reduced initialsign-up fees and usage rates significantly.  They also switched toa system of open sale of handheld phone units, rather than leasingthem in a bundled package with cellular service.     One trend is apparent in the PHS market--Nippon Telegraph &Telephone Corp.'s (NTT's) grip on the telecommunications market isweakening.       In December 1995 NTT Personal Communications Network companiessigned up just 30,600 new subscribers, compared with 52,400 for thecompeting DDI Pocket Phone group companies and 51,300 for the Astelgroup companies.     The NTT Personal group hopes to stem this slide in marketshare by slashing its rates.  In a recent application to theMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications, the group indicated thatit will cut the usage rate for calls in the 20- to 30-kilometerrange from 100 yen to 50 yen.  For calls in the 30- to 60-kilometerrange, it proposed to cut the rate from 140 yen to 60 yen.       In both categories, the adjustments would make NTT Personal'srates comparable or as much as 25% lower than its rivals.  Whilethe DDI Corp.'s Pocket and Astel groups are expected to respondwith their own rate cuts, continuing capital requirements fornetwork expansion could delay their response.      The DDI Pocket group, however, has developed a PHS basestation with its partner companies Kyocera, Kyushu MatsushitaElectric, and Nittsuko that will reduce its investment costs byone-third its per-station costs.       The cost-effective base station should reduce DDI Pocket'sper-station cost and enable it to speed up its network expansion. --Japan telecom news coverage from Access Japan, Inc.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996European Survey:France Telecom Chairman Outlines Reorganization Plan      France Telecom Chairman Michel Bon recently disclosed a planto reorganize the state-owned telecommunications giant around fivebranches and outlined a strategy to prepare for competition in theEuropean telecom market beginning in 1998.       Speaking at a company meeting in Paris Dec. 20, Mr. Bon saidthe plan emphasizes the need to improve customer services andincrease demand for France Telecom's offerings.  It was devisedafter Mr. Bon spent three months in the field, talking with morethan 1,000 employees to understand France Telecom's operationsbetter.      French consumers use their telephone lines an average of eightminutes per day, while U.S. consumers spend about 20 minutes dailyon the telephone, Mr. Bon pointed out.  He said France Telecom mustincrease its 3% annual growth rate to a level approaching AT&TCorp.'s 9% growth rate.  At that growth level, France Telecom'straffic would increase from 120 billion minutes annually to 170billion minutes by the year 2000.  "This objective is realistic andattainable," Mr. Bon said.       The additional traffic is expected to come from increases inmobile telephony use, "improving the flow and efficiency oftraffic," and "encouraging new uses for telephones," such aspersonal computer applications, he explained.     The plan envisions reorganizing France Telecom around threeoperational branches and two functional branches.  The operationalareas would include consumer services, corporate services, andnetwork services, and the functional branches would include"development" and "resources."       An executive committee will be formed, composed of thePresident of France Telecom and the company's five BranchDirectors.  The panel's purpose is "to synthesize and coordinate"France Telecom's operations, with decisions being made "as close aspossible to the field within each branch," Mr. Bon said.  A"detailed implementation plan" for the reorganization will beannounced "in the next few weeks," he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996European Survey:Ericsson, Ascom Joint Venture Clears EC Competition Hurdle     The European Competition Commission has decided not to opposea wireless communications joint venture between Ericsson, Inc., ofSweden and Ascom of Switzerland.       The companies proposed in late November to establish theventure through Ascom's Swedish subsidiary, Ascom Tateco.  Theventure will develop, manufacture, and install on-site pagingsystems and equipment in markets where both parent companies havebeen active, the commission noted.     The commission's review of the on-site paging market foundthat the joint venture will be faced with "sufficient competition. . .from the present players, which are either strong multinationalcompanies such as Philips [Electronics NV], Bosch [GmbH], andMotorola, [Inc.] or are companies specialized in on-site paging,such as Multitone."       The commission said the market is composed of "largesophisticated customers. . .who are in a position to exercisesignificant bargaining power and who frequently use calls fortenders to award contracts."  Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996EU Telecom Survey:Mobile Services Directive Formally Approved by EC      The European Commission has formally adopted the Article 90directive (TRI, July 7, 1995, p. 6), opening European Union mobileand personal communications markets to full competition.  It isbased on comments to a "green paper" on mobile and personalcommunications issued in 1994 (TRI, May 13, 1994, p. 1).       The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusiveand special rights for mobile communications.  It establishes "openand fair licensing procedures" to authorize the launch of digitalservices GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), DCS 1800(the two frequencies available for digital mobile services), andDECT (for digital cordless telephony within a fixed radius).       The directive requires states to lift restrictions on currentlicensees for one of these frequencies from applying to extendtheir services into the others.  It prohibits member states of theEuropean Union from restricting the combination of mobiletechnologies or systems, specifically where multistandard equipmentis available.     Existing restrictions on the use of mobile network facilitieswill be lifted, the EC said, "allowing new mobile operators to makefull use of their own infrastructure as well as that provided bythird parties such as utilities' networks."     The EC said the directive will become effective 20 days afterpublication in the Official Journal of the EC, which is expected bythe end of January.       Member states then have nine months to notify the commissionof the appropriate national measures taken to implement thedirective's provisions.       Under Article 90, the commission can adopt directives underits own authority without submitting them for approval by theministers and Parliament.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996EU Telecom Survey:EC Expected To Approve Atlas, Phoenix Ventures     BRUSSELS--The European Commission has said it will approve theAtlas alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG andtheir Phoenix global services alliance with Sprint Corp.       While stating its intent to approve the two ventures, thecommission is seeking comments on the deals by the end of January.      It recently released details of the two deals and outlinedcertain changes made following its intervention.      One change for the Phoenix alliance requires Deutsche Telekom,France Telecom, Atlas, and Sprint to delete France Telecom's andDeutsche Telekom's international half-circuits from the list ofproducts that Phoenix would distribute as an agent.       The companies also are prohibited from either competing withor investing in long distance service providers unless they arecontrolled by Phoenix.  The commission prohibited Deutsche Telekomand France Telecom from discriminating in favor of the Phoenixentities.       For the Atlas venture, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekomhave agreed to the following changes:  not to appoint Atlas SA asan agent for international half-circuits; not to integrate Frenchand German data networks before full liberalization of thetelecommunications infrastructure and services market; and not tointegrate France Telecom's German corporate telecom serviceprovider, Info AG, into Atlas.  They agreed Info AG must bedivested.       In addition Atlas will not be granted terms or conditions thatwould enable it to offer services its competitors are preventedfrom offering, the commission said.      France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are prohibited fromengaging in cross-subsidization.  They have agreed to establish andmaintain third-party access to their public switched data networksin France and Germany.     While the commission is unlikely to reverse its decision togrant approval to both ventures, it is expected that a number ofnational telecom operators will file complaints with theCompetition Directorate.

Steven Micossi, the European Commission Director General forIndustry, said at a recent conference that "all basic decisionshave now been taken by the commission" for the telecom sector.  Mr.Micossi's remarks were made during the annual European InformationTechnologies Conference (EITC) held in Brussels.     "Some member states need to be convinced that privatization[in] the industry will be beneficial," he acknowledged.  "At anyrate, by January 1998 there will be a de facto open market for thetelecom industry in Europe, where open competition will be able todevelop," Mr. Micossi added.       Organized by the commission's Directorate General forIndustry, the EITC conference explored social and cultural issuesraised by the ongoing evolution of European informationtechnologies.  The conference also highlighted the European Union's"Esprit" communications research and development program.     Speaking to reporters after the conference, Martin Bangemann,Commissioner for Industrial Affairs, Information, andTelecommunications Technologies, outlined initiatives the EuropeanUnion has begun to ensure that Europe is prepared for the evolvinginformation society.       He said significant progress has been made on the firstinitiative--to deregulate EU telecom markets.  He emphasizedcommitments by France and Germany to liberate alternativeinfrastructure markets by July 1, 1996.     To accomplish goals for deregulation, legislation must be inplace addressing intellectual property rights, data protection, andcompetition, Commissioner Bangemann said.  Outdated laws, based onolder technologies, must be modified.       He stated that mergers between companies in different sectorsof the communications industry sometimes may be necessary tostrengthen the telecom sector of the EU's economy.       Several pilot projects initiated as a result of the G7ministerial conference earlier this year will spur the developmentof information technologies and will make Europeans aware of someof the practical applications of those technologies, he said.     Asked about the need to establish an independent EU telecomauthority, Mr. Bangemann said it would be unwise to put the issueon the agenda for the EU Inter-Governmental Conference slated fornext year.  The issue is highly sensitive and should be examinedcarefully before a proposal is presented to Europe's politicalleaders, he said.     In a speech during the conference, Michael Spindler, Presidentand Chief Executive Officer of Apple Computer, Inc., compared thecurrent information technologies revolution to the sixth century"knowledge explosion which resulted from the definition of thealphabet and mathematics."       The current technology revolution will have dramatic economicimpact, he said, citing projections that the U.S. informationindustry will amount to $1 trillion by the year 2000 and $1.5trillion by 2005.       Although computer hardware and software will constitute thelargest markets, communications and content development marketswill be important as well, Mr. Spindler predicted.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS REPORTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996EU Telecom Survey:Competition Study To Be Done on 'Information Society'     BRUSSELS--A resolution recently adopted by the EuropeanUnion's Council of Ministers calls for a study of the effects thatthe "information society" will have on competition in variouseconomic sectors.

The Kansas Corporation Commission on Dec.29 unanimously approved the company's five-year "TeleKansas"plan (TW, June 12), as modified by a settlement agreementreached early in November between the telco and commissionstaff.  The text of the commission's ruling should be releasedby the end of January, according to an agency spokesman.Earlier, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved athree-year experimental regulatory plan negotiated betweenPSC staff, Southwestern Bell, and the Office of Public Counsel(TW, Oct. 2).The Texas Public Utility Commission is scheduled to beginhearings on Southwestern Bell's "Texas First" plan on Jan.22.  A company spokeswoman said that proceeding is not subjectto a statutory time limit.  She noted that the number ofwitnesses scheduled to participate could push the hearingsalone, "in a worst case scenario," into six months.In the Texas proceeding, PUC staff also has proposed thatSouthwestern Bell's revenues be reduced by $392,000,000 (TW,Nov. 13).  The company's Texas First proposal would reduceits revenues by $72,000,000 annually (TW, Jan. 16).Under the alternative regulatory plan approved in Kansas,basic local rates for business and residential customers willremain at current levels for five years.  These rates will notbe adjusted, as the company had originally proposed, by aConsumer Price Index/productivity measurement mechanism.Over the five-year period, the company will make ratereductions totaling $110,700,000 for toll, intrastate/interLATAaccess charges, Touch-Tone, residential service connectioncharges, and other services.The company also will undertake a network modernization programwith an estimated value of $160,000,000 over five years.Under the program, Southwestern Bell will upgrade all 131 ofits remaining electromechanical switching offices to digitalcapability.  The telco also will be permitted flexible pricingon certain services, such as billing and collection, directoryservices, MicroLink I and II (packet switched), Plexar I andII (Centrex-like), and custom calling.  Instead of the usual30 days, Southwestern Bell may file rate changes for theseservices subject to commission approval in 20 days.  Thecommission still could act within the 20-day limit to suspendrates for the full 240-day period, according to the approvedplan.The commission also ruled that while the plan is in place,neither Southwestern Bell nor commission staff will seek toalter the rates or earnings of the company.  During thisperiod, other alternative regulatory plans will be exploredand evaluated, it said, noting that it is "not the intention"to "return to rate base regulation at the end of the fiveyears."In the first year of the plan, a $2,000,000 cut in accesscharges and a $17,100,000 reduction in intraLATA toll rateswould take effect.

Pacific Telesis currentlyemploys fewer than 69,000 persons.  Of that number, 64,000work for Pacific Bell, the group's main operations affiliate.Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, PacificBell's work force has been reduced by 21% or about 17,000employees, the company said.  Together with increased operatingefficiencies and growth in the California market, thedownsizing has led to telephone rate reductions of more than$1 billion since the Bell System breakup, Pacific Telesis said.Pacific Telesis Chairman Sam Ginn said the force reductionswill occur primarily in Pacific Bell, where about 7600 non-salaried and 3400 management positions are to be eliminated.Another 50 positions among the holding company staff will becut.  Mr. Ginn noted that Nevada Bell, the group's smallertelco operating company, recently completed an early retirementoffering that trimmed management ranks by 33%.  Pacific Telesissaid it expects the downsizing to reduce labor costssubstantially over five years and does not expect the costsof implementing the force reductions to affect net incomesignificantly.The company said its early retirement plan will be a permanentchange to existing pension plans for eligible employees inselected organizations.  Credit for an additional three years'service with the company and three years of age will be offeredin "selected organizations" within Pacific Bell and the holdingcompany staff.  The company said employees would be givendetails of the offering within a week of the Jan. 4announcement.  In addition, Pacific Bell managers whose jobsare identified as surplus but who are not eligible for theearly retirement offering will be given the option of acceptingretraining for other positions within the corporation,accepting downgrades to other positions, or accepting an "exitpackage," Pacific Telesis said.It said the elimination of 50 jobs at the holding companylevel is expected to be completed this year.  The downsizingeffort will include the early retirement offer, retraining,downgrades, and an out-placement package for eligibleemployees.  Surplus holding company-level employees will begiven full consideration for job openings in subsidiaries,the company added.  The force reduction program will not affectthe group's diversified companies, which include PacTelCellular, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTelBusiness Systems, and PacTel Properties.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS WEEK via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1990MARKEY URGES CONSUMERS TO GET INVOLVED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONSPOLICY LEGISLATIVE EFFORTHouse telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Edward J.

The group also discussed conducting a survey ofall NARUC members on their views about lifting the AT&Tantitrust consent decree restrictions.  The committee haddecided at its meetings last summer (TW, July 31) to hold aneducational, closed-door session similar to one conducted inl986 at Dartmouth College.  At the Dartmouth gathering, stateregulators had studied BOC line-of-business relief and publicnetwork advancement issues before developing a consensus foruse in the first triennial review of the consent decree'srestrictions.The purpose of the "son of Dartmouth" California gatheringwas to revisit the committee's MFJ resolutions, particularlyin light of legislation pending before Congress to lift BOCbusiness prohibitions.  Commissioners devoted most of the lasttwo days of the conference to discussing MFJ relief positionoptions.  Development of a specific resolution on a groupconsensus would be left for the NARUC winter meetings scheduledfor the last week of February.  Observers noted that fromcommissioners' discussions, it was hard to pin down whether aconsensus existed on modifying any of the decree restrictions.Although some commissioners reportedly wondered aloud whatthe harm would be in lifting the information services bar,for example, any consensus on this specific issue was unclearfollowing the discussions.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS WEEK via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1990ONA CONFERENCE MEMBERS FROM AMERITECH REGION SUGGEST TRIALS OFTARIFFING APPROACHESAmeritech region state members of the federal-state jointconference on open network architecture (ONA) issues haveproposed a means of letting the Bell regional holdingcompanies' ONA plans be implemented without waiting forresolution of jurisdictional tariffing issues.  The Dec. 19memorandum to fellow joint board members, signed by MichiganPublic Service Commission Chairman William E. Long and OhioPublic Utilities Commissioner Gloria L. Gaylord, notedconsensus among conference members on several major policyareas.  The only contentious issue, they said, is the degreeto which ONA services should be tariffed at the federal level.They pointed out that Ameritech region regulators jointlyhave filed comments supporting that RHC's "dual tariffing"approach.  Rather than calling for a delay in ONAimplementation at the federal level until the tariffing issueis resolved, the two commissioners urged that the agency adoptone or more regional plans on an experimental basis.They offered the Ameritech region plan as one of the approachesthat should be tried.  "It is our view that concurrent approvalby the FCC of several plans would serve to launch the ONAprocess and, at the same time, permit actual experience withalternative programs to supplant what seems to be endlessrhetoric and debate on this subject," the regulators said.They stressed that "the actual experience gained in this areawould allow for a more comprehensive and insightful examinationof potential problems involving the federal tariffing of ONAservices.  Since certain regions appear to have legitimateconcerns regarding this issue, they would have the benefit ofvaluable information gleaned from the experience of otherswhich would enable them to make more fully informed decisionsin this regard.  Indeed, the conservative approach that wehave just outlined seems well calculated to accomplish notonly the commencement of ONA in some regions, but afford othersadditional time to study the situation."In noting areas of accord among conference members, the four-page memorandum mentioned "unanimous agreement that the costallocation procedures outlined in the FCC's part 36(separations) rules should not produce any significant mismatchof costs and revenues resulting from the implementation ofONA at either the state or federal levels."  It also observedthat the conference is "in almost total agreement that maximumuniformity should be achieved with respect to ONA to thegreatest extent possible."In addition, the document stated that the conference is "ingeneral agreement that certain ONA offerings must be filed atthe state level.  Notwithstanding the various (third computerinquiry court) appeals" (TW, Jan. 17), "intrastate filings ofONA services should recognize the statutory authority reservedfor the state commissions in determining the terms andconditions of intrastate BSEs (basic service elements) and(basic serving arrangements)," they noted.At the joint conference's last public meeting in November,New York Public Service Commission Deputy Chairman GailGarfield Schwartz had suggested that the FCC could forbearfrom requiring the interstate tariffing of BSEs, withoutreaching the jurisdictional question (TW, Nov. 20).  Stateversus federal tariffing is one of the issues before the FCCin reconsideration pleas lodged against its order grantingconditional approval of Bell operating companies' initial ONAplans (TW, Nov. 21, 1988), and in its docket 89-79 proceedingon access charge changes required for an ONA environment (TW,April 3).Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOMMUNICATIONS WEEK via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1990OREGON ORDERS U S WEST TO CUT REVENUES BY $24,057,000, LETDIRECTORY ADS SUPPORT COSTSThe Oregon Public Utility Commission has ordered U S WestCommunications to reduce its revenues by $24,057,000 thisyear, "so that U S West customers will receive benefits fromtelephone directory advertising profits."  As a result of theruling, U S West Communications' local and toll rates will becut by approximately 5% for residential and business customers.The PUC criticized the company for attempting to withholdfrom its Oregon customers the benefits of a telephone directorypublishing agreement with U S West Direct.  Despite the telco's"representation that the public would benefit from thepublishing agreement and asset transfer (in 1984), U S Westformulated a corporate strategy in 1986 to divert directoryprofits from ratepayers to stockholders," the PUC said."The company acknowledged that the strategy would cause localrates to increase, but (it) nevertheless concluded that itshould pursue the goal of flowing as many dollars to theshareowners as possible, while minimizing the risk ofimputations from regulatory agencies," the PUC noted.  Itstated that information gathered in the investigation of U SWest Communications' rates showed that in 1985, thecontribution from directory advertising was $40.10 annuallyper customer.Specifically, the PUC directed that the telco's Oregon revenuerequirement include approximately $29,000,000 in profits fromdirectory advertising.  At the same time, the PUC orderedadjustments in U S West's revenue requirement related to otherissues.  As one of these adjustments, it allowed the telco torecover in rates approximately $6,500,000 for research anddevelopment supplied by Bell Communications Research.

Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in fivecircles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlierreopened the tender for 13 licences following the notification ofminimum bids prices (TNA November 30, 1995).Paul Rea, a Telstra spokesman, told Telenews Asia that althoughIndia remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of$US2.5 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, thepresent uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basicservices licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek thelicence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternativeinvestment strategies.Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other internationalcarriers, with Indian partners, in managing basic regionaltelecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has beenapproached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he wasnot prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out, however,that Telstra has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, tohead up its New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates thatTelstra considers India one of its most important overseasinvestment areas, according to Rea.Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building itstechnology transfer relationship with C-Dot and focusing more oncellular services (see story below).The uncertainties referred to by Rea include India's largestopposition party, the Bharatiaya Janata Party, which is widely tippedto win April general elections, threatening to cancel Congress-awarded telecommunications licences (TNA December 14, 1995)and eight separate Supreme Court petitions which seek toinvalidate the DoT's authority to award licences. The petitions relateto the failure of the Congress government to establish atelecommunications regulatory body before opening thetelecommunications sector to foreign investment (TNA September7, 1995).On 9 January the Court postponed until 16 January a hearing intothe petitions. Until the Court rules on the petitions DoT remainspowerless to award licences to any consortium. DoT had earliernotified a Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd-led consortiumthat it had won four licences and a Hughes-led consortium that ithad won one licence (TNA November 30, 1995).The six consortia willing to meet the DoT's minimum licence feewere: Bell Canada/Tata with $US1.2 billion in Andhra Pradesh;NTT/Goekna with $US3.2 billion in Tamil Nadu; Bell Atlantic/Essarwith $US1.3 billion in Punjab; Nynex/Reliance with $US0.9 billionin Gujarat; Moscow Telecom/Usha with $US0.7 billion in Bihar. AStet/Bharti consortium also submitted a bid for Punjab.The DoT received no bids for Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, MadhyaPradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, eastern Uttar Pradesh, theAndaman and Nicobar Islands and the north-east region.Meanwhile, the BJP-led state government of Maharastra hascleared the US power company Enron to resume work on the$US920 million first stage of a power project which represents thelargest ever foreign investment in India. Enron's difficulties with thenationalist-BJP have been keenly watched by foreign investors inIndia as a test case should the BJP win overall government in April.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELENEWS ASIA via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996INDIA - GOVERNMENT SET TO APPROVE PARTNER SWAPPINGThe Department of Telecommunications (DoT) looks set to approvea proposal by Modicom Networks Ltd to replace the US' VanguardCellular with Australia's Telstra as equity partner in running cellularservices in Karnataka and Punjab.The proposal comes after DoT announced on 12 December that ithad awarded 18 licences to run cellular services in regional areas.The Modi group currently holds 51 percent equity in Modicom, withVanguard holding 26 percent and Thailand's Telecom Asia holdingthe remaining 23 percent.If Modicom's proposal is accepted it will likely encourage otherIndian-led consortia to swap foreign partners in equityarrangements for both cellular and basic service licences.

Hutchison has already invested in 15small paging networks in the Nanjing military region.If CESEC goes ahead with its paging project, it will be up againsttough competition from hundreds of private, regional post andtelecommunications authorities and state sector networks, not leastthe Singapore Telecom-backed Beijing Asia Pacific First StarCommunications Technology Co Ltd which plans to inaugurate itsown national paging system in the middle of 1996 - about a yearlater than planned.Hutchison has a 51 percent stake in the company installing theNanjing cellular network, which will have initial capacity for 10,000subscribers. The network will be operated by CESEC in deferenceto China's prohibition on foreign direct investment intelecommunication services. Fok said that he believed the networkwould likely be upgraded to CDMA in future and discussions arealready in progress to integrate the Nanjing system into the PLA'sother public cellular networks being installed in China's coastalprovinces (TNA July 27, 1995).A third joint venture with Hutchison has been formed with CESEC todevelop trunked radio services in China. Fok declined to elaborateas the projects were still in the early planning stages.Hutchison is not the first foreign player to consider offering financeand technical expertise for the PLA's cellular network in Nanjing.Star Paging and AT&T were among foreign operators previouslycourted to build a system there, but successive attempts to launchservices failed because of the reluctance of the localtelecommunications authorities to provide PSTN access.However a policy shift by the Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications in late 1995 enabled CESEC to start offeringpublic cellular services and these will be extended to 15 cities bythe end of 1996 using its national allocation of 10 MHz of AMPS Aband spectrum, previously reserved for military use, and acombination of analogue AMPS and TDMA networks.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELENEWS ASIA via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996CHINA - GUANGDONG NEEDS FOREIGNERS FOR BROADBANDNETWORKGuangdong province plans to invest $US24 billion within 15 yearsto construct a broadband telecommunications network and needsforeign participation, according to the China Daily.The newspaper quotes a Guangdong Post andTelecommunications official, Liu Kejun, as saying that in order todevelop the broadband communications network, foreign investorsare "welcome to participate" in equipment purchase, leasing, andpersonnel training.Liu said that because the central government has not definedpolicies on foreign participation in broadband technology there arelikely to be more opportunities available than with basictelecommunication services. Watching for the huge market potentialof China's telecoms, many foreign companies, therefore, aremaking efforts to enter this sector, hoping to participate in networkoperations, Liu said.However, Liu suggested that broadband network operations shouldstill be controlled by the government's posts andtelecommunications administrations, while broadband businessservices could be run by other organisations, including foreigncompanies.Liu also suggested that telecommunications-related laws andregulations need to be perfected, and that the government shouldmaintain good coordination between broadband network operatorsand service providers.

Other networks in Sumatra,West Java, Central Java and Kalimantan are set to change handsby the middle of January.The KSOs are the key to a government plan to add five milliontelephone lines to the Indonesian telecommunications system bythe end of 1999.A spokesman for Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, which is to operate theSumatra KSO, outlined the company's plans in an interview withThe Jakarta Post saying that it would take over the management of600,000 existing lines in Sumatra and install a further 516,487.The spokesman said that 7000 Telkom employees would joinPramindo which is 59 percent owned by PT Astratel Nusantara, asubsidiary of the Indonesian Astra International group, 35 percentowned by France Cable et Radio, a subsidiary of France Telecom,with a further six percent owned by Primkopparpostel, a cooperativeof the employees of the Ministry of Tourism, Post andTelecommunications and PT Intertel Pratama Media.According to the spokesman, Telkom's regional division office inMedan will become a KSO unit and will maintain the old billingsystem for existing subscribers.

It will be 2,300 kilometres long and pass throughall the nation's major cities.Delgado also said that Teleophil will lease Napocor's dark fibre andabsorb the cost of terminal equipment.Teleophil is investing $US150 million in the NDTN to compete withthe Philippine Long Distance Telephone company's (PLDT) existingbackbone. In November Teleophil announced that because theeight participants in the consortium each have individual authorityfrom the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) tooperate as carriers the consortium will not have to apply to theCongress for a franchise for the project, an obstacle which hasbedevilled Belltel's attempt to become the major competitor toPLDT's nationwide monopoly of services (TNA November 30,1995).

Optus Vision securedagreements from a number of power utilities for access to theirabove ground distribution network and has been installing cableson power poles in Australian suburbs for several months. Pay TVservices commenced on the network late in 1995.Telstra retaliated by forming a joint venture with News Ltd, Foxtel, tooffer pay TV services and installing its own hybrid fibre coaxialnetwork, but initially for pay TV only. Telstra, however is primarilyusing its existing network of underground ducts to install its cable.Both carriers enjoy exemption from local government planningrequirements but are required to consult with councils and the localcommunity under a telecommunications national code beforeinstalling and telecommunications infrastructure.A number of councils have objected to Optus Vision's unsightlyabove ground cables and have initiated legal action accusing thecompany of breaching the code in its handling of the consultationprocess.The councils scored their first victory in late December when ajudge in the Victorian Supreme Court granted a temporaryinjunction restraining Optus Vision from further cabling in the city ofBoroondara. The judge found that the provisions of the FederalTelecommunications Act which grant exemption are so wide as tocreate widespread uncertainty in their application. The council'slawyer had argued that the exemptions could even be invoked togrant Optus employees exemption from state speed limits. Thejudge also said it was arguable that the exemptions, granted to thecarrier Optus Communications, could not be claimed by its OptusVision subsidiary.The code was due for review before mid 1997 as part of a policy toend the Optus Telstra duopoly and open up the market to greatercompetition and Communications Minister Michael Lee announcedon 20 December that the exemption from state and localgovernment planning rules would be removed.However critics of the government say that this will be too late.Telstra and Optus are racing to build their networks as fast aspossible in the belief that the first network in an area will have astrong advantage and deter the competitor from duplicating it.Telstra has repeatedly insisted that it would not be practicable topermit Optus to share its cable ducts, but the government is comingunder increasing pressure to force it to do so or make some otherpolicy change to halt what many see as an unnecessary and costlyduplication of infrastructure.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELENEWS ASIA via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996AUSTRALIA - DRAFT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACTRELEASEDThe Australian Government has released a for-comment draft ofnew telecommunications legislation that will come into effect in July1997. It will replace the current 1991 legislation which ended thegovernment owned carrier's monopoly on basic services in favourof liberal resale and a duopoly on basic services.The draft comprises two main items of legislation, theTelecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices(Telecommunications) Amendments Bill 1996.The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers toentry into all telecommunications services but will limit the marketpower of the incumbents by instituting access codes under whichthey will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.Under the draft bill legislative control on competition will be shiftedinto general competition law under the Trade Practices Act,administered by the newly formed Australian Competition andConsumer Commission (ACCC) the necessary amends to that Actare contained in the Trade Practices (Telecommunications)Amendments Bill 1996.Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers andcarriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but maybe declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in thetelecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantialcontrol over customers through its own switches is likely to bedeclared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmissioninfrastructure.A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access toits services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.The draft legislation is based on a set of 99 proposals developed bythe Department of Communications and the Arts and released on 1August 1995 (TNA August 10 1995). Co-incident with the release ofthe draft legislation, the government issued a further 39 proposals.The additional proposals seek to minimise government control overtechnical regulation which will be "primarily addressed throughindustry self regulation involving affected groups includingconsumers". However the industry regulator, to be formed by themerger of Austel and the Spectrum Management Agency, will havea reserve power to mandate standards where appropriate or whereself regulation fails.Standards will be required to be based on international andregional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and serviceproviders will be free to develop their own network standards butthese must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customerequipment and cabling standards.The controversial Telecommunications National Code under whichthe existing carriers enjoy protection from state and localgovernment planning requirements will be reviewed and carrierswill cease to have power to override planning rules.The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELENEWS ASIA via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996NEW ZEALAND - TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BYLEGAL ACTIONThe battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communicationsand Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late Decemberwhen Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing TelecomNew Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TVprogramming agreement with Sky Television.Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's twolargest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV andbroadband services and has tried to gain programming through theagreement with Sky.

Even after deducting operating costs, the return oninvestment was triple the operating costs.Taiwanese companies that have reportedly expressed an intentionto bid for operating licenses include: Pacific Electric Wire & CableCo; Walsin Lihwa Electric Wire & Cable Co; President EnterprisesGroup; Koo's Group; Taiwan Electrical and Electric Manufacturers'Association; Vidar Sun Moon Star Co; Acer Inc; Fubon Insurance;Chinese Automobile Co; Sin Kong Life Insurance Co; China RebarCo; and Taiwan Telecom Network Service Company.International companies which have already arranged jointventures with Taiwanese companies include: BT, Vodafone,Singapore Telecom, Hongkong Telecom, AT&T, McCaw CellularCommunications, Bell South Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp.One foreign telecommunications official is quoted as saying thatforeign companies assumed that the privatisation process would beless open and they therefore used political considerations anddiplomatic influence rather than know-how to form alliances withlocal companies.However, the passage of the privatisation bill will now see the DGTonly issue licenses through financial bidding and therefore therewill be a free-for-all.The DGT held a public hearing on 15 December to discussfrequency allocation and decided to open the 900 MHz and 1,800MHz frequencies to private mobile phone communicationsoperators, as well as frequencies between 284.5 MHz and 285.5MHz to private paging communications operators.For the mobile phone frequencies, 1,800 MHz will be open tooperators of digital systems while the 900 MHz frequency will beopen to operators of GSM systems.DGT's initial plan is for the 1,800 MHz frequency to cover the entireisland, while the 900 MHz frequency can be either divided into threeregions or can cover the island. The government favours dividingthe band from 284.5 MHz and 285.5 MHz into three regions.According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC)statement, capitalisation of at least $NT2 billion ($US74 million) willbe required for a regional mobile phone operator and capitalisationof at least $NT6 billion ($US222 million) will be needed for anisland-wide mobile phone operator.For paging communications operators, capitalisation of at least$NT200 million ($US7.4m) will be needed for regional operationsand capitalisation of at least of $NT400 million ($US15m) will beneeded for island-wide operations.Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co (PEWC) has criticised the form ofDGT privatisation, saying that it will favour large corporations. LeeTa-cheng, PEWC's president, says that bidding was anirresponsible measure "because the student who makes the bestscore in a contest may not be the richest student." Besides thosewho win the bid with sky-high prices may try to get back their outlayfrom their clients, according to Lee. "Although PEWC is also aconsortium, this method that benefits only consortia should bechanged."MOTC officials responded that bidding is the fairest way for entrantsbecause it can prevent the authority in charge of the bid from beinglobbied, and because bidding can help increase national revenues.Some experts predict that by 2000 Taiwan will be among theworld's top 10 mobile phone using countries. The mobile phonepopulation is currently 600,000, with a monthly increase of some20,000 users.

The amount of the DRs have not yet been decided,but the official expected it to be around $US150 million.% Japan's NTT has disclosed its estimates of the cost of splitting it upinto separate entities. Before a meeting of the TelecommunicationCouncil, the panel affiliated with the posts and telecommunicationsminister, NTT said on 9 January that a breakup into threecompanies - one long-distance operator and two regionalcompanies covering the eastern and western parts of Japan wouldcreate a tax burden of around 1.800 trillion Yen ($US17.1b)% The overall amount of capital outlays by Japanesetelecommunications companies in the fiscal year through 31 March1996 is expected to grow 21 percent from a year earlier to 3.700trillion Yen ($US35b). In a survey carried out in October 1995 by theministry covering 1,021 domestic telecommunications companies,investment expectations were revised up from the 14 percentincrease that was predicted in a March 1995 survey.

It is said, for example, that oneweekday edition of The New York Times contains more knowledgethan a man in the 16th century was exposed to in a lifetime.     The beginning of this century saw the dawn of thecommunications revolution: sending messages by both wire andthrough the air.  In the last half of this century, we masteredsending messages to space and back, and created a wholly newmedium: pulses of light rather than electricity.  We have filledthe air--the spectrum--with so much information that we arechallenged to find ways to increase the capacity of our radiosystems.     Human culture, society and personality are all functions ofcommunication.  Thus, each advancement in our ability tocommunicate alters the fabric of culture, society, andpersonality.     Christian Schwarz-Schilling, West Germany's minister ofposts and telecommunications, reflected this when he recentlytold a luncheon audience in Washington:  "Whatever may have beenresponsible for the onset of the democratic movements in Poland,Hungary and East Germany, it can be said that this would not havehappened without telecommunications.  Without telecommunications,information on the free West would not have penetrated thecommunist countries, which were sealed off from the outer worldby barbed wire and walls.  Without telecommunications, the callfor freedom would not have spread so rapidly."     As we enter this decade, we are about to radically alter ourplanet.  The miracle of flight is credited with shrinking theEarth...of compressing time.     The miracle of telecommunications is beginning to dosomething even more miraculous: it is eliminating time anddistance all together.  It is putting the entire community of manin instant contact with one another, and will increase thecommunal power to communicate, transact and inform.     Most other industries that are international in scope onlyimport and export.  Goods are produced in one country and sold inanother.  There is a growing element of that type ofinternational business in telecommunications as well, but thereis another, more unique, aspect to telecommunications in the"global village": the provision of global communications requirespartnering and cooperation to a far greater degree than meretrading.     Some of the events of 1989 foreshadow what the telecombusiness climate of the next decade will become:     MCI and the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. have alreadyagreed on a protocol, and are forming a joint venture to linktheir videoconferencing networks.     AT&T wants to expand telecom circuits between the SovietUnion and the United States using Russia's Intersputnik satellitesystem.  Last month, AT&T introduced direct dialing between theUnited States and Moscow.     AT&T, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), and British Telecomintroduced digital services among their 3 countries and enteredcalling card billing agreements.  They are also offeringinternational ISDN.  The 3 companies continue to sign agreementswith carriers in other countries expanding this internationalISDN network.     KDD has opened offices in New York and London.     Voicecom is partnering with British Telecom to offer voicemessaging in the United Kingdom and Europe.     Nynex International and the Telecommunications Authority ofSingapore have agreed to cooperate on joint marketing andtechnical studies.     U S West acquired CATV companies in the United Kingdom andHong Kong, and is in a joint venture with Magyar Posta to build acellular network in Hungary.     Telefind signed an agreement with Japan Steel Works and hasaffiliations in other countries around the world to create aglobal paging network.     PacTel is part of a consortium awarded a license to buildand operate a cellular system in West Germany.  BellSouth is in aconsortium that has inaugurated cellular mobile service in BuenosAires.     The U.S. Commerce Department organized telecom tradedelegations to Zurich and Vienna in Europe, and to Mexico,Colombia and Venezuela.  It also has slated its second SoutheastAsia Telecommunications Conference in Pattaya, Thailand from Feb.26 to March 1, 1990.     This list is just an example of thousands of newinternational business arrangements, cooperative ventures, jointventures, and distribution agreements that have been formed bytelecommunications companies.  Such international ventures arenot limited to the multi-billion dollar companies in thebusiness.  Newbridge Networks, for instance, signed adistribution agreement with Sumitomo; formed a joint venture withthe Soviet Ministry of Radio; and, in 2 years, became the secondlargest supplier of multiplexers in Europe.  FarmsteadInternational has formed joint ventures in China to refurbish andmarket AT&T central office switches.     The process that will drive the next decade is a closedloop: to increase international business and commerce requiresthat we provide better international communications.  The act ofcreating the infrastructure for better internationalcommunications, in turn, increases international business.     The technical pieces are all in place:     Voice messaging eliminates the barriers of time zones.     The digitization of telephone networks worldwide providesthe platform.  Hong Kong, for instance, plans to have a 100%digital network in place by 1993.     ISDN integrates all communications media for transport.     Fiber optics exponentially decreases the cost per circuit.     Technologies such as facsimile, E-mail, and text-to-speechmake it possible to integrate messaging media.     Technologies like IMMC's Ultraphone and Solarex's solarpower sources for telecom mean that sophisticated communicationscan be brought affordably to areas other than those of greatpopulation density.     Increased processing power at a lower cost, coupled withincredibly sophisticated programming skills, will bringinstantaneous computerized translation to communications,eliminating the final barrier between peoples--that of language.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELEPHONE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990     *TELEPHONE NEWS salutes its readers and industry for the     *TELEPHONE NEWS salutes its readers and industry for thegiant strides it has made in the last century, and for itsemerging global perspective today.

The newlyannounced service was developed over the past 2 years by U S WestCommunications; U S West Advanced Technologies; StratusComputers; and Mitel.     U S West will initially market the new E9-1-1 service in its14-state service area after completing additional technical andmarketing trials.  The new architecture will also be available in1990 to national and international customers for installation andtesting in trial sites.     Current E9-1-1 service consists of networking that includesfacilities and routing of calls placed to 9-1-1; the database,which includes every telephone number and service address in agiven 9-1-1 service area; and customer premise equipment (CPE).In most cases, the database and networking portions of theservice are leased from the local telco, and are available onlythrough specific types of central offices (COs).  The answeringand dispatch centers, usually part of local police or governmentoperations, generally purchase the CPE equipment from a varietyof vendors.     U S West Advanced Technologies developed proprietaryapplications software to run the system, and Mitel's GX5000, witha Host Command Interface protocol, provides the switchingfunctions.  The Stratus XA 2000 performs the necessary functionsto generate and translate information, tells the switch where todirect the emergency phone call, and displays information aboutthe source of the call to E9-1-1 dispatch terminals.U S WEST'S NEW E9-1-1 IS PORTABLE, USES ONLY 1 NETWORK, & LESSEXPENSIVE CPE     U S West's new E9-1-1 system contrasts from current E9-1-1technology in that existing E9-1-1 systems require 2 separatenetworks--one for voice and the caller's phone number--and thesecond, a data network, retrieves and delivers the caller'slocation information.  The new U S West E9-1-1 softwareintegrates both voice and data retrieval information into onesystem, and then sends that information simultaneously to thedispatch center.     The new E9-1-1 platform will also allow customers to useless expensive CPE in answering and dispatch centers.  CPErequirements include a data terminal with 12 function keys, astandard single line telephone, a notification device and aprinter.  In 1991, an optional interface for computer-aideddispatching systems will be available from U S West.     Lastly, the U S West service is portable and can be deployedin any CO.  According to U S West, each service platform, orfeature node, will accommodate from below 30,000 subscriber linesto over 300,000 lines, but the best economic results are realizedbetween 30,000 and 300,000 access lines.  Future plans includemultiple platforms that could be tied together--utilizing anoptional intertandem transfer feature--to support additionallines.INTERFACE WILL ALLOW NEW SERVICE TO WORK WITH ANY CO     U S West filed its network disclosure statement with the FCCin November and will begin an 8-month internal technical trial ofthe service in Fremont County, Wyo., (county pop: 16,800)beginning in May 1990.  The new E9-1-1 is scheduled fordeployment by U S West in its area during first-quarter 1991.     "Inside our region, we will be marketing the system as aturnkey solution," said Ken White, manager for public safetyproduct development for U S West Communications.  "Outside ourarea, due to the MFJ, all U S West will be selling is thesoftware package, and we're still in the process of developingco-marketing arrangements with systems integrators.  U S Westdeveloped the software specifically for Stratus, and Mitel wasthe only CO switch manufacturer that could give us an interfaceto manipulate the service.     "The transport costs between a small community and a CO canbe expensive.  Our new platform application puts service closerto the community and reduces those transport charges.  Ourplatform has been designed, but we are still in additionaldevelopment stages.  Once our optional interface is complete--which should be around the end of the year or 1st quarter of1991--we will be able to use the service in any CO.  Then we willbegin active and aggressive marketing.  The type of existing COwill be inconsequential to deploying the service because of thisinterface.  That's why this announcement is significant.     "U S West has tested the service in our lab for the last 8months, and it has past all feature and functionality tests withflying colors," added White.  "But the medium must exist for thesystem to correct itself and be remotely monitored.  In smallcommunities, COs are not monitored 24 hours a day, but liabilityon 9-1-1 systems dictate that the system's heartbeat is monitoredfull time, which will occur when the interface is deployed.     "We've determined that there are 600 counties in our 14-state area that are too small to afford current 9-1-1 technologytoday.  That is the market that we are targeting."

The trial, involving 154 I&Mcustomers, could help consumers to manage their electricityconsumption more efficiently and lower their electric bills.During the trial, test customers will use a special thermostat--aTranstexT "Smart" unit developed by Johnson Controls--to measureand adjust the amount of electricity used.  Indiana Bell'snetwork will permit 2-way communication of electrical consumptionand billing information between I&M and the 154 homes.     The TranstexT thermostat will allow users to automaticallyadjust the temperature on their electric heating/cooling systemsand water heaters at certain hours of the day, when electricrates are higher or lower.  Indiana Bell's telephone lines and acommunications set in the customer's home will automaticallyroute the energy management information from the thermostat tothe electric utility's computer system and vice versa.  Thecommunication system will not affect customer use of thetelephone because the computer cannot transmit energy managementdata if the telephone is in use.     "This project is just one of many applications that willallow consumers to more efficiently manage their energy use,"said Pat Moss, Indiana Bell business manager.  "The datatransmitted over our network will help I&M determine how toreduce the amount of electricity used during peak hours, therebylessening its need for expansion, and, in the long run, helpingits customers save money."

Thestatistics, the result of inquiries made to telecomadministrations worldwide, showed that citizens of the UnitedStates use the telephone more frequently than others--an averageof 1,800 times a year per person.  Canada was a close second with1,451; Denmark with 861; and the Australians with 593.     The United States also had more telephones, 127 million,followed by Japan with more than 50 million, and the Soviet Unionwith approximately 28 million.  The telephone directories of theworld added 22 million new entries, for a total of 454 millionnumbers--an increase of 5% over the previous year.  In Indonesia,there are 30,000 people for every pay phone, contrasting withonly 100 per pay phone in Switzerland.  The Swiss place the mostinternational calls, an average of 28 per person.  The Belgiansare next with 12 times per person a year, and the Dutch thirdwith nearly 11.     In 1987, the United States invested over $26 billion intelecommunications, followed by Yugoslavia, which invested $15billion.  The People's Republic of China added nearly 1 millionnew telephones in 1987--an average of one telephone for every 100people.  Turkey increased its telephones by nearly 50%, but stillhas only 7.9 telephones per 100 people.

"Mike is the engineering part of our team and I'm thefront man.  We sold one system, then another, and by 1977 it waspretty apparent that I could make sales rather quickly.  We alsodid all the installations and have been a service-orientedbusiness right from the start.  "Our sales were based onreferrals from satisfied customers and now, some 12 or 13 yearslater, they still represent a major source of our new business,"added Bell.  Every 13 weeks Bell-Haun sends out a newsletter toits' customers on company and product news.  "We get a lot ofpositive feedback from the newsletters.  It helps to set usapart, and gives us an edge."  The newsletter is also sent outwith proposals and to Bell-Haun's suppliers and vendors.     "Bell-Haun is a service business.  Phones are phones.  Thedifference in equipment is a difficult thing for a consumer tosee.  To us, the phone is a means to an end.  We sell the bestequipment available, but if all of those manufacturers go out ofbusiness, we would still be around--we would just go to thesecond best and still provide our customers with the best serviceavailable.  We work very hard with our existing customer basebecause a satisfied customer is the best lead to a new customer.It gives us the inside track.     "We focus on little things," said Bell.  "All of ourtechnicians wear uniforms supplied by the company, and all of ourvehicles are fleet maintained.  We try to follow the samephilosophy as UPS or Fed Ex.  Our office is located in a high-rent area of the city, so when we bring clients to the office fora demonstration, they see a stable, professional atmosphere.They know that Bell-Haun is committed to its business.  That'swhat we stand for.  Overall we use the soft sell approach yet wewant our presence felt," Bell added.  Bell-Haun is a 5-StarAmeritech Dealer and handles Iwatsu, Mitel, and Motorola, and isalso a Centrex and data agent for Ohio Bell.     "In 1985 we became an agent for Ameritech MobileCommunications, and have installed over 8,000 cellular phones.For the past 2 years, we have been working on what we callProject '90 which focuses on voice messaging.  We see that as amajor new growth area for the company."  Bell-Haun is adistributor of Teleconnect and AVT voice processing equipment."We want to position ourselves in the Columbus business communityas the answer to a customer's communications requirements."Bell-Haun's customer base is between 4,000 and 5,000 but Bellsaid that number was somewhat inflated because it includescellular only users.     "We have always maintained an attitude that we want to bethe best.  Being the biggest is second to quality.  Theinterconnect business has changed a lot during the 1980s, and itwill continue to change.  The emphasis on quality will onlyincrease.  I don't spend time watching competition, but I want mypeople to know our competitor's systems.

Last week Maryland'sDepartment of Transportation informed APC that its PCS system hascaused "serious interference" to the light rail and bus serviceserving Baltimore and other metropolitan destinations.  Theletter had been circulated by UTC, the TelecommunicationsAssociation--a Washington-based trade group that representsseveral incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2gigahertz band.  Today, UTC issued a statement retracting theletter and acknowledging that it had been distributed without theTransportation Department's consent.Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, told TR thatAPC plans to issue a complete statement tomorrow disputing theclaims outlined in the letter.  She said UTC's involvement wassuspect and expressed concern over the trade group's effort to"politicize" the effort to relocate microwave incumbents in theportion of the 2 GHz band allocated for the new PCS services. Ms. Schelle stated that previous interference problems withBaltimore's mass transit system have been resolved.The letter from Maryland's Transportation Department recounts twooccasions last fall when APC's PCS system disruptedcommunications systems for Baltimore's mass transit operations. "These communications interruptions have posed a grave threat topublic safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated.  The TransportationDepartment also asked APC to reimburse Maryland's Mass TransitAdministration (MTA) for all costs that it has incurred as aresult of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Browndeclined to comment on the interference problems further, becauseit involves "a possible issue of litigation."Back to Headline List CopyrightTR DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996AT&T ANNOUNCES $6 BILLION RESTRUCTURING PLAN INCLUDINGELIMINATING 40,000 JOBS OVER 3 YEARSATT Corp. today announced a $6 billion restructuring as the nextstep in its plan to break up into separate services,systems-technology, and computer companies.  Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer Robert E. Allen told employees thatreorganizations planned to establish the separate telecomservices (New AT&T) and systems-technologies companies likelywould result in 30,000 layoffs.  AT&T announced plans today toeliminate almost 40,000 jobs over the next three years, but thatfigure includes more than 6,500 management employees who acceptedan early retirement offer (TR, Nov. 20, 1995) by year-end.  Itdoes not include the 8,500-job cut announced by AT&T GlobalInformation Solutions last September.  The computer unit took a$1.17 billion posttax charge against third quarter earnings tocover the costs of its separate restructuring.AT&T said it may extend the voluntary separation offer toadditional employees of its services and systems-technologiesunits, and Mr. Allen said such an extension would reduce thenumber of job cuts to be achieved through layoffs.  He added thatabout 4,000 of the jobs to be cut are in "businesses we plan tosell."  Workers in those units should be able to keep their jobsunder new ownership, Mr. Allen said.  A company spokesman saidabout 60% of the 40,000 jobs targeted for elimination over threeyears are "in management categories."   AT&T plans to completeabout 70% of the job cuts this year, but other cuts will beannounced throughout the three-year period, a spokesman said. "We know the types and levels of jobs" to be cut, but "we won'tknow specifics" for some time, he added.AT&T said 6,000 to 7,000 jobs will be cut in New Jersey, wherethe company currently employs about 48,000 persons.  Despite thecuts, AT&T will maintain "a major presence" in New Jersey, whereheadquarters for the new services and systems-technologycompanies and major Bell Laboratories operations will continue. About 10,000 of the positions to be cut will be "corporate-widestaff jobs in functions such as information systems, humanresources, and financial operations," AT&T said.  The remainingcuts, which will occur in operating units of the two newcompanies, will include about 6,000 "administrative andback-office support positions," it added.  The "vast majority" ofthe cuts will involve jobs in the U.S.Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr said thejob cut announcement will "demoralize" AT&T's workforce and setback cooperative union-management programs under developmentduring the last three years.  "We didn't even receive thecourtesy of advance notification of today's mass cutbackannouncement," Mr. Bahr said.  "So far we have no idea even howmany of CWA's 80,000 members at AT&T may be impacted by thecutbacks, and apparently neither does AT&T.  I was informed bythe head of labor relations that it will take up to 60 days toprovide details on jobs and locations that will be affected."  ACWA spokesman confirmed that meetings have continued between CWAand International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers officials andtheir AT&T labor relations counterparts to discuss plans for thebreakup.  But CWA officials got no advance notice in the meetingsof today's cutback announcement, the spokesman said.  IBEW'snational offices in Washington were closed today for the NewYear's holiday.To implement a complex restructuring that a spokesman saidinvolves hundreds of separate actions, AT&T will take a posttaxcharge totaling about $4 billion or $2.50 per share againstfourth quarter 1995 earnings.  About $2.6 billion of the $6billion pretax restructuring charge will cover severance pay andother costs related to the workforce reductions.  An additional$1.7 billion is earmarked to cover the costs of writing down thevalue of certain assets, including unneeded network facilitiesand investments in certain international units.  As an example ofsuch an investment write-down, AT&T cited its partnershipinterest in the Canadian Unitel Communications, Inc., competitivelong distance operation.  AT&T and three Canadian banks agreedlast fall to invest up to $250 million to keep the financiallystruggling competitive carrier in operation (TR, Oct. 2, 1995). The AT&T spokesman clarified that "we're not writing off Unitel. We plan to continue to use it as the base of operations fortelecom services in Canada."The spokesman said AT&T also plans to "refocus" its UnitedKingdom Istel data network operations to align it more closelywith strategic business plans of AT&T's Uniworld Europeannetworking partnership.  Foreign sales offices for NetworkSystems and Global Business Communications Services and foreignmanufacturing operations will be consolidated "where that makessense," a cable manufacturing plant in Ireland will be improved,and another plant in Taiwan will be retooled, the spokesman said. Closing, selling, or consolidating facilities determined not tobe "strategic to the new companies' future operations," includinglease terminations, will cost about $1.1 billion, AT&T said. Other actions included in the reorganization plans will costalmost $700 million.  The cost savings from the restructuringmeasures will ensure the new AT&T companies' ability to "make thenecessary investments to be strong competitors," said RickMiller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief FinancialOfficer.  AT&T intends to launch the new companies with sizes,assets, and corporate structures appropriate to industry leaders,he said.AT&T said it will not identify specific actions involving jobcuts until affected employees are notified and said it cannotdisclose other steps included in the reorganization plan becauseof disclosure restrictions imposed by the federal Securities andExchange Commission in relation to a planned initial publicoffering (IPO) for the systems-technology company.  Mr. Millersaid AT&T has begun preparing the SEC registration statement forthe IPO, which is expected to go to market by the end of thisquarter.  AT&T also has requested an Internal Revenue Serviceruling that the breakup into three companies can be accomplishedas a tax-free transaction for shareholders, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996FCC REMAINS CLOSED; AUCTIONS TO BEGIN TOMORROWSources within the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureauconfirmed today that the agency would continue three auctions ofradio licenses this week despite the ongoing government shutdown.

The action was in response to petitions byseveral local exchange competitors.  The commission denied a GTEpetition to reconsider last year's order but granted requests byAT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Teleport CommunicationsGroup, and several other companies to modify provisionsaddressing interconnection, unbundling, and interim numberportability.  The commission's original order made no mention ofGTE, and competitors had sought clarification that GTE also wassubject to the number portability requirement.The new order requires U S WEST and GTE to file unbundled looptariffs offering access to two-wire connections from end-users'premises to the U S WEST and GTE central offices.  Petitionershad sought a requirement that the incumbent LECs offer four-wireconnections that would enable them to offer digitalcommunications services.  The commission found that the two-wirerequirement was adequate to speed development of competition formost local services.  It ordered U S WEST and GTE to file interimnumber portability tariffs based on their incremental costs.  Thecompanies may assess nonrecurring charges, but those charges alsomust be set at the companies' incremental costs, the commissionsaid.The WUTC denied a request by AT&T and MCI that U S WEST and GTEbe required to offer all of their services for resale.  Thecommission's original order only requires incumbents to offerunbundled loop and other transport services.  The interexchangecarriers had claimed that the development of competition in thestate also depends on competitors' ability to resell bundled andtariffed services.  The commission said that a generalelimination of resale restrictions would be better addressed in ageneral rate case.  AT&T, which had asked the WUTC to reconsiderits earlier order, called the order "another step towardachieving the goal of widespread local competition inWashington."

The commission establishedstandard rates for terminating local traffic and the terms forlocal competitors to resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's localservice.  The PSC also adopted an interim number portability planand granted competitors the flexibility either to establish newlocal calling areas or to use those of Bell Atlantic. Additionally, the commission required all carriers to provide"911" service and launched a separate proceeding to examineuniversal service issues.  The PSC in 1994 authorized MFSIntelnet, Inc., to be the first provider of competitive localservice in the state (TR, May 2, 1994 and Aug. 8, 1994).  Itsince has authorized MCImetro and TCG America, Inc., to enter thelocal exchange services market.  TCG today endorsed thecommission order.  Later this month the PSC is scheduled toconsider an application by AT&T Corp. to provide both businessand residential local service (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).Back to Headline List CopyrightTR DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996REFORM LEGISLATION AWAITING BUDGET DEALAction on compromise telecommunications reform legislationhammered out before the holiday break likely will be delayeduntil a budget deal is struck, Washington sources said today. Only a few Senate conference committee members have signed off on"final" language circulated just before Christmas (TR, Dec. 25,1995).  Most conferees plan to stay in their districts untilbudget negotiations between congressional leaders and the WhiteHouse are completed, so they cannot sign the conference report. "Until there is a deal on the budget, you're not going to findthe bulk of the members coming back," said an industry lobbyist. Despite initial opposition from key Republicans such as telecomsubcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas), the sourcepredicted that a majority of conferees will approve the measure.Lack of active opposition by industry--combined with the supportof Senate Democrats and the White House--has paved the way forapproval of the conference language, said another close observerof the reform negotiations.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R.,Ga.) is unlikely to oppose the reform bill because speculationabout his ties to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch wouldleave him open to conflict-of-interest charges, the source said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR DAILY via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1996CITIZENS ACQUIRES ALLTEL'S CALIFORNIA PHONE PROPERTIESCitizens Utilities Co. of Stamford, Conn., today announced theacquisition of almost 20,000 telephone access lines in Californiafrom ALLTEL Corp. and the transfer of 3,600 Citizens access linesin Pennsylvania to ALLTEL.

During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4in Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipmentmanufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility todetermine what transmission technologies they will use in thefuture.  But the Commission must ensure that people withdisabilities have access to telecom services, he added.     Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called theEuropean model of mandating the use of specific digital wirelesstechnologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us intomandating their particular technology for the use of the airwaves,"he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead to theresolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be ready toprotect the interests of groups that traditionally have wieldedlittle power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.     Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy groupsshould work together to identify compatibility problems, hecontinued.  "This will be a continuous process because repeatedlywe will find incompatibilities between wireless devices and hearingaids."  He said the Commission expects specific "action items" tobe generated by the two-day summit meeting, which was sponsored bythe Personal Communications Industry Association.     The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by hearingaid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that the FCCinitiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems using theGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital wirelessstandard to interfere with hearing aids (TRWN, June 15, 1995). Wireless industry representatives, however, told the Commissionthat it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking proceedingbefore conclusive test results were available (TRWN, July 27,1995).     During last week's meeting, industry representativesemphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibilityalready is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and ChiefExecutive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications IndustryAssociation, reported that the Center for the Study ofElectromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will releasethe initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is conductinga field evaluation of bystander interference problems using thepersonal communications service (PCS) network recently activated inthe Washington, D.C., area by American Personal Communications. Results of that research are expected to be available Feb. 15.  Mr.Wheeler said digital-service interference problems are no moredaunting than those the cellular industry faced when it introducedanalog wireless equipment more than 10 years ago.     Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless phonesmeet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids thatare designed and tested to meet the requirements of the EuropeanCommission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard forhearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised atechnical standard for phones based on the code-divisionmultiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers canturn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,which can be a source of interference for some types of hearingaids.Plug-in Devices Help Hearing Aid Wearers     According to panelists at the meeting, several devices areavailable that enable hearing-impaired people to use digitaltelephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for example,can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-coil"(t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the hearingaid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to use themobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a "JABRA"device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing aids.     George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,said the availability of such devices does not mean the wirelessindustry should stop developing other alternatives for people withdisabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they willpay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some 22million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and thereisn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to ignore 10%of the population."     Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officerof CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted itsresponsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wirelesstechnologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs, whowears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientificresearch will provide us with long-term solutions for resolvingelectromagnetic compatibility issues."     Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research anddevelopment arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a SeniorEngineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aidinterference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude modulated,he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with mobile phonesbased on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said, adding that allPCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude modulation.  "HigherRF output increases the range of interference, but that is why theFCC has set limits on output levels," Mr. Williams said.     Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering forthe Advanced Products and Technology Division of the CellularSubscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving fromthe use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the useof several antennas with low-power radios.  That will leadmanufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devicesthat can minimize radio interference problems, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996S&P Revises Financial Guidelines For Wireless Telephone Companies     Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising thefinancial guidelines it applies to ratings of wirelesscommunications companies.  The business risks associated withcellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to theextent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial ratiosfor the same credit ratings as companies in other industries, S&Pconcluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to cellular andpersonal communications service (PCS) companies, although PCSoperators are expected to face many of the same start-up risks asthe early cellular companies.     That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhatworse-than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringentfinancial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited dramaticgrowth in cellular subscribership as the reason that business-riskprofiles of cellular companies have improved.     The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used toassess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom companiesthat own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These include AT&TCorp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding companies, and majorindependent telecom companies such as GTE Corp.  "Although thewireless segment does not represent a majority of these companies'assets, it is their fastest growing segment," S&P observed.  "Underthe revised benchmarks, companies with significant cellularholdings are now viewed as being somewhat less risky, while thosewith a major commitment to PCS are viewed as still havingsignificant credit risk for the PCS portion of their wirelessbusiness."      S&P will use the following measurements to determine thecredit ratings of wireless communications companies:     *    Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement ofincome before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--thatindicates "earnings protection."     *    EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement ofcellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earningsbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relativeto total interest cost.  This measures a company's minimum abilityto meet interest costs using available cash.     *    The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relativeto cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine acompany's debt "exposure."     *    Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt tototal "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continueto be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimategenerally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-popratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.     *    Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellularsubscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurementof financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number ofsubscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company's revenuesare used to service debt costs.     In determining the business risk profile of wireless carriers,S&P considers a number of market factors, including capitalintensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies, economicconditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (which measure the lossof subscribers to competitors), and the unregulated nature of theindustry.

AnAlcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but hesaid the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering thatSprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS) in upto 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services, Sprintmust pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbentlicensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.     Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum-relocationprojects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last year STV won PCSlicenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and Indianapolis "MajorTrading Areas" (TRWN, March 23, 1995).       Alcatel plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipmentdesigned to operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haulequipment interconnecting cell sites.     Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell MobileServices, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipmentfor the relocation of public safety wireless facilities operated bythe County of Santa Barbara, Calif.       The Alcatel spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spendabout $1 million to relocate five microwave links for the county. That estimate is in line with other industry estimates, which putthe cost of relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.     Alcatel--which has submitted bids to all PCS licenseesplanning to upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects toannounce similar relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. andBellSouth Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  Hesaid there is a $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996Arch To Acquire Westlink In $210 Million Paging Deal     Arch Communications Group, Inc., has signed a definitiveagreement to acquire Westlink Holdings, Inc., for $210 million incash and the assumption of $130 million in Westlink debt.  The dealwill make Arch the third-largest paging carrier in the U.S., withmore than 2.5 million subscribers.  Arch will finance theacquisition through an existing credit line and additional loans.      A privately held company, Westlink was formed in 1994 toacquire the paging assets of U S WEST Paging, Inc. (TRWN, Oct. 21,1993; and July 14, 1994).  Westlink operates paging systems in a14-state region west of the Mississippi, while most of Arch'spaging assets are concentrated east of the Mississippi.  Accordingto C.E. Baker Jr., Arch's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, theacquisition "will effectively complete the geographic footprintthat makes us a national player."     Arch also will gain access to other paging licenses throughWestlink's 49.9% stake in Benbow PCS Ventures, Inc., the winner oftwo regional narrowband personal communications service (PCS)licenses sold at an FCC auction last year (TRWN, Nov. 17, 1994). Arch currently owns about 11% of PCS Development Corp., aGreenville, S.C., company that won five regional narrowband PCSlicenses at the same auction.  Arch plans to resell that company'stwo-way paging services when commercial operations are launched in1997.     Separately, AirTouch Communications, Inc., announced thecompletion of its acquisition of privately held Message CenterBeepers.  Hartford, Conn.-based Message Center will contribute morethan 345,000 customers to AirTouch Paging's installed customerbase.  Message Center executives also announced the formation of anew company to provide Internet access, cellular, and long distanceservices in major eastern U.S. markets.  The new company, dubbedZipCall L.L.C., will be based in Hartford.  Its network willfeature ISDN (integrated services digital network) and frame relaycapabilities.  Customers will have toll-free access to the Internetand will be able to take advantage of a variety of high-speed,dial-up access plans.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Network Interference Problems     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that itspersonal communications service (PCS) system is interfering withthe operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recentletter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) statedthat the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" tothe communications operations of light rail and bus servicesoperating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.       The letter was made public by UTC, the TelecommunicationsAssociation, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representingincumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertzspectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it haddistributed the letter without the MTA's consent.     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressedconcern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" theeffort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands.      The relocation of incumbent operators has been a contentiousissue since the FCC first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licenseesto clear that band to make way for new PCS licensees (TRWN, Sept.24, 1992; and July 29, 1993).  The Commission recently clarifiedrules adopted in the Engineering and Technology docket 92-9"emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining "good faith"negotiations over relocation issues between licensees (TRWN, Oct.16, 1995).     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions lastfall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transitcommunications system.  "These communications interruptions haveposed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred asa result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Browndeclined to comment further on the interference problems, notingthat it involves "a possible issue of litigation."     Ms. Schelle told TRWN that interference problems with the masstransit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported nopublic-safety problems resulting from interference between the tworadio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility torespond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, theattorney added.       The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APCplanned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failedto respond to a single one.  "Microwave licensees that ignorefrequency coordination notices do so at their own peril," the APCattorney stated.  "PCS licensees can only protect licensedfacilities if they are informed of the complete parameters of thosefacilities' operations.  APC fully protected the facilitiesrepresented on MTA's FCC license and could not have known, withoutbeing informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance fromthose parameters."Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses     As the third U.S. auction of personal communications service(PCS) licenses got under way, Industry Canada announced that it hadawarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  Clearnet Communications,Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and MicroCell Network, Inc., ofMontreal, each were awarded 30 megahertz PCS licenses.  RogersCantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility Personacom Canada Ltd., wereawarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  Industry Minister John Manleysaid the four new licensees will invest more than $3 billion todevelop their PCS systems.  He estimated that 8,500 new jobs willbe created over the next five years as the PCS market develops.     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses tononcellular companies will create a sound industry structure, whichshould facilitate the development of enhanced competition andinnovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.Simmonds.  Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobileradio networks for businesses in major metro areas.  NextelCommunications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholdersin Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with itsPCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in twoCanadians is interested in using new personal communicationsservices.     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is astart-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group ofCanadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors inMicroCell.  Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular serviceproviders in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand itscurrent service offerings.       Based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility Personacom is anaffiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian cellular carrier. Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member companies"are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial landline telephonecompanies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will operate theirsystems on the same frequencies as their counterparts in the U.S.--between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996SBC Affiliate Wins Authority To Offer LEC Service in Chicago     The Illinois Commerce Commission has authorized an SBCCommunications, Inc., affiliate to offer landline local exchangeservice in the greater Chicago area, enabling it to competedirectly with Ameritech-Illinois.  SBMS Illinois Services, Inc., anaffiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS),submitted an application last year seeking permission to providelocal exchange services.  The commission's decision will allow itto offer wireline services under the Cellular One brand name--thesame name SBMS uses to market cellular service in Chicago.     An SBC spokesman said SBMS Illinois will file intrastatetariffs during the first part of 1996.  The company plans to offerservice in an area including Cook, DuPage, and Kane Counties, andportions of McHenry, Kendall, and Will Counties.  Last October, SBCwas authorized by the New York Public Service Commission to offerlocal exchange service in upstate New York.     SBMS currently offers cellular service to customers in theRochester and Buffalo metropolitan statistical areas, also underthe Cellular One brand name.     The spokesman told TRWN that SBC aggressively is exploringlocal exchange markets outside its traditional five-stateterritory.  The company is particularly interested in bundlingcellular and wireline services in markets where it already operatescellular systems, including Boston, Baltimore, and Washington,D.C., he said.  The fact that Massachusetts and Maryland alreadypermit competition for the provision of facilities-based, switchedlocal exchange services may prove helpful to SBC.  In Washington,city government regulators are considering proposed competitionrules.     The spokesman confirmed that SBC intends to offer wirelineservices and not fixed wireless local loop services in Chicago andupstate New York.  But he declined to identify how the company willput together its local exchange network.  SBC is considering anumber of possible options, including reselling local exchangeservices, he said.     Last October the FCC granted SBMS a rule waiver allowing it tobundle cellular and wireline local exchange services and to offerthem to out-of-region customers (TRWN, Nov. 2, 1995).  Commissionrules preclude cellular affiliates of Bell operating companies fromowning landline local exchange facilities.  Pursuant to the waiver,SBMS has proposed to offer what it calls "competitive landlinelocal exchange services" through a corporate entity that sharesfacilities, systems, and personnel with SBMS' cellular operations. That business would be managed by the same executives who manageSBMS.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996'Bill-and-Keep' Method of Interconnection Proposed for LECs, CMRSProviders     In an effort to encourage the development of new wirelessservices, the FCC recently proposed implementing a newinterconnection regime allowing local exchange carriers (LECs) andcommercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers to terminate oneanother's calls without charging the originating carrier for callcompletion.       This interconnection method, generally known as "bill andkeep," currently is used among LECs.  During its most recent publicmeeting, the Commission voted to adopt a rulemaking notice toestablish a similar policy, on an interim basis, for LEC-CMRSinterconnection.  Under the proposal, carriers would be permittedto keep the revenues from calls originated on their own networks. This new interconnection model had been proposed by the CellularTelecommunications Industry Association (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).     "Interconnection is an essential component of all networks,"observed Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina M. Keeney.  Althoughthe FCC already has general interconnection rules, they do not takeinto account the proliferation of new wireless service providersthat will be handling an increasing volume of voice traffic, sheadded.     The rulemaking proposal, which launched docket 95-185,"tentatively concludes that the interim plan [should include] abill-and-keep approach for most network components, for both peakand off-peak hours," said Kathleen L. Franco, a Common CarrierBureau staff attorney who presented the NPRM for Commissionconsideration.       "Bill and keep is administratively simple, will prevent LECsfrom charging excessive interconnection rates, and will likelyapproximate the incremental costs of terminating traffic, at leastduring off-peak periods," she explained.     The NPRM seeks comment on how long the interim plan shouldremain in effect.  It also seeks comment on how interconnectionarrangements should be made public--either through tariffs orthrough some other public disclosure requirement.  The Commissiontentatively concluded that rates for dedicated transmissionfacilities connecting LEC and CMRS networks should be based onexisting access charges (usually flat-rated fees) for similarnetwork facilities.     The proposal invited comments on whether the FCC should adoptthe following:(1) A federal interconnection model that would directly governinterstate LEC-CMRS interconnection but that would not be bindingon state regulatory commissions for intrastate services; (2) A general mandatory interconnection model with broadparameters, giving state commissions a range of choices regardingLEC-CMRS interconnection obligations; or (3) A model with specific requirements for interstate andintrastate interconnection between LECs and CMRS providers.       The Commission tentatively concluded that it has the legalauthority to implement any of those alternative approaches, basedon section 332 of the Communications Act.  According to DavidSieradzki, a Common Carrier Bureau staff attorney, the first optionwould give state regulators the most flexibility.  Under thatoption, the FCC would be responsible for regulating interstateinterconnection requirements, but intrastate interconnectionobligations would be determined by state regulatory commissions. The third option, which calls for the FCC to adopt specificinterconnection rules, would offer states the least flexibility,Mr. Sieradzki said.  "The FCC is very intent on workingcooperatively with the states on interconnection issues," he added.Commissioners Promise To Cooperate with States     Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett said state and federaljurisdictional issues should be reviewed carefully during theproceeding.  "While the Commission makes several tentativeconclusions in the [NPRM] concerning its legal authority, Iemphasize that these findings are tentative. . .and that we willconsider all relevant arguments and theories."  He noted that 33states so far have removed barriers to local exchange competition. "Washington, Texas, Pennsylvania, and California, to name a few,have been at the forefront on these issues and have implementedbill and keep as an interim arrangement," he said in a separatestatement.  "I will do my part as a member of this Commission toensure that our continuing efforts will be fully coordinated withthe state regulators."     Chairman Reed E. Hundt said, "We have good relations with thestates, and we want to continue to work with them on this issue." The interim interconnection plan "proposes an intensely practicalsolution," Mr. Hundt said.  He advised commenters to "think veryhard about the economics of this policy and about the market powerof LECs versus the market power of CMRS providers."  He added thatthe FCC must consider adopting regulations that "will not burdenwireless carriers."      In a separate statement, Commissioner Susan Ness said, "Wemust not abridge the LECs' legal or equitable rights, distortmarketplace incentives for CMRS providers, or cause prices forother LEC customers to increase."       The Commission "must seek to maintain the federal-statecooperation that we have worked so hard to develop," she added. Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong said she would prefer that the FCCnot require carriers to file tariffs with voluminous cost-supportdata.  Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996FCC Adopts Competitive Bidding Rules for 800 MHz SMR Licenses     The FCC has adopted an order outlining a wide-area licensingscheme for the 800 megahertz specialized mobile radio (SMR)service.  In a separate order, it set competitive bidding rules for800 MHz SMR licenses.  And in Private Radio docket 93-144, itadopted a rulemaking proposal to relocate incumbent 800 MHz SMRlicensees in order to accommodate wide-area systems.  The FCCsought comment on a proposed "two-phase" mandatory relocationscheme that would make new 800 MHz SMR operators responsible forproviding incumbent licensees with comparable network facilities.     During its Dec. 15 public meeting, the FCC adopted its "firstreport and order" in docket 93-144, dividing the upper 200 channelsin the 800 MHz band into three spectrum blocks for wide-arealicensing.  The 200 channels will be divided into separate blocksof 120, 60, and 20 channels, designated according to "economicareas" (EAs) defined by the Commerce Department.  These licenseswill be sold at auction.  The Commission adopted a 10-year licenseterm and a five-year construction period for EA licensees.  Theselicensees must offer coverage to one-third of the population intheir service area after three years.  Half the population must becovered after the five-year construction benchmark.     The order also reallocated the General Category channels--which include 150 contiguous 25 kilohertz channels--in the 800 MHzband to the SMR service.  It partially lifts the "freeze" on newSMR and General Category channels, so potential EA licenseapplicants can relocate incumbents out of the upper 200 channels inthe 800 MHz band.     In the "eighth report and order" in Plans and Policy docket93-253, the FCC implemented rules to award 525 EA licenses in asingle, simultaneous-multiple-round auction.  Incumbents and newentrants are eligible to bid for EA licenses.  The order permitsqualified small businesses to use bidding credits, and it allowsrural telephone companies to acquire parts of other EA licenses. This process is referred to as "partitioning."     Finally, the FCC's "second further notice of proposedrulemaking" in docket 93-144 tentatively concluded that EAlicensees should be allowed to "disaggregate" their spectrumblocks.  The FCC defined disaggregation as "assigning discreteportions of the spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee." Accordingly, the entity that is assigned a portion of the spectrumwould receive a separate EA license to operate on the disaggregatedchannels throughout the license area.  The FCC also proposedextending the partitioning rules to SMR licensees generally, ratherthan limiting it to rural telephone companies.     Regarding relocation, the Commission suggested that an EAlicensee's offer to replace an incumbent's system with comparablefacilities constitutes a "good faith" offer.  Similarly, anincumbent that accepts such an offer "presumably would be acting ingood faith," the agency said.  It proposed that "comparablefacilities" be defined as having the same number of channels withthe same bandwidth.     The rulemaking proposal tentatively concludes that 800 MHz SMRchannels should be licensed on a geographic basis defined by EAs. The Commission proposed licensing the lower 80 channels in the 800MHz band in five-channel blocks.  It also proposed licensing theGeneral Category channel blocks in the same manner.  It proposed tooffer bidding credits and to auction an "entrepreneur's block" oflicenses that would be limited to qualified small businesses.     Commissioner James H. Quello remarked that the 800 MHzlicensing rules "have been so highly contentious that [the ordersare] unlikely to satisfy everyone."  Chairman Reed E. Hundt saidmany people had voiced concerns about the 800 MHz service rules. The orders adopted last week offer "the best possible degree ofconsensus," he said.     Nextel Communications, Inc., the largest SMR operator in thecountry, praised the new 800 MHz licensing rules.  It said therules give Nextel and other SMR licensees "the opportunity toassemble individual licenses into large blocks of contiguousspectrum," similar to what cellular and personal communicationsservice providers are able to do.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996FCC Proposes Auctioning 37 GHz, 39 GHz Licenses, Revises TechnicalRules     To make more spectrum available for point-to-point microwaveradio operations, the FCC has adopted a rulemaking notice thatwould amend the licensing and technical rules for systems operatingin the 37.0-38.6 gigahertz band, also known as the 37 GHz band.  Italso has proposed to revise licensing and technical rules forsystems operating in the 38.6-40.0 GHz band, also referred to asthe 39 GHz band.  The agency proposed to auction the 3 GHz ofspectrum divided between the two bands and to offer bidding creditsand other incentives to qualified auction participants.  TheCommission also voted to process pending 39 GHz licenseapplications, with Chairman Reed E. Hundt and Commissioner SusanNess dissenting.     The Commission's proposal to amend parts 1, 2, 21, and 94 ofits rules stems from a rulemaking petition (RM-8553) filed by theTelecommunications Industry Association.  At last month's publicmeeting, the FCC proposed auctioning spectrum licenses based on"Basic Trading Areas."  To accommodate incumbent operators, itproposed to give existing 39 GHz licensees 18 months from theadoption of an order in the proceeding to certify that they haveconstructed "a minimum average of four permanently installed andoperating links per hundred square kilometers" of their licensedservice areas.  This equates to about one link per 10 square miles.     Incumbents with more than one channel block of spectrum wouldbe required to certify that each channel block contains at leastfour permanently installed and operating links.  If a licensee metthese threshold requirements, it would be eligible to retain rightsto serve its entire service area.  If an incumbent did not meetthese requirements, it automatically would lose its license 19months after adoption of an order, the Commission said.       The FCC proposed adopting such measures in order to preventspeculators from "warehousing" spectrum.  The 37 GHz and 39 GHzspectrum bands have been identified as potentially valuableproperty by those who intend to provide infrastructure forcommercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers.  Some companiesplan to use the spectrum to offer backhaul facilities for newpersonal communications service licensees, the FCC observed.     Regarding the hundreds of pending 39 GHz applications, theCommission ordered the following action:  Pending applications willbe processed if they were not mutually exclusive with otherapplications at the time the Wireless Telecommunications Bureaustopped accepting new applications.  The FCC also proposed to applythe same rules to these applicants as it proposed for incumbent 39GHz operators.       Other pending applications will not be processed at this time,although the FCC will determine whether to process or return themat the conclusion of this proceeding.  An exception to this policywould be extended to 39 GHz incumbents that filed applications tomodify their systems without enlarging their service areas.Hundt, Ness Dissent from Majority     Commissioner James H. Quello reiterated his long-standingposition that pending applications should be processed according tothe rules that were in effect when they first were filed. Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong emphasized thatnon-mutually-exclusive license applications do not fall within theFCC's auction authority.       "Indeed, even if we had auction rules in place today, these[39 GHz] applications would not be subject to auction.  Undersection 309 (j) of the Communications Act, the Commission hasauthority to use competitive bidding only where mutually exclusiveapplications are filed," she said in a separate statement. Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett made similar comments in hisseparate statement.     Commissioner Susan Ness said the majority's decision toprocess the pending 39 GHz applications will result in a "Swisscheese effect," leaving holes in the spectrum that later will beauctioned.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt also dissented from themajority.  "There is no longer any serious dispute that soundpublic policy requires assigning spectrum licenses by competitivebidding except where there are clear and compelling public interestreasons to the contrary," he said, adding that "no compellingreasons have been given here." Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996FCC Allocates Spectrum for 'Millimeter-Wave' Applications     The FCC has allocated 6.2 gigahertz of spectrum in the bandsabove 40 GHz, establishing technical rules for the development andintroduction of "millimeter-wave services," (MWS) such asautomobile radar collision-avoidance systems.  Acting at its Dec.15 meeting, the Commission adopted an order in the Engineering andTechnology docket 94-124 proceeding, approving the allocation ofthree separate bands available for unlicensed use (TRWN, Nov. 3,1994).     The Commission allocated the 46.7-46.9 GHz and 76-77 GHz bandsfor "smart car" systems.  In addition to collision warning andavoidance, applications for such systems could include "automaticcruise control" and "lane guidance," the Commission said.  Toprotect vehicle safety systems from interference, use of the bandswill be restricted to such "smart car" operations at this time. The Commission also adopted a rulemaking proposal to suspend theuse of the 76-77 GHz band by amateur radio operators until sharingtechnologies are developed.     For "generic unlicensed use," the FCC designated the 59-64 GHzband.  Such generic uses could include broadband computernetworking at data speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second. Transmission speeds over the MWS bands could approach those offiber optic systems, but only over short distances.  The Commissionwill delay its allocation of the 59-64 GHz band for one year,however, enabling industry groups to propose standards for spectrumetiquette.  Wireless industry groups had sought such a delay beforeunlicensed operations were permitted in the band.     In its NPRM, the FCC sought comment on what those etiquettestandards should be.  It also proposed establishing limits onemissions in the 200-231 GHz band and said that several additionalrulemakings could be initiated in the future to address operationsin the millimeter-wave bands.     The new rules are "some of the most flexible ever offered bythe Commission," said Michael J. Marcus, Associate Chief of theOffice of Engineering and Technology.  Chairman Reed E. Hundtagreed, calling them "a corollary" to the Commission's spectrumauction policy.  The FCC should make available to industry spectrumfor which there are no competing demands, Mr. Hundt said.  Theproposal to allow the industry to suggest its own code of spectrumetiquette demonstrates the FCC's willingness to be flexible when itis appropriate, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996'Bill-and-Keep' Proposal Could Create More Local ExchangeCompetitionBy Roger Newell, Senior Contributing Editor     In its last meeting of 1995 the FCC took steps to establish animportant component needed for competition in the local exchangemarket.  The Commission adopted a notice of proposed rulemakingthat would implement a "bill-and-keep" method of interconnectionfor local exchange carriers (LECs) and commercial mobile radioservice (CMRS) providers. Currently, when a call originated by acellular carrier is terminated by a LEC, the cellular carrier mustpay an access charge to the LEC.  When the call travels in theopposite direction, however, the LEC does not pay anything to thecellular carrier to complete the call.     This imbalance has resulted from the monopoly position of theLECs, which allows them to dictate the terms for interconnection. Access charges typically range from 2.5 to 3.5 cents per minute. According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,cellular carriers paid more than $800 million in access charges in1994.       Without changing the current method of compensation forCMRS-LEC call completion, this amount would rise significantly ascompetition in the local exchange market is spurred by the adventof personal communications services (PCS). The FCC's proposal toinstitute a bill-and-keep system, under which each carrier would berequired to terminate traffic received from the other withoutpayment, would remedy this problem on an interim basis.       Accordingly, each carrier would keep the entire revenue fromcalls that it bills.  This is an important step forward.  Fair andreasonable rates and terms of interconnection are essential for thedevelopment of local exchange competition.  As CommissionerRachelle B. Chong has noted, "Timely and reasonably pricedinterconnection is the lifeblood of competition among alternativeservice providers."     Although a charge of about 3 cents per minute may not seem tobe much, it could have a chilling effect on competition.  A one-waypayment by one competitor to another tilts the playing field andprevents equal competition.       The effect is not small; even 3 cents is a significantpercentage of cellular rates, which typically are around 35 centsin many markets.  If, as the FCC hopes, the launch of PCS this yearresults in lower rates for telephone service, the access chargeswould loom as an ever-larger percentage of LEC revenue.     Replacement of the one-way payment method with a bill-and-keepmechanism represents a sea change in the position of wirelesscarriers.  From the inception of the service in the early 1980s,cellular carriers have had the legal right to interconnect withLECs as co-carriers.  This also entitles them to mutualcompensation for interchanged traffic.  The necessary agreementswere never executed, however, resulting in the present one-waypayment arrangement.  (Some LECs have argued that the accesscharges were reduced to compensate for the lack of mutualcompensation).  The present situation favors the LECs, leaving themwith little incentive to negotiate mutual compensation agreements.'Bill and Keep' Presents Milestone for CMRS Providers     With bill and keep, however, the situation is reversed.  Theoverwhelming flow of traffic is from the wireless carrier to thelandline carrier.  This is largely because cellular servicerequires subscribers to pay relatively high charges for airtime forincoming and outgoing calls.  As a result, many cellularsubscribers reserve their handsets for outgoing calls.  Thus, billand keep could cause the landline carriers to lose considerablerevenue.  The incentive to negotiate a fair mutual compensationarrangement now shifts to the landline carrier, and the way iscleared for new carriers to compete on economically viable terms.     The bill-and-keep proposal is intended to effect a sort ofrough justice until more sophisticated and accurate methods ofcompensation for call termination are developed.  It would provideequity between LECs and their competitors only if the amount oftraffic in each direction is approximately equal.  The flow oftraffic, however, is likely to remain uneven at least during thenext few years.  But bill and keep is more equitable than thecurrent one-way system.     Of course the most logical long-term solution would be foreach carrier to charge other carriers the actual cost ofterminating calls.  The FCC said it believes that prices based on"long-run incremental costs" best reflect the true economic cost ofa service.  However, using internal costs as the basis of accesscharging presents difficult practical and administrative issues,not the least of which would be endless disputes between theparties on how to measure these costs.     One possible variation on the bill-and-keep proposal wassuggested by Frontier Corp. (formerly Rochester Telephone Corp.). To encourage new competitors to enter the market, it proposed thatthe bill-and-keep method apply unless and until the trafficimbalance exceeded 10%, in which case appropriate payments would bemade to even the score.  Assuming that the proposals in the NPRMare finally adopted in their present form, CMRS providers wouldfind their task greatly eased.       The access revenue has allowed LECs to keep their rates forresidential and business customers artificially low.  With thatincome drying up, presumably the LECs' rates for local servicewould have to rise to compensate.  That, in turn, would make theCMRS carriers' competitive situation more favorable.     This proceeding is only part of the measures necessary to havefull local exchange competition.  Still to come are the efforts towork out problems concerning number portability and universalservice.  Nevertheless, it is clear that competition in the localexchange market will flourish in the next few years, as a result ofpressure on the LECs from both the federal government and stateauthorities.  To date, 33 states have removed legal barriers tolocal exchange competition, and many of them have implemented billand keep as an interim plan.     In some cases, LECs have proposed more equitable arrangementsthan the current one.  For example, NYNEX Corp. and MFSCommunications Co., Inc., a competitive access provider, agreed toa plan that provides for half-call billing.  Each carrier pays theother 1.6 cents per minute to terminate most calls.  This is abouthalf the rate paid by the public.  With bill and keep, costs couldbe even lower.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996FCC AUCTION UPDATES     TRWN's publisher, BRP Publications, Inc., is offering FCCauction updates on its World Wide Web site.

(Mtel) should pay for alicense obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission'sauthority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowbandpersonal communications service (PCS) license without firstreceiving congressional authority (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the companyshould not have to pay for its two-way paging license because theFCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that willcompete with Mtel.  The court had requested supportingdocumentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paginglicenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a licenseein a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly allocatedfrequency band," the agency explained, adding that all otherlicensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid substantialsums for their licenses at a government auction.     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advancedtwo-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did notapply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," itsaid.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts ofmoney to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenseswere 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that theCommission is applying different rules to identical licenses," theagency added.Back to Headline List CopyrightTR WIRELESS NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996INTERCONNECTION COMPLAINT     Mid-Missouri Mobilfone, a paging provider based in Rolla, Mo.,has filed an FCC formal complaint alleging that United TelephoneCo. refused to provide Mobilefone with interconnection service.

Oberst, Jr. (797 words) CopyrightVIA SATELLITE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996GLOBAL SATELLITE EXECUTIVES MEET IN PARISby Cynthia Boeke      This September, the world satellite industry's glitterati met inParis at the fifth Satel Conseil Symposium to discuss issues facingthe future development of the satellite industry.      Among the most talked-about developments were the high rate ofgrowth in the satellite industry; the development of Ka-band systemsfor Internet-related broadband, multimedia applications; growth in theuse of geostationary satellites for mobile telephony services; and thechallenge of orbital slot overcrowding.     Satel Conseil is a French consortium that provides internationalconsulting, engineering and technical assistance services in the fieldof space communications.THE FRENCH CONTRIBUTION      "Growth in the satellite market has exceeded everyone'sexpectations," said Francois Fillon, French Cabinet Minister forPostal Services, Telecommunications and Space. "Everything points tofuture growth as well."      Fillon noted that low earth orbit (LEO) constellations areplaying a major role in this growth, but that growth in the number ofnew geostationary satellites is just as rapid.      Three of the world's leading geostationary satellite bus andpayload manufacturers--Matra Marconi Space, Aerospatiale andAlcatel--are French. "It is vital for France and Europe to preserveand increase our industrial capability by making sure [Frenchsatellite manufacturers]have the technology they need," said Fillon. He highlighted theStentor program, a partnership between French government and industry,which will "develop tomorrow's satellite technology--extra capacityand lifetime."     Although France is playing a major role in geostationarysatellite manufacturing, Fillon said that "American manufacturers havetaken the initiative in LEO constellations. We must pay tribute to theAmerican ability to mobilize resources, but we must respond withsecond-generation constellations for high data rate exchanges."THE INTERNET CONNECTION      Much of the discussion at Satel Conseil centered on the growingrole of the Internet and the potential use of satellites to become amajor Internet delivery vehicle.      "Before 2005, the Internet will have exploded," said SergeTchuruk, chairman and CEO of Alcatel Alsthom. "It will disintegrateand be reconfigured." The reason, according to Tchuruk: the Internetis not business-oriented and is susceptible to technical disruptions.     "When the Internet is rebuilt," he said, "it will incorporatebroadband multimedia." By that time, he predicted," satellites will beorbital networks complementing terrestrial networks.They will be one of the key telecommunications technologies in the21st century."     Indeed, one of the systems serving the interactive, broadbandmultimedia needs of future users could be Sativod, a constellation of64 medium earth orbit satellites proposed by Alcatel.      Sativod is being designed to provide access to the Internet andonline services, remote access to enterprises, telecommuting,videoconferencing, teleteaching, telemedicine and entertainmentservices, said Pascale Sourisse, director of planning and strategy atAlcatel Espace.     Sourisse said that there will be 15 million to 20 millionpotential Sativod users around the world by the end of the nextdecade.     Future satellite-delivered multimedia services will be driven by"prosumers," said Karl Savatiel, president of AstroLink at LockheedMartin Telecommunications. Prosumers will use the broadband,interactive satellite services for teleworking and personal use intheir homes or remote offices, he said.     "Internet backbones are not adequate," said Ronald Maehl, seniorvice president of strategy at Space Systems/Loral. Such a situation,he said, will provide myriad opportunities for new Ka-band,satellite-based Internet services, including SS/L's proposed Cyberstarsystem.MOBILE TELEPHONY      The growing role of geostationary satellites for mobiletelephony applications was underscored at Satel Conseil.      According to Michael Williams, vice president of mobilecommunications systems at Lockheed Martin Telecommunications,developing countries are "driving a dramatic increase in demand forcost-competitive voice services." Lockheed Martin, he continued, canprovide a geostationary satellite-based solution for direct-to-usermobile telephony with its LMA2100AX high power/dissipation satellitebus. Its attributes include commercially viable 12- to 15-meterreflectors; commercially available digital transmission and codingtechniques; and low mass, low power onboard signal processing.     Meanwhile Inmarsat, for its part, is studying a possiblesuccessor to the new Inmarsat 3 generation of geostationarysatellites, said Warren Grace, director general of Inmarsat. Thepotential Inmarsat 4 satellites, he said, might be used to serve newbusiness markets and provide broadband, broadcast, navigation andrural communications services. "The chosen solution will probably beGEO-based," he said, because it allows "less complex user terminals,reduced network complexity, lower probability of outages andcontinuity with existing services."      Vladimir Tamarkin, first deputy director of Informcosmos anddirector of Russia's Marafon project, provided details of the Marafonmobile satellite system. Marafon, he said, will comprise fivegeostationary Arkos satellites and three or four highly ellipticalorbit Mayak satellites. Initially, services will be provided using aEuropean satellite. The majority of the system is scheduled to beoperational by 1999.     The main strategies for Marafon, Tamarkin said, are to attractadvanced foreign technologies to develop the means of space and groundsegments of the system, develop strategic partnerships with foreigncompanies, develop partnerships with existing European mobilesatellite service providers, and attract investment for Marafon'sspace segment.     Another geostationary-based system that is looking for partnersis the Euro-African Satellite Telecommunications (EAST) projectproposed by Matra Marconi Space. According to Jean Maury,director/sales manager for the Civil Communications SatelliteDirectorate at Matra Marconi Space, EAST will most likely be based ontwo Eurostar 3000 satellites with 12-meter unfurlable reflectors. EASTwould provide mobile telephony services to all of Europe, the Mideastand parts of Africa. ORBITAL SLOT HOARDING      One of the thorniest issues facing the satellite industry isorbital slot crowding. "Overfiling is exploding," said Robert Jones,director of the Radiocommunication Bureau at the ITU.      Jones cited two possible solutions to orbital slot crowding:procedural and financial. The procedural solution, he said, wouldinvolve certification of progress toward the construction and launchof a satellite by applicants. The financial solution would entail feesor deposits submitted with each filing, which would be returned whenthe satellite is launched.       "Orbital slot congestion is worse in the Asia-Pacific than anyother region," emphasized Seon Jong Chung, president of theAsia-Pacific Satellite Communication Council and vice president of theSatellite Communications Division of South Korea's ETRI. "Nearly 120satellite networks have not been processed.     "Excessive filing for many years complicates limited resources,"he continued, "and gives burdens to everybody."      Despite the regulatory logjam, most conference participantspredicted that the high rate of growth in new satellite systems willcontinue. Steven Dorfman, president of Hughes Telecommunications andSpace Co., said he remembered not too long ago, in the 1980s, when thedemise of the satellite industry was predicted because of fiber. "Nowthere are four times as many satellites in orbit as there were at thetime of that prediction," he said.     Dorfman cited new satellite-based consumer applications, higherpower satellites, lower-cost terminals and digital compression asdrivers in satellite growth. "I believe we will continue thedouble-digit growth in satellite communications as we have over thepast ten years."      Cynthia Boeke is the Editor of Via Satellite.

Now, with students able to voice questions and filetheir responses back to teachers in real time, distance learning hastaken on a whole new power, and a whole new importance."     To test this theory, Via Satellite surveyed a number of majorU.S. BTV users, to see what they're doing with their BTV networks.CARRIER CORP.'S "BEAM TV"      Carrier Corp. is the world's largest maker of air-conditioning,refrigeration, heating and ventilation equipment. It's products aredistributed in 145 countries worldwide. As a result of thissuccess, Carrier needs reliable communications to keep its customerswell-served. And that's why the company turned to business TV.     "Basically our business television network came as a result ofcustomer demands," says Toni Nevins, Carrier's business developmentmanager, when asked about the roots of Carrier's Beam TV. "We used tohave two national meetings a year, and our customers--the independentdistributors who sell our equipment--asked us to cut it down to one."In order to continue to keep customers informed while eliminating theneed for more than one meeting a year, Carrier decided to install itsown business television network.     "That's where Group W Network Services came in," she adds. "Afterwe conducted a feasibility study, they helped us install and activateour network on April 1, 1995, in order to ensure we had another way ofgetting important product information out to our customers."     Known as "Beam TV," Carrier's BTV network supplies at least sixhours of programming a month to 116 sites in the United States andCanada. The signals are sent out digitally using GI DigiCipher 1equipment, and received by the sites using 1.2-meter antennas.     The programs they receive are quite varied, says Nevins. "We doproduct introductions, service bulletins, service training, corporatecommunications to both employees and customers, and of course, amonthly half-hour update on the company called `Beam News.'     "This is scheduled to coincide with the customers' monthly salesmeetings," she continues. "They integrate the news programs into theirmeetings to update their employees on Carrier information that theymay need to do their jobs.     "Most of our broadcasts are live interactive broadcasts," sheadds, "where our customers communicate with the on-air people using aspecial  1-800' telephone number."     This last feature has already proved particularly useful inkeeping Carrier's clients happy, says Nevins. For instance, "we weredoing a major product overhaul that our customers were concernedabout. Once we knew of their concerns, we were able to go to airwithin 48 hours with a live phone-in show explaining what we weredoing and why, and fielding their questions as they arose."     For her part, Nevins is sold on the value of Beam TV. "It has astrong cost benefit in getting a consistent message out to ourcustomers," she says, "while offering them to chance to voice theirown concerns. And, not incidentally, it has reduced our travelexpenses as well."FAA's "TELE-TRAINING"      With responsibility for critical areas such as air trafficcontrol and aircraft safety, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administrationis an agency that relies heavily on training to maintain itsstandards. But recent federal budget cutbacks have put the agency in areal bind, says the FAA's Hank Payne.      "From 1992 through 1996 we've seen our training budget cut by 42percent," Payne notes, "while we've only been able to reduce ouractual training needs by 21 percent."     Much of the expense of FAA training was the result of residentialtraining centers, and the travel and per diem costs associated withsending staff to the sites. That's why in 1993 the FAA turned to AT&TTridom to set up its Interactive Video Tele-Training Program, ina bid to save money while upgrading its staff's expertise.     Payne manages the Interactive Video Tele-Training Program for theFAA, one which uses 3.3 MHz of digitally compressed live instructionalvideo, voice and data fed to 34 receive sites across the country (withanother 26 due to be added soon).      The sites themselves are equipped with One Touch student responsekeypads, so that both audio and data are relayed back to theinstructor in real time. These keypads are a product offering of OneTouch Systems Inc. of Santa Clara, CA, a supplier of interactivelearning technology. The One Touch system allows students to registera "call" asking questions of the instructor, and lets them answertrue/false or multiple choice questions as well.     To date, the FAA has broadcast both specialized (such ashazardous materials inspection techniques) and general interest (suchas problem-solving) courses to its staff. By doing so, it hasdiscovered that teaching by satellite actually cuts approximately 25to 33 percent off course time without any decline in studentperformance.     The reason for this, says Payne, is that residential schools"keep staff in training eight hours a day because we're paying themfor eight hours a day, despite the fact that people don't learn wellthis way. Tele-Training allows employees to get up from their desk, dotwo or three hours of learning, and then return to their job--astrategy that improves their learning ability, and cuts down on thecost of covering for them while they're in school."FORD'S FORDSTAR NETWORK      Ford has been a pioneer in business TV since the early `80s,when it set up an analog network connecting 200 to 300 of its plantsand parts depots.     But it was the company's desire to connect all of its 6,000 NorthAmerican dealers that led it to establish the Fordstar Network, a $100million VSAT network built using Hughes Networks Systems' technology.     The move to Fordstar has sped up data exchange, parts ordering,and warranty submissions, says Fordstar Manager Lawrence Conley. Butit has also meant that digitally compressed video, with all of itsbenefits, has been added to the network.      Specifically, "we've got eight channels of full motion videogoing out to our dealers," says Conley. These channels featuredistance learning courses for all types of dealer staff. In addition,the courses are all live and interactive with remote sites using theOne Touch viewer response keypad system to relay student audio andresponse data back to the teacher during sessions.      To say the least, Fordstar is an impressive commitment tobusiness television, but one that Ford firmly believes it had to make.     "We're introducing new models at the rate of one every six weeksworldwide," says Conley. "These new models have a lot of newtechnology and new features, and training our dealer people to keep upwith them is important." BTV allows Ford to achieve such goals.     In addition, satellite-based distance learning has drasticallyreduced training costs, while actually improving the potential levelof expertise at dealer locations. That's because distance is no longera barrier to knowledge, thanks to the Fordstar network.JCPENNEY'S NEW DISTANCE LEARNING NETWORK      In 1995, retailer JCPenney was faced with a dilemma, namely whatto do with its aging analog business TV network.     For the past nine years, the company had been running analogbroadcasts showcasing the assortments of merchandise to store managersso that they could order for their particular stores, according to RonFazio, manager of communications programs and services. However, in1995 the company realized that sending managers the images on CD-ROMwas much more cost-effective, especially in the light of climbingsatellite costs. In addition, Fazio says the CD-ROMs were much easierfor them to manage.     Having made the switch to CD-ROM, JCPenney had to look hard atwhether to continue operating an occasional-use analog network, sincethe fundamental reason for funding it was now gone.     However, as one need faded out, a new one came to take its place;in this instance, the company's desire to start its own distancelearning video network.     "It's a whole new scenario of programming aimed at saving thecompany money and travel and per diems," says Fazio, "by doing all ofour training out of the home office, and relaying it to 1,230 sitesvia satellite." For a company such as JCPenney, such training iscrucial, since it operates in a world of expensive high-stakespromotion and ever-changing consumer tastes. To cope, managersnationwide must know what to do and when, or face the economicconsequences.     Functionally, JCPenney is relying on an outbound feed of audio,video and graphics, and an inbound audio and data feed (from 700 ofthe remote sites) from students using the One Touch response keyboard.It's a configuration that is proving to be extremely popular amongbusiness TV users.     Of course, the cost of setting up such a network under analogconditions would have been prohibitive. But thanks to the timelyarrival of digitally compressed video transmission, JCPenney was ableto cut its bandwidth requirements from one full transponder to just aquarter.     Driving the whole system--which was designed and installed by GECapital Spacenet Services--is Scientific-Atlanta's PowerVu digitalvideo compression uplink. Capable of compressing up to 10 channels ona single transponder, PowerVu is both MPEG 2 and DVB compatible,meaning that the video being delivered is, at the user end, broadcastquality.     "Scientific-Atlanta's equipment is the same as that used duringthe Olympics," notes Fazio, "which was a real confidence builder forus."     Today, JCPenney is producing about 1,200 hours of distancelearning programming a year, says Fazio; that's up radically from the400 to 500 hours of merchandising video that used to go out on its oldanalog network. It indicates just how potent an application distancelearning is for a company such as JCPenney, and how important digitalvideo compression is to keeping business television alive.MEDSTAR      Medstar is a distance learning application with a socialpurpose: providing rural and remotely-based physicians in North Dakotawith top-quality interactive distance learning from the School ofMedicine at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks.     "We typically broadcast one-hour programs related to healthcare," says Steve Gillespie, Medstar's coordinator of communicationsservices, "aimed at all the health care professions that you wouldfind in a small town, such as physicians, nurses, physical therapists,and dieticians.     "Our goal is to help small communities get better access tothings that larger communities take for granted," he adds. "This waythese professions get the continuing health care education they need,without having to spend time and money traveling to larger centers."     The Medstar application uses an analog network installed for itby Satellite Network Systems. Courses are uplinked live from aproduction control center at the School of Medicine.Two cameras are used, along with graphics, which are then sent viasatellite to 35 sites across the state. These sites--usually smallhospitals--are equipped with 1.8-meter antennas, 26-inch monitors,VCRs, and Harvard Elite audio return units. The Harvard Elite is builtby A.T. Products Inc. of Harvard, IL, a designer and manufacturer ofaudioconferencing products. The Elites, which are connected tomicrophones, allow students to "talk back" to the instructors viatelephone connections.     Distance education via business TV has paid off handsomely, saysGillespie. "Both the school and the communities involved recognizethat Medstar is a worthwhile service," he says."It's done very well."RE/MAX'S NORTH AMERICAN NETWORK      RE/MAX International Inc. is one of the few real estatecompanies that has its own business TV network, says RE/MAX VicePresident of Information Technology Bruce Benham, and it's an edge thecompany takes very seriously.     The RE/MAX Satellite Network is used for a combination ofeducation, motivation and recruitment.      For instance, "we'll have live panels of RE/MAX people talkingabout listings presentations," says Benham, "or how they do theirparticular business in terms of how they prospect for new customers,and what kind of materials and techniques they use, and so forth."      As well, RE/MAX takes pains to tape motivational speakers at itsconventions for later playback. To ensure good video and soundquality, the company shoots these features on portable sound stages.And the company also does live broadcasts where RE/MAX agents fieldquestions from prospective agents via a 1-800 telephone number.     Technically speaking, RE/MAX transmits digitally using GeneralInstrument's SpectrumSaver equipment on a BroadcastInternational-designed system, via Telstar 401 using 3.3 MHz ofbandwidth. At the receive end are about 1,200 sites, each equippedwith a 1.2-meter antenna. "They're anywhere from the far reaches ofCanada to the Caribbean," says Benham.     The CLI equipment is addressable, he adds, "so once a month oronce every other month, we'll do a broadcast that's just sent tocertain parts of the country."     Does this system work for RE/MAX? Yes, says Benham,unequivocally: with both management and sales people impressed by thenetwork's content, "the system sells itself."STATE FARM'S DISTANCE LEARNING      State Farm Insurance Companies has recently signed-on its"Interactive distance Learning Network" (ILN), a digitally-basedvoice, audio and data system which keeps agents and employeesup-to-date on both company policies and professional education.     "We're interested in sending a consistent message to all ourassociates at the same time," explains ILN Manager Patsy Fortune. "Wewant to get our promotions out in a timely manner, and we want to saveon travel expenses wherever possible."     State Farm originates its distance learning courses from itscorporate headquarters in Bloomington, IL. Using equipment installedby Convergent Media Systems, it sends out video, audio and graphicsvia Galaxy 7 to students at 33 sites nationwide. It receives questionsvia the One Touch keypad system.     Although live, the classes offered by State Farm are anything butoff-the-cuff.      "It's all rehearsed and choreographed," says Fortune. In fact,for every hour broadcast, State Farm requires four to eight hours ofrehearsal. As well, the company offers a workshop for instructors, sothat they can get a sense of how different distance education is fromconventional in-class teaching.     "We work with the instructors to make sure the material they'representing is interactive, that it invites student participation,"says Fortune. "After all, if you're just going to have a talking head,you might as well just send out a tape."     Although only officially launched on August 1, 1996, ILN isalready proving to be a big hit with both management and salespeople.     "We're definitely getting a very, very positive reception fromthe people taking the classes," says Fortune. "They see it as atime-saver and a money-saver."     As the examples we've just seen prove, business TV is not onlysurviving the spectrum crunch, it's thriving, thanks to digital videocompression. However, it's also clear that another reason for itscontinued health is its ability to branch out from traditionalvideoconferencing to a host of new uses.      One thing appears certain: as technology progresses, so will thesize and scope of business TV.       James Careless is a freelance writer based in Ottawa, Ontario,Canada.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIA SATELLITE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--WHY SATELLITE DISTANCE LEARNING IS BOTH THRIVINGAND MERELY SURVIVINGby Britton Manasco      The satellite distance learning industry is both expanding andcontracting at the same time.The industry stands between two worlds--one vibrant and promising, onetrapped in political gridlock.      While the business world has embraced space-based tele-learningtechnology and is investing the financial resources necessary tocreate expansive new networks, the world of education faces cost andstructural issues that are preventing the rapid spread ofsatellite-based learning networks. Satellite executives deserve aclear-eyed assessment of this complex market.   THE WORLD OF BUSINESS        For the immediate future, the real action in the distancelearning market is likely to revolve around the adult consumer whowishes to upgrade his or her own skills and knowledge.American companies now spend perhaps $100 billion on training andeducation (not counting on-the-job training). Adults spend another$200 billion to $300 billion on education at colleges, universitiesand other institutions. Therefore, figures can be expected to grow aslearning becomes a lifelong pursuit. What will not expand, however, isthe individuals' available time.That amount is fixed and the premium on it is rising precipitously.         Service providers who meet the individual's need to learn quicklyand conveniently can expect to reap tremendous rewards in the years tocome. Indeed, much of the funding now spent on instructural led,classroom education is likely to shift to high-tech learning servicesto meet consumer demands. Satellite-based learning services areparticularly attractive in this regard, especially if they can bedelivered direct-to-home or to the work-site.      Satellite services can transcend the geographical boundaries andlimits that constrain traditional education. They make a vast array oflearning opportunities available--no matter where you are. "Whetherthe market is intra-enterprise or from universities to the enterprise,we see exploding growth," says Joan Byrnes, marketing, sales and newbusiness development director for AT&T Skynet. (Editor's Note: As wewent to press, AT&T Skynet was purchased by Loral. When the deal isfinalized, the company will become Loral Skynet.)     One organization that is successfully taking advantage of thisopportunity is National Technological University (NTU). Based in FortCollins, CO, NTU transmits advanced technical and managerialtelecourses via satellite to high-profile companies such as GeneralElectric, Intel, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.NTU's interactive programs--enabling participants to communicate withinstructors by phone, fax or e-mail--have become a critical aspect ofcorporate efforts to encourage continual learning.      In the past decade, the number of NTU customer organizations hasrisen from five to 207, the number of downlink sites has grown 16 to993 and the number of non-credit short course enrollments (whichtarget people who need to strengthen or develop a special skill) hasclimbed from zero to 100,000 annually. In addition, the number ofparticipating universities who provide content and other resources hasreached 46. NTU now has roughly 4,400 graduate course enrollments andoffers 13 master degree programs.        The growth has been spectacular. NTU has been able to offer anarray of educational programming to meet the growing needs of theadult learning marketplace. NTU accomplished this in a cost-effectiveway. It digitally compresses its signals at ratios of as high as 12:1and sends them all over North America via AT&T's Telstar 401satellite.      NTU's success, however, is a sign of change in the unfoldinginformation era. It reflects the ascendance of technical professionalsin the modern organization. Consider the numbers. In the last fourdecades, the number of technical workers in America has risen 300percent--or three times the growth rate of the overall workforce--to20 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington,DC. It is a segment of the workforce that is on the front lines oforganizational and technological change.      If technical professionals are to be effective, however, theymust continually learn new skills and competencies. "Technologicalcreativity today is strongly related to advanced education," says NTUfounder Lionel Baldwin.      Similarly, there has been significant growth in company-specific,satellite learning networks. Some estimates suggest that there areroughly 120 networks of this kind and more than 50,000 satellitedownlinks in North America alone. Ford Motor, for instance, hasdeveloped a digital system (dubbed "Fordstar") that beams management,technical and customer service-oriented telecourses to more than 6,000dealerships. Ford executives estimate that the network willdramatically reduce training costs that the organization absorbs eachyear while expanding the number of training options. In a competitivearena such as the automotive business, such dramatic moves can becost-justified and acted upon. Other companies such as K-Mart, FederalExpress and RE/MAX International have also devoted significantresources to the development of satellite-based learning networks.RE/MAX, for instance, is a real estate firm that transmits an array oftelecourses to 1,200 sites throughout North America and has apotential viewing audience of 23,000 sales agents. K-Mart sendsmanagerial programming to 2,500 sites. And Federal Express reaches1,000 satellite dishes. All are focused on enhancing the capabilitiesof their employees while eliminating expensive classroom training (andthe travel and lodging it requires). It's unlikely that thesecompanies would be making such tremendous investments if they weren'tall in such highly competitive businesses. The market imperative isclear.       Even the competitive higher education system is responding tochanging market demands. One of the most experienced distance learningproviders is Oklahoma State University, which operates a tele-learningprogram. It transmits telecourses to students and companies throughoutthe country from its base in Stillwater, OK, and has attractedcorporate clients such as Phillips Petroleum, Conoco Inc. and SeagateTechnologies.        On the West Coast, the California State University (CSU) systemis also reaching out via satellite. Its programs in political science,social science and business administration, among others, are nowtransmitted via Hughes Communications' Ku-band SBS 5 satellitethroughout the state of California and the rest of the country. CSUSatuses digital compression to send two channels of video programming toseven campuses and more than 30 receive sites.      "Distance learning is one way we can meet the challenge of thecoming enrollment boom," says Molly Corbett Broad, CSU executive vicechancellor. "We don't have the physical facilities here or throughoutthe system to cope with anticipated increases, but with distancelearning we can still expand access to the university. It is all partof our strategic plan to bring CSU to the students, while enhancingacademic quality and improving productivity."  THE WORLD OF EDUCATION       In the world of K-12 education, the picture is far lessattractive. "On the downside, I am a little discouraged that we havenot seen more innovation from an instructional standpoint," saysSandra Welch, executive vice president of learning services for PBS."A few years ago, there was a great deal of creativity. Organizationswere creating advanced courses and we were connecting people together.There hasn't been that kind of innovation in the last three to fouryears."   She notes that the education sector is going through aperiod when a lot of new technological capabilities--includingvideoconferencing and the World Wide Web--are becoming available toschools. "Schools want to experiment," she says.       Whereas satellite distance learning programs were offered on morethan 20 satellites a few years ago, there has been much consolidationand abandonment of the market in the years since. Price-sensitiveeducational entities have been unable to absorb stiff rate increasesfor spot use. C-band rates have climbed to between $575 and $725 perhour; Ku-band prices now range from $750 to $1,000. Grace Leone,president of EFC Startime, a Los Angeles-based reseller of satellitetime, says that the percentage of her business devoted to distancelearning programming has shrunk from roughly 50 percent a few yearsago to about 15 percent today.       "What really was a vibrant, growing field in the educationindustry has come to, if not a full halt, a slow pace," adds ShellyWeinstein, president and CEO of Washington, DC-based NETO-EDSAT, anon-profit organization representing educational institutions thatemploy information technologies to deliver their products andservices.       Some educational leaders have publicly accused satelliteexecutives of greedily price gouging them. Satellite operators,however, point out that space segment supply has shrunk in recentyears due to growing commercial demand for capacity and a limitednumber of successful new launches over North America.     The larger problem is the inability of government-run,educational institutions to invest the money necessary to becomeviable customers of satellite services. As a result, much of the newactivity in education is sponsored by states rather than schooldistricts or individual schools.Satellite networks are now being funded by such states as Georgia,Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida--all of which are part of the"educational neighborhood" on Telstar 401 (which also includes NTU,SERC and PBS).      The Florida Department of Education, for instance, expects tomake programming available to some 3,000 public school, according toAT&T. But it's unclear what impact such broadly defined, "community"networks can have. They often carry government and public servicemessages of various sorts. They also tend to fill educational gaps insuch areas as the sciences, mathematics and foreign languages for themost poorly served student rather than expand choices for the typicalstudent.     Satellite-based education is at its best when it transportsstudents to distant places and generates enthusiasm for learning.Glenn Kessler, director of legislative affairs and affiliate relationsissues at the United States Distance Learning Association, points outthat satellite-based, electronic field trips have enabled childrenaround the country to interactively participate in Civil Warreenactments, archaeological digs in South America, underwaterexploration efforts in several oceans and visit some of the greatestmuseums on the planet.      Organizations such as PBS and Turner Educational Services havebeen active developers of such programming. Welch mentions PBS'srecent and upcoming electronic field trips to the Costa Ricanrainforests, Ellis Island and the United Nations. Such efforts arecreating a demand among young people for better and more engaginglearning services. "Once the communication system is in place, you cansee what is possible and you are going to want it," says Kessler. Andwhile economic and political hurdles are the primary ones preventingK-12 education from becoming a dynamic market for satellite services,technical hurdles are not to be discounted. John Champagne, directorof broadcast products for network equipment provider Comsat RSI, notesthat many educators have been stymied by the question ofdigitalization. In some cases, the costs of the transition from analogto digital is deemed prohibitive. However, other institutions arestruggling to choose from a field of largely incompatible compressiontechnologies--whether they be provided by Scientific-Atlanta, GeneralInstrument, Comsat/Wegener or some other vendor.      Comsat RSI has created networks for Channel One (10,000 nodes),Kentucky Educational Television (2,000 nodes) and, despite theeconomic and technical challenges of potential customers, experiencedgrowth of between 50 to 60 percent last year. "The big thing is thateveryone will have to go digital eventually," Champagne says.        Of course, most of the near-term opportunities are likely to bein business markets and, possibly, among agencies in the federalgovernment. The downsizing of government, presaged by the end of theCold War and the rise of the federal debt, has proved a surprisingopportunity for providers of distance learning capabilities. JollyHolden, executive marketing manager for distance learning at AT&TTridom, explains that the federal government's satellite training andeducation network (GETN) is expected to grow from 900 downlink sitesin 1995 to 1,800 by the end of 1997 and 3,000 by the end of 1998.Between now and then the number of telecourse hours will triple fromroughly 4,000 to about 12,000.  The network spans an array of civilianand military agencies--everything from the Department of Energy to theDepartment of Defense.THE YEARS TO COME        In the years to come, satellite equipment and service providerscan be expected to focus on creating end-to-end solutions thateliminate many of the risks and capital-investments that distancelearning customers are now forced to assume. Indeed, some companiesare beginning to introduce packages that enable organizations withexpansive networks of satellite downlinks to pay monthly service feesand lease the equipment. As arrangements such as this become morecommon, more companies and organizations--private sector andpublic--will be willing to implement distance learning programs.        Still another promising development is the emergence of thedirect broadcast satellite business. While DBS players have for themost part resisted calls for an "open architecture" consortium thatenables consumers to point their satellite dishes at multiple orbitallocations (see Via Satellite's June 1996 issue, "Open ArchitectureDBS"), this would be an essential step if true narrowcast programmingis ever to be offered direct-to-home. This may ultimately be oneimportant route by which educational and learning service providerscost-effectively reach diverse and targeted markets.     One other route, of course, is the Internet. Satellite-basedcontent providers will have to incorporate dynamic, interactive,online services into their program offerings in the years ahead ifthey wish to succeed. It is no longer enough to merely transmit staticprogramming, especially if the objective is learning. The era of MTVis effectively over. This is an era of multiple, reinforcing media.         One trend that bodes favorably for the future of distancelearning is the rise of business as a purveyor of educationalservices. Stan Davis, Harvard lecturer and author of The Monster Underthe Bed (Touchstone), argues that the government school system willbecome a relatively less important force in education than thetraining and continual learning that occurs in the business worldduring the individual's working lifetime. Due to both demographic andeconomic trends, he argues, education will no longer be merely"front-ended" in the two initial decades of a person's life. It willat last be recognized as a lifelong pursuit. That suggests that themarket for learning is increasingly swinging toward adults withworking experience. Already, more than half of the people paying forthe services of colleges and universities are older than 25 years ofage and have entered the workforce, according Educom, a nonprofitorganization in Washington, DC that tracks higher educational trendsin the United States.     Satellite distance learning is thriving in the open market ofbusiness and merely surviving in the market of education. But thesmart money knows that the learning market, as a whole, represents atremendous economic opportunity. Satellites will unquestionably assumea vital role in the infrastructure of the emerging knowledge economy.Still, it's important to make distinctions and recognize that somesegments are more promising--at least, in the short term--than others.For those who invest wisely, the learning market may turn out to beone of the greatest business frontiers of the next century.

Oberst, Jr.      Increasingly, the satellite industry is accessing the vast storeof information that is on the Internet, free or nearly so for thetaking. The Net can be a strong resource for regulatory or generalindustry research, if you have time to play with the many differentsites that are available.     A few practical warnings at the outset: you can spend an entirelifetime sorting and sifting through the virtual maze of Internetsites. Thus, surfers generally maintain a library of bookmarks for thebest or most-used sites. Some favorites are maintained by the Analysysconsulting firm in Cambridge, U.K., and the University of Michigan.      The "Regulator" page on the Analysys server includes links tonumerous regulatory agencies and many other topics within the domainof telecommunications. The Michigan site is succinctly named "TelecomInformation Resources on the Internet." It is supported by theMichigan Schools of Information and of Public Policy Studies, andclaims to provide links to over 2,000 sites. Another useful site is"Diane's List" maintained at the U.S. National Telecommunications andInformation Administration.      A little Net secret is that many documents pulled up are informats that do not translate well into hard copy. This is a problemif you need to download and maintain the original document. ReprintingInternet documents, particularly those with built-in links to otherInternet documents, often requires reformatting the original. The endresult can either be difficult to read, messy, or starkly differentfrom the original in format and pagination. (Hint, use the "replace"word processing function a lot to eliminate those pesky HTML codes anduseless paragraph marks.)     Those caveats aside, the Net is a startling gold mine ofinformation. There are few laws or government regulations on Websites, the Canadian and U.S. telecoms laws being notable exceptions.However, a large number of regulatory agencies now maintain Web sitesthat can be useful for anyone working in the international arena.     Two sites on which to focus are maintained by the U.S. FederalCommunications Commission and the International TelecommunicationUnion.      The FCC site is a basic bookmark for the satellite researcher, ofcourse, since it is a quick source of recent FCC documents. You cannotrely on it for older documents (go to the pay online databanks forthat). But for anyone outside Washington, DC, who does not obtainhard-copy FCC documents regularly, the fcc.gov site is a greatresource.     The Internet is now the primary source for updates on the FCCworking groups that are preparing for the World Radio Conferences(WRCs). The FCC decided to stop preparing lengthy notices of proposedrulemaking or notices of inquiry on WRC issues, but instead to publishregular agendas, minutes and schedules for the various WRC workinggroups. To follow the working group agendas and summaries, go to theWRC-97 site within the International Bureau.The International Bureau is the location for most satellite-relateditems, so this is a site to "bookmark."     The ITU maintains a treasure trove of information, but as withmost treasure hunts, there can be frustrating deadends. Some of themost enticing documents might be available only for a fee, or to ITUMembers, or participating member companies that have passwords. Evenso, quite a few documents on current debates concerning, for example,"paper satellites" can be found under the search term "Resolution 18"on the function within the ITU site. The background on regulatory orpolicy forums can be pulled off the Web as well.     Even if certain documents are password protected, sometimes youcan find the same document freely available at another site within thelabyrinth of ITU levels. Unfortunately, you will not be able to accessITU recommendations that way, since the agency wants to preserve itsability to earn substantial revenues from selling these and otherdocuments to the paying public.     One advantage of most ITU documents available on the Web is thatthey suffer from fewer formatting problems than many others. ITUdocuments can usually be downloaded and reprinted with little or noreformatting. The same cannot be said for many European Commissiondocuments, even in the telecommunications and Information Societyarea, which can suffer from messy formats.

As we look back on an industry that was born 10years ago, we see that despite a slow start, the concept ofresidential electronic messaging services is beginning to comeinto vogue.      To the videotex industry, the 1980s have in many ways been aparadox--a decade perhaps epitomized best by the old literaryline "it was the best of times--it was the worst of times."      For those of us who now look back over the past 10 years inthe information services arena to determine the common threadthat ties together the events of that decade, the only constantappears to have been change.      As a fitting beginning to the decade of the 1990s, VIEWTEXTis taking a look back on the major events, visions, and changesof the past decade and the past year that have brought us to thispoint in our industry's history.Challenges and opportunities      Riding the sweeping tide of the Information Age, theconsumer videotex industry was born amid much fanfare in 1981.By the end of the 1980s, some advocates claimed at the time,every home in America would access information services--including news and banking--from a terminal in their living room.As we enter the 1990s, that vision is still far from reality.      Even by the time of the Videotex '82 conference in July ofthat year, the reality of the mammoth challenge of deployment hadbecome apparent.      While a number of videotex trials (Time Inc., Knight-Ridder/AT&T, and Times Mirror) were already under way, questionson divergent standards, consumer demand, and the service'srelationship to existing media were already being raised.      These factors, and an insufficient residential terminalbase, had closed the book on those early trials by the late1980s.  In the last 2 years, however, a proliferation of personalcomputers in the home and RBOC gateway involvement hasresurrected the videotex concept.      One nationwide service, the IBM/Sears joint venture Prodigy,as well as regional services operated by Southwestern Bell andBellSouth, Nynex, Bell Atlantic and U S West appear to be gainingsteam and may give American living rooms an intelligent window onthe world in the 1990s.      Other developments, including ISDN and RBOC installations offiber-to-the-home, could also give the industry the push it needsto realize the vision in this decade.A new telecommunications infrastructure      Perhaps the one event that has had the most significantimpact on the  communications marketplace is the 1982 antitrustsettlement that broke up AT&T's telecommunications empire.      So significant were the events of that time, that theripples have not only been felt throughout the 1980s, butrepercussions will likely continue throughout the remainder ofthe 20th century.  The AT&T-Justice Department SettlementAgreement, signed Jan. 8, 1982, by the 2 parties, replaced the1956 consent decree that had ended a 1949 antitrust action.      Under the terms of that agreement, AT&T divested its 22 Belloperating companies (BOCs), which then were required to functionas separate entities independent of AT&T.      The BOCs, which were grouped into 7 regional holdingcompanies (RBOCs), retained the local exchange and exchangeaccess services, but were banned from engaging in manufacturing,interexchange services, information services, or "any otherproduct or service, except exchange telecommunications andexchange access service, that is not a natural monopoly serviceactually regulated by tariff."      For the first time, alternative interexchange carriers suchas MCI would be able to compete on a level playing field.  Forthe price of divestiture,  AT&T retained its interexchangebusiness and all constraints on its dabbling in technology werelifted--enabling AT&T to realize its dreams of moving into thecomputer business.  It was, however, barred from engaging inelectronic publishing services until last year.      When U.S. District Judge Harold Greene OK'd AT&T's bid toenter the electronic publishing business last August, he may haveopened the door allowing the long-distance giant to offer contentin a cross-country videotex and audiotext network should it sodecide.      In addition to freeing AT&T to provide videotex andaudiotext, the decision theoretically will also permit AT&T toprovide electronic messaging services, including E-mail,nationally via the same transmission facility.      Greene's decision reversed a clause in the modified finaljudgment (MFJ) that for the last 7 years has blocked AT&T fromengaging in the electronic publishing business.  When the MFJ wasissued, the court reasoned that the prohibition was necessaryboth because of AT&T's "de facto control of the interexchangenetwork, coupled with the infancy of the electronic publishingindustry" at that time.      Greene, who also signed the order that dissected Ma Bell'sempire, would continue to play a critical role in the evolutionof the new telecommunications order throughout the remainder ofthe decade.  On March 7, 1988, Greene issued a 66-page orderreversing some of the provisions of the (MFJ).      That original order permitted the RBOCs to engage in thetransmission of information as part of a gateway to aninformation service, but not in the generation or manipulation ofinformation content.      Other concessions made to the RBOCs in that order includedthe ability to provide electronic mail, voice storage andretrieval, voice messaging services, and kiosk billing.      This resulted in the entry of the RBOCs into the electronicmessaging arena in a big way.  Today, most of the RBOCs offergateway services and many offer electronic mail services to arapidly growing base of corporate clients.      At the dawn of the 1990s, support continues to build for so-called "free the RBOCs" proposals, and faced with the need toaddress critical issues of global competitiveness and customerservice, the RBOCs appear destined for regulatory relief in thefirst half of the new decade.      Last year was a year of heavy activity for the RBOCs as theybegan to stake a claim in the information services marketplace.The Information Age officially arrived in the Omaha, Neb./CouncilBluffs, Iowa, area in November 1989, when the U S West CommunityLink Gateway went on line.      U S West joined fellow RBOCs BellSouth (the first to enterthis field), Southwestern Bell, Nynex, and Bell Atlantic in thevideotex gateway services market.  By year's end, only PacificBell and Ameritech were still lacking an on-line gateway by whichtheir customers can gain access to electronic information andmessaging services.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIEWTEXT via NewsNetJanuary, 1990Pacific Bell bows out of the videotex arena      West Coast information service providers were dealt a severeblow in November, when Pacific Bell abruptly cancelled itsCalifornia Online gateway project, apparently a victim ofChairman Ginn's budget axe.  This most recent setback for thevideotex industry is reminiscent of Pacific Bell's ill-fatedProject Victoria, an ISDN trial dismantled in the spring of 1988(VT, June 1988, p. 2).      Roger Conrad, director of voice information and gatewayservices for Pacific Bell, told VIEWTEXT, "We are deferring atthis point."Customer needs; commercial viability      At the time, Conrad said, "Products that we are currentlybeing allowed to introduce into the marketplace will not satisfyor meet our customers' needs.  Therefore, we have concluded thatit will not be commercially viable for Pacific Bell or theinformation providers that would be involved in the trial."      Pacific Bell disassembled its estimated $1-2 million gatewayproject with its 8-10 employees and re-allocated the resources toits other projects such as voice mail, X.400, and the interactivevoice response service bureau for 976 and 900 providers.California On-Line trial was scheduled for 1990      The FCC had conditionally approved Pacific Bell's ComparablyEfficient Interconnection (CEI) plan to offer a videotex gatewayservice, "California Online," scheduled for a market trial in theSan Francisco Bay area during the second quarter of 1990.      Quantum Computer was to develop a user interface for thegateway, and Vicorp Interactive System to implement theinformation storage facility using a Tandem NonStop computersystem.      Conrad laid the blame on a lack of maturity of the videotexmarket which is due to insufficient PC penetration (despite a BayArea ubiquity of PCs that ranks among the highest in the nation),little general public awareness, and not enough on-lineinformation services out there for companies.      The project is being "put on hold" until there issignificant market development or deregulation occurs.Deregulation is considered a very critical factor.  AlthoughConrad asserted that competition with IBM/Sears joint ventureProdigy was not part of the considerations, he did say thatProdigy has not had the restrictions placed on it that the RBOCshave had to endure, such as offering preferred access to somecustomers, providing their own services or centralizingoperations between LATAs.      Most of the other RBOCs appear to have acknowledged thatthey must commit to the videotex market without expecting profitsin the foreseeable future.  Pacific Bell chose not to wait outthe storm under the conditions that exist today in the regulatedmarketplace.Up-to-date in Omaha with U S West      U S West customers officially entered the information age inNovember when the Community Link trial began in the Omaha, Neb.,and Council Bluffs, Iowa, (the 2 cities are separated by a river)metropolitan area.  U S West's marketing communications managerRon Dulle said that the RBOC initially targeted 70,000 customersthrough a direct-mail campaign.      Approximately 40 percent of the services on their CommunityLink gateway have local applications, including grocery orderingand delivery, municipal government, local sports, symphony,community calendar, advertising, and so on.          By year's end, U SWest had 64 contracts with information service providers (ISPs),Dulle told us, with more being added every week.  Because eachISP can provide more than one service, the total number of onlineservices approaches the 150-175 range.      Customers access the service through modem-equipped personalcomputers or through a dumb terminal that can be either rented orpurchased from U S West.  A Community Link Center retail storewill be opened in an Omaha shopping mall, where customers canobtain the communications devices and software necessary toaccess the service.      Philips Minitel M2 terminals, which support both Teletel andASCII formats, can be rented for $7.95 a month, or be purchasedfor $295.  Two months free rental or a $50 dollar discount plusfree software were being offered as an introductory inducement tostart up the service.      Emulation software from Minitel is available for IBM, AppleII, Macintosh and Commodore, and will be available under theCommunity Link label.Bell Atlantic introduced gateways in Washington and Philadelphia      In January of 1989, Bell Atlantic kicked off 2 gatewaytrials on the East Coast.  Bell of Pennsylvania is targetingsmall businesses in the Philadelphia area, while C&P Telephone isfocusing on residential customers in the Washington, D.C., metroarea.  To date, the RBOC has not attracted tremendous numbers ofusers.      The trial will continue in 1990 with more emphasis devotedto aggressively marketing the service.   Bell Atlantic firstconcentrated on enhancing its gateway service by adding 3 newinformation providers (IPs) to its gateway trial (VT, May 1989,p. 3).  Dialcom, American CitiNet Inc. and Minitel USA Inc.together are providing more than 90 new services to theWashington Metropolitan area adding electronic mail, taxinformation, and travel information.           CitiNet's 47 servicescover a broad spectrum, from an E-mail service, American CitiNetMail, weekends on the road, to cultural events up in the NewEngland area.      Minitel Services was providing access to an extensive arrayof French and English language services by the fourth or fifth ofAugust, said Joseph Mazzeo, Minitel Services president.  Mazzeospoke of a unique French cooking class in English allowing usersto "look in the refrigerator for ingredients" and a Euro-baseddatabase of information by the European Economic Community (EEC).      Howard Morrison, product manager for Bell Atlantic services,told us,  "What we learn this year will determine how we rollthis service out to other service areas.  We're looking to expandalready."      The total number of online services reached 112 this fall,and included a strong local orientation.  Some of the more recentofferings include California Wine Online, GEnie, JournalGraphics, Trademark Register, and a Washington Dating Service.Bell Atlantic also offers an electronic messaging service that isprovided through the SprintMail (formerly Telemail) network.      Bell Atlantic's Gateway Service is available to allChesapeake and Potomac Telephone residential and businesscustomers in the Washington metropolitan area on a 24-hour basisvia a modem and a personal computer.      Bell Atlantic also included Prodigy's videotex services in aresidential trial of integrated services digital network (ISDN)last summer.  This was the first inclusion on Prodigy in an ISDNtrial since the AT&T ISDN demonstration at NetPower '89.      Prodigy's computer-based information and electronic shoppingservice as well as Bell Atlantic's gateway service was offeredfree of charge for the residential trial.  The advantage of usingProdigy or Bell Atlantic's Gateway service with ISDN is theaccess through a plug in a wall vs. the need for a modem, and nottying up a voice line.      In December, addressing a gathering of communicationsmanagers, Bell Atlantic CEO Raymond W. Smith blasted a decisionby Judge Greene regarding intra-LATA gateways, the effect ofwhich requires the RBOCs to maintain separate databases in eachlocal access transport area (LATA) for its electronic informationgateways (See related story, p. 11).      The Bell Atlantic CEO said the decision hurts his firm'sgateway by "raising costs considerably, and is an inefficient wayto provide information services to the public."  Smith would alsolike to see an end to the restrictions on providing informationcontent imposed by the MFJ under the administration of JudgeGreene.Southwestern Bell follows French example for SourceLine      Southwestern Bell launched an ambitious gateway trial thispast year in the Houston area.  SW Bell was the first RBOC toapply the French "Minitel" strategy by seeding the market with12,000 terminals offered free for the first 6 months.      The Southwestern RBOC has been working closely with U.S.Videotel, for the provision of both terminals and services inwhat sales manager Guy Miller called "the largest, most ambitiousmass market gateway trial attempted by an RBOC."  By the end ofthe summer, over 15,000 customers had come aboard as on-linesubscribers, with over 10,000 of them using the "dumb" terminals.      Southwestern Bell also went after the small businesses inthe Houston area by offering "a couple of thousand" free U.S.Videotel minitels, said Scott Hilgeman from SW Bell.      Offering the terminals to a small business will provide aninformation retrieval base that will not tie up a computeralready committed to a specific project or person.  For smalloffices that do not usually have computers to spare, this couldbe an added bonus.      Southwestern Bell expects its legislative news, grouporganization information, dining locations, electronic mail,financial news, and travel information along with the 300 otherservices to attract the small businesses to its service in thegreater Houston area.BellSouth first to videotex through unregulated subsidiary      BellSouth's unregulated subsidiary, BellSouth Enterprises,is zeroing in on the Atlanta marketplace with the TranstextUniversal Gateway (TUG) by using local services as a competitiveedge.  The project was begun in 1988 and the RBOC reports "goodsuccess" with the project thus far.      By the end of October 1989, TUG had over 50 ISPs on-linewhich translates into many more services.  Customers are beingprovided with what BellSouth refers to as "useful and attractiveinformation," such as the Alliance Theatre Co., Ask-a-Vet, chatlines, newspapers, Grolier Encyclopedia as well as access toDialcom and Delphi.      Although BellSouth was the first RBOC to introduce itsgateway at the end of August 1988, the RBOC still considers theservice new, is working on feedback, and considers itself to havea "ubiquity that cannot be denied" in the marketplace.Nynex introduces Info-Look gateway      Info-Look, the public network gateway service introduced byNew York Telephone last year, offers residential and businesscustomers access to a wide range of information, educational,shop-at-home services via the use of a PC or terminal, modem andcommunications software, and a New York Telephone Calling Card.      "Info-Look service dramatically changes the way peopleaccess and use information," Walter Richard, vice president ofmarketing and technology at New York Telephone, boasted.      "For the first time, our customers can reach and interactwith a variety of services quickly and easily from their home oroffice."  Over 60 services are offered to customers in thegreater New York metropolitan area, Long Island, and Westchester,Putnam and Rockland counties.      Charges for New York Tel's new service include the cost ofthe telephone call to the gateway, plus 5 cents a minute for thetime spent to review the directory, plus the specific rates setby the information provider (IP) for their individual services.      Charges for Info-Look may appear separately on the New YorkTelephone bill under "Data Services," or the IPs also have theoption to bill customers directly.      Customers can block access to various services, or pricespecific services by following directions on the directory.  Allaccess to Info-Look can be blocked, at no charge, by calling NewYork Tel's business office.      Nynex first offered the Info-Look service in Vermont,through New England Telephone, in December of 1988.  The Vermontgateway is serving customers throughout the state with about 100information and consumer services.Canadian videotex activity on the rise     Having conquered Montreal on a market trial basis, Alex--Bell Canada's videotex service will move on to Toronto in April1990 with its information service.      The company is rolling out in Toronto almost a year ahead ofschedule because of what it calls "customer interest in theservice, market demand, and the growth of the videotex supportindustry."      Last May, the videotex service had attracted almost 13,000Montreal subscribers, and was predicting 20,000 subscribers bythe summer.      U.S. Videotel will begin providing 50 services to Alex bythe middle of next year.  In addition to the Texas-based serviceprovider, La Redoute--a subsidiary of Sears Canada, ConsumersDistributing, National Pagette and Hertz Rent-A-Car have recentlysigned on with Alex.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIEWTEXT via NewsNetJanuary, 1990PRODIGY GROWS BY 450 PERCENT, APPROACHES 200,000 HOUSEHOLDS     Since its launch when the service began with 35,000households, Prodigy has attracted nearly 200,000 households, fora total of 315,000 users, as of Dec. 31, 1989.  That translatesto a 450 percent rate of growth over the past year.      According to President Theodore Papes, Prodigy has more thandoubled the number of member households since it entered the NewYork market last spring, when membership stood at 50,000households.      Sources say that Sears and IBM have spent more than $700million on Prodigy thus far, and they still have a way to gobefore the service begins to run in the black.      Prodigy has recently begun packaging its software with aHayes Personal Modem which is available in either a 1200 or 2400baud version.  Although the modem is not fully functional (userscannot dial in), the package is an attractive "turn-key" systemthat provides everything a properly equipped personal computerowner needs to get on line within 15 to 20 minutes after openingthe box.      As it stands, the packaging of the software/modemcombination appears to have made Prodigy an appealing Christmasgift, something the marketers no doubt anticipated, and theservice made a major sales push during the holiday season.      Nynex, whose electronic gateway for information servicescompetes with Prodigy, is the first of the RBOCs to enter into abusiness relationship withthe Sears/IBM-owned information service provider.      Prodigy has negotiated bundling relationships with differentcompanies to enlarge its public profile.      As far as the banking side is concerned, Prodigy has signedan exclusive contract with Wells Fargo Bank which prohibits otherCalifornia financial institutions through 1990 from offering thehome banking service.A growth year      Earlier last year, Prodigy made a big splash entering newmarkets in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Chicago,and the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.      The Twin City area of 115,0001 homes with personal computerswill also be serviced by Super Valu, a large grocery store chain.      The Chicago area had on line 375,000 homes with personalcomputers and will have NBD, Illinois banks to offer electronichome banking on the Prodigy service.      When Prodigy launched its new service in Chicago, itannounced it was in 85,000 households and that figure represented2.3 persons per household using the service.      While Prodigy's reach into the consumer marketplace in 1989was significantly extended, it experienced a few minor setbacks.Citizens and Southern National (C&S) of Atlanta discontinued itshome banking service, (HomEc) offered via Prodigy on Sept. 15.      Although C&S gained nearly 50 customers a week since theservice was introduced in October 1988, Bill Van Landingham,president of C&S in Georgia, said business priorities had beenreviewed and the bank had decided to "allocate resources nowcommitted to the HomEc program to other activities."       C&S was servicing 1,100 accounts or households, ScottScredon, a bank spokesman, said.  Prodigy said it had 1,500accounts, but Scredon explained that included couples using thesame account.      VIEWTEXT learned in late July that C&S was reevaluating itsbanking service with Prodigy.  Prodigy officials we contacted atthat time were not aware of the event.Battle lines drawn in Houston      Prodigy moved into the Houston area last year the same wayit has moved into all of its areas across the United States.  Theonly difference in Houston is that Southwestern Bell Telephone(SWBT), along with U.S. Videotel, had already staked their claimto the greater Houston area (VT, April 1989, p. 2).      In addition to moves into Texas, Prodigy Services Co. hasmoved into Denver and Miami.  More than 125,000 homes in theDenver area and another 140,000 homes in the Miami area with PCsnow have access to Prodigy services.  Prodigy distributed itsfree start-up kits in both areas to seed the market and will, ofcourse, charge $49.95 for the kit after the promotion isfinished.      The computer-based information and electronic shoppingservice, which is owned by IBM and Sears, Roebuck, & Co., hasalso entered into an agreement with First Interstate of Denver toprovide the banking service.  Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ofNew York will do processing for the Denver bank.      Prodigy has not come up with a bank for the Miami area as ofyet, but it's a foregone conclusion that the information serviceis looking for a banking partner for the area.      Even sophisticated technology is not immune to occasionaloutages.  A Prodigy Services Co. computer went down on May 8,after a glitch in the software package caused the computer tooverload, and precipitate intermittent outages for the nationwideon-line system (VT, March 1989, p. 4).      The computer-based information and electronic shoppingservice was "on and off Monday night and Tuesday," said Brian Ekof Prodigy.      By [early] Wednesday, "service was restored to some parts ofthe nation, and by 8:00 p.m. Wednesday, the service wascompletely restored," Ek added.      Ek said the company will continue to monitor the system, butthe "fix was put in place before the peak usage time on Wednesdaynight."  He said he was confident about the restoration but addedno one could promise problems would not occur again.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIEWTEXT via NewsNetJanuary, 1990VIDEOTEX SERVICES FORM MARKETING CONSORTIUM TO SEED CONSUMERMARKET     In an effort to provide a shot in the arm to the residentialelectronic messaging services marketplace, 7 key videotexservices in the United States joined forces in September 1989 topromote consumer videotex.  VIEWTEXT discovered that the newgroup, dubbed the Videotex Marketing Consortium, planed to seedthe consumer market with access terminals by selling more than50,000 French Minitels to the regional Bell operating companies(RBOCs) at a low cost.      Under the tentative plan, the RBOCs would acquire theterminals from the group and would distribute them to consumers.The terminals would be rented at a rate of $7 to $10 per month,although direct sales of the terminals to interested customerswould be another likely option.      The 7 members of the consortium are BASELINE II Inc., CTLCommunications Inc., General Videotex Inc., Minitel Services Co.,Minitel U.S.A. Inc., U.S. Videotel and Videotex Development Corp.Additional firms are expected to join the group within the nextfew weeks.      Members of the group with services on the new Bell operatingcompany gateways reported seeing tremendous growth in usage inthe Southwestern Bell Houston market, which was seeded withterminals, when compared with other markets.      "We don't think this difference is a question of climate,"he continued.  "The main factor separating the Houston experiencefrom that of Burlington, Vt.; the New York City area; Washington,D.C.; Atlanta and Philadelphia, is that there is a strongmarketing commitment and that terminals--or access devices--areavailable in Houston and nowhere else."Negotiations under way with terminal manufacturers      All of the members of the group have vowed to invest in thepromotion of the terminals in key Gateway markets.  The Gatewayoperator in each case will be contacted to participate in thepromotion and will handle the consumer billing.      The consortium has set aside a $20 million-plus advertisingand marketing budget to accomplish the task.      "We got involved in videotex because our service is in theMinitel format," Linda Brown, director of marketing anddevelopment at Baseline II, an on-line information service forthe film and television industry and a key member of the group,explained.      The consortium's efforts, Brown said, will focus on tryingto "re-enact the experience in France" in which French consumersreceived terminals at no cost and were charged access charges forthe on-line services they used.      "We are convinced that the Gateway videotex market is aboutto explode in the U.S.," Bruce Forgrieve of U.S. Videotel said.      "We have proven that our services can be successful when wework with an RBOC that has adopted a large-scale access deviceand marketing strategy.  All that remains for additional successis to get access devices into the hands of consumers.  This planwill provide a major impetus to the birth of a new industry."      In other videotex industry events, Robert Smith, executivedirector of the Videotex Industry Association, confided thatwithin the next year "regional gateways will take a hard look atgateway business."      His biggest concern was that "senior managers will forget itis a long-term business, and view it as short term."  Theexecutive director emphasized that "this is a business of thefuture."  He reminded us it was clearly not a "get rich quick"business.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIEWTEXT via NewsNetJanuary, 1990THE MINITEL COMES OF AGE AND COMES TO AMERICA      As the Minitel system in France nears a decade of service,and boasts 4.5 million users enjoying access to 11,000 services,France Telecom has set it sights on expanding its servicesabroad.  This effort has been focused on the North Americanmarket through its Intelmatique international division, whichincludes subsidiaries Minitel USA, Minitel Services Company, andMinitelnet Inc.      The 11,000 videotex information services, all France Telecomhas to offer, were made available over Minitelnet Inc. to NorthAmerican users of the Minitel network on May 1.  Minitel can beaccessed from over 160 locations in the United States.Previously, Minitelnet Inc. accessed only 1,500 informationservices, and the recently added French Electronic DirectoryService, which offers 25 million white and yellow page listingsin French and English.      A recent expansion of the Minitel system allows NorthAmerican ISPs to market their services online to the over 4million subscribers in France.  The service is offered through anetwork operated by Minitel Services Co., a partnership ofInfonet and Minitel USA.  Local access charges from citiesaccross the country vary from 15 cents per minute to $1.65 perminute.Now available on RBOC gateways      The French videotex services are now available on 5 of theRBOCs' gateways, Southwestern Bell, Bell South, Nynex, U S Westand Bell Atlantic.      The U S West gateway, which was developed in partnershipwith Minitel USA, began providing services in November.  Minitelterminals are being leased to U S West gateway users in Omaha.      Scott Magee, director of Minitelnet, said he expected "thenumber of English language services to grow" as usage increased.He added, "We expect to be on all the RBOC gateways within ayear."Thomas Morgan, VIA chairman, hints of more intelligent terminals      Thomas Morgan, vice president of Quantum Computer Servicesand chairman of the Videotex Industry Association (VIA), toldVIEWTEXT last spring that most RBOCs or online informationservices going outside the PC arena had gone with Teletel,Minitel or dumb terminals but "one unannounced RBOC was planningto go with a more intelligent terminal."      Sources concluded that the unannounced RBOC would have beenPacific Bell, which was at that time planning its now defunctservice.      Morgan said his company does not consider informationservices a mass marketplace at the present time, but more of a PCarena.      Another significant issue was the calling number for gatewayservices.  Numbers, of course, vary for different areas of thecountry.      Morgan said intelligent software should be able to make thecall and set up service with other intelligent software.      The VIA president concluded that it was important to have"acquisition [as well as] retention" of customers.  He felt thatif electronic mail could be worked off-line and be connected tovoice and fax, and international connectivity could be achieved,progress was truly being made.      He said he considers inter-connectivity with matchingtransaction codes vital to the scheme.      Blocking services or requiring users to fill out writtenrequests "ignores services that have shown response."  There areother means of controlling a secure environment.  Morgan contendsthat as more is learned, customers are more interested in pricethen ONA and do not have their own network and will not have oneeither.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIEWTEXT via NewsNetJanuary, 1990JUDGE GREENE REFUSES INTER-LATA GATEWAY SERVICE     One of the most significant regulatory events of 1989concerned the future of inter-LATA videotex gateway servicesprovided by the RBOCs.  It hasbeen placed in question by JudgeHarold Greene's recent decision against Bell Atlantic.      The judge's strict interpretation of the Modified FinalJudgment (MFJ) on Jan. 24, 1989, has stopped the RBOCs fromrouting information services across local telephone boundariesusing a single gateway processor.      Bell Atlantic had proposed that a customer could dial alocal node in another part of Pennsylvania and be connected withthe gateway processor in Philadelphia over a leased line.      The central processor would then provide the customer with amenu of service providers as well as an index of services.      After the customer made a selection, the centrally locatedgateway processor in Philadelphia would tell the local node tomake the connection with the appropriate service provider.  Theactual connection would be provided by the local telephonecompany.Greene rules architecture to be interexchange      Greene turned down Bell Atlantic by saying it was"inescapable that the gateway architecture Bell Atlantic isproposing would operate on an interexchange basis, and that itwould therefore constitute an interexchange service prohibited bysection II(D)(1) of the decree."      Bell Atlantic had claimed "the transmission provided in thecontext of the gateway service did not violate the decree because"it is analogous to the regional companies' provision of officialservices across LATA boundaries which this court approved shortlyafter the breakup."      The company said the centralized arrangement was nodifferent from the centralized arrangements it uses to provideexisting telephone services like directory assistance which areconsidered official services.      These services were permitted by the original decree thatbroke up the Bell System.      Judge Greene concluded that "in every significant respect,it would be the central, multi-LATA processor, that would be theinformation services gateway.      "[Therefore,] the court holds that the operation of acentralized gateway processor is not an official service."Centralized gateway service--a new and competitive service      Greene added, "the centralized gateway service constitutedthe heart of a new and competitive service.  On that basis alone,the attempted analogy with official services has no reasonablebasis."      Richard Levine, a consultant at the Touche Ross ServiceCenter in Washington, D.C., told VIEWTEXT that "while the judge'sdecision seems to be saying 'no' to centralized use of menus,there was a slight possibility that a region might be able to geta narrowly founded waiver of the restriction to support a gatewayfor a less populous LATA."      Levine, an expert in telecommunications regulatory services,said Judge Greene was concerned about allowing BOCs to operatethese centralized services.  The judge clearly did not want toset a precedent.      Levine did say he felt it would be "unfortunate if ruralareas were deprived of gateway services" because of the ruling.      "Judge Greene's ruling has caused an adverse financialeffect on the BOCs' incentive to employ gateway services inextended rural areas or smaller LATAs.  The Justice Departmenthas still not taken a position on the waiver.  It would beappropriate to give some help on the ruling at this time."Bell Atlantic's alternative: Justice Department or waiver      A spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic said the company had "askedfor a ruling, not a waiver.  It only asked if it was apermissible service, not for a waiver."      The company considered Greene's stand too strong and lackingsympathy; however, the issue has not been confronted as a waiver.This could be an alternative to the situation as it stands.      Bell Atlantic had the choice of going before Judge Greene orthe Justice Department to file a waiver.      The RBOC did not think a waiver was necessary.  It had askedthe court to declare that it could use one computer to providegateway services throughout the entire state of Pennsylvania.      The RBOC pointed out that such an arrangement would holddown the cost of this service, and would provide services torural areas and urban centers.      Bell Atlantic estimated that the cost of putting gatewayequipment in all 5 Pennsylvania LATAs would be approximately $2million.      In Bell Atlantic's LATA regions alone, the population rangesfrom 200,000 customers to 5 million customers.  There are a totalof 161 LATAs in the United States.Pacific Telesis looks to interexchange carrier      Bill Adler, executive director of regulatory matters forPacific Telesis,said his company "will be looking at the possibility of aninterexchange carrier providing any interchange services.      "Such companies as MCI, AT&T, or other resellers would be apossibility; California has 120 interexchange carriers operatingin the state.  The problem is they do not operate everywhere inthe state.  We feel like this might have more chance of asuccess."      Adler did say, "Bell Atlantic's proposal was more efficientand cost-effective.  One of the drawbacks of MFJ is that it givesengineers heartburn."      Bell Atlantic had also been prohibited by Greene from evenleasing packet switching lines to carry inter-LATA calls togateways.  Thus, Pacific Telesis may turn to the interexchangecarriers as a possible answer to the problems.      While opposition to RBOC powers continues to be the norm inthe courts, the U.S. Congress is contemplating legislation thatwould provide some relief.  It is likely that some progressiveaction will be taken on the issue in the coming year.Back to Headline List WT03-B14-13IA086-000621-B039-384http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te147.html 205.156.212.5 19970122053357 text/html 257266HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:30:43 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:14 GMTContent-length: 257078Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te147.html Sample Issue Copyright VOICE & DATA via NewsNet October 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: HYDERABAD GOES CELLULAR (113 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA INTRODUCES NEW PAGER (157 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: PENTAFOUR TO MANUFACTURE TELECOM EQUIPMENT (147 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA BAGS $54 MILLION CONTRACT (103 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: HP PROVIDES TRAINING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS (131 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA'S WORKAHOLIC FOR THOSE WHO REALLY ARE (120 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: T-NET BAGS DELHI STOCK EXCHANGE CONTRACT (120 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: USHA COMMUNICATION LAUNCHES CORAL DIGITAL ISBX (164 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: LOTUS OFFERS A NEW E-MAIL UTILITY (170 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: SOFTWARE DEALERS ASSOCIATION TO COUNTER GREY MARKET (100 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: HINDITRON INTRODUCES FLUKE'S RCL METER (169 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: NIIT LAUNCHES NETVARSITY (190 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: INTERNET SOFTWARE FOR INDIAN LANGUAGES (79 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: ALIT BAGS ISO 9001 CERTIFICATE (85 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: HCL COMNET TO PROVIDE REMOTE ACCESS SOLUTIONS (245 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: HCL-HP UNVEILS SUPER SERVER RANGE (96 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: SESHAN TO INAUGURATE CONVENTION (97 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: CSI '96 MASCOT UNVEILED (122 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: EXELAN DIVERSIFY INTO TELE-MKTG DIGITAL PCS & NETWORKING PRODUCTS (94 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: DELHI IIT GETS HP EQUIPMENT (81 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: WIPRO BT & LANBIT OFFER INTEGRATED E-MAIL PACKAGE (217 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: D-LINK TO POPULARIZE PRODUCTS (101 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: NOKIA LAUNCHES 8110 BRAND CELL PHONE (108 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: LOGIX INTRODUCES HUBBELL PRODUCTS (151 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: ICO APPOINTS NEW CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER (123 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: ADVANTEC DISTRIBUTES ALLIED'S NETWORKING PRODUCTS (226 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: ESCOTEL COMMENCES CELLULAR SERVICES IN KERALA & HARYANA (138 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: VSNL CHIEF GETS FURTHER SERVICE EXTENSION (138 words) NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA'S UNIQUE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY (263 words) CONNECT INDIA '96: A success show, going by the number of participants, displays, and visitors (397 words) JB PANY -

Today,FM RDS paging, Radiant, and JB Pany are really a dream team in theIndian paging industry. Now, Radiant has its operation in 16 out of the17 cities, where FM RDS paging is available.JB Pany or Dulal Pany, as his friends call him lovingly, is modest,casual, calculative, and polished. He always believes in thetheory--learn to live happily. This man from Orissa was born on 10 July1953 in Cuttack. His father was a government servant and mother a simpleOriya housewife, very caring and affectionate. After completing hisschooling and intermediate in Orissa he joined LIT, Nagpur, from wherehe successfully completed his chemical engineering course in 1975. ThenPany returned back to Orissa to be an entrepreneur.His entrepreneurial strategy was simple--"get people better than you andhave faith in them". With this unique idea in mind, he started hisbusiness in Bhubaneswar. First in 1981, he started developing aromaticchemical, Bromostyrole. And in 1983, he formed a company, Mechem PvtLtd, in collaboration with RTZ, Germany. Primarily, the company wasdealing in fibre glass and FRP. In the very next year, Mechem bagged amajor order from Nuclear Fuel Complex. However, the company also startedassembling TV sets on behalf of Surya Udyog in 1984. Giving a boost toPany's entrepreneurialship, his company received national award forproduction excellence in 1987.The year 1984-85 saw a major change. From chemicals the company switchedover to electronics. On 5 September 1986, Radiant Electronics Ltd wasincorporated. It is a joint sector company with Orissa State ElectronicsDevelopment Corp., in technical collaboration with C-DOT. In 1994, thecompany diversified into FM RDS paging, through its division calledRadiant Connect.He says that team work has been the key to the success of his company.He is a man is grateful to all those who are behind his and Radiant'ssuccess. Sam Pitroda is his role model. And, in Pany's opinion, Pitrodais the man who shaped up Indian telecom revolution. He also gives creditto the people of Orissa for their continuous encouragement.On the family front too, Pany is leading a happy life. He met his betterhalf in Nagpur. He has all praises for her when he says, "she is more anOriya than a Maharastrian". She helps him in his business activities andhandles the TV assembling unit. She is also a very good wooden furnituredesigner. The Pany couple has two children, a son and a daughter. Bothare studying at Dehradun.Besides being an excellent manager, he is also a good leader. He was thechairman of CII, Orissa. Once, travelling was his hobby. Now, it is anecessity. He travels almost three cities in a week on business trips.Besides travelling, he is also very fond of socializing and reading,especially technical magazines. He loves to spend his spare time at thegolf course or in the billiards room. In fact, he has won the Jamshedpursteel city billiards tournament too.About his employees, he says that their union is one among the mostenlightened and disciplined ones in the country today. He feels proud ofthem that they are, to some extent, the jack of all trades and themaster of FM RDS paging.Coming to the future of FM RDS paging, he is very optimistic. And hebelieves that once the nation-wide network is established, 70 percent ofcountry will be covered by Radiant.With a vast experience behind him, Pany is the driving force at Radiant.However, he is reluctant in admitting this and attributes everything tohis colleagues, saying that they are his strength. A virtue that drivesthis Dulal Pany, relentlessly.GAURAV PATRACopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996VIPIN MALHOTRA - SAW FAR, SAW GOODfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996From TV to telecom, it is not a smooth transition normally. But then,where there is a will, there is a way. And Vipen Malhotra,vice-president, Arvind Telecom, is testament to this adage. A matureface which reflects that experience has been the best teacher for him.He wears a typical Punjabi look. Broad shoulders and a good height are acertain plus in his personality.Vipen was born on 11 August 1956 in Punjab. After completing hisschooling, he had his degree in electronics from Punjab EngineeringCollege, Chandigarh. To have a perfect combination--engineering coupledwith management--he went on to do his MBA from Punjab University. Vipenstarted off his professional career as marketing executive atContinental Devices India Ltd (CDIL) in 1980 in Ahemdabad. When CDILjoined hands with a German company for colour TV technology transfer andagency operations in India, Vipen turned out to be a shot in the arm forCDIL. He managed all the affairs almost single handedly and brought in atremendous business for the company. He was then promoted as marketingmanager and was asked to take on an additional responsibility area. Andthis was to market the CTV components which did not come with theoriginal kit.He did that job well too and acquired a considerable marketshare for thecompany. It was in 1986 that he came up with an idea of fusingtechnology with style. To launch the range of vertical black and whiteTVs. But CDIL was not ready for the investment required. And Vipen, asever, was a man who wanted to change with the times. He joined ArvindMills' electronic division as general manager, operations, in September1987.It was here that his life took a full turn. And it was here that hiscareer bloomed. Arvind Mills' telecommunication division had thendesigned a small EPABX system in-house. The problem that lay ahead wasits mass production and marketing countrywide. Vipen accepted thechallenge. He worked vigorously on the project and brought down the costof production to a considerable level. Not satisfied with just this, hewent on to successfully sell around 250 exchanges in just a short spanof nine months. Albeit, Arvind Mills ventured late into the big andcomplex arena of telecommunication, it soon became one of the big namesin rural automatic exchange manufacturing under his active leadership.The company is on the verge of almost tripling its production of small EPABXes.On the workfront, his vision is to make Arvind Telecom, India's largestsuppliers of small EPABX systems and to eat a major share of the radiotrunking pie in India. "We are already in a process of establishingourselves in 10 cities in the trunked radio business licensed to us andare working on making a name in the field of Public Mobile Radio TrunkedServices," says Vipen. For trunked radio, his company has a tie-up withEF Johnson of the US.When he is not thinking of telecom and business, he loves to watchcricket with his elder son who is nine-and-a-half years old. In hiscollege times, Vipen used to be the captain of his university badmintonteam and a member of the tennis team. These days, he is keen on golf. Healso likes to potter in his house garden whenever he manages to do that.Reading happens to be another favourite pastime with him. And that ismostly on business and modern management techniques. As far as the musicgoes, he prefers golden oldies--both Western and Indian (non classical).Wife Radhika was earlier into ethnic dress designing, but with the birthof his second son who is two-and-a-half years old now, she prefersdevoting full time to the family for Vipen.Things were not easy initially, but then he climbed the heights. Rightlysaid, its all in the attitude. Coupled with aptitude. And he is a fineexample.DHIRAJ AHUJACopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996PAGING - THE VOICE MATTERSfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996The operators' job is not a dull one, after all. There is excitement andfun, as well.Every telecom service segment--cellular, E-mail, or VSAT--calls for itsown skillset. What makes paging so special, however, is that in theactual service-delivering, no other communication service involves humanbeings. In paging, the interface with the customer is a voice. And muchof the subscriber perception emanates from the voice.The more live and vibrant the voice, the better it is. A disembodiedmechanical voice is a complete put off. Says Sandip Das, CEO, HutchisonMax Telecom (MaxPage), "The human interface holds a great deal ofimportance in the Indian context." Apparently, research into Asians andtheir interaction has revealed that Asians relate much better to humansthan machines. It is in this context that the role of a paging operatorbecomes critical. Besides, in the Indian context, the operator's rolecarries more importance as operator-assisted paging is more popular incomparison to automatic paging. A paging operator has to do more thanjust receive and send messages.Once they receive a message, the paging operators have to verify itwhile keying the message simultaneously into the computer in front ofthem and send it off. The job carries a lot more responsibility; thevoice has to convey a sense of reliability and also sustain thefreshness and vibrancy through the day. All the senses should be alertas she has to listen to the message and enter it on the terminalsimultaneously. Besides, they are required to have multi-lingual skillsto translate messages. For instance, when a message comes in Marathi,the operator should be in a position to translate and enter it inEnglish on the spot. Hence, knowledge of at least two languages,depending upon the location, is a prerequisite for this job.Surely, sitting in front of a terminal eight hours a day, constantlylistening to messages and sending them after a double check, cannot beall that exciting. Instead, it is bound to be taxing and tiring. So theonus of keeping the paging operators motivated lies with the employer,as the quality and performance of the people who form the "voice" willdetermine to a large extent the success of the service provider. So thekey is to keep the voice as good as possible. For as much time aspossible. That is what every paging operating company is trying to do.It is an HRD exercise of a different sort.It could vary from designating paging operators as paging officers toproviding them with cafeteria and rest room with TV and music system torelax. While on one hand, the designation bestows the operators with asense of dignity, the restroom helps these operators to take a break inthe midst of their gruelling day. For, on an average, an operatorhandles around 50-60 calls an hour. During peak hours, this number islikely to go up by 50 percent.On an average, an operator handles around 50-60 calls an hour. Duringpeak hours, this number is likely to go up by 50 per cent.Running through most of the service providers, the sops offered are moreor less similar. For instance, all of them have introduced uniforms toimpart a sense of uniformity and to eliminate any differences that mayhave surfaced due to economic or cultural factors. The distinctiveflavours come in the form of throwing open the field to employees todesign their uniforms, like in the case of MaxPage, which changes theuniform every six months. What it does promote a sense of belonging andpride in the organization. Says Sandra Mahadwar, head (human resources),MaxPage, "They are able to give their expression to theircreative urgings."Nearly all of them arrange outdoor activities which could be sports likeat RPG Paging or picnics at DSS Communications. In a city like Mumbai,Pagepoint Services, a Motorola joint venture, adds a dash of excitementby having a bash at a disco. Here, the operators have an opportunity tosocialize not only among themselves but also with the rest of thecompany staff which brings about a team feeling. In addition to these,there are in-house magazines and cultural events. Modelling for thecompany is also not ruled out. For all its advertisements, MaxPage hasroped in only its employees to model.Despite the similarity, most go a little further in different ways. Forinstance, at RPG Paging Services, Madras, a recreation club has been setup within the office premises equipped with exercycle, indoor sports,and aerobic facilities. Pagepoint follows a five-day week pattern forall its employees, including the paging operators. Says Micheal Latimer,president, Pagepoint Services, "They have two days to themselves, torelax and get ready for another hectic week and as they are an integralpart of Pagepoint there is no reason why they shouldn't enjoy similarbenefits."All of these become relevant in the light of the fact that mostoperators--on an average 60 percent--are women. Some, like MaxPage, havea 100 percent women workforce in some select cities like Bangalore andMumbai. The night shifts are usually managed by male operators with someexceptions like at MaxPage in Bangalore and Mumbai. Says SureshSrinivasan, general manager, Pagepoint Services, "It is purely forsafety reasons that we have men in the night shift as then transport andsecurity are not an issue." Despite this, MaxPage prefers to have womenon the rolls. It does add a bit to their expense list, given that theyhave a duty officer and security staff during night shifts.We put people ahead of pagingBesides, they pick and drop their "officers" outside their doorstep.MaxPage even encourages the applicants to bring their parents along whencalled for an interview. While the candidate is undergoing theinterview, parents are given a tour of the office and shown thefacilities that will be provided to a paging officer.Now moves like these come handy, specially in small cities like Ludhianawhich tend to be conservative and where parents are not as open tosending their "girls" to work. It is precisely for these reasons thatmost service providers have men in their night shift. Though at RPG,women working in the last shift between 12.15 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. areentitled to a car drop back home, women working in the last shift isgenerally avoided. Says Preetha R Ramakrishnan, assistant manager(personnel and administration), RPG Paging, "Due to personalconstraints, women are not asked to work at night."We believe we should trust and respect our employeesApart from these, operators are given awards and incentives in order tomotivate them to perform better. Most of them have fairly elaboratemonitoring system. Based on the observation, the operator is given afeedback and the freedom to evolve a self correcting process. "This,says Latimer, "helps operators perceive their role better." The ultimateaim is getting the operators to understand that they play a key role insatisfying the customer. And, hence, the efforts of the company aredirected towards this goal. Pagepoint has an award for the "best pagingoperator" for the week, month, and year. Apart from that incentives aregiven, based on various parameters both qualitative and quantitative.These also help in taking the drudgery and monotony of the job. Unlikeother jobs, an operator's job (in spite of being called paging officers)does not provide too many avenues for growth within the organization.Not that they cannot opt for anything else. Sure they can go from beingan operator to a shift supervisor or they could move into other areaslike customer service or finance, depending on their preferences andcapabilities.Well, given the competitive nature of business today, mostcompanies--service and non--service--have come to realize that the costof training a fresher is disproportionate to the money spent on theseactivities, which have long-term benefit. However, in the pagingindustry, it takes more preeminence because of the "people intensive"operations and more dependance on the human factor than the technology.Given these, the attrition rate among paging operators is very low.They all claim that none of them have lost any of their operators tocompetitors. Of course, poaching is against IPSA rules. The rule is nota law in itself but more of a gentlemen's agreement. Most of them claimto have lost paging operators not due to the nature of the job but moredue to personal reasons like marriage. In fact, the nature of the job orworking in shifts have not been a deterrent for many is the generalrefrain.The working environment created and policies have had their effect onmanpower turnover and also in recruitment. According to Latimer,"Initially, recruitment was through the medium of advertisements buttoday it has shifted to word-of-mouth and referrals. All the propagandais done by the paging operators themselves." And this Latimer attributesto the excellent atmosphere created within the company.No doubt, the companies have had to spend in order to create the"comfort zone". But it is a cost that has been factored in at the timeof budgeting for infrastructure. However, none of them is willing toreveal just what percentage it took up of the entire investment. Onereason for this advance planning could be that all the service providershave joint ventures going with MNC partners. These partners carry withthem their experiences in other countries.A lot has been written and said about paging as an industry but littlehas been discussed about the human face of the operations, theoccupational hazards, and how companies are taking care of theiremployees. In Das' words, "As far as India goes, our vision provedright. A strong service orientation is the right approach as hardware isincidental to business." And human resources is inextricably linked tothis vision which is reflected across the paging industry.SUBHA ACopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996"WE LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN TO CHANGE"from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996What does Ericsson look for in its prospective employees. And why? Howdoes it develop a positive feeling among employees? Ranjit Bhatia,general manager and chief (human resources & administration), EricssonTelecommunications, explains in an interview with Shyamanuja Das.What are the qualities that you look for in a person while recruiting?We look for people who are more flexible to change. Particularly, whenwe recruit experienced people, we always look for people who are notvery rigid. But for people who will embrace change. Because that isEricsson culture. That is how this industry is. You have to be open tochange. You have to be in constant lookout for change. For new options.New styles. New environments.What is your policy on recruiting fresh graduates?We do not go to campuses. Recruiting from campuses is good. But it istime consuming. The average time is eight months. Who has got that kindof time in this industry? Last year, when we recruited in bulk, weadvertised for fresh candidates.How important is the label of a college/university?Depends on the nature of job. I can go for an IIT graduate, if I amrecruiting someone for a planning kind of job. For a hands-on job, weprefer graduates from other engineering colleges.What about marketing and other such functions?Almost for all marketing positions, we recruit engineers. And that too,only electronics and telecommunication engineers. The concept ofmarketing is slightly different in this industry. We are not sellingconsumer products. We are selling solutions to operators. That requiresnot only an understanding of technology, but also knowledge of what canbe offered to the customer as a solution. It is more of businessdevelopment than marketing. We cannot afford to take a non-engineer.Only for publicity etc., we take MBAs.Where do you get middle level people from?Engineers from PSUs, C-DOT, etc. have joined us. For marketing, wedevelop our own people. There is no other way out. They are givenresponsibility at a quite young age. Our average age in marketing is28-30 years.What are the problems you face, if at all, while recruiting?Getting good field support staff is a problem. Very few people have thecustomer orientation that this kind of job demands.How do you manage to get good people in an extremely competitiverecruitment market?Let me clarify on one point. We pay well. (But) we are not the bestpaymasters. We do not try to be. Our objective is to be a very goodemployer. We look at providing all comforts to an employee. We encouragedecision making. Above all, he is respected as an individual.We conduct training programmes for the employee's overall growth. We arenow carrying out a continuous training programme as a project, withactive participation from our Sweden office. It is called CompetenceManagement and it aims to help an employee develop business competence,technical competence, and human values. We also send them abroad fortechnical trainings.With a certain degree of pride, I can say that there has been negligibleemployee turnover in Ericsson in recent months.In general, what are the positive and negative factors in therecruitment scenario in India?One thing good about India is the availability of people, not necessarilyskilled, but who can be trained. The basic education is good in India.In software, we have got skilled people.On the flip side, people here are very low on accountability andcustomer orientation. Accountability can only be built into the systemif we put thrust on it in our educational system, itself. Now, one wayof doing that is better co-operation between the campus and corporate.In a market-driven world, that is a necessity. Then, we won't keep ontraining our youngsters on something in the campus and something else inthe job. There will be no duplication of efforts.Ericsson Telecommunications LtdTYPE JV of Ericsson, Sweden, and Jiwarajika GroupAREA OF OPERATION: Switching; transmission; trunked mobile radios;turnkey projectsTURNOVER (1995-96): Rs. 70 croreMANPOWER (as on 31-08-96): 222RECURITMENTS IN LAST ONE YEAR (01-09-95 TO 31-08-96): 85BREAK-UPS: Technical: 44 Management: 3 Others:38 Fresh(engineers): 4,Experienced: 41PROJECTIONS: Not available since the restructuring of the groupcompanies is on progressShYAMAJUJA DASCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996HOW HCL GROUP RECRUIT ITS PEOPLEfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996"We do not recruit for individual companies because we want to ensuremovability within the group."How does HCL Corp., known for its high people-orientation, recruit itspeople? Sujit Baksi, the company's director & president, HRD, tellsShyamanuja Das.What is the basic recruitment principle of HCL Corp.?We believe in recruiting freshers and developing them. We recruitglobally. In Singapore, Thailand, UK, US, and of course India. We takeengineers and MBAs from premier engineering and management institutesand colleges.How common or different are your recruitment procedures for differentgroup companies?We do not recruit for HCL-HP or HCL Comnet. We recruit for HCL Corp.Basic skill requirements for a marketing person or a technical supportperson is similar in all the companies, barring a few R&D jobs. So afresher is taken for HCL Corp. We do that because we want to ensure ahigh degree of movability within the group. Our recruitment, hence, isfunction-oriented, not company oriented.Why at all is there a need for that?IT is a very flexible industry. Only thing that is constant here ischange. Tomorrow, we may enter some new business, exit from somethingelse. The person must be ready to handle different jobs, differentsituations.How do you find such people?We look for some basic attitudes. A logical and analytical bent of mindis a necessity. And we look for persons with high tolerance forambiguity. The person must be adaptive. He should be able to adapt tochanges. To new jobs. To new people. To new countries. Also, we look forpeople who have motivation to achieve. This is in addition to thespecific skills required for the job and academics. We give a lot ofimportance to academics. We believe academic records say a lot about thestudent.What is a typical recruitment process in HCL Corp.?As I told you earlier, we take only freshers. We go to institutes likeIIMs, FMS, and Bajaj among management institutes. For engineeringgraduates, we go to IITs, BITS, and selected RECs.The entire process takes about one year. In fact, for our July '97recruitment, we have already started in June last. We organize meetswith students where our top management goes and talks about the companyand the kind of opportunities that lie. Shiv Nadar himself has gone andspoken. This year, we are planning to start this exercise in October.Ex-students of these schools also go to campuses.Once a student is selected, he is treated as an employee of the company.From getting a B'day card to receiving information regarding theactivities of the company, he is made to feel as a member of the HCLfamily. We also organize periodical visits of these students to company.What are the problems you face?Of course, sometimes there are certain mind blocks. HCL is perceived tobe a hardware company, though that is far from truth. We are second onlyto TCS in software. And those who want a cushy kind of job, we cannotprovide. Right from day one, you have to be hands-on. Another fear thatis there is HCL is a very task-oriented company, which is a fact. So onewanting a secure, slow job is not a typical HCL fit-in.In spite of best of your efforts, there must be some people who willfail to deliver...They will have to go. No matter how thorough is the selection procedure,there will always be some people who will be like that. That number isvery small in HCL. (But) they have no place. We cannot carry passengers.It is perceived that some group companies like NIIT and HCL Comnet aremore employee-friendly than others like HCL Frontline and even HCL-HP...I don't agree. There is a common policy. If someone has tried somethingsuccessfully in one of the companies, we implement that in othercompanies. (So) there is no scope for any discrepancy. For finding outwhat is best in each company we regularly conduct meetings called BIG(Best In Group), where the chiefs of companies meet and discuss whatthey have tried.There is a belief that there is a mad rush towards telecom from allother fields. And the biggest loser is IT. What is your observation.What does this mean for HCL?I agree that IT is losing a lot of skilled manpower to telecom. But fora group like HCL, where there is enough scope to work in the latter, Ido not think that is a major problem. Our employee turnover has beenvery low.(But) at the same time, I must admit that a few of them haveleft and joined some MNCs.HCL CORPORATION LTDTYPE: IndianCOMPANIES: HCL-HP, HCL Consulting, NIIT, HCL Comnet, Network, HCLFrontline, HCL Ltd, HCL OA, HCL GA, HCL General Instruments, HCL PerotSystemsTURNOVER: $500 millionMANPOWER (As on 30.06.96): 8,300RECRUITS IN LAST ONE YEAR: 700Break-ups Technical (R&D, support and software): 580 (approx) Marketing:120 (approx)Fresh (Engineers and MBAs): Almost allPROJECTIONS (This year): More than 700SHYAMAJUJA DASCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996COMMUNICATION CAREER - A COMPELLING ISSUEfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996WE Indians believe that we have one of the best technical manpower inthe world. Quite rightly too. Various surveys and studies havereaffirmed this fact from time to time, the latest being the WorldEconomic Forum (WEF) Report On Global Competitiveness. India ranks amongthe top three nations in the world in terms of availability and qualityof engineers.Yet, finding right people still remains the toughest job for thecorporates--multinationals and Indian companies alike. And vice versa.Unemployment is not a problem anymore, at least, for professionaldegree/diploma holders. Misemployment is. Unless that is checked, it hasthe potential to have a negative effect on the workforce in particularand the growth of Indian business in general.Let us define misemployment. In short, it is the wrong employer-employeeassociation. With higher level of professional knowledge and betterskillset, the expected level of satisfaction from one's job has gone uptremendously. So has the employer's expectation from the employee. Forthe best results, a perfect sync between attitudes of the employee andthe employer is a must. If there is a mismatch, there is bound to beproblem. That qualifies for a misemployment.If the employers and employee do not choose each other carefully beforetheir association, it backfires. While employers have large HRDdepartments doing the job, very few employees do that. As a result,there is dissatisfaction that results in frequent job changes, stress,and a fall in productivity level. The sole culprit is information. Orrather, the lack of it.The turnover and the product profile of a company are not the bestinformation to act on for making a career move into a company. One needto know about the culture of a company, what are the qualities that thecompany looks for, and what kind of a person will fit well into thatorganization, before taking any decision on joining it.These are the kind of information that we will provide you in this newsection COMCAREERS. The HRD chiefs of companies will directly tell youwhat their companies look for and who is the right kind of person, andwhat is expected of him. From time to time, we will throw light on areasin which there are information gaps. This time, we have interviews withHRD chiefs of two different types of companies. One is a fully Indiantransnational, HCL Corp.; other is a typical joint venture between anEuropean and an Indian company, Ericsson Telecommunications Ltd. Thesize, the working culture, the strengths, all are different. Plus, thereis a feature on paging operators that tries to remove manymisconceptions.Feel free to write to us if you want to read about any particular issueregarding recruitment, training, and other related areas.Copyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996SAYING IT THROUGH NUMBERSfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996On the silver screen, the Hollywood hero uses his code, ILU, ILU. On theLCD screen of your spouse's pager, you can use your own code. And thatcould be a number.That is exactly what the Chinese are doing. Many Chinese use a numericpager because it is cheap and numeric paging is easy to automate. So forsaying I Love You, it could be 111. For I love you too, it could be 222,and so on. But how to remember so many codes? They have got a littlecute book of codes, known popularly as Bible Of Paging, where thesecodes are listed. There are so many of them. The book is distributed bythe paging operators.In India, some companies are already talking of that. So the next timeyou want to say something, you perhaps will have the option of saying itthrough numbers. But we have to evolve our own code. The Chinese codefor You are the nicest person I know could well be 420.Copyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996TEST AND INVEST: Unearthing of the telecom scam has led to scrips fallingat much more faster rate than other industriesfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996The telecom scam has delivered a body blow to the liberalizationprocess. The telecom scrips that were considered to be favourites haveno demand in the exchanges. The result is a continuous fall in theprices. Telecom scrips have been falling at much more faster rate thanother industries. The small investor has lost confidence, which willtake time to build up.After the presentation of union budget by the finance minister, themarket has been gradually sliding downwards. The downslide of the equityshares is far more than what is reflected in the sensex. Scrips of newcompanies which have entered the capital market recently either do notfind there quotations or most of them get traded in the range of Rs 1 or2 in a day. Even their volumes are not exceeding 100-200 shares. Thebudget has proved out to be disastrous for the stock market.Introduction of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has deeply shaken theconfidence of investors. Stock market analysts are predicting that itmay take, almost, an year for the sentiments to improve.The debt market has improved considerably and the institutions likeICICI, IDBI, IFCI, and SCICI have already mobilized around Rs 6,000crore and thus the money has been squeezed from the investor by the debtinstruments. There is no money left for the equityinstruments. Meanwhile, the deposit rate war between the non-bankingfinance companies have intensified. Companies have started offering upto 18 percent interest. While PAL Credit & Capital has announced itsinterest rates of 17.5 percent for one year and 19 percent for four tofive years, Reliance Capital's rates are 15 percent and 18 percent,respectively, for one and three years.The BSE Sensex fell by 2 percent as it closed at 3,349.30 points on 20September. Out of the total 58 shares listed, 48 went down, sensex 7moved up, and three closed with no change. Datacom segment was the worstaffected as shares went down by 55 percent. Datapro went down by 90percent and ICNET by 55 percent. Telephone cables is the worstperforming stock in telecom industry and is ranked fourth in list of top5 losers in all companies listed in the exchanges. The share is quotingat Rs 9 as against Rs 69 six months back.The controversy over the VSNL's Euro issue has taken a new turn as theMinistry of Telecommunication is suspecting a foul play in theappointment of lead managers to the issue. The lead managers to theissue are currently Kleinwort Benson, Jardine Flemming, and SalomonBrothers and the company hopes to raise $700 through the issue. Theministry suspects that more underwriting commission has been agreed incase of VSNL. The controversy has certainly reversed the sentiments ofthe investors.Meanwhile, the board of directors of VSNL has proposed a 45 percentdividend for 1995-96. The company has emerged amongst the top 10tax-paying corporates in the country. It paid Rs 369.31 crore ascorporate tax.A select few heavy-weighted scrips rallied smartly in a mixed pattern oftrading on the BSE. In general, the trend was downwards. Investors areconcentrating more on the debt market, resulting in brokers alsoshifting their focus to the same.BSE's decision to revamp the sensex has been hailed by the marketmen.The inclusion of public sector stocks and giving weightage to newsectors of the economy is the step in the right direction. The sensexnow will give the true picture of economy. The old sensex represented 19percent of the market capitalization. A total of 15 new scrips havereplaced the old ones.The Primary market in August was again deluge with a number of smalloffers. The total mobilization through public offers during the monthfell to Rs 363 crore in August 1996 as against Rs 1,675 crore in Julyand Rs 675 crore in May. However, the number of offers continued to behigh with as many as 87 companies tapping the market in August, 99 inJuly, and 127 in June. Premium offers continued to remain out of sightin August too. Only 11 out of the 87 offered were at the premium, withthe only Apcotex (Rs 105) and Super Auto (Rs 70) in high premium.One of the major factors which supported the fall of the market isSEBI's directive to extend the mark-to-market margin system to thenon-computerized stock exchanges. Because of this, the volumes declinedlast month by 46 percent over the previous month.As several companies are announcing book closures, the supply of thestocks in the market will be reduced. Some stocks because of themanipulation might increase for the shorter time frame. One shouldcarefully examine these stocks and avoid investments in these.Best Performing IndustriesIndustry Travel & Transport2 Week % Change 8.33Yearly % Change -66.57Industry Bearings2 Week % Change 2.07Yearly % Change 13.55Industry Telecom Equipment2 Week % Change 1.40Yearly % Change -57.61Industry Electronics-Industry2 Week % Change -0.02Yearly % Change -6.99Industry Fasteners2 Week % Change -1.36Yearly % Change -28.74Worst Performing IndustriesIndustry Transmission Towers2 Week % Change -20.99Yearly % Change -35.50Industry Office Equipment2 Week % Change -19.26Yearly % Change -35.78Industry Gems, Jewellery2 Week % Change -17.83Yearly % Change -32.96Industry Construction2 Week % Change -16.25Yearly % Change -45.53Industry Consumer Durables2 Week % Change -14.04Yearly % Change -66.35Recast Sensex-WeightageCement             3.07%Engineering        6.31%Metal             13.27%Power              2.72%Services          25.33%Chemicals         19.88%Consumer Products 15.46%Automobiles       13.96%Primary MarketMonth No. Of Issues     Amount Mobilized (Rs Crore)April      105                   378May         73                   675July       186                 1,675August      87                   363BSE & NSE INDEX FOR 100 SHARES    BSE        NSE16/8                            3,447.96   1,577.8323/8                            3,431.90   1,563.2930/8                            3,514.61   3,508.077/9                             3,508.07   1,581.5613/9                            3,514.61   1,512.4220/9                            3,349.30   1,494.45TOP FIVE GAINERSAnco Communication         56Dynavox Electronics        55VXL Instruments            22Network                    18Jayanti Business            8TOP FIVE LOSERSDatapro                   -90Northern Digital          -67ICNET                     -55Sparc System              -50HFCL                      -43Copyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996WEB WATCH: COMPUSERVE POSTS LOSSES, CUTS JOBSfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996CompuServe Corp. has reported a loss of $17.7 million for its firstquarter.

He almost decides what the AT&Ts, Sprints, USWests, and Bell Atlantics should do in the next few years.Sometimes, he also auctions air waves. For a change, he is now preachingwhat other nations should do. Given below are his seven commandments.I. Privatization does not conflict with or substitute for the rules ofcompetition.II. Any nation that champions a national telecom firm and limits foreigninvestment is wasting its money and turning down a big opportunity.III. When governments intervene in markets in the name of guaranteeinguniversal service, they generally do not make anything universal andthey do not enhance telecom service.IV. Every country does not need two redundant wireline networks.V. If you are not awarding spectrum licences by auction, you are makinga big mistake.VI. After you auction the licences, let the market work. Systems rivalrywill speed technological innovation and countries should not bardesegregation or combination of spectrum licences.VII. The right goal for international communications is the same as thegoal for domestic communications--no more regulation of communicationsservices than of soap or software or shoes.Copyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996GLOBE WATCH: MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: IDT (Interactive Discount Telecom)from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996IDT (Interactive Discount Telecom) Corp. has bought Genie Online Servicefrom Yovelle Renaissance Corp.

But the cellularoperators are fast realizing that small is indeed beautiful. Perhapsmuch more beautiful than Schumacher imagined.When cellular licences were being awarded, there was so much glamour andclamour for the Mumbai licence. Most aggressive forecasts, bids, andwhat not! Some even thought the rest was a waste. Today, Delhi has thelead. Whether it is maximum number of cars or cell-phones, it is the samesuccess story of small entrepreneurs behind them.Recently, we were on a search for a small office building ... there werebrokers and brokers but with a common factor ... all had a cell-phone,in fact some had two, one from each of the two operators ... just incase! When we looked for furniture ... again the same common factor. Aconspicuous cell-phone. The common factor stretches beyond ... ourlawyer carries one, our CA carries one, our freight agent carries one.No wonder it is the small wonder!But for now, we leave aside the small wonder called cellphone ... andtalk about the success story of the small business. Small business hascome to mean big business to cellular operators. Not only world-wide,but in India too!Delhi is obviously the trend setter in India. Today, travelling in aBombay suburban train if one sees a combination of "chappals" and"cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff.The InnovatorsMost operators tend to launch with testimonial ads. Focus: Corporate BigWigs! No doubt almost all CEOs become the first subscribers though Iknow several dogged exceptions. But where do the real numbers, usage,and revenue come from? It is from the humble pockets of small businesseswith employees less than 10 sometimes; we include the self-employed too.In the first year of service, over 95 percent of the revenue may comefrom this segment. For cellular, small is big. Big market. It may takesometime for cellphones to travel down the corporate echelons.In the "consumer" segment, it takes two to three years to reach"significant" level of penetration and airtime usage. We know, mostpeople prefer to charge to official account. Consumer segment willmostly comprise of housewives, college going youngsters, and old people.Majority go for it as "status symbol" or "snob value" and sometimes for"security" reasons, mostly with very low airtime usage.The Global ScenarioToday, small businesses and corporate segments account for about 70percent of world cellular market and the consumer segment less than 30percent. In some "not so highly dense" markets with about 10-12 percent(still quite big for us) penetration, small businesses have been seen toreach a cellular penetration of about 50 percent. While in "highlydense" market like Sweden with 30 percent cellular penetration, smallbusinesses (less than 15 employees) have 85 percent penetration. Need wesay more?The Cellular Way To BusinessCellular changes the way to business for a small businessman as helearns to manage his time better--the cellular way. With a cellphone hevirtually carries his office around. Office and telephone do not tie himdown anymore. He could devote more time with his clients and intravelling. For operator, it requires a customized concept selling toaddress and target each of sub-segments based on the pattern of dailyactivities which may differ for exporters, doctors, CAs, lawyers, estateagents, freight agents, courier services, contractors, etc. It mayinclude specialized promotion for specific professions highlighting howthe service can help in improving efficiency and business. In Delhi, Iam told that almost 100 custom-agents subscribed to service en masse,even the same model of handset.Today, traveling in a Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of"chappals" and "cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff. It is not justthe basic unit of economic fabric but also the "big" star of cellularworld. Schumacher wrote, "There is wisdom in the smallness if only onaccount of the smallness and patchiness of human knowledge... It is moreimportant that everybody should produce something than that a few peopleshould each produce a great deal... The task is to bring into existencemillions of new work places in the rural areas and small towns.""Cellular will play a leading role in this task in India," MrSchumacher, "we assure you."END-USER TRENDSBUSINESS CONSUMER        Small Business  Corporate Staff   Blue Collar  Mass Mkt   High Income        Corporate Exec1st Year     100                 -              -         -          -3rd Year      30                40              -        20         106th Year      15                30              -        40         10Niraj K GuptaCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996NEPOSTEL CONSULTANCY BV - CASHING IN ON TRAININGfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996With lot of private telecom operators starting their operations, thecompany is eyeing a huge business opportunity. Reason enough for itbeing in serious business.Nepostel is the member of the KPN Group (Royal PTT Nederland NV). And,it was founded in 1981 to offer Telecom and Postal Training andConsultant Services to telecom and postal operators and serviceproviders using the expertise of PTT Telecom and PTT Post.PTT Telecom, the Netherlands, is one of the most productive telecomcompanies in the competitive market of Europe. Since its foundation,Nepostel has worked in more than 50 countries in former Eastern Europe,Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The turnover of the company expressedin Indian currency was Rs 56 crore in 1995, which is 10 percent morethan that in 1994.Nepostel's relation with Indian customers dates back to 1991 when twotelecom managers attended a course--Management of Operations andMaintenance of Modern Telecom Networks in the Netherlands. Since then,Nepostel has formed a joint venture company called Orange TelecomSoftware with TCIL for the development of telecom software locally,which caters to the European market. Billing software and other customercare software for the private telecom network operators seem to be themajor areas of operation for Orange Telecom Software.Nepostel has also been instrumental in providing back-up consultancy fora Videotex project in Delhi. It has provided training and consultantservices to Sterling Cellular and HFCL. Around 13 network engineers ofHFCL were trained by Nepostel in the Netherlands last year. The companyis the foreign collaborator in Beltron Telecommunications Ltd, a pagingoperator with licences in six cities.Nepostel's services have been delivered up till now through itsheadquarters in the Hague. Currently, Nepostel is in the process ofsetting up shop in India together with its partner, Svana Systems (P)Ltd, in New Delhi. This joint venture company called Nepostel India PvtLtd will be operational soon. It has been registered but is in a waitfor formal government approval. According to the company sources,Nepostel India Pvt Ltd is expected to be launched by 15 October 1996.Svana Systems, a small time telecom software developer itself, will nowbe involved in project execution and marketing of all the ventures ofNepostel in the country. "Project execution, not product development, isand will remain our forte," says Shugan C Jain of Svana Systems. "Thereis a lot of technical expertise available in the country, but managingthem together and bring business out of it is not an easy job. Itrequires expert consultancy and thus justifies our existence," adds JanJoosten, senior consultant (training and organization), Nepostel.Nepostel is an expert organization in feasibility studies, networkdesigns, consultancy for bid evaluation in a telecom tender, buyingdecisions for network equipment, etc.Till the time this venture comes into picture, Nepostel has alreadystarted to deliver its services through Svana Systems. "In the nearfuture, we are planning to bring the best of training facilities inIndia itself, rather than taking the Indian engineers to theNetherlands," says Jain.The first tangible result of this co-operation is a series of five opencourses for executives and managers of various telecom operators.Nepostel focuses on all aspects of running a telecom networkeffectively, whether fixed, GSM, paging, VSAT, MRTS, or other. Dutchexperts with hands-on experience in all aspects of telecom will carryout or back-up the services offered by the newly hired staff of thejoint venture. The main aim is to deliver the highest quality oftraining and consultancy in telecom and posts based on thoroughknowledge of the telecom and postal businesses and hands-on experienceof its consultants and trainers.FactsheetYear Of Start-up: 1981CEO: Ir Bob BennekerArea Of Operation: Consultancy and Trainingin Telecom and PostAlliances: Svana Systems (P) LtdNo. Of Employees: 60Address In India: Svana Systems (P) Ltd,D28, Panchsheel Enclave, New Delhi - 110 017Tel.: 011-6220560/6868906Fax: 011-6433931/6511231DHIRAJ AHUJACopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996USHA COMMUNICATION - THE JUMBO IN MAKINGfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996With the ever expanding officecom segment, Usha Communication is acompany to watch.If you think foresight is the key to success of any business, it is trueof Usha Communication. "As a corporate, we think eight years inadvance," says Jai Dhar Gupta, managing director, Usha Electronics. ThisDelhi-based company was established way back in 1968, with a productfocus of manufacturing telephones, intercoms, and small analogueswitches.Right now, the company is into the manufacturing of state-of-the-artISBX systems. For this, it has entered into an alliance with TadiranTelecommunications, Israel, to manufacture and market its Coral brand ofISBX, a technically advanced EPABX system. This Coral Automatic CallDistribution (ACD) helps users by evenly distributing incoming calls,and keeping track of calling patterns and performances. Manufacturingthese locally will give the company a tremendous cost advantage. Theother products are Coral Computer Telephony Interface (CTI), Coral AIR(Wireless EPABX), and Coral ISDN PABX. The Coral ISDN PABX provides widebandwidth for voice, data networking, and videoconferencing. These ISDNexchanges are fourth generation PBXes that will support voice, data,video, wireless facilities, cellular facilities, voice mail as well asISDN and VSAT connectivity. The Coral AIR handset is like a wirelessextension.The company has also entered an alliance with Cosmopolitan Electronicsof Taiwan for smaller PBXes with a capacity to handle 240 lines at atime. The most modern thing about this is that this has a single pairwire and also a digital one."Now hotel and paging are the two areas where there is lot ofopportunity," comments Gupta. And, that is why the company is targetingthese industries. Till date, Punwire is its major client. UshaElectronics has installed EPABXes both for its POCSAG and FM RDS pagingservices. And, very recently, the company has bagged its first orderfrom the hotel industry, i.e. Hotel Bright Star, which is coming up inDelhi. It has also installed ISBX systems at Western Pagers and baggedorders from Jindal and Oswal Group.Among Public Sector Units, Indian Railway is their major client.Everyday, 16-17 voice conferences take place between different officesof the railways and Usha has to provide adequate facilities for this onleased line voice conference. Apart from these areas, the company isalso trying to enter areas like banking and telecom. Other prospectivecustomers are from the banking and financial sectors, PSUs, and courierindustry. "We are looking forward for at least 20,000 connections,"says Gupta. The company has already set up five EPABXes so far, andexpects to set up 18 more in near future."Customer satisfaction is our main look out," comes out Gupta. To ensurethis commitment, the company has a chain of 60 dealers, 10 branchoffices, agents located in almost all big and small cities across thecountry. It also plans to open sales offices in the African and SouthAsian regions. And, a team from Tadiran are in Delhi and Mumbai to sellits products.Usha Electronics' manufacturing unit at Okhla Industrial Area in NewDelhi has already into production. Very recently, the company has set upits second unit at Bari Brahma near Jammu, complying with ISO 9001standards, to manufacture and assemble digital ISDN customer premisesequipment for the Indian market. This will be the first of its kind inthe country to manufacture Integrated Services Business Exchanges(ISBXes).Gupta agrees with Voice & Data's prediction and says that communicationsoftware is where future lies and his company will also move intosoftware development. According to him, his company will move intocomputer telephony as they will have a market in 50 countries and alsosees the growth of networking market in India. With an expected turnoverof Rs 20 crore for the current fiscal, against Rs 9 crore in 1995-96,Usha Communication is poised to find a new helm in the Indiancommunications industry.FACTSHEETYear Of Start-up: 1968CEO: Jai Dhar GuptaTurnover: Rs 9 croreAlliance: Tadiran Telecommunications; Cosmopolitan ElectronicsArea Of Operation: Manufacture of officecom productsAddress: Thapar Chamber IInd, 2nd Floor, Opp. Kalindi Colony,New Delhi - 110 014Tel.: 011-6839982/6839983/6832003/6921849Fax: 011-6832003GAURAV PATRACopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996VSNL - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS GATEWAYfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Long-term focus and better project executions place VSNL in the numerouno spot.Instability of world grandeur is not concurrent with Videsh SancharNigam Ltd (VSNL), the exclusive provider of public international telecomservices in India. Its is a steady journey of success and innovationthroughout.And, for the government too, it is a preferred entity over MTNL. This isobvious from the government's keen interest in keeping its stake high,even after the expected GDR issue--66 percent. In the case of MTNL, thegovernment's stake is already down to 65 percent.Now a bit history. The origin of India's external telecommunication isactually dated back to as early as 1870 with the formation of BritishIndia Submarine Telegraph Company. In 1872, Eastern Telegraph Company(ETC) was formed. Fifty-one years down the lane, in 1923, anothercompany--Indian Radio Telegraph Company (IRT)--was formed.Circa 1932. And, ETC and IRT merged into one--Indian Radio & CableCommunications Company (IRCC). With Independence, IRCC was nationalizedand rechristened to Overseas Communications Service (OCS) in 1947.March 1986 saw the conversion of OCS into an autonomous businessunit--VSNL--to improve operating performance.In 1992, the government reduced equity holding to 82 percent andincreased private ownership to 18 percent. The expected GDR issue willincrease the private ownership to above 34 percent, still retaining thegovernment control. However, at the time of this article going to print,the government has announced a disinvestment of another 7 percent ofVSNL's equity.ServicesAs a service company, VSNL's area of operation is spread into basicservices and specialized services. And, it generates 95 percent of itsrevenues from the international long distance services. The secondlargest revenue earner is leased channels which contribute only 1.6percent to the total revenue.Under the umbrella name basic services, it has telephone services to 237ISD destinations; telex services to 238 IXSD destinations; and telegraphto 33 destinations.Going by the specialized services, VSNL is into TV (programmetransmission), videoconferencing (home country direct), andmulti-address press broadcast (time and frequency transmission). Also,it offers leased channels services such as bureaufax, T-Fax, Intelsatbusiness service, and Inmarsat mobile services. Its specialized servicesalso include Gateway Packet Data Search Transmission, Electronic DataInterchange (EDI), On-line Data "Easynet", and E-mail (Gems 400) throughits Internet backbone.Business At A Glance* International Telephone Traffic  (paid minutes in millions - Outgoing                        322.66                              Incoming                        619.72                              Total                           942.38*International Telex Traffic (paid minutes in millions)        24.19*International Telegraphic Traffic (paid minutes in millions)  24.47*Gateway Packet Switching -- Revenue Rs                        10.11 crore                             Traffic                          439.33 million                                                                     segments*International TV Traffic (paid minutes in thousands)          99.81*International Bureaufax Traffic (total no. of pages, both ways)                          104,233International Telephone ServiceTelephone 77   No. Of Direct Links 77   No. Of Circuits 12,873Top 10 PartnersCountry                 No. Of CircuitsUSA                       3,850UAE                       1,494UK                        1,381Singapore                   618Saudi Arabia                519Germany                     456Canada                      450Australia                   307Japan                       296Hong Kong                   274VSNL's international gateways are two-fold. One, satellite earthstations and two, sub-marine telephone links. The former has stations inArvi, Bangalore, Calcutta, Dehradun, Madras, Mumbai, and New Delhi.In sub-marine telephone cable links, it has both wide-band sub-marinecable analogue and digital systems. Under the wide-band sub-marine cableanalogue system, it has two gateways--Madras for IOCOM Cable to Penangin Malaysia and Mumbai for Gulf Cable to Fujairah in UAE, with a lengthof 2,509 km and 1,964 km, respectively. The digital system--SEA ME WE2--has a length of 17,658 km, having covering points in countries suchas Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,and Sri Lanka. Mumbai is the gateway for this service. This facility wascommissioned in June 1994. The total cost involved in this was Rs 2,204crore. As on 30 April 196, VSNL had 2,814 circuits in this service.Coming to the mobile communication services, VSNL deals in voice, data,and fax for the marine, air line, and land mobile communities. ItsInmarsat mobile satellite communication services is the focal point ofall these operations.International AssociationVSNL's association with international bodies like Intelsat and Inmarsathas enhanced its image in India and abroad, alike. It is a foundermember of Inmarsat, an organization dealing with mobile communications,with other 77 countries, having a share of 1.48 percent in theconsortium. Similarly, in Intelsat, a set-up of 138 countries forsatellite services, too, VSNL could forge in 2.12 percent share forIndia. And, in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia, VSNL is, respectively,the tenth and eighth largest operator in the world. It also hasparticipation in the international joint venture ICO GlobalCommunications to provide global satellite private communicationservices. Through VSNL, India has put in an investment of 7.38 percentof the total project cost.The company's association with Commonwealth Telecom Organization (CTO),Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT), and International TelecommunicationsUnion (ITU) gives it an unequivocal edge. It actively participates inthe events conducted by these bodies.It has MoUs with BT-MCI for Concert Packet Switched Services, Tele MediaInternational for the introduction of Universal Connect, SprintInternational, and Cable & Wireless to enhance globally managed networkand data services. Further, VSNL's success in bidding for the locationfor ICO Global Satellite System's satellite access nodes gives a boostto its international image.By introducing Internet services on a commercial basis, VSNL hasregistered a customer base of over 8,000 subscribers. It is planning tooffer companies, facilities to host home pages on the VSNL Web servers.It is expected to further facilitate Internet usage in the country. Thisservice may also see tariff reduction.The company is looking forward to participate in two sub-marine fibrecable projects: FLAG and SEA-ME-WE-3. It also plans for laying down ahigh-capacity under sea cable, linking the neighbouring countries andproviding them connectivity with other international sub-marine systems.In the Iridium global personal satellite communications project too,VSNL is also to participate. And, it has set up the Iridium gateway inPune, at a cost of Rs 50 crore. However, this will not affect itsparticipation in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia.VSNL has got into the value-added services too. With Telstra, it hasformed a joint venture--Telstra V-Comm--to provide DAMA VSAT services.Also it found a partner in Elnet, Madras, to provide domestic E-mailservices.VSNL is, no doubt, an unchallenged entity in the internationaltelecommunications services at least until the year 2004. In a reformedera too, it is a protected monopoly. However, this status does not stopVSNL from aiming high. Quite unusual to many Indian PSUs, VSNL has acorporate vision and it foresees changes and tries to manage suchchanges well in time. It is being reiterated by its turnover of Rs 4,417crore for 1995-96 registering 22.46 percent growth over the previousyear. Recently, the VSNL board has proposed a dividend of 45 percent.Its present stature is mainly due to its visions and foresight than amonopoly entity. Thanks are due to BK Syngal, the present CMD, for hisforesight and leadership. He has proven for VSNL and many PSU heads arole model. Recently, when I met one of his senior colleagues, thatperson had all praises for the CMD, quite strange in a PSU set-up.However, this synergy could have been put to a stumbling block if he wasnot given an extension. Now, Syngal will be in the driver's seat for twomore years as the government has given him an extension, recently. Itis, no doubt an acknowledgement to his contribution.VSNL has scored in man power management too. When job attrition is acommon feature across the IT and communication industries, more so withthe arrival of MNCs. According to Amitabh Kumar, director (operations),VSNL, through better pay packages and welfare schemes, his company couldkeep its forte safely. It experienced very little man power turnoverunlike many government/autonomous entity.Aiming high is VSNL's all time agenda. So are its strategies. VSNL isdetermined to live beyond the present expectation. And, for this, Syngaland his men are in the forefront with all good project arsenals.The turnover chartYEAR    TURNOVER(RS.)1992-93   2,027.001993-94   2,928.381994-95   3,606.811995-96   4,417.00**(Rs in crore)NC GeorgeCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996RURAL TELECOM - A CHALLENGING TASK AHEADfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Modern technologies and streamlined policies can ensure better telecomlinks to rural India.The present rural telecommunication scenario reminds me of the story ofthe elephant and seven blind men. Every one views the ruraltelecommunication market differently depending on which angle he islooking at it from. Going by the sheer size of the rural population,there should be a very sizeable demand for telephones in the ruralareas. However, as one looks at the economic conditions in these areasand the average spending power of the population, the demand appears tobe very low. The remoteness and the geographical spread of these areasmake planning of communications a very challenging and complex task.Modern technologies provide many solutions for the communicationrequirements of the rural sector but the costs involved coupled with thelow expected returns are daunting indeed.Some of the solutions like Wireless In Local Loop (WILL) are beingprojected as the panacea for the rural telecommunications problem butone would need an indepth study to decide whether these are economicallyviable for areas with such low population density and whether it will bepossible to support these sophisticated technologies in such remoteareas unless our own people in these areas are trained to maintain thesesystems after the installation teams have done their jobs and gone backto the comforts of their highly developed countries. It is most unlikelythat even our own trained engineers/technicians will choose to serve inthe rural areas.The government, on its part, has taken the easy way out by laying downthat the private basic service providers will have to install 10 percentof their total capacity in the rural areas. It has also specified thatwires will not be used in the network. The basic service providers whoare, as it is, struggling hard to cope with other problems likefinancing and inter-connect agreement are desperately trying to work outhow they can make their ventures profitable. Many of them are hopingthat sooner or later the government will dilute this requirement.It is not that no one has been able to see the rural telecommunicationsector in its correct prospective. At least for the past four years orso, a number of enlightened experts have been debating on the issues andthe complexities related to the rural telecommunication requirements.But what is being done falls well short of the requirement.Rural Areas: Some Basic FactsThere appears to be no formal definition of a rural area. However, BSMurthy in his book "A Phone In Every Village" published by TRC,Government of India, November 1987, defines the rural area as an areawhere the population is less than 5,000 with a population density lessthan 400 person per sq. km and with less than 75 percent of the malepopulation employed in the non-agricultural sector. The averagepopulation of a village is about 1,200 and typical distances betweenvillages range from 3 to 10 km. A typical household in a developingcountry has four to five members. Generally, a household can afford tospend only 5 percent of its annual income on a telephone. Going by thecurrent rentals of telephones, this means that if a household has atelephone and pays only the rental of Rs 2,280 per annum, it must havean annual income of Rs 45,600. The government has a target of providingone public telephone for every 500 people.There are about 6.3 lakh villages in the country. Of this, only 2.16lakh have a Village Public Telephone (VPT). There are, however, 20 lakhtelephones in the rural sector which has a population of roughly 70crore. Thus, in the rural sector, the average number of phones is 0.3percent against the national average of 1.2 percent of the population.As against this, the average in the sub-urban and urban sector is 6percent which is 20 times higher. This disparity certainly needs to beminimized if we have to work towards achieving economic development ofour backward and rural areas. There is an outstanding requirement ofnearly 4.14 lakh VPTs. The government has plans to provide a VPT inevery village by 1997. However, its annual target for the year 1996-97is only 75,000. It appears that the objective will not be achieved forthe next four to five years. It will take even longer to meet the targetof one public telephone for every 500 people which even by currentstatistics comes to nearly 15 lakh telephones. The burden of providingthese will, therefore, shift to the private operators. They will notfind it economical to provide one in each village.Unless cost-effective solutions are found for meeting theserequirements, it will not be financially viable for any company or eventhe government to establish the requisite infrastructure.Technology PerspectiveThe government is looking at a number of technological solutions to therequirement of communications in the rural sector. Use of VSATs,microwave equipment, ultra high frequency radio links, WILL, andmulti-access radio are some of the approaches presently being adopted.Indeed an appropriate mix of these approaches based on the peculiaritiesof the terrain and the demographics of the areas will have to beemployed to find the right solution. This is easier said than donebecause of the economics of each of these technologies.The critical factors that need to be considered while planning a networkfor the rural sector are:* Existing network architecture* Subscriber density* Equipment costs* Ease of installation and use* Power supply requirement* Reliability, maintenance, and repair* Growth capability of the network* Frequency management.As brought out earlier, subscriber density in rural areas is expected tobe low. Since the population density is less than 400 per sq. km and thepresent average is 0.3 per 100, the expected density in these areas willbe less than 1.2 per sq. km.As far as costs go, the average costs per line presently being taken forplanning purposes is Rs 40,000 per line. In the rural areas, however,the cost is expected to be more. Many of the private operators areworking on costs of Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh per line. Ideally, the costshould be kept below Rs 40,000.Low power requirement, ease of repair and maintenance with remotediagnostics and repair capability are important considerations in acountry like India. While use of solar cells is advocated as the idealsolution for power requirement in remote areas, the cost of theseremains prohibitively high. The planning figure is roughly Rs 3 lakh perKVA of capital investment.Frequency management has been a serious problem in our country. There isan on-going debate about the critical shortage in the RF spectrum forthe existing requirement of the operators of cellular, paging, andmobile radio trunking networks. The Defence forces have been underpressure from various government agencies to release some of thefrequencies which they are holding but not utilizing in peace time.However, they cannot risk doing this because they cannot be assured ofthe availability of the frequencies if and when required duringhostilities. With more and more technological sophistication beingintroduced in our weapons, surveillance, and communication systems, thedemand for the frequency spectrum cannot possibly decrease.Conventional WirelineWireline will continue to be an alternative for the subscriber loop,although only for short distances approaching 1 km.Satellite CommunicationsRemote users who are dispersed over wide areas can be served by usingsatellite technologies. Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC), MultipleChannel Per Carrier (MCPC), and VSAT technology, however, are oftenexpensive compared with terrestrial systems. A number of satellitecommunication companies are working on solutions which will hopefully,bring down the price of satellite communications to $500-1,000.In larger rural communities that are far removed from major switchingcentres, satellite links are effective in providing trunk circuit toindividual smaller rural switching exchanges, rather than individualsubscriber loops. A terrestrial wireless local loop system can beintegrated with low capacity satellite system, providing acost-effective solution.Point To Multipoint Terrestrial TechnologiesPoint to Multipoint Time Division Multiple Access (PMP TDMA) is a provenrural distribution system that finds optimum use for serving clusters ofrural subscribers, using wireless for the local loop. New features,frequency bands, and capacities are continually being developed, witheach system optimized for specific rural needs.Low capacity analog systems have been available for many years. Analogmulti-access systems are used primarily in isolated low capacityapplications, typically serving up to 50 subscribers from individualradio base stations. In India, a 2/15 MAAR system, at present, costsapproximately Rs 80,000 per channel. Digital system when introduced willcost even more though they would provide higher quality telephoneservice.Fixed Cellular And Digital Enhanced Cordless TelephonyA number of companies are offering solutions based on fixed GSM, CDMA,and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony (DECT) technologies. Trials arebeing conducted by Qualcomm on CDMA in India. IIT Madras has developed aDECT technology which promises to be cost effective though costs are notindicated as yet. DoT has signed an MoU with National Semi Conductors ofUSA for a DECT technology which it predicts will cost only Rs 500-10,000per line. However, the subscriber density for which these costs areapplicable is not known. Thus, it would be seen that while a number oftechnologies are in the offing the economics are not being clearlyprojected. Hopefully, the prices will come down once the volumes aretaken into consideration and once the multinationals realize that Indiamay soon find its own solutions.Need For Adopting A Pragmatic ApproachIn a seminar organized by CII in December 1992, N Vittal, the then DoTsecretary, had made some very useful and practical suggestions forimproving telecommunications in the rural sector. Since then he hasexpressed his views on a number of occasions through differentplatforms. Some of the suggestions made by him merit seriousconsideration. The main theme underlying in all his suggestions is toremove all kinds of artificial restrictions that are presently imposed,i.e. * Only one additional service provider for basic services in eachcircle * VSATs are not permitted to be connected to PSTN network *Dedicated networks of major organization like Railways, Defence, NTPC,and ONGC cannot be shared by any of the private service providers. Theycan only use DoT's infrastructure * Only specified technologies approvedby DoT can be deployed by private service providers.Each of these restrictions hampers growth of the telecommunicationinfrastructure. Another suggestion which he had made in 1992 was tochannelize the black money (and there is plenty of it in the country)into developing the rural telecommunication infrastructure.It is very heartening to see that the present government has laidspecial emphasis on developing the rural infrastructure in its CommonMinimum Programme. The allocation for the rural infrastructure in the9th Plan has been increased from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore. Itis now for the telecommunication fraternity as a whole to grab theopportunities presented by the rural telecommunication market, takingthe long-term benefits, both for the nation and the telecommunicationbusiness, into consideration.Fixed cellularUsing fixed cellular instead of copper wire to connect homes and officeshas several advantages.* Speed of installation. Subscribers can be connected immediatelywhen supplied with an antenna unit that connects to an ordinary telephone* Low maintenance. The absence of wires means fewer potential problemsthan are found with wire-based networks in both rural and urban environments* Flexibility. Fixed cellular can be used as an interim measure ahead offixed network construction, with the radio equipment transferred toanother location once the fixed network has been established.Maitland reportA document entitled the "Missing Link" produced in 1984 by aninternational commission headed by Sir Donald Maitland lays down the UNPolicy towards telecommunications development.In January 1995, a proposal of the 1984 Maitland Commission to createWorld Tel, a specialized funding body for telecommunications developmentin the world's poorest countries, was finally given the go-ahead. Tosome, it represents the last chance for significant progress in thisarea during for the foreseeable future. This body is now headed by SamPitroda who pioneered the spread of telecommunications to the ruralareas in India.Distorted economicsIt is generally argued by most basic service providers that providingservices in rural areas is going to be a loss-making proposition forthem. However, their projections may be some what exaggerated with aview to seek subsidies from the government. A number of factors supportthis view.* Modern technology offers cheaper alternatives to physicallywiring up every remote customer. These products are more reliable and sorequire less maintenance. Maintenance costs in rural areas are lowerthan those in city environments where carrying out repairs can involvecomplex and disruptive work beneath busy streets. City networks are alsomore likely to be damaged by other utilities while digging up thestreets* Methods of calculating the per subscriber costs and revenue inrural areas often disregard revenue generated by incoming calls made torural users.Brig. SK Jandial (retd) is vice-president (business development), IndiaSatcom LtdCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996ENHANCED SERVICES A CUT ABOVE THE RESTfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Through enhanced services, operators are trying to differentiatethemselves from their parallels.Today, one can find more than one operator available for any kind of atelecom service. Be it cellular, paging, or yet-to-be-privatized basictelephony. The subscribers remaining the same, the question is who willeat a bigger chunk of the service pie. With competition getting hotterday-by-day, the operators of different telecom networks are striving toprove their edge over others. Others, who are out in the arena providingsomething similar. One sure way out has been providing enhanced servicesor value-added services, as some prefer to call it.To the delight of the operators, enhanced services can be integratedsmoothly, without any major changes in the installed networks.Technically also, these support virtually all network interfaces, allcurrent protocols, and standards including those specific to particularcountries. Thus protecting any investments already made, which is amajor issue in any technology upgradation. And in the interest of thecommon user, for whom all this translates into better connectivity andtrue value for money.Market For Enhanced ServicesDoT had started the car phone service and even the paging service longback. But it turned out be a total fiasco, as the public gave it a coldshoulder. Not that these services were not good technically orotherwise, as they are now, but all because of the lack of an emphaticmarketing savvy and mass awareness. DoT was, and still seems to beoblivious of the fact that the first phase in selling anything is themarket development. And that comes through educating the customers, byreaching them, and telling what it is. Indian Paging Service Association(IPSA) is promoting and selling the concept of paging in a mega way. "Infact, there are numerous enhanced services that can be provided alongwith the routine paging service. But it is unnecessary to inundate themarket and confuse the customers. Educating the people should be giventhe priority," says Praveen Kumar, president, IPSA. Essar Cellphone inDelhi has come up with "Personalized Services" to attract thesubscribers. According to company officials, it is like having apersonal secretary working for you, outside your office, round theclock. AirTel, too, hasn't lagged behind in jumping into the bandwagon.It all started with flashing of cricket scores on pagers during theWorld Cup 96. Even, AirTel had introduced a special number service tokeep the cellphone users updated with the latest in the action-packedmatches. And, when the election fever was on a high, the lateststandings were continuously being flashed by some of the pagingoperators. Soon one will see the operators providing more suchinformation. "The sensex and forex update will take some time to be onthe air round-the-clock. But the paging operators are giving a seriousthought at providing other value-added information, for instance, stockmarket briefings, airline schedules, railway time tables, etc.," feelsOP Suri, senior vice-president (operations), DSS Mobile Communications,a Delhi-based paging operator."These will surely go a long way in developing the market and will, in away, benefit the individual operators also to lure the subscribers,"adds he.Roaming arrangements between the various cellular and paging operatorsis also becoming quite popular. Recently, nine cellular operators, fourfrom metros and five from the yet-to-be operational state circles, havecome together to form "World 1 Network". This is to provide efficientroaming between their respective territories. The cellphone user can dowith a single SIM card, without having to go for separate ones, as inplastic roaming. "Follow Me Paging" introduced by RPG is in associationwith Motorola's Hotline Paging. You can be paged locally, within thecity you are visiting. And that too, at the cost of a local call. Andsurprisingly, nothing changes even your pager number remains the same.Voicemail is just one of the enhanced services that the operatorsprovide these days, but it is catching on very fast as compared to otherenhancements. Not only the cellular operators but paging operators arealso in an endeavor to incorporate it into their networks. Mobilink hasbecome the first service to provide Voicemail facility on pagers. It isalso providing vernacular messaging in three languages--Hindi, Punjabi,and Tamil."Interestingly, enhanced services can be introduced at a cost,which is just 1-2 percent of the total cost required to lay a telecomnetwork.Some players in the field providing these enhanced services are BostonTechnology, Brite, Centigram, Comverse, Glenyare, and Octel," says BonnySingh, manager (telecom), IIS Infotech. His company has been appointedas a master distributor in India by Boston Technology Inc., a leader inthese services world-wide. The personalized services for Essar have beenintegrated into their network by Comverse, Israel.How can enhanced services change the lifestyle of an Indian on the move.Let us take a closer look at these new offerings that are and can bemade available to the Indian users.Virtual Telephone: In many regions around the world, the demand forbasic telephone outstrips the connections being provided. And India isno exception to this situation. Virtual telephone, a yet-to-be exploitedservice seems to be the answer. It is like having a telephone connectionat your place, without physically having an instrument. Though it is notthe panacea for all the connectivity problems.It is an efficient tool for reaching out people living in:areas with poor customer access network those on long waiting list for thetelephone service those in areas struck by natural disasters, causingdisruptions in the infrastructure and small businesses who need 24-hourmessaging capability.A 7-10 digit number is assigned to the subscribers of the virtualtelephone service. This offers them access to a private and secure voicemessaging mailbox. It is just like dialing a conventional telephone. Thecaller hears a greeting or a specific message, pre-recorded by thesubscriber whenever he dials into the network. Subscribers can accessthe mailbox through a payphone and retrieve their messages anytime. Akey feature that can be added is the ability to provide timelynotification to the subscriber, when they have messages waiting forretrieval. The message centre at the network can automatically alert thesubscriber via a pager, if programmed to do so.Voice Mail Service (VMS): Based on electronic voice messaging technique,this service is available to the users through our very own MTNL. Itprovides for recording, storing, and retrieval of voice messages. Thevoice is first digitized and then stored in an Electronic Voice Mail Box(EVMB), which actually is a memory space in the disc of custom-designedcentral computer of the VMS. For recording the voice messages, theseEVMBs can be accessed by anyone--whether he is a VMS customer ornot--anytime through a direct telephone (local or long distance) andextensions of PABXes (through junction lines). For retrieval, however,bonafide customers of VMS only can access their individual EVMBs throughthe use of a secret Personal Identification Number (PIN), which can beselected and changed by the customer at his will.Optional facilities that are bundled with the VMS are:- incoming calls to a number, served by an electronic exchange, can be  transferred to any other telephone and also to any EVMB- restricting the access to selected callers only, by giving a secret  password to them- choice of an EVMB number- quick scan of beginning of all messages- elective retrieval of all messages- redirect messages (with or without comment) to other EVMBs- broadcasting voice messages to several mail boxes  closed user group.Call Answering: With today's fast-paced work and leisure schedules,people demand the ability to capture messages from incoming calls,whenever they are away from their home or office. And this is surelygoing to give the answering machine market a big blow. It is like aseparate answering machines for each subscriber fitted into the network.But in real, there is no machine present physically. It is the networkwhich does it all. It is like your personal secretary, workinground-the-clock for you, outside your office, claim some of the cellularoperators who provide this service.Enhanced services can be integrated smoothly, without any major changesin the installed networks.The subscribers are allotted an EVMB which can gather the incomingmessages when the line is busy or remains unattended for a certainspecified duration. With the touch of a button, the callers can:- mark a message urgent (which places it into the high priority queue)- review a message- re-record a message- cancel the message completely.Once the subscriber logs into his EVMB, he can with a simple keystroke:* listen to all messages* listen to selected messages skipping others* pause while listening to a message* go back or move forward while listening to a message* save or delete messages* check the time and date of message deposit.Submailbox: This allows the subscribers to create several mailboxes fora single telephone line. Many people/ departments can share a phone lineand still enjoy the privacy of a personal EVMB.Call Hold/Waiting: This facility lets you receive incoming calls evenwhen your telephone is busy. You get a short duration pip tone when youare busy talking, indicating that another call is waiting for you. Youcan talk to either of the callers, keeping the other on hold. There iscomplete secrecy of communication between the two callers. In Essar'snetwork, the service helps the subscriber to handle three calls at thesame time, without any of them getting the engaged tone. The subscriberhas the freedom of attending calls at his own priority.The basic telephony will soon get privatized. With the cellular and thepaging networks getting operational in state-wide circles along withmajor cities, the industry will witness a burgeoning demand for theseenhanced services. By the present operators and the operators-to-be. Ina stride, to add more names to their subscriber database, and make theirservices more feature-rich, what these operators will end-up doing is tomake life easier for the end-user.GSM Networks-associated Enhanced Services:Short Message Service:This is a text messaging function for use in digital wireless network.The caller composes a brief text message that is delivered to thesubscriber's properly equipped wireless handset. It can be configured totake messages through an operator or via a voice menu. This facilityhelps your cellphone to double as pager by giving you an option to sendor receive messages in a written form. Thereby, circumventing the needof unnecessary conversation specially when the incoming calls are alsobeing charged.Roaming: It is specially designed for people who frequently travel toother cities. You can be reached anywhere, if your operator has anarrangement with the operator of that place.Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP): A characteristic of theIntelligent Networks. The caller's number gets displayed on the LCDscreen before the subscriber answers the call. If the phone is connectedto the local computer and some memory augmentation is done, the computercan display a scroll of information about the caller, before thesubscriber attends the call.Calling Line Identification Restriction: The calling subscriber canprevent his number being presented on the called subscriber's phone(prevention of CLIP). However, it will be overridden by certain agenciessuch as police and fire, since they need to know the identity of thecaller.Advice Of Charge: The amount charged for the call can get displayed onthe subscriber's phone screen in the form of call units.Call Transfer/Call Forward: The call can be routed to another specifiednumber or even an EVMB conditionally, if the called subscriber is notavailable (or doesn't answer the call). This can be facilitated afterfew rings or directly without any wait.Paging-associated Enhanced ServicesTwin Line service: A business line and a personal line number is givento the subscriber opting for it. To separate the business messages fromthe personal ones.Sequential Numbering: All messages are sequentially numbered allowingthe subscribers to have a control on the messages missed.Reminder Service: You can remind yourself appointment/ schedules for theday or future dates by getting yourself paged from the operator of thepaging service.Special Instructions: Special instructions can be given to the operatorto convey to your callers, anything which you decide.

Yes, communicationsatellites today do not necessarily mean INSATs and INTELSATs, revolvingat an altitude of 35,000 km. They are now closer to us; much smaller,and of course, much smarter. Soon, they will be crowding the skies.By the turn of the century, more than a hundred of them would beorbiting around the earth. Above a distance of as low as 400 km. Theseare called the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, to distinguish themfrom the traditional communication satellites like INSAT and INTELSAT,often called geostationary satellites. Then, there are satellites thatcan be placed at a distance of between 8,000 and 11,000 km, with similarkind of functionalities. Placed between the high orbit geostationary andlow-orbit LEO satellites, these are expectedly called Medium Earth Orbit(MEO) satellites.MSSes are constellations of LEOs or MEOs aiming to provide mobilecommunication services to millions of users around the globe. Most ofthese systems will be operational by a time as early as mid-1998. Atleast, seven such systems have been promised by different consortia.Three of them are being talked about, simply because they have alreadygot the FCC approval in the US. Iridium is a 66-LEO project of aconsortium led by Motorola. Globalstar is a 48-LEO project to be jointlyput by Loral and Qualcomm, with different companies having servicerights for different regions. ICO is a 12-MEO project by an Inmarsatsubsidiary company. All the three are expected to be operational by1998.The others are Odyssey, a 12-MEO project; and Aries, a 48-LEO projectand Ellipso, a 24-satellite (combination of LEOs and MEOs) project.Odyssey, though not in a very advanced stage of planning andfund-raising, and the other two, deferred by FCC, also hope to startoperation in the same time frame as the FCC-approved systems. Then,there is the grand plan by two celebrities--Craig McCaw and BillGates--to start Teledesic, a project involving 840 (No, the figure isnot a printing mistake) LEO satellites to provide broadband services.But they are talking of a time frame of beyond the year 2000. But thatis another century.Why Not Geostationary Satellites?The answer requires a bit of techspeak. Because, the LEOs and MEOs, assuch, are a breakthrough in satellite technology. They are not anupgradation of the geostationary satellites. They are altogether adifferent technology, belonging to a newer generation. To talk of mobilesatellite systems, without talking technology, is a mistake, to use amild word.First, what necessitated the change ...There is something called the Clarke Orbit (some also call it the ClarkeBelt). Perhaps, you know about it. For those who do not, it is an orbitin the space about 35,860 km above the equator where the period ofrevolution of an object is roughly 24 hours, the same amount of timethat the earth takes to revolve around itself. A satellite, which isplaced there, can maintain a constant elevation and angle from aparticular point on the earth, always. In other words, it appearsstationary to that particular point. Hence, the name geostationary. Allthe geostationary satellites are placed in the Clarke Orbit.But what is the problem? It is something that we Indians are veryfamiliar with. Excess population, that is. Clarke Orbit is just oneorbit at a single altitude. Satellites are many. So there can be what iscalled "crowding". There is, of course, no possibility of physicalcollision or congestion. Because, even a spacing of two degrees isactually a distance of about 1,300 km in the Clarke Orbit. The problem,however, is that the antennas on the ground fail to discriminate amongsatellites, if they are too close in the sky, for all practicalpurposes, two to four degrees. That means, there cannot be more than 180satellites, even if we assume a two degree space.LEOs and MEOs, on the other hand, do not have to operate at a fixedorbit. They can be placed anywhere between altitudes of 400 to 10,000km. So, we have no orbit constraint. Hence, no crowding. No problems forantennas on the ground. If tomorrow, there is a need to add newsatellites, or to launch a completely new system, that can be donewithout pains.Another fact that works in favour of LEOs and MEOs is what is called theinverse square law for signal power. According to this, a signal inspace attenuate in direct proportion to the square of the distance ittravels. The lower the altitude of a satellite orbit, lower is therequired transmitting power for a signal. Of course, there is analternative--that of using large antennas. But, that is also not anattractive proposition. LEOs and MEOs, which are at a lower altitude,require less power while using smaller antennas.The LEOs also offer another advantage. There is negligible transmissiondelay as the distance travelled by a call using an LEO is several timeslower than the same using a geostationary satellite. This means, formobile communications, which is predominantly voice communications, theyare better. The final deciding factor is, of course, cost of satellitesand the cost of launch. LEOs are much cheaper.Why MSS?Landline cellular networks do have certain limitations. Most of thetimes, you are deprived of a communication link where you need itmost--in villages, rural roads, forests, and such remote locations. Itis uneconomical for any landline cellular operator to cover theseplaces. Mobile satellite services expand the service territory to coverthe entire world. "It is like having base stations in the sky," explainsMing Louie, vice-president, Globalstar.Put simply, MSSes are LEO and MEO satellite constellations that willprovide mobile voice and data communication facilities the world over.Since an LEO or an MEO can cover much less geographical area than ageostationary satellite, usually more satellites are used to provideglobal connectivity. MSS satellites will be revolving around the entireearth, which means any point on the earth will be covered by at leastone satellite. The advantage is that low altitude, high altitude areas,as well as the seas will now be the coverage area of telecommunications.MSS service will provide a cost-effective way for extending the reach ofbasic telecom operators. Laying cables and even microwave links toremote low subscriber locations is not only costlier, but also timeconsuming. MSS connectivity is instant. It is connectivity on demand.This connectivity-on-demand is beneficial even to the cellularoperators. By collaborating with an MSS operator, they can effectivelytackle the occasional demand in certain locations. Examples includetourist and pilgrimage spots. Haridwar will have at least hundred timesmore demand during Kumbh Mela than that during normal days. So will bePuri during Rath Yatra. No cellular operator will be able to meet thatkind of differentials in demand. That is not a problem for satellites.And, of course, they will get a ready back-up network, thus reducingdropped calls and enhancing service quality.It is like having base stations in the skyResidents of rural and unserved areas will gain access to a telephonecourtesy MSS services. DoT has this ambitious plan of covering all thevillages in next three years. Estimates show, the cost involved will beenormous as the task is almost impossible. Enter MSS and the villagepublic phones will be there, as and when required.The last segment of users--the most important from the MSS operators'point of view--are the international business travellers, the creamylayer. With globalization, the population of this tribe has gone upconsiderably. For cellular operators, using MSS services for servingthem is a better option than using roaming with other operators becausethe complexities of revenue sharing can be much less in the former.Iridium Vs GlobalstarBut why only Iridium and Globalstar?On 31 January 1995, FCC in the US allowed three of the fiveapplicants--Iridium, led by Motorola Inc.; Globalstar LP, promoted byLoral and Qualcomm; and Odyssey by TRW while deferring twoothers--Mobile Communication Holding's Ellipso and Constellation Communications' Constellation. In addition to this, there is aninternational consortium, Inmarsat's ICO. So we have four projects thatare rolling on at present.The reasons behind talking about Iridium and Globalstar are primarily,two. They will become operational at least six months before any othersuch project. Two, we are interested in India more than we are in FCClicences or the meetings of corporate bigwigs in Los Angeles. AndIridium and Globalstar have been most active in India (more about thatlatter).The fact that both these projects are LEO satellite-based is merelyincidental.Iridium is pioneering. The idea of using LEOs for MSS first came toscientists at Motorola's satellite communication division in Chandler,Arizona. Motorola was also the first to approach the FCC for licensingIridium. Globalstar came latter, but now is giving good competition toIridium.Iridium provides total coverage. Iridium with 66 satellites providestotal global coverage, whereas Globalstar covers only 70 degree S to 70degree N. It excludes the poles from its coverage area.Globalstar has low system cost. Globalstar has managed to keep its totalsystem cost low by using less number of satellites. Globalstar's totalsystem cost is $1.8 billion as compared to Iridium's $3.4 billion.Funding, hence, won't be a problem for Globalstar.Tariff: Globalstar wins outright. Globalstar, because of its lowersystem cost, plans to provide the service at a tariff of 30 cents perminute which is several times lower than Iridium's tariff of $3 perminute. The Gobalstar price will be slightly higher (about 50 cents)when it reaches the customer as the local partner will also have hisshare.Iridium uses 66 LEO satellites at an altitude of 780 km, withintersatellite links. Irdium offers total global coveragePrime targets are different. Though business travellers are the targetfor both Iridium and Globalstar, the latter puts emphasis on developingnations as well. This is understandable as the tariff of Globalstar canbe afforded in these countries. This is something that Iridium needs toreally worry about. The international business travellers will also needhigh-speed data communication. Teledesic may also target this elitemarket. As of today, the Teledesic plan is for fixed services. But with840 satellites, mobility can be added to system with marginalincremental cost. That will create problems for Iridium. Iridium shouldeither plan for broadband to directly compete with Teledesic or couldbuild up a loyal user base for paging. Or try both. There is no fourthway. Perhaps, it will do that once it makes some quick revenues.Iridium, despite large system cost, will break-even fast. Motorola,because of its brand equity, will attract major business users. Andthese are the people who will use the system more. Iridium, hence willmake much better revenue, even if Globalstar gives it a run for itsmoney as far as number of subscribers is concerned. That means Iridiumcan plan for next phase better.Globalstar uses technology better. Though better technology usage doesnot necessarily mean better revenue, it helps. Globalstar does not usecomplex inter-satellite links and keeps the entire intelligence onground. This will be the trend of tomorrow as this helps one to havebetter control on the system.Globalstar uses CDMA technology. CDMA is proving its superiority interrestrial cellular and PCS. In satellite communication, it is evenbetter. TDMA, being used by Iridium, requires exclusive command of thespectrum while offering less capacity. No wonder, almost all the MSSservice hopefuls, with the exception of Iridium, are planning to useCDMA. Iridium was finalized when CDMA was still in labs.The Indian SceneIndia is never the same as the rest of the world. MSS services are noexception. While the rest of the world is thinking of LEOs and MEOs,India has provisionally approved an MSS proposal using a geostationarysatellite. And, it is the only MSS proposal approved so far.The $850 million project by Afro-Asian Satellite Communication (ASC), aGibralatar-based company, owned by Zee TV owner Subhash Chandra, plansto use a geostationary satellite to cover India and 53 other countriesin the region which come under the satellite's footprint. It plans tolaunch the satellite in third quarter of 1998 and start the service soonafterwards. While transmission delay and large power requirements makepresent generation geostationary satellites unsuitable for mobilecommunication, a technology breakthrough may well be able to do that. APrice Waterhouse forecast says that mobile communication with hand-heldunits will become commercially available by the year 2000. Chandra plansto do that at least a year earlier.Inmarsat, through VSNL, has also publicized its plan to start the ICOservice by 1999. VSNL will be the local partner in services in thisproject which will spend $37 million for equipment in the first phase.But VSNL is yet to start promotional activities for ICO.Globalstar uses 48 LEO satellites at an altitude of 1,390 km. All theintelligence in the system is kept on the ground. There is nointersatellite link.In contrast, Iridium started selling the concept in mid-1995. Indian FIshave contributed as much as $38 million to the project. That is 5percent equity. Iridium India Telecom Pvt Ltd, as the investing companyis called, has contributions from various Indian FIs through IL & FS.Others are IDBI, Exim Bank of India, SBI, ICICI, HDFC, GIC, LIC, andUTI, among others.What will help Iridium is that these FIs will use their clout to makethe venture successful. Motorola's brand equity will also help.Globalstar, though it came much latter, has already opened up an Indianjoint venture. The company will have 51 percent share held jointly byCrompton Greaves and Pertech Computers Ltd while the rest 49 percentwill be owned by Hyundai-led Hyundai/Dacom. Hyundai holds the Globalstarservice rights for this region. Globalstar plans to invest Rs 4,300crore in India during the next few years. Globalstar's partners could bethe cellular service providers. Last August, Globalstar organized atechnical forum in the capital and it was one of the most well attendedforums in recent months. At least, two cellular operators are havingserious talks with Globalstar India and are waiting for governmentapprovals. Globalstar's strategy of co-operating with local operatorsand the low tariff may give it an upper hand. But FIs still have a holdin the industry and they have invested heavily in Iridium. That could bea hurdle for Globalstar.As far as Odyssey is concerned, this writer is not aware of anyactivities of the company in India.Unto The FutureA Price Waterhouse forecast says Odyssey will form a joint venture withone of the other three consortia and additional joint ventures andpartnerships will be formed by all of the LEO groups. That is true. Themarket is big. But never so big to embrace all those who rush in.The real thing to watch is Teledesic's entry. Bill Gates has never doneanything that is not helpful to growth of personal computers in one wayor the other. Teledesic could be his latest way of ensuring hisobjective. With 840 LEO satellites, it could change the whole balance ofthe MSS market. And the rules of the game. But the big question: will hefinally go for M, mobility that is? The answer to that question candetermine what MSS scenario will be in the year 2010. That could be adifferent story altogether.

The National Institute ofInformation Technology, or NIIT as it is popularly known, is the oldestamong them all. A part of HCL Corp., ever since it started in 1981, itbrought a sea-change in the Indian IT education scenario. For the firsttime, professional courses apart from medicine or engineering or lawcame into being. And for the better.Going back to 1981, when it came into being, education was the firstmotive of this institution. Then it diversified to fields of training,consultancy, software marketing, and software exports. In 1995, thescenario changed. With the government's liberalization policy coming inthe air, the need for going global arose. And the international divisionwas set up.Apart from these, software export factories were set up aimed atproviding entire software solutions to its clients that includes settingup of the network too.Today, NIIT is virtually into every aspect of IT. And telecom. Manytie-ups are taking place. NIIT is diversifying and so are the areas ofeducation in infotech. Be it software solutions, network integration, orInternet training, it can boast of its expertise in many areas.The level of expansion is so high that lately the sales trainingdivision of the institution, NIS had to be separated as an entirelydifferent entity. Now called NIS Sparta, the company has emerged as ajoint venture with Team Productivity, a specialist in imparting trainingin sales and marketing. The other four strategic business units includethe Global Education and Training, Global Software Solutions, GlobalSoftware Products, and Multimedia.In the field of training, it has formed alliances with four companies:3Com; AT&T Network Systems, now under Lucent Technologies; MicrosoftCorp.; and NETG Applied Learning.World leaders in computer and communications software are finding Indiaas the green pasture to venture. And NIIT is the easy solution for them.For it already has the second largest share in the software market inIndia. The organization, already awarded with ISO 9001, internationalquality certification, has little to say for its introduction.The tie-up between NIIT and AT&T has created waves. By recognizing thearea of telecommunications as one of the thrust areas, the alliance aimsat offering training in telecom to the Indians. This includes all,ranging from the basics to the advanced courses. And NIIT being theIndian training associate of AT&T completes the process. A programme onnetworking education is now being provided with the tie-up with 3Comunder the brand name of Centre for Network Excellence (CNE). Hence, thetotal range of education from datacom to telecom is now being madeavailable.Companies like Microsoft also has had an understanding with NIIT inimparting knowledge on Microsoft technologies under the curriculum ofGNIIT programme. For this, it has got the college credit recommendationsfrom American Council of Education (ACE). NIIT alumnae can seekexemptions on certain modules in the US universities on the basis ofcredits. This programme provides education on Windows NT, MicrosoftBackOffice, Internet products, and Networking. NIIT itself is a majoruser of the latest communication tools like videoconferencing, intranet,and the like.Apart from these, NIIT is also into varied IT fields like consultancyand systems integration. In the field of software, it has formedalliances with major companies which include Sybase Inc., PowersoftCorp., Ansys Inc., Mentor Graphics, and Mechanical Dynamics.It has entered into an alliance with Cincom Systems, USA, to provideenterprise resource application software suite called Control. The mainclients among the communications company using the application areAlcatel, Ericsson, Hitachi Semiconductor, Siemens, GEC Alsthom, andPhilips. The advanced functionality of Control is insulated with a3-schema client/server design and is available in multiple platformsincluding IBM, DEC, HP, and multiple databases that include Oracle,Supra, Sybase, and Informix.Ross Systems Inc. is another US company joining hands with NIIT. Thistime, it is to provide the business application software suite of RossSystems called Renaissance CS. It is fully integrated open systems basedclient/server solution designed from the ground up for processmanufacturing organization like food processing, pharmaceuticals, paper,and chemicals.Powersoft Corp., the subsidiary of global software major Sybase, hastied up with NIIT to provide PowerBuilder 5.0, client/server applicationdevelopment tool and Optima++ for building Internet applications. NIITis the sole distributor of Sybase products in India. Sybase providestechnical solutions to NIIT.The organization that has been growing the day it had started from seemsto agree with the same old saying that Darwin meant many years ago--Survival Of The Fittest. On asking the main motive behind NIIT'spresence in telecom education, Sanjiv Kataria, vice-president, corporatecommunication, replied, "If we would not have got there, we would havebeen dead by now. Today, is the era of Net Centric Computing (NCC) ... Andnetworking is the key to any business."Sudeshna Banerjee in New DelhiCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996VSNL - TO EURO OR NOTfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996To raise funds and fructify its vision, VSNL does need to go the GDRway.Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the Rs 4,417 crore India'sinternational communications carrier, has been trying to float itsEuro-issue for the past two years now. But its attempts have beenthwarted for one reason or the other.The ministry of finance is drawing up a list of companies for immediatedisinvestment. The list includes some telecom majors and VSNL could beone of them. The impact of this disinvestment will be negative if VSNLhas to float its GDR before the end of this year.Post-disinvestment, the floating stock will increase. This will lead todilution of the share price and will ultimately affect the pricing ofVSNL's GDR issue. Further, the chances of getting an attractive priceare also doubtful because of the queue-up of other international telecommajors. Large number of telecom companies from the US, Europe, and Asiahave firmed up plans for GDR issues totalling over $30 billion.The first time, VSNL tried to float GDR in May 1994, the share pricefell from Rs 1,550 to Rs 1,200. The issue had to be deferred due todepressed international equity market conditions and the stiffening ofinterest rates. In the second attempt, the share price fell further toRs 1,050 and the issue was deferred due to delays in obtaining finalclearances from the government. So goes the VSNL's GDR saga. Theprospects looked even bleak with the impending retirement of BK Syngal,CMD, VSNL. Even the financial advisor, Anne Morris who had witnessed theearlier deferrals has also moved out. At the time of this article goingto print, the government has announced another 7 percent disinvestmentof VSNL's equity. And, the Telecom Commission has extended Syngal'stenure for two more years. A real respite.Does VSNL really require this GDR? How is VSNL positioned now? Well ...It is placed in a comfortable position presently. Not because it is thesole provider of international telecom services, but because it has beenable to build on its own success and vision. It might be a little knownfact that VSNL has the second highest rate of returns on equity--at 38.5percent, just three points below Advance Info, Thailand.VSNL has been operating independent of budgetary allocations byploughing money back into projects for building, maintaining, andexpanding its services. However, VSNL's profit percentage is quite lowdespite being the sole service provider. This is mainly due to the factthat the company's profit structure is solely determined by what it owesto DoT. DoT charges each caller Rs 62.50 per minute and VSNL's incomeout of this is just between Rs 4 and 7 per minute. Due to this, itsoutgoing traffic has remained almost static as compared to the past.Because, it is cheaper to call India rather than calling from India dueto falling bandwidth costs abroad. Is this an index of growth?Definitely not.Luckily, DoT seems to be acquiescing with global trends in telecomtariffs. Since 1995, it has announced a 25 percent concession onoutgoing calls between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Even for the Internetservices, VSNL doubled up its 250 hours of access per year to 500 hoursper year.In anticipation of growth in outgoing traffic, VSNL has beenconsistently and aggressively expanding its call-carrying capacity. From2,109 in 1991, it rose to 11,525 in 1995. And the target that VSNL hasset for itself in the next few years is 35,000. During this period, thepaid telephone circuits increased two-and-a-half times.The target does not seem to the farfetched, because with fallingtariffs, traffic is going to explode. Together with this are emergingapplications like software exports, videoconferencing, and ISDN, to namea few. Apart from increase in call-carrying capacity, the lines have tobe high-speed lines. Thousands of switches and fibre-optic links need tobe put up to achieve this milestone. And, this cannot be done byretained cash-flow alone. Therefore, VSNL does need to go the GDR way.It would be better if VSNL floats its GDR without much further delay. Itwill enjoy the status of being the sole service provider for six moreyears ... By that time, VSNL should have become a global telco to reckonwith. It needs to reach an enviable position that might even help thecompany to get its sole provider status extended.Expected GDRsCompany Value Time Frame Singapore Telecom $3.5 bn Year-end GeneralWireless $65 m Year-end Nextwave $300 m Year-end Telefonica $1 bn 1sthalf next year Tele Denmark $2 bn 1st half next year Telia $2 bn 1sthalf next year STET US $2 bn 1st half next year France Telecom $10 bn1st half next year Telstra $6 bn 1st half next yearEASWAR SATYAN IN MUMBAICopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996MADRAS - CELLULAR OR SERVICESfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Better coverage, low call-drop, and roaming? Or interpreter assistance,information services, and hospital emergency services? The two cellularoperators in Madras have different priorities for offering to thecustomer.Is providing cellular phone service a part of the telecom industry orthe service industry as a whole? This seems to be a major bone ofcontention between the two cellular operators providing the service inthe city of the Madras. While one swears that it is undoubtedly a partof the service segment, the other refutes it vehemently. Caught in thiswar of words are Skycell Communications Ltd and RPG Cellular ServicesLtd."We are not a telecom industry but a service one. We are all cellularservice providers and should aim at offering more services," says RameshK Narain, Senior Manager, Sales, Skycell Communications. In line withthis thought, Skycell has recently started offering a number of servicessuch as hospital emergency service, interpreter assistance, wake up callfacility, etc.Justifying these host of facilities, Narain says, "The subscriber shouldget a more complete service from us when he pays a hefty amount and thatis what we offer." In his opinion, people have understood the need for acellular phone and their realization should be valued more by offeringsuch additional services. "This business is no longer concept selling.People have started to feel the need and are coming to us now," says he.But RPG Cellular Services, the second service provider operating inMadras has a different angle to the entire story. Shashi Kumar Kalathil,general manager, marketing, RPG Cellular Services, dismissing theservice concept, says, "We are undoubtedly in telecom. Value addition incellular could only refer to voice-mail and data transfer facilities.The rest of them whatever they be, are not value-added in classicparlance."The company argues that the effectiveness of the service should bemeasured more in terms of the capability of the frequency signals andnot in other service packages. RPG's stance is understandable, giventhat it does not offer any value-added services. Instead, it has beenharping on its wide network ever since its started operations with 24base stations. It does claim to have the larger subscriber base of thetwo."It is the coverage that matters", says Kalathil. Currently, it has atotal of 31 base stations and his company plans to add 10 more in theevent of a spurt in demand. This move, however, will depend on thetraffic, according to Kalathil. In his opinion, the number of basestations need to be increased only if either the profile of the citychanges with the migration of a section of people or if the need forgreater coverage inside the buildings in a particular area arises.Skycell is not too far behind on the base station front. It has 22 basestations in place and plans to add 10 more by the end of October. "Withthis and the new services, Skycell will surely garner about 57 percentof the total market before the end of March 1997," avers Ramesh.The subscribers in Madras, unmindful of the wordy duel of whethercellular is a part of service or telecom segment, seem to have respondedto the new concept. They are not unduly excited at the availability ofsuch varied services though. "All these could be more of a marketinggimmick of each of the organization," says Rekha, a business executiveworking in a multinational firm in Madras. Their one overriding concernis the high airtime charges. "Whatever it is, all that I am moreconcerned with is my phone bill. Hence, I obviously use it with greatprudence," says Hari Krishnan, a cost conscious business man inpossession of a cellular phone for the past six months. "I still do notgive my cell number to everyone I know," says he.Despite these reservations, the number of cellular subscribers in Madrashas been growing steadily. Though subscriber base has fallen short ofexpectations, the numbers are not way behind projections. According toestimates put out a year ago by the two players, Madras was to have asubscriber base of 22,000 by the end of September 1996, the firstanniversary of cellular service in the city. Currently it is at18,264--a 17 percent shortfall. Of the total subscriber base of 18,264customers, Skycell claims a base of 8,994 and RPG boasts of 9,270customers (as on 10 September 1996).The gradual popularity of the service has motivated the operators tointroduce the concept of using cellular phones on a rental basis. "Thisis mainly for those people who have a need to use a cellular phone butare still not ready to buy one," says Kalathil. "Rent-a-Cellular"concept is a fairly new service introduced just over a month ago and thesuccess of the concept still remains to be seen.Whether the operators finally settle their differences or not, the priceconscious market of Madras has shaped up well, as per the businessplans. And this is perhaps the only area where the two operators agreewhole heartedly. "This is because this time the customers were notbudget-sensitive," say both the operators.K Sreedevi in MadrasCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996MRTP ACT - CAN IT LATCH DOT'S WINGS?from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996DoT has recently been brought under the purview of MRTP Act. Thequestion is which DoT? The service provider or policy maker?The National Telecom Policy 1994 signalled a shift from culture ofmonopoly to that of competition in telecom services. Competition, if notfair, is Jungle law. At the same time, protection of consumer interestis the ultimate objective. MRTP Commission's decision to include DoTunder its purview is, hence, a welcome step.In July 1996, the two-member bench of the MRTP Commission consistingSardar Ali and S Chakravarthy took a historic decision to bring thegovernment departments rendering "non-sovereign functions or services"if they are found indulging in restrictive, unfair, or monopolistictrade practices except for those services which are provided free. Thatincludes road transportation, Railways, housing, and DoT. While most ofthem are merely service providers to the consumers, DoT's case is a bitdifferent. It has two different functions to perform. That of operatingbasic telecom services and framing policies for the entire telecomservice industry.Does the Commission's observation also include DoT, the policy maker?That is the point of debate. Since there is only one DoT, and it is nottoo willing to separate both the roles in near future, DoT, the operatorshould also be accountable for what DoT, the policy maker is doing. Andvice versa.The Commission stated that collection of a fee for a service providedrenders it possible for the consideration by the Commission. That meansDoT--no distinction between policy maker and operator--which has takenhuge sums as licence fees, is also liable to be prosecuted if it failsto provide service. Does that mean failure to provide easy andacceptable interconnect facilities to the private operators can be areason to bring the case to MRTP Commission? While some feel this isstretching the thing a bit too much, there is no less number of why notsin the response. Some also say that the restrictive nature of theinterconnect agreement can be challenged on the grounds that it has madethe sector unfavourable for private operators and has thus negativelyaffected the users. It should be mentioned here that as the tenderdocument did not stipulate any interconnection charges, there should notbe any interconnection charges. Again, DoT does not pay charges for acall which originates from its network and goes to private operator'snetwork. So, DoT should also pay interconnection charges. There shouldbe a common code for everyone. A few of them even go to the extent ofaccusing that the main objective of DoT is to maximize its revenueirrespective of the impact this may have on the consumers and, ofcourse, private operators. Says TH Chowdary, director, Centre forTelecom Management and Studies, "This is an anti-competitive,monopolistic, and restrictive trade practice."It is noteworthy that in the recent past, the MRTP Commission has issueda notice to BPL Mobile, one of the cellular service providers in Mumbai.This happened as per a consumer complaint filed against the value-addedtariff plan of the company. It is mentioned in the complaint that whileBPL Mobile in its value-added tariff plan claims to charge the consumerRs 4.25 per minute for every call till the consumer logs up 800 minutesa month. But, as per the complaint, the company is collecting Rs 5 andnot Rs 4.25, even before the consumer logs up 800 minutes in a month.This is because the company, in effect, collects Rs 4,000 as advancecharges for calls.After the new telecom policy was announced in 1994, Indian telecomscenario has undergone a sea change. During this period, it has gonethrough many ups and downs. It has also witnessed many controversieslike not allowing the PSUs to participate in the bidding, capping onlicensing, telecom scam, and change in partnerships. Are not theseenough for MRTP Commission to be a bit stricter in implementing itsregulations on DoT?DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it haschanged some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.It is a matter of fact that since the privatization of telecom sector,DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it haschanged some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.However, this has not affected the growth of the Indian telecomindustry, till date. It is booming. And, one hopes, it will not do so inthe future also. Let us wait and watch.Gaurav Patra in New DelhiCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996VSAT MARKET - LOOKING FOR A FASTER TURNAROUNDfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996There is an Indian Airlines flight from Varanasi to New Delhi that goesvia Bhubaneswar. If you take the flight from Varanasi for the capital,you will fly to Bhubaneswar, and then come to New Delhi. It soundsamusing.But, many corporates do the same when it comes to sending electronicmail. To send E-mail from Delhi to Madras they go to Manhattan. There isa faster turnaround from outside than inside. One can go on and ongiving examples. But the bottomline is, after years of big talk, thestate of our communication services has improved little. Boasting aboutintroducing new technologies do not help. Exploring their capabilitiesdo. Fax has seen a tremendous growth. Reason, it was a revolution at thecustomer's end. Structured cabling is seeing explosive growth. Reason,ditto. Wherever DoT has not got involved, it has been a success story.Can We Continue To Live With That Kind Of Attitude Today?Today, the environment is getting increasingly competitive. Quality ofproducts is rising. Products are moving fast on the store shelves. Takeshirts for example. In the last couple of years, one has seen a numberof foreign brands come in. Arrow, La Coste, Ralph Lauven. In the face ofthis competition, some Indian brands have survived, others have not. Onedoes not hear too much about Wings/Four Seasons these days, thoughZodiac has managed to do well. Indian companies can certainly competewith global brands in quality of products. Especially in certainsegments, textiles being one. But what they do not have is the resourcesthat large corporates can deploy. Companies like HLL, Proctor & Gamble,Philips. Communication is one vital tool of doing business these days.These Indian companies also need faster, reliable communication. Theywould certainly use VSATs if they are provided at an affordable cost.After years of big talk, the state of our communication services hasimproved little.Companies need to be market ready and ready to market. It involves fastturnaround. The newly set up private banks like IndusInd, TIMES Bank,Centurian Bank, all have used VSATs to achieve fast turnaround. Fastturnaround on information of deposits. And fast turnaround on profits.And the same is the case in manufacturing and distribution. AshokLeyland, Bajaj Auto, SAIL, TISCO, and Essar are using this satellitetechnology to move their business processes faster.Sectors that are doing well in the economy are courier companies,hotels, and airlines. It is a manifestation of the state of economy.With increasing globalization, a number of joint ventures are gettingformed. And, just as in a marriage, the joint venture is going throughvarious stages. The first stage is the courting stage, the second is theengagement, and the third stage is marriage. Most of the companies arein the first stage and some are in the second. And they need to be ableto communicate with their partners--foreign and Indian alike. So thesectors that have a role in supporting these activities are naturallydoing well. It is like the marriage season in Indian economy.Companies like Hindusthan Lever, Proctor & Gamble, and Citi Bank can setup their own WAN. But, then they are part of an exclusive club. They canafford it. DoT has been slow in its commitment on customerservice--HVNET was supposed to be up and running a year ago. One isstill waiting. The other service providers are meeting with somesuccess. But, at an average cost of Rs 8 lakh per VSAT as far as theTDM/TDMA variety, it is still pretty much meant only for the elite. So,customers need to wait for prices to come down and services gettingbetter.A new twist that has been added is the Sukh Ram impact. The new boss atSanchar Bhawan has delinked himself from day to day operations. But,what is happening is that in the name of delinking, things are gettingdelayed. An example in point. DAMA services have not got off the groundfor any VSAT provider except HFCL and Telstra V-Comm. And the new yearis already six months old.The Need For VoiceVSATs are already in use. Yet, much more market potential needs to betapped. The biggest communication need in the country today is "voice".The independent gas station owner on the National Highway is notinterested in credit card transactions because he only takes cash,therefore, has little reason to buy a VSAT terminal. But, if you comealong and you give him a telephone line at a reasonable price and highquality, he will buy it. There is a larger market opportunity for VSATand the market is demanding voice. But, they do not want voice at Rs 8lakh, they want voice at Rs 50,000 per VSAT. Come to DAMA. At thispricing policy regime, a DAMA terminal would be costing Rs 15-16 lakh.Who can afford them such investments?Today, it is the MNCs and large corporations who can think of usingVSATs. MNCs are used to large pipes connecting their various businesslocations. And, in the absence of reliable terrestrial links, they needto depend on VSATs.Consider an organization that is Rs 700 crore dealing with hightechnology products and services. The total communication costs are ofthe order of Rs 3.75-4 crore. The two most important markets for thisorganization are the west and south. As a result, 70 percent of theorganization's communication costs are between Mumbai and Bangalore.That is out of the total communication costs incurred in Mumbai, i.e. ofthe order Rs 1.25 crore, Rs 75 lakh are for communication between Mumbaiand Bangalore.The rule of sercive provision is that the more the network is loaded,the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is notabout to lose its marketing share.Let us now look at a scenario where the organization has a dedicatedleased line between Mumbai and Bangalore. The cost of the leased line(with both fixed and recurring costs) is of the order 14 lakh. Let usadd an additional cost of 10 lakh to the downtime. So the total expenseswould be Rs 24 lakh. Compare that to Rs 75 lakh. That is a saving of 50lakh.Today, DoT has got 15,000 leased lines installed country-wide. And, theconcentration is in the metros. But, the issue is leased lines incentres outside the metros. That is where VSATs can filled the gap.Also, in its present form access to the PSTN does not exist.The rule of service provision is that the more the network is loaded,the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is notabout to lose its marketing share. The more private networks--whetherVSATs or not access DoT's network, the more revenue DoT earns.Even from the customer's point of view, he is not interested in someesoteric technology, but rather in getting a phone line on demand. IfVSAT policy remains in the present form, then the real addressablemarket is only for the large organizations. However, the access of VSATequipment to PSTN will open up a whole new market medium and smallercompanies and even individuals. And, that is the real India.WILL THE POTENTIAL BE REALIZED?The answers depend not on technology, but on a variety of other factors:1. Pricing PolicyWill new services be offered at prices which attract widespread use?Will new tariffs be extended to maximize revenues from large users orsubsidize the costs of other services?2. Ownership Of FacilitiesWill users such as broadcasters be able to own their ownsatellite--receive terminals (downlinks) and transmit stations(uplinks)? Or will they continue to be required to lease them from DoTthat will recover several times their cost in large charges?3. Terrestrial FacilitiesWill resources be allocated to solve the last mile problem, i.e. toinstall local loops or radio links, rebroadcast transmitters, and so on?4. Competition Or ExclusionWill the established communication networks take advantage of thetechnology to lower the costs and reach new customers? Will they pass onthese savings to their customers or absorb them as additional profit?Will they attempt to block the entry of new networks designed to reachunserved customers, or to reach existing users at lower cost?5. Role Of GovernmentWill government policies be flexible enough to facilitate maximum use ofthe technology. For example, the adoption of policies to minimize usercosts and to encourage new entrants to supply both equipment andservices.6. Flexibility And InnovativenessWill organizations that could apply satellite technology to better servetheir customers be flexible and innovative enough to adopt it?ISHAN RANJANCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996VSAT MARKET - BAMBOO OR BONSAIfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996The most important innovation in satellite technology in the Eightieswas Very Small Aperture Terminal or VSAT. Initially, VSATs were designedfor inexpensive low volume data transmission. Today, versions have beendeveloped that transmit higher volumes of voice, data, and video. Indiahas an opportunity to leapfrog its underdeveloped communicationinfrastructure with rapid VSAT deployment. And thereby pursue strongeconomic growth.VSAT technology promises a wealth of new services.Combined with advances in low cost earth station design, bandwidthcompression techniques to facilitate transmission of motion video, andnew techniques for low cost voice and data communication. And, mostimportantly, social and economic benefits for society as a whole.Themarket has not taken off as fast as one would have expected. We have awindow of opportunity with this technology. But, will the promise befulfilled? The answer depends not on technology, but on a variety ofother factors, chief among them being policy.A Market Still To Be BornIt is still a big boy's game. At their current price, only the largecorporate users can afford VSATs. In a country that is so large andwhere communication infrastructure is concentrated by and large in themetros, one would believe that there would be a huge potential for thistechnology. Its diffusion has not been as rapid as one would haveexpected.We at Voice & Data, in August 1995, had predicted a market potential ofRs 200 crore in 1995-96. We ended up realizing only about Rs 100 crore.The problem, however, has not been demand, but access to that demand.And, one will need to look at flexible solutions in order to achievethat.In the growth of this market, the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is notjust a simple equation between demand and supply. But, one of regulatingthe whole process. And DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibitingrole so far.The tariff structure still does not reflect the advantages of this newtechnology--cost independence of distance; point to multipointdistribution; economical uses of satellite bandwidth. The structure isstill reflective of an attempt to maximize revenues from large users.And the non-commercial attitude of DoT. It certainly, today, is not seenas a tool to promote the development of an economy.VSATs and terrestrial links go hand-in-hand. And, like terrestriallinks, VSATs are pipes. Ones that allow information to flow back andforth. DoT is the provider of terrestrial links. And with demandoutstripping supply, one would have thought that DoT would encouragedeployment of these "pipes in the sky". In the growth of this market,the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not just a simple equationbetween demand and supply. But, one of regulating the whole process. AndDoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting role so far.But, DoT is playing its old games. It is a monopoly and it is actinglike one. The satellite carrier cannot market directly to the end user,but only to DoT. The equipment supplier can try and reach end users aswell as DoT, but the power to take decisions on adoption of technologyrests with DoT. Evidence of users demand can take the form of waitinglists. In order to help meet that demand, some technology providerscould also conduct "pilot projects". But, if DoT decides not to respondto this demand, the user has nowhere else to turn.Contrast this with the diffusion of computers. Diffusion of thistechnology does not rely on a single gatekeeper. There may be multiplechannels--wholesalers or retailers. The government may intervene tocontrol supply, however, by limiting imports and/or encouraging localproduction of technology as a developmental strategy. Users are able toinfluence supply and price through their activities in the market-place.VSAT technology is attractive to the user because the service providercan guarantee high quality and fixed user cost. However, the cost ofacquisition is high. As far as the customer is concerned, DoT blocksaccess to equipment and services they need. And may be ready to pay for.Corporates here can neither set up their own systems to bypass theunreliable telephone system nor obtain high-quality services from thetelecommunication authorities. So the customer has no choice.Why is DoT making things difficult for VSAT?One possible reason could be that it sees VSATs as competing withits terrestrial infrastructure.That is why VSATs are not allowed to be connected to the public switchedtelephone network. And VSAT service providers are only allowed toconnect in closed user groups. The market has huge potential. But, likea bamboo, it needs to grow in an open and free environment.VSATs are not necessarily a standalone technology. It is not a directcompetition for the terrestrial link. In a country where the telephonedensity is 1.2 telephones per 100 people and business centres are sowidely spread, VSATs could act as a strong complementary technology.The average trust in telecommunication service provision is rather low.And in important matters the traditional methods (personal meeting,signed papers, etc.) are preferred. To try to change this attitude, arapid solution for urgent customer needs is provided by wirelesstechnologies .... VSATs. DoT needs to implement HVNET fast.The market has huge potential. But, like a bamboo, it needs to grow inan open and free environment. People trying to play GOD will end increating not the real thing, but a small invitation.Copyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996STRUCTURED CABLING - DISTRIBUTION WILL DECIDEfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Networking is the next wave and companies are trying to adapt to it.Structured cabling provides one of the basic entry points for vendorsinto customer accounts.But, today, the focus of competition has shifted from products toservices. Providing services in networking. As a result, managers havebecome increasingly concerned about the services their distributorsprovide. Ideally, every participant in the distribution channel shouldprovide the same high-quality services to every customer.But what are the distribution channels for structured cabling? And howare managers of these channels looking to provide the same high-qualityservices to each and every customer?THERE are two distinct type of channels. And, they are classified by thekind of customers that they cater to. The first kind is theenterprise-wide customers. They are the ones who want turnkey networkingprojects executed. And, they are represented by the Top 200 companies inthe country. The second kind is workgroup customers. People whosenetworking product and services requirements are of a smaller magnitude.They constitute the mass market.WHILE every participant in the distribution channel should provide thesame high-quality services to every customer, in practice, of course,such consistency is virtually impossible because neither themanufacturer nor the distributor is likely to excel at everything.Instead, companies tend to do an outstanding job with some services anda mediocre job with others.To overcome these discrepancies, managers commonly try to achieve theimpossible goal of making every channel member equally skilled in everyservice. Often this effort entails forcing distributors to hireadditional service personnel or sponsoring training programmes fordistributors.Innovative managers are trying a different approach. Recognizing thatthe proficiencies of some channel members can be used to bolster thoseof others, they are experimenting with what we call capabilities-sharingagreements. Through such agreements, the superior service of one channelmember is substituted for the inferior service of another. Each channelmember offers a greater number of high-quality services at far lowercosts than it could by acting alone. And each contributing distributorreceives appropriate compensation when it shares its superiorcapability.This is the idea, implementation, though, could be tricky. Let us looksat the national netas. The HCLs, the Wipros, and the like. Today, thenetworking products market is of the order of Rs 300 crore. It isexpected to touch Rs 1,200 crore by 1998-99. Four times growth in threeyears. And, everyone would be looking to address this market. Now thismarket can be segmented into two distinct streams--the enterprise-widemarket and the workgroup market. Opportunities exist in both themarkets. The turnkey solutions market is of the order of Rs 450 croreand workgroup segment another Rs 750 crore. But how can theseopportunities be addressed by the players?THIS opportunity is huge and now is the time companies need to bepositioning. For action delayed could be market denied. In order tohighlight the way the market is evolving, we have built up a model.Consider the given chart. The X axis represents volume, while the Y axisrepresents value. Volume means amount of business in structured cabling.The key driver for this axis is money. The Y axis corresponds to valueadd. Higher one goes on the Y axis, higher the value add. The driver ofthis axis is intellectual resources.The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distributestructured cabling could get it to be classified into differentquadrants.THE first quadrant has two distinct clusters ... Cluster I has HCLComnet, Wipro, Digital, and TISL. These companies are the big names andtraditional rivals. The biggies would want to address the entire market.But to address those turnkey projects, they will need to form alliances.Let us take an example. Wipro has bagged an order from BPCL for aturnkey project. It will be the one point source for the entire project.However, it has contracted Comptel for doing the structured cabling.That is Comptel's strength. And, this partnership is not only for thisparticular project, but rather on a more continuous basis. Same is thecase with HCL Comnet which as been developing its own cabling partners.The company has met with a great deal of success in bagging campus-widenetwork projects. Cable laying requires a great deal of customization.And for this specialized job, you need to call in professionals. Digitalis going to gain from growth in the manufacturing sector. TISL has somekey accounts which it should be able to leverage on.Cluster II has players like MicroLand, Datacraft-RPG, and PCL. CMS isthe one to watch as it has been gaining ground rapidly. These peoplewill bag, on an average, less revenue from structured cabling in theenterprise-wide cases than the biggies.MicroLand has a strong presence in the corporate segment, Datacraft-RPGis making inroads through its network integration focus. PCL is anotherplayer in this league with strong public sector and government accounts.CMS is beginning to make an impact. It got shortlisted in the Reliancedeal with HCL, Wipro, and Digital.The long-term success of turnkey/enterprise-wide solution providers willdepend on how well they are able to partner with other smaller players.The big guys have bagged these corporate accounts after aggressiveselling and close customer contact. It is now going to be difficult forthem to give up control to their partners. Comptel is doingsub-contracting work on cabling with Wipro, but in time would be gettingbig enough to pitch for certain contracts on its own. In any case, thesmaller partners shall be increasing their influence in the activecomponents of the networking game while the biggies would want them toconcentrate on the passive components only. This is because structuredcabling is not where these biggies make money, with increasingcompetition, margins are certainly getting squeezed. They carry cable inorder to provide a one stop shop to the customer; margins are higher indoing higher value add, network design, and integration.IF you look at the second quadrant, here are companies that are playingthe high volume game. Advantec, Apcom, and MicroLand/Microsell. That isthe present state. There is an opportunity for both HCL Comnet and Wiproto get into the distribution game. This is because they have large reachnation-wide and also partners who would be looking to source structuredcabling from them. And, they seem to be preparing to get into it.Advantec has certainly been very successful. It was a pioneer of sortsand is modeling itself on Anixter. Anixter is one of the most successfuldistribution chains world-wide.In the distribution game, it is reach and level of support that isprovided to the customers which set distributors apart. This high-volumegame is going to be addressing the large workgroup market. Also, anumber of structured cabling vendors would be depending on thesedistributors to get their brand visibility and marketshare. AT&T, today,has alliances with most of the key guys in the game, Advantec,Microsell, and Wipro. Apcom is another leader in the distribution game.It is helping Nortel gain market share. HCL Comnet is the one to watch.It is working in an exclusive relationship with Siemon. It will beinteresting to see how it builds up the Siemon brand against Lucent.Another cluster that is emerging in the same quadrant has companies likeIT&T, BNA, and C-Tel. These are companies that have signed distributionagreements with AMP, BICC, and IBM, respectively. IT&T is a medium-sizednetworking company, focusing mainly on markets in the North and West.BNA is a strong technology company that has focused on cabling rightfrom the start. It is based out of Bangalore. C-Tel is a company thatalso has a strong technology orientation. It has been looking at thenetworking market from the high value-add side--things like networkdesign and integration. The market is growing rapidly and all thesecompanies have an opportunity to penetrate the market. How successfulthey are, depends on their choice of target segments and reach.The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distributestructured cabling could get it to be classified into differentquadrants.THE third quadrant has companies that are the workhouses ... the actualimplementors. Companies like Proactive Data Systems, Comptel, BNA,Optel, Gateway Systems, Delta Force, Taker Technologies, Advanced MicroDevices, and Infotech. They are the guys who get their hands dirty.Companies here are relatively new and small. And have very differentbackgrounds. Proactive Data Systems has evolved from a background ofvending networking products and services. Taker Technologies has historyof providing EPABX Systems. Optel and Gateway Systems are dealing withfibre optic cable. This is a specialized area. Optel is partnering withHCL Comnet on campus wide projects.Gateway Systems is more focused in the West--addressing large corporatecustomers like Bajaj Auto and Telco. So, the backgrounds here are bothvoice and data. And, there are some who have always focused only oncables, like BNA. One will see increasing number of players as this isone entry point into the market. But then companies here will startmoving into other quadrants. Like, Proactive which is trying to move upwith higher value add and BNA that is looking at the mass market.THE fourth quadrant is the sector where one is seeing the largest chunkof hidden champions move in. Companies like Ramco, Zenith, Unicorp,Melstar, DCM DataSystems, IT&T, and Samtech. These are companies who aretargeting the workgroup market. They are realizing that structuredcabling is a key point of entry into the customer's backyard. They arerealizing that they need to have influence on as many networkingproducts as possible. So, they are extending their focus from boxes tothe core of the network infrastructure; and, provide a total networksolution to the customer.Ramco, for example, has been one of the biggest channels for Bay's hubsales in the country. Realizing the strong correlation between hubs andstructured cabling, it is now focusing on cabling as well. And, as it istargeting largely workgroups, it is a typical IV quadrant player.Another interesting company here is DCM DataSystems. It is focusing onthe networking products and services market, more importantly, thegovernment and public sector organizations, the typical tender market.And, it has tied up with AMP, a recognized structured cabling brand fromthe US.These are one kind of players here. Another are companies who aretargeting newer opportunities in structured cabling itself. Structuredcabling involves UTP and fibre. Laying fibre is still a specialized job.And, a whole lot of opportunities are emerging in manufacturing andtelecommunication sectors to deploy fibre. Here companies like Optel,Gateway Systems, and Proactive Data Systems are trying to positionthemselves.Ishan RanjanCopyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996STRUCTURED CABLING - INTERVIEW WITH AJAY ADVANI, DIRECTOR, LUCENTTECHNOLOGIESfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Ajay Advani, director, Lucent Technologies and former director,Advantec, is one man who has had the inside track of the structuredcabling in India right from its inception. Interview with him follows.Structured cabling was a new concept here in 1992. What was yourexperience in this early phase?Things were hard. In those days, I remember making customer calls andgetting insulted. "Haven't heard of your company and if this technologyis as great as you claim, then with a brand like AT&T to back it, itdoes not need selling. And if we want this thing, we will speak to AT&Tdirectly."What was the focus then?One thing was getting to be clear. Customers are apprehensive of newtechnology. They are looking for change, a better change. But they arenot sure whether this vendor is the right vendor or not. I tried to makethe customers comfortable. To reassure them that there is no catch. ButI needed reference sites.When did that happen?My first reference site came to me in February 1993, over six monthsafter I had been in the field. It was a Wipro customer, a paint companyin Mumbai, to whom the company had sold 11-12 nodes. That was the firsttime I saw this technology work in India.Who were your first major customers?Banks. MNC banks were my first major customers. Citibank, ChaseManhattan, Standard Chartered.How do you see the technology evolving?Technology is heading towards faster and faster data transmissionspeeds. Voice and data was integrated early. Video was a bit of aproblem, but that has now been taken care of. Today, you have buildingswith structured cabling systems that support outlets for phone, PC, TV,VCR, smoke detector, and fire alarm.Are you referring to intelligent buildings? Don't you think it is alittle futuristic today?The concept of intelligent building is more with respect to the mindsetof the builder. Structured cabling helps add value to properties. Costof real estate is rising rapidly--at least in the metros. While propertyrates have grown 200 percent in the last two years in Mumbai, buildersare looking to provide value to properties. Along with marble on thefloor, granite in the kitchen, and phone with voice mail and otherfeatures, they are planning to provide shafts for structured cabling.Copyright 1996 Voice and Data (India)Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE & DATA via NewsNetOctober 1, 1996STRUCTURED CABLING - THE MAGIC MARKETfrom VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996Having good quality cabling infrastructure is very important as over 70percent of the network problems are cabling-related, and the cost ofdowntime can exceed original costs.However, in our interactions with corporate users and industry, we cameacross some interesting trends. One is that both the supply side anddemand side are driving the cabling market. Also, size of marketopportunity is getting major network integrators to look at this marketfrom more than one viewpoint.The supply side of the equation shows entry of a number of newinternational vendors. Demand is getting fuelled from not only theexisting markets, but the new markets as well.We are presenting the method in the madness--of how we see things unfoldand on what is hot in today's technology.The most important trend in networking today is "growing demand".Corporates are reporting an increase of 20 percent to 70 percent peryear in the number of nodes they are adding to their networks. And whatdoes networking entail? It enables resource-sharing. In other words,connecting resources together. And to connect, one needs cable."Structured cable", in today's context.But why so much hoopla about structured cabling? The great interest instructured cabling is because it provides convenience. The drivers forcabling today are the need for resource-sharing, the need to scale-upoffice productivity, and an increased emphasis on workgroupcollaboration. And in order to achieve this, every seat in anorganization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of where you aresitting, you need to be connected.Every seat in an organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective ofwhere you are sitting, you need to be connected.The structured cabling market is seeing strong growth, growing over fivetimes in two years. From Rs 23 crore in 1994-95 to over Rs 120 crore by1996-97. Both the supply side and the demand side continue to fuelgrowth. There is a great deal of infrastructure that needs to be put inplace in organizations as the economy becomes more service driven andcompetitive.The market is being driven by three distinct forces. First is thepresence of increased number of players. The second is the demand in newcustomer segments--geographically and sectorially. And, third isincreased networking industry focus.THE number of structured cabling vendors has grown three times in thelast six months. Till March 1995, the active players were Lucent(formerly AT&T), Nortel, and Siemon. Today, we have six moreplayers--AMP, BICC, Digital, IBM, Molex/Mod-Tap, and Siemens. RAD/RITGroup is also planning to enter the market.So far, Lucent is the clear leader having entered the market early witha strong product offering and its principal channel partners--Advantecand MicroLand--having done a great job. HCL Comnet has helped Siemongain a foothold in this market, while Apcom has consolidated Nortel'sposition in the structured cabling market.Looking at the rapid growth of this market, a number of internationalvendors felt that they needed a piece of the action. AMP, a US-basedcompany, has entered the market through alliances with IT&T and DCMDataSystems. BICC Brand Rex, a UK-based company and part of one of thelargest cable companies, has forged alliances with BNA Flexinet Systemsand CMC. Digital and IBM, the leading computer vendors and the earlypropounders of this technology, also have their own version ofstructured cabling systems. Molex is one of the leading connectorcompanies in the world and has its own manufacturing plant here. It isdistributing its cabling system through Intercom Systems and EikoComputers. Siemens is a major player in the European market with itsshielded twisted pair offering. RAD/RIT, an Israeli company, hasalliances with CG Informatics and MRO-Tek.So far, structured cabling has fund favour in the large cities. Now,the market is moving out and beyond them. Into industrial towns andclusters.FROM the supply side to the demand side. Demand is rising--not only inexisting segments, but in new segments too. One of the earliestcustomers was the financial sector--Citibank, ANZ Grindlays, andStandard Chartered are some prominent names. Citibank, in 1993, waslooking to provide telebanking services to its customers. And, it neededto get its infrastructure in place. The demand for structured cablingcame in from the telecommunication side. Today, as Citibank looks atexpanding its suite of customer services, both voice and dataapplications are getting increasingly deployed.These and other top-of-the-line organizations in the financial sectorwere the first to invest in structured cabling. For them, it was a keyinfrastructure requirement. The same was the case with Kentucky FriedChicken. It is known for talking "chicken". But even before it orderedits chickens, it had got its cables in place. And all thought-out andstructured. Same has been the case with Coca Cola, Levi-Strauss, and,now, Ford. These are large transnational companies who understand thevalue of having infrastructure in place to provide services to theircustomers. Whether it is cola, cloth, or cars.Another segment is the high-tech sector--information technology andcommunication companies. Companies like Oracle, Novell, Motorola, andNortel. Software Technology Parks have also seen large scale deploymentof structured cabling. HCL Consulting, Infosys, and Cadence are examplesof such companies.The campuses also have contributed to the market. IISc Bangalore, IITKharagpur, IIT Mumbai, IT-BHU, and JNU are examples of networkedcampuses.The big opportunities are emerging in manufacturing. A large number ofsteel, automobile, and consumer durable companies are setting up shops.General Motors and Larsen & Toubro are setting up factories in Baroda.Ludhiana is emerging as a key centre where a whole lot of structuredcabling is getting deployed. Hero Cycles is one of the major sites. But,a whole set of new customers are coming up there.Typically, so far, structured cabling has found favour in the largecities--Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, and Mumbai. In places likeCoimbatore/Tirupur, Cochin, and Hyderabad in the South, in theindustrial clusters of Lucknow/Kanpur, Bhopal/Indore, and in and aroundLudhiana in the North. The most industrial activity today seems to behappening along the Vapi belt ... along Mumbai/Surat stretch, and alsoin Pune/Nasik in the West.The Taj Group of Hotels is looking to deploy structured cabling acrossits 40 locations country-wide. Here, apart from providing infrastructuresupport, structured cabling is also seen to add value to "theproperties".This is the same concept that a number of builders and architects aretoying with. DLF, Ansals, and Raheja are builders looking at deployingstructured cabling along with a whole suite of other facilities.Hospitals are another opportunity area. A great deal of voice and data,and video flows back and forth in a modern hospital.Another potential opportunity area for structured cabling is emerging intelecommunications. Cellular service has been operational in the metrosfor almost a year now. And, cellular networks are getting to be rolledout in other states. Escotel has announced start of services in Meerut,some 70 km from Delhi. These structured cabling products could bemodified to suit some of the needs of these operators. Particularly, innetworks with distributed architectures, data flow can be done throughstructured cabling.THE last (but certainly not the least) driver of the structured cablingmarket is the increased networking industry focus. Wipro formed analliance with Lucent in July 1996. HCL Comnet, in August 1996, appointeda general manager to spearhead its indirect channel sales. These eventshave a common thread. Wipro was earlier sourcing its structured cablingrequirement from Advantec. Today, it feels that with its reach andfocus, it can get into the distribution game, apart from its focus onnetwork systems integration. The same is the case with HCL Comnet. Theseare large IT groups and their focus has been on high value addition inthe network integration game. But that was true when the cabling marketwas only at the high end--the enterprise level whether large campuses orlarge corporate accounts. Now, the market is taking on mass marketcolours, and the big networking companies--HCL Corp., Wipro, Digital,TISL, MicroLand, and Datacraft-RPG are getting very interested. And,when they get interested, the market potential intensifies.Also, the new entrants into the structured cabling market, AMP, hasformed alliances with IT&T and DCM DataSystems. With IT&T, the allianceis to act as a distributor and also a network integrator. With DCMDataSystems, it is for a whole range of networking products. Same is thecase with BNA which is to act as a distributor for BICC. Siemon has anexclusive relationship with HCL, while Nortel is going with Apcom.You can also expect a whole host of other networking companies--Ramco,CMS, Comptel, Unicorp, Samtech, and others--to get interested. Afterall, structured cabling is one point of entry into a customers network.And an increasingly important one.THE structured cabling technology is in transition. Traditional cablingwas the cause of over half the network's downtime. Structured cablingprovides paths of reliability in information flow in the ever-changingworld of networks. Structured cabling system is a completeinfrastructure. It consists of cables and the connecting hardware aswell as the installation and administration practices required toprovide system reliability and longevity. A structured cabling system isdesigned to provide a physical link between every work area in abuilding or in a campus, and is installed with little knowledge of thetype of communication equipment being connected to it. It accommodatesall of a building's current communication requirements and provides theability to cope with new needs as they arise.When one thinks of structured cabling systems, one thinks of cablingconnectors, wall plates, work area outlets, test equipment, and patchpanels to support standards based 100 Ohm Category 3, 4, and 5 UTP aswell as 62.5/125 mm fibre optic cabling. Today, "Category 5" has becomethe hottest term since UTP. But what are these Cats?Category 3 cable is intended to be used for voice and data transmissionrates up to 10 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 16 MHz.Category 4 is intended to be used for voice and data transmission ratesup to 16 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 20 MHz. Category 5is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates up to 100Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 100 MHz.ONE characteristic that will be critical in all future structuredcabling technologies is their relationship to the technology alreadyinstalled. The new generation of technology must offer more than mereinvestment protection though it must certainly offer that. And, it mustdo more than simply integrate the new technology with the existinginfrastructure. Owners will want new technology to evolve in such a waythat it adds value continuously to the infrastructure investment alreadymade.And, they will want this happen across the board in systems, in theproducts that implement the systems; in the support available; in thebusiness process involved in buying and installing new systems; and inthe development of applications and services.Ishan RanjanThe Market Is MushroomingThere are three forces driving the structured cabling market ...*1.

No one could talk about the coming year without mentioning theInternet and how it would affect the voice market.  Private branchexchanges (PBXs) and telephony servers will merge to createintegrated, do-it-all servers on which enterprises will run mission-critical networks.  The long predicted emergence of unified messagingand computer telephony integration (CTI) finally will become a realityin 1996.The Internet:  CB Radio or New Paradigm     Even with all the excitement over the Internet in 1995, therestill are many consultants predicting its imminent demise.     "It's not clear to me that the Internet is not just [citizen'sband] radio," said Dusty Sykes, a consultant for analyst firm VanguardCommunications Corp. in Morris Plains, N.J.     But even if it is a passing trend, companies are spendingconsiderable time, money and resources crafting Internet strategiesand incorporating the Internet into products.     "The Internet will be very big this year," said Sheila McGee-Smith, of the PELORUS Group in Raritan, N.J.  "I think people arespending a lot of time investigating what kind of presence ... [they]need to have.  I think we are beyond the point of 'do I need apresence,' [and now should be asking] 'how do I integrate this intothe back office and how do I make money from this.'  Companies need toknow whether there is money to be made or not."        The rush to the Internet has not been all rosy, analysts said,because many other technologies were ignored in 1995 as companiesclamored for more Internet presence.  One example is fax-on-demand.     "The same money that might have been budgeted for fax-on-demandhas gone into [World Wide] Web pages," said Peter Davidson, presidentof Davidson Consulting in Burbank, Calif.         After awhile, the people who are putting money into the Internetare going to realize it only hits one segment of the marketplace andthey are going to go to fax as well.  [Then] the Internet may createopportunities for fax-on-demand."       In the voice market, Internet activities are particularly visiblein call centers.  Big call center companies, such as AspectCommunications Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Rockwell of DownersGrove, Ill., announced they would be adding technology to theirproducts that allow callers to access customer service representativesin call centers by clicking a button on a World Wide Web page.       Smaller companies, such as San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.,also announced software that would perform similar tasks throughsoftware-only, open solutions.       McGee-Smith expects to see many more Internet-relatedannouncements from call center companies and "more focusing on callcenter vendors' end-user.  People will need to be able to access callcenters from the Internet."     The call center market also will continue to grow in 1996, McGee-Smith said.  "I can't imagine anybody saying ... that [the call centermarket] is mature.  That is like saying the personal computer (PC)market is mature--it is constantly changing."Combining Telephony and Switches on One Server     What CTI gurus long have been predicting seems set to come truein 1996--telephony servers that will run both an enterprise's PBX andcomputer-telephony over a single network.      "The marketplace is going to recognize that the idea of addingdevices to existing PBXs does not make sense and the market willrecognize that a new paradigm is upon us--new telephony switch serversthat integrate voice, data and communications services," said JimBurton, president of C-T Link in Boston.     AltiGen Communications Inc. in Fremont, Calif., is one companyalready causing a buzz over its yet unseen "open multimedia platformthat will offer integrated servers," according to new vice presidentof marketing, Gary Andresen, formerly a senior consultant forDataquest in San Jose, Calif.      Andresen was so impressed by AltiGen's forthcoming platform thathe left Dataquest to get on board with a company that would beoffering what he had been saying eventually would be the enterprisetelephony solution, he told VTSN.  Look for upstart AltiGen toannounce its new platform at the Computer Telephony show in LosAngeles, March 12-14.     The type of solution companies such as AltiGen will offer is a"self-contained unit that has fax, integrated messaging, interactivevoice response, and a switching element so that you have telephonelines coming in from the central office and telephones serving out ofthe box to the desktop.  A web server might also be a part of thecommunications, and an automated attendant," Burton said.Unified Messaging Will Take Hold     The universal in-box and unified messaging platform are twotechnologies all of the big messaging companies--voice and electronic--have been pursuing fervently.  Analysts say 1996 will be the yearthese offerings become reality.     "I believe that messaging is the 'killer app' that everyone hasbeen looking for and it has been sitting in front of us for the pastfive years," Vanguard analyst Sykes said.      With the need for multimedia messaging driving a technologyconvergence, players new to the voice market are changing:  softwareheavy-hitters Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., and NovellInc..       All three have said they will have next generation client-servermessaging systems coming out in the first half of 1996, and all haveannounced or demonstrated plans to include universal in-boxes thatwill receive electronic, fax and voice messages.  All three also arecrafting Internet strategies that they are incorporating into thesesystems.      Release 4.0 of Lotus Notes will become available Jan. 10.  Notesalready offers third-party applications that make it a viablecomputer-telephony platform, such as San Diego-based Blue SkyTechnologies' Phone Notes.  However, release 4.0 adds functionality toNotes while making it simpler to manage and lowering the price. Analysts expect the differences to increase Notes popularity, despitepredictions that simpler technologies--such as web browsers--woulddethrone Notes as large enterprise's groupware platform of choice.     Microsoft has said its Exchange server product would be out sometime in the first quarter of 1996, and many companies have put theirmessaging plans on hold until they get a chance to look at what theRedmond, Wash.-based company is going to offer.  With a largecorporate migration to Windows NT, the company's powerful high-endoperating system, many users will want to use a native Microsoftmessaging solution as well.     Microsoft also has shown a solid commitment to both computer-telephony and fax in its products.  Its new operating system, Windows95, included Microsoft's telephony API (TAPI), Microsoft Fax and alink to Sprint Corp.'s broadcast fax service in its offering (VTSN,Aug. 8, 1995,).       Novell Netware users are waiting for Novell to release GroupwiseXTD, which finally will make Novell's popular groupware offering intoa client-server messaging architecture.  Groupwise XTD will offerupdated calendaring and scheduling, and Gary Rowe, principal of RoweCommunications in Atlanta, said Groupwise XTD is "probably thefurthest ahead in the universal mailbox arena."Fax's Role in Unified Messaging     The universal mailbox is expected to boost fax's messaging role,making it both easier and more preferable because of the directconnection and exact image replication fax offers.     "Fax is an integral part of the universal mailbox," said MauryKauffman, managing partner at The Kauffman Group in Cherry Hill, N.J.     The proof of this, Kauffman said, is Kirkland, Wash.-basedApplied Voice Technologies' purchase of RightFax of Tucson, Ariz., for$4.2 million in cash and stock last week.  "This is sending a messageto all the other voice- and E-mail companies that if they don't have afax [component], they won't be able to compete."     Analysts say RightFax leads the market in fax servers, followedby Optus Software in Somerset, N.J.; they expect the local areanetwork (LAN)-based fax server market to expand rapidly in 1996.  "Interms of LAN fax itself, we will see growth rates through the roof,"Kauffman said.  "There are at least a million Novell networks.  Lessthan 10 percent have fax servers on them," Kauffman said.     The rise of Windows NT also will help the LAN-based fax servermarket, consultant Davidson said.  "[Last year] has really been a yearof pilot testing NT-based servers.  1996 will be the year whencommercial sales start to happen in a big way.  What you are going tohave is what was a DOS-based industry become, as much or more so, anNT-based industry," Davidson said. Forming Standards To Meet New Needs     The introduction of computer software companies that adhere to adifferent, more competitive business strategy changed the way voicecompanies thought about their own strategies last year.  Once a marketof closed and proprietary technology, the voice industry has beenforced by the encroaching computer software industry to open theirplatforms.       In response to that need, the Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum(ECTF) seemed to come from nowhere to become a major industry force in1995, leaving the other voice standards organization--Versit--scrambling for position in the rapidly changing voice standards arena.     "The most important is the formation of the ECTF.  They will gettogether and see that we have interoperability--even without Microsoftand Intel.  There isn't a play for Microsoft and Intel in the ECTFexcept to follow what's going on and participate," Burton said.       "The Versit community has to be asking themselves whether theyare accomplishing what their goals have been."     Versit is a four-company standards group composed of AT&T Corp.,Apple Computer Corp., IBM Corp. and Siemens Rolm.  Each of thefounding Versit companies, along with Novell, joined the ECTF in July1995.     Versit worked on its own standard of Novell's open telephonyservices application programming interface (TSAPI)--Versit TSAPI.  Italso brought out its encyclopedia of computer-telephony standards, theVersit Encyclopedia, which is available for anyone to download onVersit's home page at http://www.versit.com.     One of the ECTF's goals for this year, according to ECTFPresident Tom Zenisek, is to make its own work on Versit TSAPI and theVersit Encyclopedia its second major project.  In 1996, the ECTF willrelease its first body of work:  the telephony application objects(TAO) specification, which it was given to develop by the SingleComputing System Architecture (SCSA) consortium.       The ECTF plans to release the specification at the ComputerTelephony show in March, and have a membership technical and marketingcommittee meeting immediately afterwards, on March 15, in Los Angeles.

Back to Headline List CopyrightVOICE TECHNOLOGY & SERVICES NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996VOICE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRAL TO RETAIL BANKING SERVICES     Banks are turning increasingly to voice technology amongsolutions to providing 24-hour remote retail banking services.       "We believe that eventually this will be the preferred method ofinteracting with a bank and there will be appropriate revenuestreams," said Henry Mounger, senior vice president of DepositGuaranty National Bank in Jackson, Miss.  "Right now it's (an issueof) market leadership.  We believe we are laying the groundwork forwhat the future of banking delivery will look like. ... It is hard inthe early stages to put a benefit to that."Working with Visa     Deposit Guaranty, which has almost $6 billion in assets andserves Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, is working with VisaInteractive of San Francisco to provide its customers with remotebanking solutions.  In 1988, the bank installed a virtual responseunit (VRU) from InterVoice of Dallas, to handle requests for accountbalances.  In November 1994, Deposit Guaranty offered touch-tone billpayment, and introduced remote banking by personal computer (PC) inNovember 1995, Mounger said.       This year, Deposit Guaranty also will begin selling customersPhonePlus screenphones for approximately $200 to $250 a piece. Several bank employees have been trying the screenphones since April,and Deposit Guaranty plans to select 250 customers to test the systemfor free for several months.  Customers will pay an undeterminedmonthly fee to use the service.     Mounger admits the bank is not sure which device or methodcustomers will prefer--one reason Deposit Guaranty has chosen toprovide its customers with several options.     "There are lots of mixed reviews on screenphones," Mounger said. "We don't want to dictate which device wins [and] we ... have to offerdifferent options."  Visa buys the screenphones from U.S. Order andVerifone manufactures the phones which include some intelligence sousers can perform a variety of tasks off-line.  "Visa's strategy is to  ... support their electronic banking platform by making it compatiblewith several screenphones," Mounger said.     On a systems level, Visa Interactive provides software andoutsourcing services for banks that want to offer remote bankingsolutions.  Deposit Guaranty uses Visa to outsource its bill paymentservices, which approximately 1,800 customers use.  When a customercalls in to pay bills, Deposit Guaranty's VRU transfers the customerto Visa's network, which is linked to Deposit Guaranty's database, andthe funds are transferred then from the customer's account to thepayee.      Deposit Guaranty also plans to offer services from the Internet,although the bank is not yet sure what it will do beyond getting ahome page and World Wide Web site.  "We will be relying on a thirdparty such as Visa Interactive to get us to that level," Mounger said.     For its part, Visa is working hard to develop its Internetapplications--last summer it allied with San Francisco-based WorldsInc. to develop three-dimensional banking and retailing applicationsfor the Internet.

Unisys Corp. lastmonth purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0 to provide a self-servicehuman resource application to its 36,000 employees worldwide. Employees will access this information through the "Intranet," orinternal World Wide Web, that Unisys' human resources department isbuilding.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added to the system.

Among the investors wasMichael Dell, founder and chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.     The Edify program will give Unisys employees secure andcontrolled access to their human resource records, including benefitsand available leave information, through the Intranet.  ElectronicWorkforce 4.0 also will work with PeopleSoft's Human ResourceManagement System (HRMS) to allow employees to update records eitherover the Web or via telephone.        Bluebell, Pa.-based Unisys believes it can control human resourcepersonnel costs by letting employees make their own changes to certainpersonal information, according to Lee Stivale, information technologyproject director for human resource systems at Unisys.

The FCC is concerned that by takingthis revenue from local phone companies, phone service for hard-to-reach rural areas will increase.  A Notice of Proposed Rule Making maybe issued sometime this year, sources said.  The Commission isconsidering levying either a flat tax or basing it on an accountingsystem that would make ISPs account for all the traffic they sendthrough the local exchange and then pay a fee based on that traffic. ISPs would then choose whether to pass those savings on to users. (Federal Communications Commission, 202/418-0200.)

InterVoice has been issued U.S. patent number 5,469,500 for itstechnology, which distributes an AIN application's intelligence intosubscripts, once called "applets" and now referred to as serviceapplication modules (SAMs).  SAMs run on an IP instead of leaving theintelligence on a service control point (SCP), which often handlessuch tasks as network database management.       "A SAM would be something such as voice mail, voice-activateddialing, single number service, or automated service activation," saidAl Samball, manager of new business development.  "The modules all canbe tied together."       This requires the SCP to exert a lower level of control over theIP, said Mike Polcyn, InterVoice's vice president of businessdevelopment and product marketing. Taking the Pressure Off     Transferring some of the network intelligence and tasks to IPstakes the pressure off SCPs, much like using an Internet applet meansthat the user can avoid taking up personal computer memory storingapplications and instead run the program straight off a remote server.     "An IP is typically performing very primitive functions," saidPolcyn.  "Play a particular message, collect digits, and so on.  Whenyou get into a complex application like voice-activated dialing thathas a couple of layers of user dialogue, user input or informationaccess, the overhead on the SCP of dealing with that complexity in avery large port configuration would be somewhat overwhelming in termsof processor requirements."       "If you were to break that application into pieces that could bedelegated to the IP, it could perform a lot of those functionsautonomously and then return to the SCP the result of thatprocessing," he added.     Polcyn said InterVoice would incorporate this technology into itsown products.  He would not disclose whether the company plans tolicense the technology to other vendors.      InterVoice also announced that it has joined Texas-based TandemComputers Inc.'s Tandem Alliance Program.  The program developsconnections between Tandem's platforms and software from alliedvendors to provide integrated solutions for customers.  Initially,Intervoice said it will offer voice-activated dialing, single-numberfollow-me services, an automated assistant, and voice navigation andvoice mail applications.

The firm last week announced an exclusive, 7-1/2-year, 10,000-workstation market data contract with Thomson Financial ServicesInc.'s ILX Systems Inc. market data subsidiary. ILX will oustincumbent quote terminal providers Quotron Systems Inc. andAutomatic Data Processing Inc.  Dean Witter had enough problems choosing a market data vendorfor its new firmwide branch system without monkeying around withthe networking piece. Dean Witter had been bedeviled by itsearlier attempts to create a homegrown market data system, usingworkstations running IBM's OS/2 operating system and --possibly -- satellite delivery. That quest was eventuallyabandoned last fall (Inside Market Data, Nov. 15, 1991). Thefirm then opted to look at solutions driven by the market datavendors, a process that ended with the selection of ILX andSears Technology Services (STS), a subsidiary of Sears Roebuck.  STS sells voice, video and data services internally to otherSears units, according to Gary Weis, STS senior vice president ofnetworking and technology. Weis also has managementresponsibility for Sears Communications Co., which sells the sameservices to non-Sears companies. He says that SCC is "activelyengaged" in discussions with another brokerage firm that wouldbring a DWR competitor onto the network.  As part of its plan, DWR, the brokerage arm of Sears' DeanWitter Financial Services Group Inc., will expand its use of theterrestrial facilities provided by STS, operator of one of thelargest SNA networks in the country (see box). The firm alreadyuses STS for branch applications, and to provide localconcentrators to handle market data provided by Quotron and ADP.  "We're glad it's over," says Fred Frohne, executive vicepresident and director of information services at DWR. "It waslike giving birth."  Dean Witter's choice of STS isn't surprising, given thecorporate relationship and the fact that STS is an incumbent ofsorts. But Frohne insists the selection was based onfunctionality and sound business reasons rather than family tiesalone.  "The reason we're using STS is because it's got good pricing,the right kind of uptime, and over the years the network managershave become very sensitive to the nature of Dean Witter'sbusiness." Other Sears units on the network are Coldwell Banker,the real-estate brokerage; Allstate Insurance; Discover Cardmerchants; and Sears Payment Systems. Non-Sears customers includeRadio Shack, Goodyear and major petroleum companies.  "The arrangement within Sears is that where it is the prudentthing to do, Sears will provide the network services," Frohnesays. "That's not something cast in stone if, in fact, there is areason to make a business case to do something the network cannotprovide."  The rollout is already underway with the installation of 12 386and 486 IBM PS/2 broker workstations at DWR's branch at 2 WorldTrade Center in New York. It will continue with "a dozen or 15additional locations -- the shakedown group" -- that will allowthe firm to identify and deal with installation difficultiesbefore moving on to the rest of the 350 branches. According toFrohne, DWR will continue with the full-scale rollout in thefourth quarter. Sources say the project is scheduled forcompletion by the end of 1993.  The new network contract covers data only. The firm's voicevendor is Sprint, managed by STS; the hoot 'n' holler vendor isAT&T, and DWR already has plans to move its shoutdown servicesonto the STS network. There are no plans for video near-term,though STS's T.1 and T.3 backbone has sufficient bandwidth tohandle video, Frohne says.                        Back at the Branch  "The big change is that we took market data and will bebroadcasting that through the network," says DWR senior vicepresident George Ross. The ILX ticker plant on Fulton Street inlower Manhattan will be connected directly to the Sears SNA widearea network. "It will save us money. The bottom line is we couldhave packaged that with a quote vendor, but STS is so big theycan deliver the package more cost-effectively than the vendorcan."  DWR currently employs a mix of Quotron and ADP market dataterminals for account executives on a broadcast-only basis. Thedata passes from the vendor's network into regional DWRconcentrators, and from there on to individual branches via theSTS network.  Until now, DWR brokers have been using the STS SNA network forapplications related to broker-client services rather than marketdata. These applications include account information andservicing, and internal research. Even so, the volume from the350 branches is enormous. More than a million inquiries per dayarrive via the STS WAN at the Sears data center in Dallas,according to Frohne, making it one of the largest such IBM-baseddata centers in the country. The new agreement with STS will "addtraffic for opening accounts and placing orders for thebranches," Frohne says.  In the firm's official announcement of the branch system, DWRpromised the introduction of "a broad range of new services foraccount executives and clients. These new features will includeportfolio management tools, spreadsheet packages, wordprocessing, expanded market data, and market and research alerts,along with many other applications customized for Dean Witter."Despite this official pronouncement, Frohne says the network assuch "will not play a role in new product development." STS willnot be adding capacity for the new DWR applications, but he says"they will absorb us within the network."  The new implementation on the STS network will increase thespeed of access for DWR brokers from a 14.4 kilobit/secondmultipoint access, to point-to-point 56 or 64 kilobit/secondaccess.            Sears Has Everything -- Except Satellites  STS has a 100 percent terrestrial T.1 and T.3 backbone for itsnationwide IBM System Network Architecture network. Frohne saysthat STS has "the largest single image SNA network out there."There are some "400,000 logical devices connected to thatnetwork," he says, including PCs, mainframes, minis, printers andfax machines.  Ross says redundancy is built into the network. He describesthe network as a "family of T.1s" linked to more than 50 majornodes throughout the U.S. These nodes, in turn, are serviced byT.3 circuits linking the major processing centers in Schaumburg,Ill., Columbus, Ohio, and Dallas. Columbus has 15 large 900-series IBM mainframes, according to Ross; it is the central sitefor Sears' Discover and merchant applications, and is the backupfor Dean Witter. DWR's main processing facility is in Dallas.  "It's like a universal virtual network," Ross says. "If we loseany one data center, the users will never know it happened. I amof the opinion we could lose two of the three and still be allright."                        By Land or by Air?  DWR's relationship with STS goes back to 1984, when the brokerfirst began to use STS for the firm's branch applicationsnetworking.  DWR never considered another terrestrial alternative. But thefirm did look closely at end-to-end satellite services providedby market data vendors, including ADP's Brokerage InformationSystems Group and ILX. Quotron and U.K. market data vendorReuters were also considered, as was Hughes Network Systems Inc.,a vendor of very small aperture terminal (VSAT) networks.  "We really did look at all of the networking options," saysDWR's Ross. "Satellite is excellent, it works very nicely.... Thebottom line is there were no dollars to be saved by going off thereservation to a satellite environment. STS developed theirnetwork with Dean Witter first because we were the most sensitiveusers to downtime in the world of Sears. If they could make usclowns happy, then they knew they had a product that can meet theneeds of the rest of Sears."  DWR explored satellite options through market data vendors,thereby underlining the importance of a networking strategy forthese players. Ross says Quotron had no satellite option, but "weaddressed totally unbundling all services" -- so this shortcomingdidn't rule out Quotron for the rest of the pie.  "We went to Hughes directly," he says, "but if we had chosen togo satellite, it made more sense to go through ADP -- the reasonbeing we would have had to set up a group to manage that processrather than leave it in the hands of the vendor." Under an accordsigned last fall, ADP provides some customers with two-waysatellite communications using Hughes' VSAT technology. Ross saysDean Witter looked at Reuters "casually" -- although Reuters hadproposed a pilot using its Satellite Delivery System 3 (SDS3)network.  "We would not look at any terrestrial solution offered byanybody else," Ross says. "Being very candid, it was not anoption we had. And they [STS] do not offer satellite. Really, it[satellite vs. terrestrial] is kind of a wash, to be very candidwith you. It's an iffy type advantage. Satellite means antennas,roof rights on buildings, and there are dollars involved withthat. So it's a wash overall, nationwide."  "In any given LATA, [Local Access Transport Area], we havesufficient density to make long-distance and local access lessexpensive than using VSAT technology," says Weis. "Because of thesize and density of the network, it is net cheaper."                      **********************                      NETWORK SIZE AND SCOPE                      **********************                * 3.6 Trillion Characters of Data                  Transmitted in March 1992                * 1991 Dial Connect Minutes:                  30.2 Million                * 32,000 Data Circuits                * 268 T-1 Facilities                * 90 NET IDNX T-1 MultiplexorsSource: Sears Technology ServicesBack to Headline List CopyrightWALL STREET NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJune 19, 1992NEW YORK TELEPHONE SET TO BRING T.1 ISDNTO WALL STREET USERS AS EARLY AS NEXT MONTH  New York Telephone is on the verge of receiving approval for atariff filed for ISDN Primary Service that would bring T.1 ISDNcapacity to Wall Street for the first time. If the New York StatePublic Service Commission approves the filing, the service couldbecome publicly available as soon as July 24.  If approved, ISDN Primary Service would join Basic Service asNew York Telephone's two-headed ISDN offering. The Centrex-equivalent Basic Rate ISDN, which is comprised of two B channelsand one D channel, has been available since April 1991, but hasbeen almost invisible on Wall Street. Only Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., and Citibank -- the threeparticipants in the recently completed New York State ISDNtrials -- have experimented with the technology in any depth.  These trials have, however, suggested the variety ofapplications that ISDN can bring to the desktop. Shearson, themost ambitious participant in the trial, tested branch trainingapplications that take advantage of ISDN's capability to delivervoice and data simultaneously: both the trainer and the studentcan look at and make changes to the same screen while they talkon the telephone at the same time.  Merrill Lynch experimented with ISDN as a way to more closelycontrol telecommunications costs. And Citibank implemented aninternational video teleconferencing application using thefacilities of Teleport Communications Group's TC Systems unit.  New York Tel has been hampered by the scarcity of its ISDNswitching technology. According to Jean Altenau, staff directorfor ISDN Product Development for NYNEX's Telesector ResourcesGroup, Basic Service is available only from Central Offices inManhattan on West 42nd Street; in White Plains, N.Y.; and inGarden City, Long Island. Both Basic Service and Primary Servicecan carry integrated voice and data over a single ISDN line, andboth flavors eliminate the need for a modem of any kind.  NYNEX has remained reluctant to announce a more specific ISDNdeployment schedule. "Right now, deployment is limited," Altenausays. "But we expect additional deployment through 1992 and1993." Mary Cooke, associate director for NYNEX ISDN MarketPlanning, told a recent forum: "As money comes rolling in, we'llbe able to increase our deployment 50-fold."                  Primary Service: A Definition  NYNEX's ISDN Primary Service operates at 1.544 megabits/second,typically broken down into 23 64 kilobits/second B channels fortransmission and one 64 kilobits/second D channel for signaling;or 24 B channels under the control of a D channel in anotherDigital Transport Facility (DTF), defined in the filing as "a 1.5Mbps facility between a subscriber's premises network interfaceand a port." The B channels can carry voice or data, while the Dchannel carries the out-of-band signaling necessary to controlits associated B channels.  The Primary Service's circuit-switched voice provides digitizedspeech or voiceband data access for features like Direct InwardDialing, Outward Dialing, WATS long-distance service, and 800services. The service also allows subscribers to utilize the Dchannel for signaling to dynamically allocate B channels on aper-call basis.  The full 24 channels will be available at what New York Telcalls the "suitably equipped" CO's DS-1 port termination viadedicated lines. According to the New York Telephone filing,subscribers to the Primary Service have the option to use either"a subset or all of the channels at the port termination or [to]have multiple ISDN Primary Service ports to connect to multipleDTF's."                         The Commitments  New York Tel will require a minimum service period of 12 months"subject to the availability of facilities and node software andhardware"; additional commitments must also be for a minimum ofanother 12 months. All subscriber-based equipment must conform tothe published AT&T and Northern Telecom ISDN Primary Servicespecifications.  One caveat in the filing pertains to the controversialAutomatic Number Identification feature plaguing public utilitycommissions everywhere. The filing warns: "The subscriber may notresell, or otherwise provide to third parties any informationobtained through the use of the Calling Line Identificationfeature."  Pricing is complex. On a per-month basis, the cost of a DigitalTransport Facility to the subscriber will be $332.25 for "thefirst half-mile or fraction thereof"; and then an additional $300for each DTF to the same premises. Ports with 23 B channels andone D channel are priced at an additional $595 per month, andInteroffice Termination is priced at either $595 (23 B channelsand 1 D channel) or $545 (24 B channels).  As for interoffice facility charges, rates are based on NYNEXSuperpath 1.5 megabits/second service. There are optional monthlycharges for backup D channels ($50 each); calling lineidentification per port ($150); and channel configuration pertrunk group established ($10).  If subscribers choose a three-year contract, they will save afew dollars per feature. DTF, for example, would cost $315.65rather than $332.25. A five-year contract would reduce that samecharge more substantially, to $299 per month. There will benonrecurring charges for service establishment ($250); for anychange from NYNEX FLEXPATH to ISDN Primary Rate Service ($225);and for any changes to service ($200).  So far no one has intervened -- a sign that perhaps not evenadvocacy groups understand the full implications of ISDN service.Given the lack of ISDN-capable COs, and NYNEX's reluctance tomove more quickly than its customers, it will be up to WallStreet firms to create a future that includes ISDN capabilities.Back to Headline List CopyrightWALL STREET NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJune 19, 1992MCDONALD COMPLETES ROLLOUTOF 29-BRANCH VOICE DATA NETWORK  McDonald & Company Securities Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio, has justgone live with a final network link to its Jersey City, N.J.,office, the last of 29 branches to be tied into an integratedvoice-data network. The new network supports some 400 users atbranches in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.  The McDonald rollout illustrates why securities firms arebecoming reluctant to turn over their network destiny to marketdata vendors, and how easy it can be to underestimate networkmanagement demands. It also underscores the importance ofintegrated voice-data networks in driving down firmwidetelecommunications costs.  At the same time as they were implementing a new networkingstrategy, McDonald took the opportunity of swapping out itsquote-terminal system for a new one developed with New Yorksystems integrator American Real-Time Services Inc. The ARTSsystem, which handles branchwide distribution and display ofReuters' Marketfeed 2000 digital data feed, replaced some 290 ADPFS One terminals at McDonald and 75 Quotron Q1000 terminals atGradison & Co., a firm based in Cincinnati and owned by McDonald.                          Who's Driving?  The driving forces behind the switch to integrated service wereboth cost and speed. ARTS and McDonald consider the new networkunique because it will carry three types of data simultaneously:voice (eight kilobits/second); hoot 'n' holler (16kilobits/second); and market data in the form of news and quotes(32 kilobits/second). Boris Gettig, vice president of managementinformation systems at McDonald, says that voice-data integrationhas meant savings "on the order of $250,000 per year."  McDonald was using ADP Brokerage Information Systems Group'sterrestrial data network for back-office purposes. The ADP datanetwork is based on analog 9.6 kilobit/second data circuits.McDonald was using half that capacity to receive market data andhalf for back-office traffic.  Using the ADP analog network, a broker in a branch couldconnect to a Tandem Computer Corp. processor in Cleveland andpull up customer accounts, but response time was sluggish: up to17 seconds for a full screen to be painted on a broker'sterminal. Once a broker hit the carriage return to make his orher request, the request data was sent to ADP's data center inMount Laurel, N.J., for processing; on to McDonald's Tandem inCleveland; and then back out to the branch office. The new,higher-speed network was able to cut response time to an averageof five seconds, with some requests taking only from two to threeseconds.                           It's a No-No  "Neither ADP nor Quotron would allow us to stick an arbitraryprotocol on their network," says Gettig. For McDonald's networklink to ADP, the firm had developed a special program running onthe Tandem to convert standard 3270 data into the proprietaryprotocol necessary for transmission to the ADP data center inMount Laurel. Nonetheless, according to Gettig, "The protocolconversion was pretty ragged."  "With our own new network, we have the flexibility of linking aPC LAN into the WAN if we want to," he says, "but [ADP andQuotron] wouldn't allow us to. Essentially, their networks areused for doing quotes, and other securities firms are using thesame lines to get to the same places. They are quote vendors andnot communications vendors. Both Quotron and ADP said we'd haveto encapsulate our protocols within theirs."  AT&T lost out after the analog hoot 'n' holler network cameunder close scrutiny. McDonald was also paying for long-distanceAT&T circuits -- a pair of 9600 baud digital circuits -- for datadelivery to ADP for back-office processing, a system distinctfrom the analog voice network.  The new integrated network configuration will give McDonald "alot of things we never had in past," says Joe Perez, a McDonaldvice president and assistant manager for communications, "likedial backup in case the network goes down. We have total controlof remote loopback testing, and signal gain and loss testing.Before, we were pretty much at the mercy of AT&T to tell uswhether or not the circuit was good, and you know how thatgoes -- if something goes wrong, it turns into a finger-pointingmatch. Now we can do the trouble-shooting and provide thesolution ourselves."  The switch to digital also means better quality for McDonaldusing less bandwidth. The 16 kilobit/second of bandwidth requiredfor compressed voice provides "much better quality with full 64kanalog circuit," according to Perez. "It's super -- that was asurprise to us."  The digital circuits running from the firm's main office inCleveland to the branches are T.1s provided by LitelCommunications Inc. International, a regional long-distanceprovider that will carry traffic at 56 kilobits/second. TheMcDonald segment of the network uses X.25 connections; a packetassembler/disassembler (PAD) in each branch is linked with anInfotron 8020 multiplexer that communicates with another Infotronmux located in the branch.  Gradison, in contrast, is reliant upon TCP/IP and its linkbetween the UNIX-based LAN supporting broker workstations inCincinnati and the Internet Protocol: a Proteon router atGradison in Cincinnati is connected via two 56 kilobit/secondlines to a Proteon router in Cleveland.                        Switch and Cut Bait  At first, McDonald installed four PC-based Level 2 packetswitches, at a cost of just $15,000 each, as the center cloud.The firm bought Netrix X.25 software. But the PC-based packetswitches were too slow to keep up with the UNIX processors in thebranches. As a result, the X.25 connection was cleared, and thebranch users were forced to log on again.  "The whole circuit went down," Gettig says. "It was as bad asgoing up with a pair of cutters and cutting the line. We couldn'tfind the problem, because it was difficult to tell where theclear was coming from."  To solve their problem, McDonald executives invested in Level 3hardware. That doesn't come cheap -- the Infotron Streamline 2550cost McDonald in the neighborhood of $140,000.  McDonald worried the Streamline 2550 might be overkill. But ithas worked well when combined with network-monitoring equipment.Network management personnel at McDonald are now able to seewhere the clears are coming from via a graphical map displayed atheadquarters in Cleveland: they can then run tests to a givenbranch, and Litel can loop back to a different part of the fibercircuit until they are able to isolate the origin of the problem.  "One of the main things we learned was not to try to scrimp onthe cost of the hardware," Gettig says. "We got halfway rolledout -- six or eight branches -- and that thing [the PC-basedsolution] was enough to drive us out of a job. We ended up takinga big hit from the small inexpensive network. Nobody could put adollar value on management and troubleshooting, but those are thethings that gave us sleepless nights. We knew there were problemsbut we couldn't find them."Back to Headline List CopyrightWALL STREET NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJune 19, 1992INTERSTATE/JOHNSON LANE ADDSFUNCTIONS TO VSAT NETWORK  Charlotte, N.C.-based Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. has begun tomigrate its hoot 'n' holler branch application from AT&T landlines to the ADP satellite network the firm has already installedfor market data delivery to more than 62 branches in theSoutheast. The regional broker believes the hoot 'n' holler moveto satellite will save the firm $150,000 per year once it'scompleted this summer.  Interstate has set up three sites to test the ADP network inanticipation of a branch-wide hoot 'n' holler rollout scheduledfor Aug. 1, according to Glenn Mabry, first vice president,telecommunications.  Interstate was the first ADP customer to receive the FS Partnerdata service via very small aperture terminal (VSAT) network, aconversion process that began in October 1991 and was completedthis past February.  Interstate/Johnson Lane was also the first ADP customer to usePersonal Earth Stations from Hughes Network Systems (HNS) as partof Hughes' exclusive agreement with ADP for VSAT networkservices. The ADP contract gives Hughes exclusive rights to theinstallation and maintenance of the earth stations at ADP'sclients.  Metromedia Communications Corp., a long distance vendor basedin East Rutherford, N.J., will remain the primary vendor forInterstate's basic voice service; the firm has no immediate plansto implement video on the network.                        Making the Switch  As part of the firm's switch to a VSAT network, an HNS PersonalEarth Station has been installed at each Interstate branch inNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. A Direct Indoor Unit(DIU) interfaces with the VSAT dish to deliver both the hoot 'n'holler application and FS Partner to the IBM PS/2 servers inplace at Interstate branch offices.  The ADP/Hughes satellite network can support speeds of 512kilobits/second outbound and 128 kilobits/second inbound.Interstate, however, doesn't expect its traffic to exceed 64kilobits/second. The ADP network traffic is downlinked to the HNShub in Spring Creek, N.Y. The company will not be incorporatingits own information with ADP's market data.  In 1989, the Interstate/Johnson Lane network was 100 percentterrestrial, with long distance lines provided primarily by AT&Tand MCI. But I/JL was plagued by what Mabry calls "thevulnerability of land lines" -- mainly downtime and noise on theline. Another factor in its switch to VSAT was speed ofinstallation and/or relocation. With AT&T any change or newinstallation generally took from 60 to 90 days; I/JL is trying tonegotiate a 30-day turnaround time with ADP.  Interstate examined three VSAT options: Avdata Systems inAtlanta; Hughes on its own without ADP; and ADP using Hughes'technology. Despite the cost savings that comes from integratedvoice and data, the four chief criteria for selection, accordingto Mabry, were quality service; guaranteed uptime (with automaticdialup backup); the ability to integrate voice and data; and "theflexibility of relocation or installation."  ADP had both feet in the door. The company had beenInterstate/Johnson Lane's back-office vendor since 1985, and itsmarket data provider since 1986. "We needed to get their serviceinto us in the most efficient way," Mabry says. "They came [tothe VSAT network discussions] as our quote service vendor."Interstate conducted a pilot with ADP and Hughes before makingits final choice.  Interstate is one of several regional firms exploring VSAT forbranch communications. In 1988, before ADP's deal with Hughes,Edward D. Jones & Co., a regional broker based in St. Louis,awarded HNS a $30 million contract for a VSAT network expected toreach more than 2,000 broker sites by the end of this year.Hughes is also installing a 400-node network for A.G. Edwards.Additionally, ADP is in the early stages of a network rolloutwith regional broker J.C. Bradford & Co., based in Nashville.  "They are more receptive to satellite technology," says PradmanKaul, president of Hughes Network Systems, "because they all havethe same requirements: rapid response time, high-qualitytransmission of data, flexibility if they move or install a newoffice, and specialized applications like hoot 'n' holler."Back to Headline List CopyrightWALL STREET NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJune 19, 1992AMID UNCERTAINTY, CTFI BUILDSBACKUP FOR WALL STREET FIRMS  Three years after 14 Wall Street Telecommunications Associationmember firms announced plans to develop a hot site in case of anetwork disaster, no contingency planning facility has beenbuilt, and the vendor selected by the WSTA group has been forcedto market its facility with nothing more than the consortium'sendorsement to show for its winning proposal.  Contingency Trading Facility Inc., based at MetroTech Center inBrooklyn and majority-owned by competitive access providerMetropolitan Fiber Systems Inc., was selected as the "winner" ofthe request for proposal issued by the Disaster Recovery Hot Siteconsortium. The consortium was formed in 1989 by the 14 WSTAmember firms, but now that CTFI has been selected as the hot sitevendor, the group agreed that its work was complete and hasdisbanded. CTFI has won an endorsement with no explicit dollarvalue from a WSTA group that no longer exists.  "The award allowed us the right to go out and market to theWSTA member firms," MFS vice president Kathy Perone says. "But itdid not guarantee any number of seats, or that the 14 WSTA firmswould use the site. We got an endorsement, and we are marketingto all financial firms."  "The [WSTA] group basically looked at their experience withWall Street requirements," says a key member of the Hot Siteconsortium. "We looked at the proposal, and the recommendationwas based on networking flexibility and the location of thefacility. Based on those, CTFI had the wherewithal -- they werebetter than the closest alternative."  At least one member of the Hot Site consortium has committed toa rival that "lost" in the bidding process -- Exchange ResourcesInc. of Minneapolis.  "It was difficult to understand what it is you would win," saysone of the "losers" in the RFP process. "It was extremelynebulous throughout, and we have since found there was nothing tobe won -- nothing to win."  The purpose of the contingency facility is to providealternative network routing and access to market data feeds fortraders should a disaster cripple their own facilities. ThoughMFS is claiming that 55 percent of the seats at the as-yetunbuilt CTFI MetroTech Center contingency site have been sold,Wall Street firms have been required only to put down deposits toreserve seats.  A "shared" seat at the facility costs $4,000 per year; a "semi-shared" seat is $6,000 per year; and a "dedicated seat" is pricedat $11,000 per year. Contracts are for a minimum of three years.Dedicated seats are 100 percent guaranteed under allcircumstances. Sharing guarantees subscribers will have accessto, at worst, a percentage of the seats contracted for: 50percent for semi-dedicated; 25 percent for shared.  CTFI plans to go live before year end. Other than the original14 consortium firms, CTFI principal Jim Loizidez says his companyis in discussions with "another 25 WSTA companies" and that CTFI/MFS are "now prospecting about 75 customers" in all.  "They are actually waiting for the Wall Street community tocome in with some commitments," says the source. "I don't know ifthere are enough to go forward.... I believe we are basically onhold while we wait for the CTFI to formalize commitments."  For $2,000 each, the 14 Hot Site consortium firms were able toformulate requirements for a site that few felt they could affordon their own. But it is also clear that needs have changed in thetime since the Hot Site consortium surveyed WSTA members andfirst disseminated its RFP in October 1991. The RFP was designedto delineate common requirements, but in fact MFS has beendeluged with requests for additional data feeds andcustomization.  Customers are asking for things outside the scope of theoriginal RFP: additional market data services, connections tointernational carriers, access to their long-distanceproviders -- and even storage space and the ability to bringnontrading functions to the CTFI facility.  Ironically, one of the prime beneficiaries of the "endorsement"from the WSTA member firms will be MFS competitor New YorkTelephone, which operates the Securities Industry AutomationNetwork. According to one source, MFS has already ordered some200 lines from New York Tel; MFS has also announced a partneringagreement with NYNEX Computer Services to provide consultingservices for disaster recovery to Wall Street customers. New YorkTel is even involved in designing the CTFI facility.                           The Hot Site  At the Brooklyn Hot Site, CTFI will provide a 60-button V BandCorp. digital turret at each seat, with market data delivered bya Reuters Triarch 2000 data distribution system. CTFI willprovide the Reuters Selectfeed and Telerate TDPF feeds for eachtrader position. Quotron, ADP and Telekurs are under evaluationto provide equities data.  There are plans for five separate trading rooms of 50 seatsapiece at the facility in Brooklyn, each with a Novell local areanetwork connected to a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputer;the VAX will act as feed handler and local controller forincoming and outgoing communications.  Subscribers will also have the option to connect feeds fromtheir back-office operations to traders' temporary stations inBrooklyn via a System Network Architecture (SNA) gateway to theDEC VAX. This allows for the interconnection of the traders'back-office information to the CTFI VAX, accessible fromworkstations.  Individual voice and data lines can be re-routed through thefiber networks of MFS or the Securities Industry AssociationNetwork. According to Perone, MFS can switch the lines from theNew York Telephone Central Office (CO) that feeds the trader "andshoot it into Brooklyn."                          Discount Data  CTFI also has the capability to pre-configure up to fiveadditional data feeds available through Reuters' Triarch 2000."We end up getting it cheaper than the traders' wouldthemselves," Loizides says, "because market data vendors realizethis is a backup site and they are giving us discounted feeds."  Perone says the setup gives CTFI/MFS the ability "to turn themon within 24 hours." The MFS network has direct fiber connectionsfrom the company's midtown and downtown New York locations to theMetroTech Center in Brooklyn.  "The important thing is they are both fiber-optic-basednetworks," Perone says. "That allows us to essentially look at acircuit in two directions. If something happens, you can swingthe broken location to a third location. The Digital Cross-Connect System acts as a controller -- it essentially allows youto take one end of a private line and reconfigure to a thirdlocation, such that traffic would appear to be transmitting overthe normal path. The duplicate services in Brooklyn would lookexactly like the traders are used to."Back to Headline List CopyrightWALL STREET NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJune 19, 1992DOW JONES, NYNEX PURSUE PLANFOR WALL STREET VIDEO SERVICE  Dow Jones and NYNEX aren't about to let the failure of Reuters'TV 2000 in 1990 to stop them from exploring the market for bothstore-and-forward and real-time video programming on Wall Street.In an ambitious test of video over fiber already well into theplanning stages, both companies are trying to surmount thetechnical and programming difficulties inherent in deliveringbroadband services.  The resulting product is expected to allow users of market datato use digitized video in much the same way they use data now. IfDow Jones and NYNEX are successful, users would be able tomonitor, store, and retrieve both real-time video and historicalvideo databases. Digital video with the properties of data couldopen up a new revenue stream for network and market data vendorson Wall Street -- and a new way of monitoring developments in thefinancial world.  For NYNEX, the project is the first thrust into videoprogramming since the restraints of the Modified Final Judgmentwere lifted by an appeals court. For Dow Jones, it means achance to turn a glaring weakness in its Information Servicesoperation -- television programming -- into a presence in videoon Wall Street.                           In the Field  A prototype testing both the NYNEX network and the Dow Jonesprogramming is scheduled to be up and running by the end of theyear; if all goes well, a field test is set for the third quarterof 1993. The operation will be based at Dow Jones headquarters atOne World Financial Center in New York, and at NYNEX's Scienceand Technology Laboratory in White Plains, N.Y. The project willbe managed on the NYNEX side by its Telesector Resources Group(TRG) as part of Dow Jones Television, headed by senior vicepresident Peter Skinner, who reports to Dow Jones president PeterKann.  The test will rely at first on "standard DS-1 connections,"according to Joe DeMauro, director of new product development atTRG. In the near-term, that means deploying the existingdedicated point-to-point facilities of NYNEX Superpath, the 1.2to 256 kilobit/second packet-switching service marketed by NewYork Telephone. With Superpath, users have the capability ofestablishing either permanent or temporary switched virtualcircuits between locations.  DeMauro does expect the pilot will move to the 1.544 megabitISDN Primary Rate Interface -- once Primary Rate ISDN is tariffedby the New York State Public Service Commission. A decision isexpected by July 24 (see story, page 1). Superpath relies ondedicated facilities at two locations; ISDN PRI, by contrast, isa switched connection that can be delivered to anyone with anequivalent facility. ISDN will also allow for an end-to-enddigital connectivity.  These networks will permit VCR-quality broadcasts: a step downfrom broadcast quality, but probably good enough for a first-generation business-to-business broadcast. The good news is thatthe pilot will not suffer from "motion artifacts," the jumpinessthat often plagues video teleconferencing at lower baud rates. Atthe slower data rates, any motion at all makes it look to theviewer as though the signal itself has broken up, and the qualityof the picture is muddy compared to a network broadcast.  The two companies have broken out the project into threepieces: production of the programming; storage and distribution;and delivery of the video service at the customer's premises. DowJones will take care of the video programming piece, while NYNEXwill handle storage and distribution. The line has not yet beenclearly drawn as to how customer premises will be handled -- orby whom. Should the service go commercial, Dow Jones expects thatthird-party business alliance partners will perform theintegration function within the customer's premises -- as theynow do with other data feeds. As yet, no customer sites for theprototype or the pilot have been announced.  "The first step is technological," Peter Skinner says. "We haveto figure out how one transports a video feed over fiber in afashion that allows users to manipulate, store, and recallprogramming the way you do now in an electronic database. We haveto figure out how one digitizes, stores, and retrieves videoinformation."                          Easy Answers?  NYNEX and Dow Jones have the advantage of trying to answerthose questions at a moment when international standards for thetransmission of digital video have stabilized. For store-and-forward video, NYNEX will rely on the groundwork of the MotionPicture Experts Group and its MPEG standard.  For real-time video, DeMauro expects the partners will turn tothe international H.261 CCITT standard for transporting video tocodecs, the compression/decompression devices that are analogousto modems for data. Thus, the test will benefit from standardinterfaces to codecs, and compatibility with the hardware andsoftware of a variety of manufacturers of video teleconferencingproducts and services.  NYNEX has to tread lightly when it comes to issues of content,considering that cable and telephone companies are still barredby federal law (the 1984 Cable Act) from entering the business ofthe other; NYNEX has nicely side-stepped any immediatecontroversy by leaving the programming side to Dow Jones. Thetechnical hurdles pertaining to delivery of video-on-demandservices are nothing compared to the programming issues Dow Joneswill have to conquer to grow the pilot into a commercial service.  Dow Jones failed in its attempts to acquire Financial NewsNetwork Inc. last year when the National Broadcasting Co.absorbed FNN into the CNBC cable channel. Dow Jones may be aninformation powerhouse in most media, but video has limped alongas a weak sibling. All that Dow Jones has to show on thetelevision side under its Dow Jones Television unit is the limpidWall Street Journal Report, a syndicated television show usuallyshown at off-hours over the weekend on just 70 stations. With aweekly magazine format, that half-hour show is broadcast by only17 people total, a staff that also has responsibility to deliversyndicated inserts into the broadcasts of news shows in localmarkets and in Japan.                      Are You Experienced?  This dearth of video experience is daunting, considering thatSkinner is talking about Dow Jones providing everything from"real-time breaking news to analytical, historical, archival, andother programming we haven't thought of."  "We have a lot of ideas about programming," he says. "Part ofour effort is to experiment with various types of programming."Skinner said the "issue is open" as to relying on outsidesuppliers of programming for the pilot. Of course, Dow Jones hasthe option of drawing on the other parts of the company toprovide programming, but then so did Reuters when it came to thedefunct TV 2000.  Exploration and exploitation of a new technology are twodifferent things, and video to date has been a minefield on WallStreet, in large part because programming is a black hole. Don'tbe surprised if Dow Jones and NYNEX fall into the programmingchasm between prototype and pilot. Jumping the technology hurdlescould turn out to be the easy part.Back to Headline List CopyrightWALL STREET NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJune 19, 1992  Telekurs (North America) Inc. has increased the bandwidth of  Telekurs (North America) Inc. has increased the bandwidth ofits Telekurs Ticker Service digital data feed from 19.2kilobits/second to 56 kilobits/second. The increased speed bringsthe Ticker feed up to a level comparable to Reuters' Marketfeed2000 and PC Quote Inc.'s HyperFeed. The move was made because ofa planned expansion of the Ticker's content and "the beginningsof a bandwidth problem," in the words of Steve Williams,Telekurs' product manager for real-time systems.  The seven Regional Bell Operating Companies and threeindependent telcos have endorsed plans for local frame-relay andswitched multi-megabit data services. The RBOCs (Ameritech, BellAtlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Bell, Southwestern BellTelephone, and US WEST) and the independents (Cincinnati Bell,GTE, and Southern New England Telephone) have given their supportto an agreement similar to one already announced by long-distancecarriers AT&T, Sprint, MCI, and BT North America. Frame-relayservice will begin this summer in the Ameritech region, andmulti-megabit transmission will be available on GTE facilities inLos Angeles.  Teleport Communications Group has appointed Charles "Chip"Cleary as vice president of national markets. Cleary will be incharge of selling TCG's local services to telecom carriersnationwide. He had been director of ITT's Communications Servicesdivision, and, most recently, he directed Eastern and Midwesternsales for Metromedia Communications.  Users of Instinet Corp.'s Order Management System have found itcan be used as a continuous crossing network, performing some ofthe same functions as Morgan Stanley & Co.'s MatchPlus PatientTrading system, according to sources at Grantham, Mayo, VanOtterloo & Co., a test site for the system.  If nothing else, the recent Chicago flood has forced anotherround of CAP-think among telephone operating companies. "Thereare two ways to deal with a bear that's in your territory: fightit at all cost or sit down and have dinner," says RichardVanderwoude, president of Central Telephone Co. of Illinois, asubsidiary of Centel. "Demand is growing so it's not a zero-sumgame. You look for that as a saving grace. We can share the piebecause the pie's getting bigger." Some telephone companies --RBOC and independent -- consider that philosophy to be heretical.But Vanderwoude believes the flood will lead "toward multipletypes of services -- two different paths, two different routes.We'll see more and more of that. Customers want it now."Back to Headline List WT03-B14-16IA086-000621-B040-100http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te144.html 205.156.212.5 19970122053508 text/html 69422HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:33:03 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:27 GMTContent-length: 69235Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te144.html Sample Issue Copyright WARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNet February 19, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES * THIS WEEK'S NEWS * SAN DIEGO DEFERS VOTE ON PACIFIC BELL PCS DEPLOYMENT AFTER OPPOSITION (528 words) AMERITECH, BELL ATLANTIC, SBC LAUNCH OUT-OF-REGION LONG DISTANCE DRIVE (1252 words) TOP 10 OUTCOMES OF TELECOM ACT (139 words) COURT TEMPORARILY BARS ENFORCEMENT OF TELECOM ACT'S INDECENCY LAW (751 words) FCC PROPOSES RULES FOR RHCs OFFERING OUT-OF-REGION TOLL SERVICE (260 words) IXCs TO SEEK NICHES AS THEY PREPARE FOR LOCAL, BUNDLED SERVICES BATTLE (726 words) RHCs EXPECTED TO DELAY IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE UNTIL FCC FINISHES CHECKLIST (477 words) JUSTICE DEPT.

Council's 8-1 vote Feb. 12came after sometimes heated meeting at which opponents of GlobalSystem for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology argued thatinterference with hearing aids, pacemakers, wheelchairs andelectronic braking systems required city to study issue furtherbefore voting.  City Attorney John Witt told Council in letter thatnew Telecom Act restricts local govt. role in determining siting ofradio antennas.  Next meeting is March 19.     PB blamed setback on "well-orchestrated" campaign byD.C.-based Wireless Communications Council, headed by Hear-It-Now'sJames Valentine, which opposes wide deployment of GSM technology. "We're disappointed by the Council vote," PB spokesman Lou Savianotold us.  City Planning Commission earlier had approved PB'srequest, but opponents appealed decision to full Council, whichheard testimony but deferred action.  He said city lawyers advisedCouncil that new Telecom Act supersedes local authority over suchissues in deploying national PCS system.     Witt told us Sec. 704 of Telecom Act bans local govt. role inregulating "placement, construction and modification" of PCSfacilities for frequency emissions, provided equipment complieswith FCC rules.  Lawyers for Council challenged legal opinion, andlaw office is continuing to research laws, Witt said.     PB officials said one-month delay in winning approvals won'tderail plans for network deployment, which includes 12 antennasites in city to handle phone calls during convention.  PB paid$695 million for L.A. and San Francisco licenses and is buildingnetwork for Cal., most of Nev. and portion of Ariz.  Company plansrollout of rest of network by year-end.     Opponents of GSM technology, operating as Cal. CommunicationsCouncil and funded by D.C. group, urged City Council to investigatetechnology before approving application.  Saviano describedopposition as "well orchestrated" and said company tried to offsetcampaign with "facts and figures" about technology.  AdvisoryCommission for Persons with Disabilities in Santa Clara Countywrote letter saying GSM phones create interference with assistedlistening devices (ALDs) in public buildings, and use of phonescould deny ALD users access to services.  Council soughtenvironmental impact report study as "only way" to resolve disputeand "protect health and safety."     In related development, Cal. State Architect Div. accesscompliance unit issued letter saying it was preparing statewidepolicy to address hearing aid interference.  Michael Mankin, assoc.architect, said in letter to City Manager Regina Williams: "[Agency] suggests, if possible, that you consider this concernwhen making any decision on the deployment of PCS 1900/GSMtelephones because they undermined the assistive listening devicesrequired in assembly occupancies in the State Building Code." Mankin said office is working with hearing-impaired community todevelop policy.     PB plans to open San Diego network ahead of rest of state toprovide wireless services during political convention, even thoughmost delegates, candidates and media won't have equipment.  Somefrom D.C. could use Sprint Spectrum telephones because GSM systemhas been operating here since last year.  Phone can make all longdistance calls but won't operate outside 1.9 GHz territory.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996AMERITECH, BELL ATLANTIC, SBC LAUNCH OUT-OF-REGION LONG DISTANCEDRIVE     Bell Atlantic (BA) and SBC Communications jumped quickly intoout-of-region long distance service last week, filing applicationsin 18 states and D.C. to resell services under brand name.  At sametime, Ameritech unveiled aggressive plans for in-region longdistance and signed agreement with WorldTel to carry long distancecalls to cities outside region.  RHCs were first to enterout-region business, with other companies expected to discloseplans soon.  IXCs also began seeking state approval to deliverlocal services.     BA became first RHC to seek long distance authority outsideterritory, filing applications Feb. 13 in Fla., Ill., N.C., S.C.and Tex. just 3 days after Telecom Act freed RHCs to operate in newregions.  SBC followed 2 days later with more extensive filing in16 states and D.C., and in twist said it will use alreadyestablished Cellular One wireless brand name as vehicle for sellingwireline services to existing and new customers.  BA and SBC filedseparate applications in Ill., and SBC plans include many states inBA's territory.     BA Communications Pres. Al Binford said 5 states representedprime opportunities for company as it begins building nationwideservice.  It could be offered on resale basis by end of 2ndquarter, he said.  "These states are important states," he told us. BA plans to seek resale agreements with facilities-based carriersin 5 states after winning state approval, Binford said.  Other RHCshaven't indicated plans for filing in states.     Company pledged last week to move quickly on state front,saying it would submit applications within 5 days to provideservice in 5 states unidentified until Tues.  Binford said eachstate represented significant opportunity for BA to provide servicefor its existing customers, such as travelers to Disney World inFla.  Proximity of Carolinas to BA's territory, coupled withexisting cellular interests in those 2 states, will enhance BAbrand name in region, he said.  BA also is part of PCS partnershipthat has licenses in Tex. and Ill. in addition to other markets.     Eventually, company plans to have nationwide presence aimingat targeted audiences rather than all customers, using mix ofadvertising, including newspapers, Binford said.  He said first 5states were "attractive," with large amounts of long distancecalling already in place.  He didn't provide details on timetablefor introducing service in other states.     BellSouth (BS), which provides service in 3 of 5 states,welcomed potential competition from neighboring company, saying BAchoice demonstrated "attractive" nature of Southeast for business. "We anticipate and expect to have a number of competitors in allour markets," spokesman Tim Klein said.  BS has strategy formeeting competition, he said, and has developed "very aggressive"plan to meet checklist conditions for providing long distanceservice in its own 7-state territory.  He said company expects tomeet checklist targets first in Fla., entering market as early asyear-end or early 1997.     BA has said it expects to seek FCC and state approvals tooffer long distance service in its own territory as soon as rulesare established.  Its quick response to Telecom Act signals itsintention to provide long distance services quickly outside regionwhile concentrating on in-region checklist, officials said.  OtherRHCs have sketched out brief details of service offerings, mostbeginning by providing long distance to cellular customers. Ameritech unveiled plans for in-region service but will carryout-of-region calls through LDDS WorldCom.          SBC Uses Cellular One Brand for Long Distance     SBC Communications said it expected applications to be filedby early this week, with regulatory approvals in 2-3 months. States generally are in Northeast and Upper Midwest, with furtherplans still undisclosed, official said.  SBC plan relies on brandname recognition of Cellular One, which has been in existence insome states for decade.  SBC official said market had sufficientroom for numerous competitors.     SBC targeted BA territory of Del., D.C., Md., Va. and W.Va.and plans to seek approval in Conn., Ill., Ind., La., Me., Mass.,Miss., N.H., N.Y., R.I. and Vt.  "We're building on our out-regionbase," Chmn.-CEO Edward Whitacre said.  States either are adjacentto SBC's 5-state territory or to Cellular One network.  Officialsaid company has tested Cellular One brand recognition and doesn'texpect obstacles in offering wireline services.  In competitionwith BA, SBC official said Cellular One brand has high namerecognition in all 16 states and BA lacks presence or namerecognition in at least 3 of its 5 launch states.  Spokesman DaveSenay said:  "Competition will be nothing new for SBC or BellAtlantic."  In Md., for example, Cellular One and Bell AtlanticNynex Mobile are 2 cellular providers.     SBC began offering long distance to cellular customers onCellular One and Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems (SBMS) as soon asPresident Clinton signed Telecom Act.  Stanley Sigman, pres.-CEO ofSBMS unit that oversees Cellular One, said company expectscustomers to select one company for local, cellular and longdistance.  "We'll build on the customer relationships and brandrecognition that characterize Cellular One," he said.  Goal is toprovide bundled services for all customers.     In separate announcement, Teleport Communications Group (TCG)unveiled plans for its Md. operation, saying it will invest $20million in Baltimore by year-end, with $100 million more in nextseveral years.  TCG Md. Pres. Larry Bugden said company will add200 employees to Baltimore operation, with 500 jobs created overnext 5 years by company or subcontractors.  "This is a best stepfor us in the Baltimore market," he said.  "We can now capitalizeon the technological capability we already have in place."                    IXCs Begin Local Filings     LCI International and AT&T filed at Fla. PSC to provide localservice.  LCI already has approvals from Ill., N.Y., Tex.  It saidapplications also are pending in Cal., Md., Mich.  Douglas Kinkoph,PSC dir.-regulatory affairs, said Fla. is one of several states"ripe" for entry because of promising markets and favorableregulations.  AT&T said it would provide service for business andresidential customers in state, depending on negotiations with LECsthere, including BellSouth, GTE, Sprint/United Telephone.  AT&Tdisclosed plans to begin offering service by resale agreements withincumbent carriers, although Chmn.-CEO Robert Allen said companycould build own facilities in some areas.                 Ameritech Targets In-State Goal     Ameritech expects to offer in-region landline long distance in9 to 13 months, with strongest start in Ill. and Mich., CEO RichardNotebaert said.  Statement came in news conference unveiling longdistance cellular service, to be offered over long distance networkthat company has built throughout its 5-state region, he said. Ameritech wouldn't provide details on cost of digital, fiber SONETnetwork or its capacity, but Notebaert said it would be enough forcellular service.     Efforts have focused in Chicago and Grand Rapids becausethat's where Ameritech had Justice Dept. (DoJ) waiver to offer longdistance service, company said.  But landline service in all itsregion will be available in at most 13 months, pending regulatoryapprovals, Ameritech said.  Notebaert said adding long distancecapability to local network was not "significant" cost. Announcement also marked another plum for LDDS WorldCom, which willprovide out-of-region long distance service for Ameritechcustomers, companies said.     Notebaert declined to reveal how much of long distance marketAmeritech hopes to get.  Company spent much of news conferencetouting cellular long distance, saying it would be priced at 16-24cents per min., 10-35% less than long distance carriers.  Ameritechsaid it had signed up 126,000 cellular customers in 36 hours sinceservice began.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996TOP 10 OUTCOMES OF TELECOM ACT     List prepared by consulting firm A.T. Kearney envisions moreRHC acquisitions and entertainment-telecom conglomerates as resultof Telecom Act.  According to Kearney, new law will: 1. Force consolidations among interexchange carriers and RHCs. 2. Give wireless carriers competitive advantage over wirelinecarriers. 3. Push state regulators to open local loop to competition. 4. Open debate on definition of universal service, includingaccess to information services. 5. Turn state regulators into implementers of federal policy. 6. Postpone rate relief for cable systems until 1999, making cable"vulnerable" to competitors. 7. Enhance power of broadcast networks by increasingcross-ownership opportunities. 8. Set stage for TV licensees to acquire advanced TV spectrum. 9. Foster growth of Internet.10. Pave way for few $100-billion conglomerates to dominate worldmarket in communications, information, entertainment.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996COURT TEMPORARILY BARS ENFORCEMENT OF TELECOM ACT'S INDECENCY LAW     Despite Justice Dept.'s defense of new law, federal judge inPhiladelphia issued temporary restraining order Feb. 15 barringgovt. from enforcing controversial Internet indecency provision ofTelecom Act while case is before court.  Provision, known asCommunications Decency Act (CDA), prohibits making indecentmaterial available to minors over Internet.  ACLU and 19 othergroups have challenged provision on basis that law is too broad andwill chill speech on Internet.     U.S. Dist. Judge Ronald Buckwalter appeared to endorse pointsmade by both sides in memo accompanying his order.  Buckwalter saidCongress has "compelling interest" in protecting minors and "atleast from the evidence before me, plaintiffs have not convinced methat Congress has failed to narrowly tailor the CDA."  However, healso said ACLU and others raised "serious, substantial, difficultand doubtful questions" about whether CDA's use of word "indecent"is "unconstitutionally vague."     Buckwalter issued order several hours after DoJ filed brieftelling court there's no need for such action.  In 60-page brief,Justice said that ACLU and 19 co-plaintiffs haven't metextraordinary burdens necessary to block enforcement of new law. Buckwalter's decision clears way for 3-judge federal panel --composed of Buckwalter, Dist. Judge Stuart Dalzell and DoloresSloviter, chief judge of 3rd U.S. Appeals Court, Philadelphia -- toconsider merits of CDA.     In related activity, Sen. Leahy (D-Vt.) said that he hasprivate support of senators for repeal of law, but that chances arepublic support won't materialize.  And 6th U.S. Appeals Court,Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of pornographic computerbulletin board operator in Cal. under Tenn. community standards,where material from board was downloaded.                 DoJ Questions ACLU Conclusions     Justice brief frequently focused on argument that ACLU hadn'tmet burden of proof at this stage of case, saying that conclusionsbrought by challengers to law haven't been proved sufficiently towarrant declaring law unconstitutional and because there's no proofof irreparable injury should law be allowed to take effect.  DoJsaid:  "Plaintiffs fail to show a realistic threat of suppressionof their speech."  Claims that free speech on Internet would behurt by new law are "wholly speculative," DoJ said, contending thatACLU based claims of harm on nothing more than "their own academicreading of the statute."  Justice said there was ample evidence ofpornographic material on Internet and amount is growing, "farexceeding anything available prior to the advent of on-linecomputer services."  It was concern over that availability that ledto passage of law, Justice contended.     ACLU argument that indecency portions of law are too vague flyin face of several years of court decisions, Justice said, notingthat cases involving broadcast language and dial-a-porn touched onmany of same topics.  Congress in passing law "neither purported toban, nor effectively ban, on-line indecency in all its variousforms," as ACLU contended, DoJ said.  "Those who create or 'post'indecent images or texts in cyberspace are on notice that they arefree to do so, so long as they have taken reasonable andappropriate measures to block access to children effectively."      DoJ concluded that Congress knew what it was doing when itpassed Telecom Act, based on extensive record including floorspeeches and hearings.  But one senator, Leahy, said at Washingtonnews conference same day that many in Congress don't understandtechnology.  He was pessimistic that legislation (S-1567) heintroduced with Sen. Feingold (D-Wis.) would get very far.  Whilesenators privately agree with him on merits of repeal, they'reafraid of 30-sec. attack ads portraying them as proponents ofpornography, Leahy said, adding that he was worried lawmakers areafraid to stand up for First Amendment.  Leahy said "chillingeffect" on Internet speech already has emerged, citing case ofAmerica Online, which threw off its system Vt. subscriber for usingword "breast."  She was discussing her cancer, Leahy said. Americans shouldn't be too quick to criticize Chinese for theirattempts to censor Internet, he said, because much same thing ishappening here.     Meanwhile, in separate case with similar implications, 6thU.S. Appeals Court, Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators ofCal.-based Amateur Action Bulletin Board.  That case dealt withobscenity, which is illegal, as opposed to indecent material, onwhich there's great difference of opinion.  Attorneys for Robertand Carleen Thomas argued that community standards for obscenity inCal. were different from those in Tenn., where postal inspectordownloaded material from Thomas's service.  Thomases were convicted2 years ago in U.S. Dist. Court, Memphis, of violating obscenitystatutes.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996FCC PROPOSES RULES FOR RHCs OFFERING OUT-OF-REGION TOLL SERVICE     In most significant response so far to Telecom Act, FCC openedrulemaking Feb. 14 that proposes giving nondominant regulatorystatus to RHC affiliates offering out-of-region long distanceservice.  As nondominant carriers, RHC affiliates could beginoffering service almost immediately upon filing their tariffs. Commission also proposed that if RHCs offer such out-of-regionservice directly, rather than through affiliates, they should beregulated as dominant carriers.     To be classified as nondominant, RHC affiliate would have tomeet separation conditions outlined in 1985 Competitive CarrierOrder.  Affiliate would have to:  (1) Maintain separate accountingbooks.  (2) Have no joint ownership of transmission or switchingfacilities with RHC's LEC.  (3) Obtain all RHC exchange companyservices at tariffed rates and conditions.  FCC noted thatindependent LECs are classified as nondominant in long distancemarket and operate under same rules.     Commission asked for comments on tentative conclusion and saidparties that disagree with plan should offer alternative regulatorypolicies.  Action is required by fact that Telecom Act eliminatesMFJ ban on telcos' offering interLATA service.  Nondominantclassification is given to carriers that don't have enough marketpower to engage in anticompetitive conduct.     In notice of proposed rulemaking, Commission said it wants to"permit efficient and rapid entry" by RHCs but at same time "wealso seek to ensure that sufficient regulatory safeguards are inplace to prevent a BOC from gaining any unfair competitiveadvantage."     Nynex praised FCC plan, Federal Regulatory Affairs Vp DonEvans saying action "brings Nynex one step closer to offering longdistance telephone users greater choice."Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996IXCs TO SEEK NICHES AS THEY PREPARE FOR LOCAL, BUNDLED SERVICESBATTLE     Second-tier IXCs, like Big 3 counterparts, will accelerateofferings of local and bundled services as result of passage ofTelecom Act, they said last week.  LDDS WorldCom and Frontier,which rank 4th and 5th among IXCs, said they will target largestbusiness customers, taking on RHCs, AT&T, MCI and Sprint in shortrun.  No. 6 LCI International said it will seek broader market,including residential, small, medium and large businesses.  Cable& Wireless targeted 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500.  Allsaid they are interested in offering full range of telecom servicesand at this stage won't rule out any service or market.     With own fiber network, LDDS WorldCom will aim for customersdoing at least $500 per month in business, spokesman Gil Broylessaid, and existing customer base will be important.  LDDS filed inIll., Mich. and Tex. to enter local market, but he wouldn'tidentify first launch state.  He said important factor will be howLECs set rates for resale capacity.  It also will look at howstates set guidelines to create attractive rates, spokesman said. "That's the kind of the next thing that needs to be done," Broylessaid.  LDDS is providing interLATA service for resale toSouthwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Ameritech, GTE.  Talks are"continuing" with another unidentified LEC, he said.     Frontier, with $2.1 billion in 1995 revenue, will compete"door-to-door" with Big 3 to offer bundled services to Fortune 500companies, Vp John Purcell said.  "We've got real blood to show"for combat already, he said.  Frontier jumped to No. 5 rankingafter buying ALC last year and combined companies provide longdistance, local and wireless services to more than 2 millioncustomers.  Purcell said Telecom Act's requirement for LECs to showcompetition before entering long distance created incentive forNynex to negotiate favorable rates with Frontier on bundlingservices.  He declined to specify where Frontier's next localservices might appear.  However, among 120 sales offices in U.S.,2/3 are in "opportune" markets for bundled offerings, Purcell said,and about 40 offices are in regions with regulatory barriers.     LCI International is likely to pursue broader market,including residential and business customers of all kinds, andimprove on its $693 million annual revenue, Regulatory Affairs Dir.Douglas Kinkoph said.  LCI's 200% growth in residential revenueprompted interest in developing market, he said.  LCI's longdistance marketing, based on what he said were "simple, fair andinexpensive" services, will be thrust of local offerings, he said. LCI now offers flat-rate calling plans and 6-sec. billing option,unlike competitors, Kinkoph said.  Unlike AT&T, LCI doesn't foreseebuilding its own facilities to provide local service, he said.     LCI provides Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile with long distanceservice that regional cellular carrier resells to its 3 millioncustomers.  LCI currently doesn't offer any form of local service,Kinkoph said.  "No state today is ready to accept local service." Spokeswoman Gerry Simone said company is eager for states to setdiscount rates.  "Until we know what our price is, we don't knowwhat our products will be," she said.  In anticipation of stateaction, LCI filed at Fla. PSC Feb. 15 to provide local service. Kinkoph said Fla. is one of several states "ripe" for entry,regardless of Telecom Act, because of promising markets andfavorable local regulations.  However, Simone said, should pricingprove unsatisfactory, LCI also sees options, such as cable, thatcould preclude entry into local voice services.  LCI has approvalsfrom Ill., N.Y. and Tex., with applications pending in Cal., Md.,Mich.     Cable & Wireless (C&W) will carve niche by offering bundledservices to 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500, company said. C&W has approvals from Conn. and N.Y. and has filed applications inCal., Ill. and Tex. to provide local service, company said. Official offered rankings for C&W's best opportunities:  (1) N.Y. (2) Conn.  (3) Cal., Ill., Tex. tied.  Company launched UniLinkbundled local-long distance in N.Y.C. area.  Official said companytargeted Conn. for greatest investment to offer local services tobusinesses.  Conn. PSC recently set Southern New England Telephone(SNET) resale discounts at 20%-50%, which official said willtrigger aggressive competition.  State granted C&W LEC status,making company first IXC to buy from SNET.  In Tex., C&W will limitits resale relationship with Southwestern Bell, citingdissatisfaction with discount rates and "not very attractive"economics, official said.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996RHCs EXPECTED TO DELAY IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE UNTIL FCC FINISHESCHECKLIST     FCC Chmn. Hundt said talks with RHC executives indicate theywon't apply for in-region long distance service until Commissionfinishes writing rules for checklist that RHCs must pass, processthat could take about 180 days.  He made comment at Feb. 12 newsconference at which FCC released "task list" of 80 rulemakingsrequired by Telecom Act of 1996 (see pullout feature in thisissue).  List outlines which bureaus will handle various items andwhat deadlines they face, most of them in 1996.  Hundt saidCommission hopes to beat deadlines wherever possible.     Hundt said FCC is excited about opportunities presented byAct:  "All along we've wanted the chance to write rules that go toa competitive market.  Our reach for competition no longer exceedsour grasp."  Move toward competition means that "in thecommunications sector, the era of big government is over," he said. Two key goals, he said, are to promote competition rather thanindividual competitors and to protect "the public interestforever."     Asked how FCC will get work done without budget increase ithad sought, Hundt said it will continue urging Hill to provide moremoney but "at the same time, we're hitting the ground running." Asked how Commission will get routine work done while itconcentrates on implementation, he said "one answer is, don't tryto do everything the same old way.  We're going to need ideas."     FCC Wireless Bureau met with industry and public interestrepresentatives day later to discuss ways to make filing processesmore efficient in light of tight deadlines.  Bureau asked partiesto submit short filings, not seek unnecessary meetings and focus onproceedings with most immediate deadlines, rather than submittinginformation for proceedings that are farther down road.  "Don'tgive us the rhetoric and don't paper us to death," FCC Chief ofStaff Blair Levin said.  Industry also can help by developing datathat agency needs to make decisions, bureau staffers said.  BureauChief Michele Farquhar said Bureau in turn will help public byusing new home page on Internet for updates on progress.     Hundt said other bureaus may hold similar meetings, andCommission also is considering actions such as page limitations,open forums where agency staff can question parties more directly,joint filings when several parties have same view.  As expected,open video systems proceeding has been moved to Cable Bureau fromCommon Carrier Bureau to spread workload.  "Our intent is to haveall the bureaus challenged but not overwhelmed," Hundt said.     Meanwhile, FCC has received first filing under new Act --application by CSW Communications, affiliate of utility companyCentral & South West Corp., to be classified as "exempttelecommunications company."  Classification would mean it's bonafide communications company and thus exempt from Public UtilityHolding Company Act restrictions on offering telecom services. Office of Gen. Counsel has 60 days to make determination.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996JUSTICE DEPT. SAYS TELCO-CABLE BAN CASE IS MOOT BECAUSE OF TELECOMACT     Passage of Telecom Act makes moot U.S. Supreme Court casetesting constitutionality of telco-cable cross-ownership ban, U.S.Justice Dept. said in court filing.  However, Bell Atlantic (BA)argued that case isn't moot because, despite legislation, banremains in effect for at least 6 months while FCC sets rules fortelco entry into cable.     Telecom Act means there's no limit on telcos' building cablesystems in their service areas, Justice Dept. said, although itacknowledged that Act includes some restrictions such as 10%maximum ownership of incumbent cable operators.  However, Justicesaid limits in Act aren't before Court and haven't been tried atlower levels, so Supreme Court shouldn't consider them, andcross-ownership case remains moot.  Brief urged court to vacateU.S. Appeals Court, Alexandria, Va., decision and order lower courtto dismiss case.     "Sweeping" Telecom Act means that, "at a minimum, thelegislation has been sufficiently altered so as to present asubstantially different controversy than the one the lower courtsoriginally decided," Justice said.  "Even if the new legislationdoes burden the LECs operating open video systems to a modestdegree... it surely does not burden them in the same fundamentalway" as was argued in appeal and "it would not be appropriate forthis court... to review the constitutionality of the new law, whichhas not been the subject of briefing and argument."     Telecom Act "does not moot this case," BA contended, becauseit "substitutes new provisions that keep in place, for at least 6months, the prohibition on a telephone company's provision of videoprogramming."  It said Act allows telco open video systems only ifthey comply with FCC rules, and "no such rules exist today."  Actgives FCC 6 months to establish rules and BA said "absence ofregulations in the interim translates into a continuation of theflat prohibition on speech."     "Far from mooting the controversy, the Act perpetuates thecontroversy," BA said.  "It does no more than require the FCC, atsome point in the future, to take regulatory action that might thenmoot this case."  Prolonging ban "will produce irreparable injury"to telcos, BA said, and there's no major burden on Supreme Court toissue decision, since case has been briefed, argued and Court hasdeliberated on it.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S TELECOM REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetFebruary 19, 1996SCHEDULE OF FCC'S TELECOM ACT RULEMAKINGSFEBRUARY 1996-- Order streamlining amateur radio rules -- Wireless Bureau (WB)MARCH 1996-- Creation of Federal-State Joint Board for universal service --Common Carrier Bureau (CCB)-- NPRMs for universal service accounting safeguards, exemptcarriers, service area definitions -- CCB-- NPRM on Open Video Systems -- Cable Bureau (Cable)-- Order revoking VDT reporting requirements -- Cable-- NPRM on safeguards for RHC joint marketing of mobile and localservices -- WB-- Order on intelligent network interconnection -- CCB-- NPRM on interexchange carrier proceeding to assure fair rates inrural areas -- CCB-- Amendment to Network Reliability Council charter to give FCCoversight in network planning -- WB-- Notice of inquiry on market entry barriers -- Office ofCommunications Business Opportunities (OCBO)-- Notice eliminating Sec. 214 rules for cable-telco buyouts --Cable-- NPRM to develop dispute resolution process for manufacturingstandards -- Gen.

Ameritech sought waivers as part of its Customers First plan. Waivers will allow company to:  (1) Bulk-bill portions of itsaccess charges rather than bill on per-min. basis.  (2)Geographically deaverage one type of access charge called transportinterconnection charge (TIC).  FCC said Ameritech can reduce TIC incompetitive areas but can't raise it in other areas to compensate. Actions are expected to result in overall reduction of Ameritechaccess charges, possibly in neighborhood of "tens of millions ofdollars," FCC staff member said.  Commission stopped short ofgranting full pricing flexibility sought by Ameritech, saying itwould address that issue in future order.  Although action is aimedat giving Ameritech more flexibility when it faces competition,rivals say it's premature.  Heather Gold, exec. dir. of Assn. forLocal Telecommunications Services (ALTS), said she's "outraged" bydecision because it lets Ameritech undercut competitors.  She saidthat, while Grand Rapids LATA covers about 25% of Mich., Ameritechcould lower access rates selectively only in metropolitan GrandRapids, where there's competition from Brooks Fiber.  Action "setsa bad precedent by inhibiting competition just one week after thesigning of a bill which has the purpose of encouragingcompetition," Gold said.  FCC Comr.

He said that will"relieve this court of its stewardship of that industry [telephonesegment of telecom] which, in a sense, it had exercised sincecompetition was introduced by the judicially ordered breakup ofAT&T."  But Greene said in brief order that his relief "ismitigated only by a single concern:  That under the bill justenacted it could turn out that sufficient safeguards do not existto prevent domination in the future of the vital informationindustry by a few large providers."  He said that if that were tocome about through mergers, acquisitions or other deals, it notonly would have detrimental effect on consumers but also could"enable a few giant companies (or perhaps even individuals) todominate what is rapidly becoming the central factor of Americanlife -- the control of the dissemination of information in its manyforms."  "Evils of monopoly would be magnified by domination of thekey information industry by one or a few corporations," he said.

Dole hascited problems with a provision that he perceives as a multi-billiondollar spectrum giveaway.  However, sources close to the negotiationsspeculated last week that Dole's real concern may lie with theconference committee's decision to strike language abolishingrate-of-return regulation.     SBC Communications Inc., which serves Dole's home state ofKansas, particularly is concerned about striking that language, thesources said, and could be the real reason for the delay.     A spokesman for SBC denied the charge.  An alternate form ofprice regulation is already in place in Kansas.     John Schneidawind, a spokesman for the Alliance for CompetitiveCommunications (ACC), which represents the seven regional holdingcompanies (RHCs), called the allegations "bunk."     Larry Clinton, associate vice president of government relationsfor the U.S. Telephone Association (USTA), said that he was "99percent confident that the Bells are together.  Do they want greaterpricing flexibility?  Sure.  Do they want to hold the bill up overthis?  I don't think so," he said.    ...Dole's Concerns     But a Dec. 7 letter that Dole sent to House Speaker Newt Gingrich(R-Ga.) warning that any progress made on telecom legislation could be"compromised" if telecom conferees "continue to consider regulatorysolutions that are clearly outside the scope of either bill" (WTN,12/11/95,), seems to provide evidence that the majority leader isharboring some serious concerns not associated with the spectrumflexibility provisions.      "Whether it is moving backwards on regulation of phone rates,expanding the House provision on facilities-based competition, orweakening my forbearance provisions to get useless regulations, it isall counter productive," Dole wrote.       A Dole spokesman said he could not comment beyond what themajority leader said during a recent press conference, that, "thereare three, four, or five provisions including spectrum giveaway" thatare still of concern.      Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking member of the House CommerceCommittee, told sister publication Communications Today that there are"honest problems [with the conference report] that are more politicalthan substantive."  He said many members are "unhappy" with thereport.  However, he was unsure how many members were involved, howunhappy they were, and whether they were unhappy enough not to sign aconference report.  ...How Can Spectrum Flexibility Be Resolved?     The budget reconciliation agreement currently being negotiated onCapitol Hill will be Dole's recourse to resolve the spectrumflexibility issue, sources said.  A plan put forward by PresidentClinton to speed up the transition to digital TV has been shot down bybudget negotiators, but Dole may try and push to auction off thespectrum.  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-S.D.)floated a similar plan in the early stages of the budgetreconciliation process, but it received a hostile reception by thebroadcasters and was killed.            Neither speeding up the transition to digital TV nor auctioningoff the additional 6 MHz needed for the transition would beacceptable, sources said.  By auctioning off the spectrum, Congress inessence would be making a public policy decision that it did not wantdigital TV, the sources added.      The budget reconciliation issue will need to be resolved beforethe telecommunications conference agreement is brought to the floor,several Hill sources said.  Also, until Dole's concerns are resolved,the House leadership refuses to circulate the conference report forsignature.  Back to Headline List CopyrightWASHINGTON TELECOM NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996SHUTDOWN CONTINUES TO DELAY FCC ACTIONS, BUT AUCTIONS CONTINUE     The planned Jan. 18 FCC meeting is "imperilled if we do not goback to work soon," FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told sister publicationCommunications Today last week.  The first day the FCC is open afterthe current federal budget impasse ends, Hundt plans to meet with theother commissioners to see if there are issues they can agree toaddress on that date or soon after.     It usually takes three weeks to put a commission meetingtogether, but commissioners could agree that there is something theywant to accomplish and schedule a meeting more quickly upon theirreturn, Hundt said.      Asked what FCC work is being delayed by the shutdown, Hundt notedthat not only are "thousands of complaints, petitions, andapplications...not being filed," many proceedings are not beingaddressed.  Although actions opening proceedings on access chargereform and advanced TV policies have been discussed as possible agendaitems for the Jan. 18 meeting, Hundt said that he does not set theagenda items until three weeks before the meeting.   ...Shutdown Affects Workgroup Participation     Michele Farquhar, chief of the Wireless TelecommunicationsBureau, who made a brief appearance with Hundt at last week's HearingAid Compatibility and Access to Digital Wireless TelecommunicationsSummit, said that neither she nor other FCC officials couldparticipate in the summit's workgroups because of the governmentshutdown.  The only thing Farquhar has received is emergency federalworker status to continue overseeing FCC auctions.       All three ongoing commission auctions started up again last weekafter a holiday hiatus.  These include the C-block personalcommunications service auctions and the smaller specialized mobileradio service and multipoint distribution service auctions.     But the shutdown still burdens many segments of the wirelessindustry awaiting actions in non-auction matters.  Farquhar said thatthe bureau typically receives 3,000 license applications a day.  Theseapplications cannot be filed because of the shutdown.  Hundt said thatthe upcoming Jan. 24 auctions of two direct broadcast satelliteconstruction permits will not be affected by the shutdown.  He notedthat Congress and the administration realize it would be "unacceptablyfoolish" when the impasse is over the budget deficit to keep theagency from bringing in money to reduce that deficit.  Back to Headline List CopyrightWASHINGTON TELECOM NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996HUNDT:  INDUSTRY SHOULD SOLVE HEARING AID PROBLEMS     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told a wireless industry and consumergathering last week that the commission does not plan to mandatehearing-aid compatibility standards for the wireless telecom industry. But he indicated that the agency stands ready to bite down with itsregulatory "teeth" if the digital wireless communications industrydoes not try to provide access to America's 28 millionhearing-impaired consumers.  Pulse tones created by some digitalwireless technologies are claimed to interfere with hearings devicesused by many people.     Opening the two-day Hearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibilityto Digital Wireless Telecommunications Summit, Hundt expressed regretthat FCC staff could not participate because of the governmentshutdown.  The summit--organized by the Cellular TelecommunicationsIndustry Association (CTIA), the Personal Communications IndustryAssociation (PCIA), the PCS 1900 Group, and consumer and manufacturinginterests--is bringing industry and consumer interests together todiscuss interference and compatibility problems for hearing-aid usersin the rapidly changing world of wireless technology.  ...Encouraging Compromises and Practical Solutions     Hundt encouraged summit participants to find compromises andpractical solutions.  He noted that wireless industry leaders haveassured the FCC that they will work with hearing-impaired consumers toaddress their concerns.  With many new wireless technologies coming tomarket, the possibility of compatibility problems will continue toarise, he noted.       Hundt also emphasized the need for the cooperative processescreated at the summit to continue.  These include "identifyingcompatibility problems as soon as they are spotted" and "trying tounderstand the technology and the problems" rather than engaging inwars of rhetoric.     He assured industry that the FCC is "not going to mandatesolutions" and "lock in the status quo."  But "we are not going to saythat the marketplace will resolve all compatibility problems."     CTIA President and CEO Thomas Wheeler said that the OklahomaUniversity Center for the Study of Electromagnetic Compatibility,which CTIA helped organize, should release on Jan. 15 the first roundof human factor results from its research to quantify interferenceproblems and isolate their causes.  CTIA also is using AmericanPersonal Communication's digital system to test "bystanderinterference"--the ability of a digital wireless phone to affect thehearing aid of a nearby person not using that phone.  The completionof this project is now projected for Feb. 15.     Wheeler noted that the CDMA Development Group last monthannounced a technical standard that provides a hearing-aid wearer withthe capability to turn off the component of CDMA (code divisionmultiple access) technology claimed to be a source of interference. "We are confident that the work of the EMC Center, which includes alldigital technologies: CDMA, PCS-1900 [the American version of theEuropean global systems for mobile communications standard], TDMA[time-division multiple access], and IDEN [integrated dispatchenhanced network]--will be able to identify other such solutions foruse with all technologies," he said.     ...A Running Start Toward Accessible Communications Technology     The American Academy of Audiologists expressed hope that "thesummit meeting will provide a `running start' toward making 21stcentury communications technology accessible to all citizens.  Themeeting also will help to clarify the parameters for appropriateregulation of wireless communications by the FCC."       PCIA President Jay Kitchen praised the summit for bringing thevarious interests "together to work in concert in a proactive, open,and cooperative fashion with all the right technical expertise and aresults-oriented process in place."  Back to Headline List CopyrightWASHINGTON TELECOM NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION     Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage hasbeen fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses wasscheduled to resume at our deadline.     According to sister publication PCS Week, the top markets havebeen the scene of the most furious activity.  For example, Washington,D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a first round high bid of $11.3 millionfor the Chicago basic trading area (BTA), only to have the lead takenby GWI PCS Inc. in round two for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. thenupped the ante to $61.4 million in round three.  Round four saw DCRtake another shot at the lucrative Chicago license with a bid of $70.3million, or $8.59 per potential subscriber in the market.  Severalother markets, such as Miami and New York, have seen similar activity.     High bids for round four included $203 million for New York byPCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million forPhiladelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc.; $48.75 millionfor San Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license byPCS 2000.  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction     In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchersand participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. "It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are somany changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst atMalarkey-Taylor Associates/Economic and Management ConsultantsInternational Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at theend of [the auction, the environment] looks different than when itstarted."     Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst forWashington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was notreading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I thinkthere's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lotgreater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent thatcompanies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auctionenvironment and that there are many bidders that are not quite assophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."     Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top marketsmay cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined notto come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some ofthese companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said.   ...What Is PCS 2000?     Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has beenthe aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-basedpartnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry eversince it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of roundfour, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of theEastern United States.       PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partnersdeveloped and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and25 percent owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that wasincorporated for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four yearsago," said Javier Lamoso, company president.     According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limitedpartnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investmentcompanies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[Theinvestors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners ownsmore than 3 percent of the company.     Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he didnot want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players. He explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets itwants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "IfI tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCChas interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want toavoid any hint of implied collusion."Back to Headline List CopyrightWASHINGTON TELECOM NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996TELECOM BILL RATED ONE OF TOP SWEETHEART DEALS IN 1995     The Center for Responsive Politics rated the telecommunicationsreform effort as one of the 54 "special deals" where campaigncontributors succeeded in lobbying legislation on Capitol Hill.  InCashing In From A To Z, authors Nancy Watzman and James Youngclauscite the telecommunications bill as mostly an "inside deal" that wasfought out by industry players such as the large long-distancecarriers and the regional holding companies.  "The tone was set earlyin the session when Republican members of the House Commerce Committeeheld a series of private dinners with CEOs of major communicationscompanies," the report said.       The report also noted that the telecommunications industry poured$2.7 million into the campaign coffers of House and Senate membersduring the first half of this year.  Republicans received 75 percentof that amount, according to the report.  Sen. Larry Pressler(R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, received the mostmoney from the telecommunications industry:  $103,165 in PoliticalAction Committee (PAC) funds in the first six months of 1995.   Sen.Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) received $37,000 in PAC funds.       On the House side, House Telecommunications and FinanceSubcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R-Texas) received $97,000 in PACmoney from January through June of this year, according to the report.

Law enforcement agents found a scanner the size ofa business card portfolio used to capture electronic serial numbers(ESNs) and mobile identification numbers (MINs).  When open, thescanner measures approximately 11 inches high, 6 inches wide and 1.5inches thick, said U.S. Secret Service spokesman William Whiteside.     "Like the cellular side, the criminal side of the industry isbecoming more mobile and building smaller devices to facilitate theircriminal activities," said Tom McClure, Cellular TelecommunicationsIndustry Association director-fraud management.     Also uncovered in the bust was a device called a "Celltracker,"which is perhaps more threatening than the pocket-size scanner.  Thisdevice looks like a cellular phone, but can be used to eavesdrop onother cellular phone conversations.  The device can capture ESNs/MINsand functions as a "Lifetime" phone.  The Lifetime phone can store 99ESNs/MINs, making it easy to avoid detection as a cloned phone.  OtherLifetime phones without the scanner were confiscated in the bust aswell.  Their keypads are used to program ESNs/MINs.     AT&T Wireless Services Inc. first notified law enforcement agentsafter discovering an advertisement for the sale of illegal electronicdevices on the Internet.  For the first time, investigators used theInternet to "wiretap" and monitor outgoing and incoming messages ofthe crime ring's leaders, Bernhard Bowitz, his estranged wife, RachelBowitz and Gregory Brooks.     Some good news:  "We have come up with a solution," said McClure,referring to authentication technology.  He said there are ahalf-million authentication-capable handsets and tests are under wayin New York on authentication networks.     While the authentication technology may prevent cloning fraud, itdoes not eliminate the eavesdropping capability of the Celltracker. However, Cycomm Corp. introduced a service last week that couldprevent such criminal activity.  The PrivaCall Network service allowscustomers in the United States or Canada to have calls scrambled toprevent monitoring of their cellular calls.  ...Extension Cloning Case Goes to Trial     In a related item, the first fraud trial involving a man chargedwith extension phone cloning is underway in Lexington, Ky.  Don BillyYates used equipment to program cellular phones with the same ESN/MINcombinations, allowing his customers to have two phones for the priceof one.  For one time fee of $150 paid to Yates, customers would avoidpaying activation and monthly service charges for the second phone.     In a motion to dismiss, Yates argued that federal law did notprohibit his activities.  The judge disagreed, saying that Yatesdefrauded cellular carriers by denying them the monthly service andactivation fees.     "[The case] could be the most important [fraud] case the industryhas ever had," said CTIA's McClure.  "We have long advocated that[extension cloning] is a violation."

"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) decided to forgo a run for oneof Louisiana's Senate seats and will run for his 10th term in theHouse.  According to the Associated Press, Tauzin--who recentlyswitched parties--said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has vowedto name him chairman of the House Telecommunications and FinanceSubcommittee after the 1996 elections.  The subcommittee's currentchairman, Rep. Jack Fields (R-Texas), announced last month (WTN,12/18/95,) that he is retiring to spend more time with his family. The subcommittee's vice chairman, Rep. Mike Oxley (R-Ohio), is next inline for the job.  However, Oxley also chairs the Commerce, Trade andHazardous Waste Subcommittee.       * Seeking to provide multiLATA (local access and transport area)personal communications service (PCS) in North Carolina, SouthCarolina and Tennessee, BellSouth Corp. has requested a waiver of the1982 AT&T antitrust consent decree.  In addition, BellSouth asked theU.S. district court overseeing the decree to relieve it of equalaccess obligations for PCS in this area.     BellSouth noted that AT&TWireless, currently the only other PCS licensee in the region, islikely to offer PCS on an integrated (local and long-distanceservice), non-equal access basis.  "That being the case, granting thewaiver would be pro-competitive," it said.     * Robert Woods, commissioner of the General ServicesAdministration (GSA), will discuss the Post-FTS 2000 program Jan. 16in McLean, Va., at an event sponsored by Capitol TelecommunicationsProfessionals (CTP).  The Post-FTS 2000 program is designed to providegovernment agencies with flexible, responsive, and state-of-the-artvoice, data and video networks; a Request for Proposal will be issuedin the next few months.  (CTP, 301/564-1032.)     * Labeling the request an "extraordinary exercise in chutzpah,"AT&T opposed Bell Atlantic Corp. and Ameritech Corp.'s joint motionfor court action allowing their minority-owned affiliate Telecom Corp.of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide "full circuit" service on callsbetween the United States and New Zealand.  The two companies lastmonth asked the decree court to modify the 1990 order that allowedthem to invest in TCNZ. They want permission to provide the UnitedStates half of the call to a point terminating on the U.S. West Coast. AT&T said TCNZ imposes the high accounting rates that the two regionalholding companies claim have disadvantaged them against competitors.     "The effect of the proposed modification would be to enableTCNZ-Bell Atlantic-Ameritech to impose even greater costs on U.S.carriers and illicitly to advantage TCNZ's own full-circuit service,"AT&T said.  Bell Atlantic and Ameritech also have not shown that "theyhave lost the ability and incentive to leverage exchange monopoliesinto long-distance markets in the five years since the TCNZ waiverorder was entered."     * AT&T has opposed four regional holding companies' (RHCs') "metoo" requests for extensions of any decree waiver granted to anindividual RHC.  AT&T said that some of the waiver orders the RHCsseek to extend "were granted solely because of facts unique to thesingle [RHC which] sought and obtained the order."  AT&T specificallynoted a Pacific Telesis Group [PAC] waiver that allowed it to acquirea 10 percent interest in a trans-Pacific cable.       The waiver would not have been granted, AT&T contended, if theproposal was to allow each of the seven RHCs to acquire separate 10percent interests, such that together they would own a 70 percentstake in the cable.  "Yet this motion would authorize precisely that,"AT&T said.            * The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans tohold a series of seminars on how independent specialized mobile radio(SMR) operators can develop winning strategies in the new 800 MHzregulatory framework.

Back to Headline List CopyrightWASHINGTON TELECOM NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 8, 19961996 SEEN AS THE CALM BEFORE THE COMPETITIVE STORM     The outlook for the telecommunications industry in 1996 is one of uncertainty and caution.  Many executives, regulators andlegislators believe 1996 will be the year companies across all linesof the telecommunications industry jockey for position to prepare fora marketplace without competitive barriers.     Uncertainty lingers, of course, because the fate of the telecomreform bill still is uncertain.  If the bill passes, consumers are notlikely to see immediate changes.  Instead, players in all facets ofthe industry are likely to take a deep breath to figure out theconsequences of the legislation before making any major moves.      In other words, 1996 will be the calm before the storm.  BernardEbbers, CEO of interexchange carrier (IXC) WorldCom Inc., said thestate of competition in the telecommunications marketplace will changevery little in 1996.  Some changes may be noticed by the end of thisyear, he said, but dramatic changes will not occur until 1997.     "I think the legislation is irrelevant in 1996," Ebbers said. "If legislation is passed I think we'll see very little effect in1996.  People will be getting ready, but I don't think we'll see muchof a roll out of anything this year."     Roy Neel, president and CEO of the U.S. Telephone Association(USTA),   said nothing will happen overnight once the legislation isapproved.  In some cases, the industry will have to look at how theFCC implements the legislation.     "You may get the bill passed tomorrow, but it may take six monthsto write the rules to implement it," Neel said.  ...Merger Mania?     Some believe the landscape will become less crowded as companiesacross all lines of the telecommunications industry begin merging andallying.  The industry has been moving in that direction over the lasttwo years, with companies partnering to do everything from developinginteractive TV services to offering personal communications services(PCS).        Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), a member of the House CommerceCommittee and its Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, saidthe pace of consolidation will accelerate once a bill is passed. Boucher believes the industry could start to see national multimediacompanies develop this year that will provide a host of offerings suchas television and movie production and cable TV and telephoneservices.     "I think that will eventually occur as the lines that distinguishtelephone, cable and entertainment companies blur, and in the future,vanish altogether," he said.       Pacific Telesis Group Vice President for Corporate Strategy BobBarada thinks legislation will force the telecommunications industrydown the same path as other large industries where only three or fourmajor players exist in a given market.      "That's probably going to happen in our industry when legislationgets out of the way," said Barada.  "I don't think [the marketplace]can sustain eight huge local exchange companies and four huge IXCs."       Others, however, do not subscribe to the shakeout theory thatBarada and others are espousing.  USTA's Neel said that predictionsthat only a few companies will be left after the smoke clears are"certainly premature and perhaps even nonsense."     Two candidates often mentioned as merger partners are BellAtlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..  The two already are members of theTele-TV venture, were members of a consortium that bid in the PCSauctions, and have merged their cellular operations.       George Schmidt, who now is president of Omnipoint CommunicationsInc., worked with both companies when he was president and CEO of PCSPrimeCo, the PCS alliance that also includes U S WEST Communications[USW] and AirTouch Communications [ATI].  While NYNEX and BellAtlantic are a good fit geographically, they operate very differentlyand their  respective chairmen--Ivan Seidenberg and Ray Smith--"makestrange bedfellows," Schmidt said, adding, "I don't know if Ivan, whojust became chairman of NYNEX, could stand being anything less thanthat.  We know Ray can't, and he's not retiring."     Another takeover candidate mentioned by many is MFSCommunications Co. Inc..  The competitive access provider's president,Royce Holland, thinks such speculation is due to the fact that hiscompany is well positioned to take advantage of deregulation.  MFS, hesaid, serves more office square footage with fiber than any othercompany in the world.     "We're not necessarily looking for alliances," Holland said. "[But] if something comes along that makes sense we'll take a hardlook at it."  ...The Wireline Wars     Regardless of whether the legislation passes, consumers inseveral states will see competition in the local telephone market. Legislators and regulators in states like California and New Yorkalready have cleared the way for competition in the local loop.        "We believe that 1996, especially in California, is the year ofthe wireline wars," PacTel's Barada noted.      MFS's Holland said if 1995 was the year of co-carrier rules, 1996will be the year of co-carrier implementation.  Holland's company haseither applied to or has been approved to provide local telephoneservice in 17 states.     "I think 1996 will see a big acceleration in competition in thelocal loop," Holland said.  "We certainly saw a lot happen in '95 onthe state level...I think we'll see a lot of these regulatorybreakthroughs implemented."     As competition heats up, the industry and regulators still willstruggle with issues such as interconnection and access policies, thecorrect approach to universal service, protections for service qualityand number portability, said Lisa Rosenblum, deputy chairwoman of theNew York Public Service Commission.     "Even if you get the basic policy established, there's a range ofareas that you're going to have to continue to monitor or modulate,"Rosenblum said.   ...Local Telcos Under Assault     As the local loop opens in states across the country, thecompanies which have had a monopoly over local service will be thrustinto a competitive environment, in particular facing the aggressivemarketing and advertising of the three major long-distance carriers: AT&T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp..       To prepare for the onslaught, the seven regional holdingcompanies (RHCs), GTE Corp., and the nation's more than 1,000 otherlocal exchange carriers (LECs) need to be just as aggressive on themarketing front as their soon-to-be competitors.  USTA's Neel said theLECs need to capitalize on the fact that consumers give localtelephone companies high ratings for providing dependable, reliableand high quality service.  To avoid the churn that is so prevalent inthe long-distance industry, the LECs need to hammer this point intoconsumers' heads.     "The key for LECs is to become more aggressive tooters of theirown horn, so to speak," Neel said.     PacTel's Barada said the RHCs must move from being consideredorder takers to being known as aggressive marketers.  The companiesalso must show the business and residential markets that they areserious about providing superior service.  Consumers, he said, willfind out this year that their local telephone companies are ready,willing and able to serve their needs.     "Starting in '96 you're going to see us really trying to findwhat holds consumers together, and willing to pat their backs and givethem massages," he said.

For the 12 months through Dec. 29, the North AmericanTelecommunications Index--composed of the stocks of 16 publicly held,large-capitalization companies, all of which do business in cellularand paging services or in manufacturing wireless equip-ment (WB&F,Jan. 4, 1995)--increased 30.4 percent. Much of this gain came in thesecond half of 1995.     Not all telecom indices followed thispattern, however.  The 20-stock Chicago Board Options Ex-change GlobalTelecommunications Index, up 22.5 percent on the year, was flat sincemid-July.NORTH AMERICAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDEX***************************************                  12/29/95 Close:  392.17Twelve-Month RangeHigh         Low392.17      295.62Percentage ChangesOne Month:     3.7%Three Months:  8.5%Six Months:   22.4%*******************Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996AUSTRIAN GSM LICENSE AWARDED FOR $400 MILLION     Bowing to bidders' demands that a winner be named by year's end,Austria's top telecom regulator announced Dec. 29 that a German-ledgroup will be licensed to operate the nation's first private cellularsystem.  O-Call, led by Deutsche Telekom and Siemens AG with financialbacking from Austrian interests, is to begin service of the globalsystem for mobile communications (GSM) network in about six months. Austria's PTT, building out its own GSM service, is expected to paythe same amount--$400 million--that Transportation Commissioner ViktorKlima said O-Call offered for the 15-year license.Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996LATE-1995 SIGNPOSTS POINT WAY TOWARD INDUSTRY TRENDS OF 1996Executive Summary:  From interviews with industry leaders and analysisof recent events, it is possible to connect some of the dots and makeeducated guesses about what 1996 holds in store for wireless.     The way Larry Vanston sees it, the year ahead "will be a lot like'95" in the world of wireless telecommunications.  This is to say that1996 will be another year of record-setting growth, heightenedcompetition and rapid techno-logical change for the industry,according to Vanston, president of Austin, Texas-based consultantsTechnology Futures Inc.     Vanston and other observers surveyed by WB&F said it may well bethat the industry is in for a year when the pace of developments, ifanything, gains more momentum.  Such an acceleration is seen occurringacross a broad front--mani-fested by prices for services driven loweras more competitors arrive on the scene and by a stream oftechnological advances--and against a backdrop where wirelesstelephony becomes a widespread reality in more markets overseas.     But this is not to say that there are no clouds on the wirelesshorizon.  Indeed, renewed signs of a slowdown in the U.S. cellularmarket--the world's largest, in terms of absolute subscribers--havedampened the growth outlook for network operators and for handset andinfrastructure manufacturers.      As Nokia Corp. noted Dec. 14, "Despite improvement in Nokia'sU.S. mobile phone business, growth and profitability in Nokia MobilePhones have developed somewhat below plan."  That sent the price ofNokia's American Depositary Receipts tumbling for the second time intwo months (page 9).       However, it was unclear at press time whether handsetmanufacturers in general faced a repeat of the overages that built upin their U.S. inventories during the 1994 Christmas season.     All the same, Wall Streeters are a notoriously fickle bunch, andany fall-off in domestic wireless growth should be measured againstthe blistering ex-pansion that the U.S. market enjoyed during 1994 andthe first half of 1995.  Net subscriber additions simply could not besustained forever at such an ex-plosive rate, and cellular's long-termgrowth pattern seems firmly intact.      By the end of 1996, it is conceivable that there will be 40million cellu-lar subscribers in the United States--a gain of 10million in a 15-month span.  ...All Eyes Turn to PCS     Big changes are destined to sweep the U.S. wireless market thisyear, as the industry comes to grips with the probable enactment oflegislation aimed at deregulating telecommunications.  This would givenetwork operators "the statu-tory certainty they need to move forwardwith big purchases of new equipment," said Matthew Flanagan, presidentof the Telecommunications Industry Association, Arlington, Va.     Moreover, the U.S. market is on the verge of entering a new phasewith the advent of broadband personal communications services (PCS). It may be another year yet before PCS is marketed on a large scale,but PCS licensees are betting big bucks that both lower price pointsand the digitally enhanced sound quality of calls placed over theirsystems will prove appealing to consumers who have disdained cellularas too costly and to at least some cellular subscribers.         This year's challenges for PCS players will be to finish the U.S.licensing process--the C-block spectrum auction (see page 10) is setto resume this week--and to bring newly licensed services to market,said Tom Mateer, vice president of business development for SprintTelecommunications Venture (STV), the al-liance of Sprint Corp. andthree large cable television operators.     "Our goal is to provide service in our own markets by the end of1996," Mateer said of Kansas City-based STV, the largest of the A/B-block major trading area (MTA) licensees in terms of potential marketpopulation.  Other MTA licensees, including AT&T Wireless Services andPCS PrimeCo L.P., are working against similar timetables.     While committed to code division multiple access (CDMA) as itstechnologystandard, STV had not named equipment vendors for its networkbuildout--estimated to cost from $3 billion to $4 billion by industrysources--at press time.  Mateer said talks with prospective supplierswere "moving along."     Some funds from Sprint's long-anticipated deal to sell 10 percentequity interests to France Telecom and Germany's  Deutsche Telekom,which was approved by the FCC last month, are expected to be earmarkedfor STV's buildout.     On the narrowband side of PCS, action will center on howsuccessfully competitors narrow the lead that Mobile TelecommunicationTechnologies Corp. (Mtel) enjoys in this market.  For its part, Mtelcontinues to grapple with what Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. recently called"rollout concerns" surrounding the company's SkyTel 2-Way advancedmessaging service.    ...Competition, Consolidation and Convergence:  More of the Same,Only More So     Perhaps the most important issue before the wireless industry ishow to compete effectively on a landscape that seemingly keepsshifting beneath its feet.  For many wireless players, achieving"scale" is the way to maximize their competitive ability.       This consolidation trend has been most pronounced in paging,where Arch Communications Group Inc. and AirTouch Paging announced themost recent acquisitions, deals giving them about 2.5 million and 2.2million U.S. subscribers, respectively.  Suf-fice it to say that morepaging acqui- sitions are in the offing this year.     But 1996 will see the introduction of new wireless players aswell, via corporate spinoffs.  For instance,  Sprint's spinoff of itsSprint Cellular subsidiary to shareholders (WB&F, June 21, 1995) is ontrack for completion late next month or early in March, and AT&TCorp.'s landmark breakup (WB&F, Sept. 27, 1995) is set to close byyear's end.     Other wireless companies may become publicly held entities. PageMart Inc., the only privately held company among the top U.S.paging operators, has hinted that it may go this route, and Londonfinancial circles are abuzz that Hutchison Wampoa of Hong Kong willfloat Orange, its U.K. personal communications network (PCN)--possiblyas part of a larger realignment of its telecom interests.     And the cast of characters getting into wireless seems likely tokeep on growing.  Two recent examples:      *  A unit of International Family Entertainment Inc., whosechairman is evangelist Pat Robertson, bought out the majority interestheld by Motorola Inc. in Pakistan Mobile Communications Ltd., licensedto offer nationwide cellular service based on the global system formobile communications (GSM) standard as well as paging in the Asiancountry.     *  Fidelity Capital, part of the Boston-based mutual funds giant,has helped engineer a deal aimed at strengthening specialized mobileradio (SMR) operator Pittencrieff Communications Inc. in its coreTexas market (WB&F, May 10, 1995).  Pittencrieff shareholders were tovote late this week on the company's merger with Fidelity-ownedAdvanced MobileComm Inc.     Meanwhile, convergence has continued to take on new and differentforms in wireless.  For instance, there is the growing trend amongcompetition-minded service providers to establish themselves as "one-stop shops."      In the space of a week last month, Dallas-based Paging NetworkInc. (PageNet) announced marketing agreements with both STV and GTECorp., giving PageNet new distribution channels for its digital andalphanumeric services in both the PCS and local telephone markets,respectively.       STV, by packaging cable services on a promotional basis with itsplanned service offerings for the local and long-distance telephonemarkets, appears to be seeking as many distribution sources aspossible.  STV also signed an agree-ment covering various text-messaging services with National Dispatch Center Inc., a San Diego-based data network operator, last month.   ...Technology:  It's Show Time for CDMA, iDEN     Technology, like competition, is a powerful catalyst forconvergence.  The wireless industry should look during 1996 for moredevelopments along the lines of these recent announcements:     *  Putting aside their intense rivalry, Motorola granted L.M.Ericsson AB a license to use Flex, Motorola's high-speed pagingprotocol, in the Swedish company's pagers and infrastructureequipment.     *  IBM Corp., Nokia and the PCS subsidiary of Pacific TelesisGroup will work together on making wireless data services accessibleto subscribers via IBM ThinkPad laptop computers.  The ability to sendand receive e-mail and facsimile messages and to gain access to theInternet will be a key selling point for Pacific Bell Mobile Servicesin marketing PCS in its service area of California and Nevada, thecompanies said.     But in the dynamic field of wireless technology, the CDMA airinterface--and its promise of offering 10 times the capacity of analogcel-lular--no doubt will command the limelight right through 1996.               The first CDMA system to achieve commercial status wasHutchison Telecom's cellular service in Hong Kong last fall.  Next upwill be a long-awaited cellular network built out in Los Angeles byAirTouch Com-munications, which has spent much time fine-tuning it,followed by themid-1996 launch of Shinsegi Tele-communications Inc.'s cellular systemin South Korea (WB&F, Aug. 30, 1995).     Importantly, the 43 member companies of the CDMA DevelopmentGroup have verified test results done with CDMA's 13 kilobits persecond vocoder, a touch-stone to achieving wireline-quality voicecommunications over CDMA networks.      CDMA handsets for use on PCS networks are expected to becomeavailable during the first half of 1996, said Kevin Kelley, vicepresident of external affairs for Qualcomm Inc., San Diego.  Thecompany plans to ship 1 mil-lion terminals this year.     For enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR) operator NextelCommunica-tions Inc. [CALL], at least some of the questionssurrounding the sound quality of Motorola's ESMR technology, known asiDEN (WB&F, April 12, 1995), will be resolved this year.       Even while cementing its nation-wide footprint in place with theimmi-nent completion of its acquisition of Dial Page Inc. [DPGE], theRutherford, N.J.-based company plans to conduct asingle-market betatest of what Nextel executives call "reconfigured iDEN" before the endof March.  Based on the re-sults, the company will decide whether toproceed with a "more broad-scale com-mercial introduction" of thetechnology, Nextel disclosed in a recent Securities and ExchangeCommission filing.     Meanwhile, Geotek Communications Inc.--with a $25 million line ofcredit provided by Hughes Electronics Corp. at its disposal to acquireadditional 900 MHz spectrum--will begin commercial operation of itsown SMR service in Philadelphia, its initial market, this month.     Finally, two companies developing interference-reducing cellularfilters that use high-temperature superconducting materials are boundto make news.  Illinois Superconductor Corp. is proceeding withoperational field trials, while Superconductor Technologies Inc.announced the delivery of its second receiver filter subsystem for GSMbase stations last week.  ...International:  Asia, Brazil Seen as Where the Action Will Be     According to the Commerce Department's Office ofTelecommunications, Brazil and India (WB&F, Dec. 6, 1995) will meritclose scrutiny from the wireless industry this year as emergingmarkets with the greatest untapped potential.     Also, noted agency analyst Stephanie McCullough, cellularcompetition will come to five countries for the first time:  SouthKorea, Taiwan, Belgium, Poland and Ireland.  The Czech Republic willchoose operators for two digital net-works this spring, and PCNservices may take shape in more European nations (page 7).     Three other Asian "tigers" also are likely to make waves incellular in 1996.     In China, handset prices and user tariffs are projected to fall,spelling further rapid subscriber growth.  Having recently awardedEricsson its third infrastructure contract in 12 months, GuangdongMobile Communications Corp. soon will qualify as one of the world'sbiggest network operators, boasting subscriber capacity of ap-proximately 1.2 million on its GSM network and more than 1.4 millionon its analog system.     In Indonesia, the state-run PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia is con-verting its revenue-sharing arrangements with private investors in thenation's five fixed and mobile operators into joint ventures.  Thismay open the door to more foreign capital, akin to the $800 millionand the $586 million that Nynex Corp.WB&F, Oct. 11, 1995) and DeutscheTelekom paid, respectively, for equity stakes in Indonesia's two GSMcarriers last year.     In terms of sheer numbers of participants--seven, with a combinedsub-scriber base projected by Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd. at 1 millionas of the end of 1995--Malaysia is one of the most competitive of themajor markets for voice-based wireless services in the world.  Celcom--the nation's dominant cellular operator (WB&F, Dec. 7, 1994) butsaddled with an analog-based system--faces a difficult task inprotecting its market position against several upstarts offeringhigher-capacity GSM.

In its latest annual report, West Point, Ga.-based InterCel disclosed that it plans to make concurrent publicofferings of stock and notes during the first quarter of 1996. Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5 millionand $150 million, respectively.     The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with thecellular network operator's plans to acquire Powertel (WB&F, July 5,1995), a privately held con-sortium in which InterCel already is amajor participant.       Cash interest on the notes will not be payable before 2001. InterCel also is negotiating a $20 million revolving credit facility.     While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positiveoperating income," InterCel warned in the annual report thatmanagement expects "signifi-cant operating losses beginning in 1996,"reflecting the impact of PCS buildout and marketing costs.(InterCel, Tel.: 706/645-9520.)Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996CELLULAR OPERATOR CLOSES TWO-TRACK DEBT FINANCING     Colombia's Communicacion Celular SA (Comcel) received netproceeds of $145.5 million from a recently completed debt financing,the company's first.     The funds will be used to expand the company's network coveragein its eastern Colombia service area, which includes the capital cityof Bogota and which has a potential market population of 15.8 millionpeople.     Comcel, adding subscribers at the rate of 4,000 a month, had amid-December base of approximately 62,000.  The company is in theprocess of upgrading its technology, with the time division multipleaccess digital standard to be paired with its advanced mobile phonesystem analog network.     The financing, said majority owner Bell Canada InternationalInc., had two components:  a $100 million syndicated Eurodollar seniorsecured term loan due in the year 2001; and an oversubscribed $150million private placement of high-yield senior deferred coupon bonds due 2003.  The bonds, whichwill accrete at a 13.125 percent rate compounded semiannually untilNovember 2000 and begin paying cash interest in May 2001, are combinedwith warrants that, if fully ex-ercised, would amount to a 2 percentequity interest in Comcel.      Montreal-based Bell Canada International, a BCE Inc. subsidiary,owns 51 percent of Comcel.  The rest is owned by Colombia's principaltelecom companies, wireline operator Empresa de Telecomunicaciones deSantafe de Bogota and long-distance carrier Empresa Nacional deTelecomunicaciones.

Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996LACK OF HANDSETS SEEN IMPEDING DUAL-BAND GSM SERVICES       Cellular operators that employ global system for mobilecommunications (GSM) technology in their networks should think longand hard about pairing their services with GSM's higher-frequencycounterparts, DCS-1800 and PCS-1900.     So says Toni Stadelmann, deputy managing director of mobileservices for Swiss Telecom, which has deployed a DCS-1800 personalcommuni-cations network (PCN) in Geneva to go with its nationwide GSMcellular network.       While its experience with PCN has been limited--the Geneva system was rolled out to coincide with the Telecom '95trade show and conference last October--the PTT plans to introduceDCS-1800 service in Zurich and Basel next fall as a capacity-enhancingsupplement to 900 MHz cel-lular in these high-traffic markets,Stadelmann told the PCS-1900 in North America conference in Washingtonlast month.     In the long run, he said, the company hopes to reach roamingagreements that would tie its PCN service together with Europe's GSMcellular operators and countries that either have PCN already--theUnited Kingdom, Germany and France--or are contemplating PCN rollouts,including Sweden and Italy.     But there is one sizable problem:  Wireless equipmentmanufacturers need to speed up efforts to bring dual-band mobilephones to market.  The subject of GSM/DCS-1800 handsets also came upduring another recent meeting in Washington.      "I don't know of anyvendor today committed to" developing these handsets, Malcolm Cowan,general manager of the Richardson, Texas-based PCS business unit ofNorthern Telecom Ltd., told the PCS Strategies conference.      If recent contract announcements are any indication, however,Finland's Nokia Corp. may be the first to take the plunge.      The company has signed a two-year contract with Telia Mobitel,the biggest GSM cellular network in Sweden, for the delivery of basestation subsystems that can be used either for a stand-alone DCS-1800network or a seamless dual-band service.  The base stations aredesigned to bolster capacity in areas with heavy calling traffic aswell as to improve indoor coverage.    ...Savings on Fixed and Operating Costs, More Flexibility in SettingRates     Nokia's other recent GSM/DCS-1800 infrastructure deals were withNordicTel Holdings of Sweden and Sonofon of Denmark.  It also was thevendor for Swiss Telecom's DCS-1800 system.     For Swiss Telecom--scheduled to face competition in PCN beginningin 1998, when spectrum set aside for private operators will be openedup--pairing GSM and DCS-1800 will afford cost advantages in the areasof infrastructure, its trans-mission network and customer service andbilling, Stadelmann said.       According to an analysis in which the PTT assigned differentweightings to these cost areas, potential savings of 30 percent can behad--12 percent on both transmission network and billing/customerservice expenses and another 6 percent on infrastructure costs.     Moreover, in limiting its PCN coverage to urban areas, Stadelmannsaid that Swiss Telecom has found that it can devise a rate structurethat offers greater appeal to the more price-conscious segment of thewire-less voice market.     By setting rates close to those of the wireline network, SwissTelecom hopes to induce customers to switch over to PCN from the fixednetwork for the mobility it affords.  But that, of course, first wouldrequire a more robust roaming capability.     All Stadelmann could do last month was ask rhetorically:  "Whatare the manufacturers ... doing?"  He would like to see action soonerrather than later.(Swiss Telecom, Tel.: 41-31-62-76-93.)Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS BUSINESS & FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996GLENAYRE, NEXUS TEAM UP TO SUPPORT SPREAD-SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY     Glenayre Technologies Inc. is considering plans to manufacturere-ceivers incorporating technology developed by NexusTelecommunication Systems Ltd., which plans to market the technologyto paging operators aiming to address the "low end" of the two-waymessaging market.     The companies announced an agreement last month to collaborate oninte-grating Glenayre-made switches, controllers and base stationswith Nexus's reverse-channel receivers and two-way applicationsplatform.       The deal is noteworthy because Glenayre will provide protocolinformation on the company's GL3000 advanced paging terminal thatwould facilitate the operation of the two-way Nexus Network onexisting one-way paging systems.       Besides possibly making Nexus-based receivers itself, Glenayreholds an option to buy them from Nexus as an original equipmentmanufacturer.  In return, Nexus granted the Charlotte, N.C.-basedcompany the right to obtain a worldwide license on its return-channeltechnology.  ...U.S. Beta Test Draws Near      Essentially, the spread-spectrum Nexus technology (WB&F, Nov. 9,1994) af-fords one-way paging carriers a low-speed return channel. Nexus Network uses the unlicensed 902-928 MHz band for the returnchannel, which operates at 200 bits per second--far slower than ReFlexor pACT, the narrowband personal commun-ications service (PCS)protocols developed by Motorola Inc. and AT&T Wireless Systems,respectively.     Rani Cohen, senior vice president of Givatayim, Israel-basedNexus, said that Nexus Network is geared toward service offeringswhere speed is not critical--most notably, a confirmation or short-messaging capability that would appeal to price-sensitive pagingsubscribers.     A beta test of Nexus Network involving American Paging Inc. andseveral other U.S. carriers is scheduled for next month.  Minneapolis-based American Paging holds five regional narrowband PCSlicenses.      Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate, is expected to beginshippingtwo-way paging units supporting Nexus Network by next summer.     (Nexus, Tel.: 972-3-571-0226; Glenayre, Tel.: 704/522-0483.)

And with good reason.  While the specialized mobile radio (SMR)auction that began a month ago generally has moved along at a moresedate pace, the C-block auction of bandwidth for broadband personalcommunications services (PCS) kicked off with a bang on Dec. 18:  Nethigh bids for the 493 C-block licenses exceeded $1.2 billion by theend of the fourth round.     One hopeful, Puerto Rico-based PCS 2000 L.P., offered anastronomical $327 million in net high bids for basic trading area(BTA) licenses in the first round, skewing the bidding.  But thehectic activity put to rest at least some doubts about whether thelong-delayed C-block auction would measure up to last year's PCSauction of major trading area licenses.     Meanwhile, SMR operators praised FCC plans to auction wide-arealicenses for 10 MHz in contiguous blocks of 20, 60 and 120 channels inthe 800 MHz band.  Also, two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs)will allot still more spectrum for use in wireless applications ifadopted as final rules by the FCC:     *  One would open the 37-38.6 GHz band for point-to-pointmicrowave operations.  BTA licenses would be auctioned off--possiblyas soon as a year from now--with credits and installment plansaccorded to small businesses that wish to bid.  A provision wouldpermit the processing of pending license applications in the 38.6-40GHz band.      *  The other NPRM would give hospitals access to vacanttelevision channels in the very and ultra high-frequency bands,doubling in many regions the number of frequencies available forremote patient monitoring.  Higher power levels also would be allowedfor medical telemetry devices.(FCC, Tel.: 202/632-7000.)Back to Headline List WT03-B14-19IA086-000621-B040-172http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te104.html 205.156.212.5 19970122053640 text/html 26736HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:34:33 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:34 GMTContent-length: 26549Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te104.html Sample Issue Copyright WIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNet January 10, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEW YEAR BEGINS WITH CDPD CARRIERS STILL FACING SEVERAL TASKS BEFORE ESTABLISHING NATIONAL SERVICE (1109 words) 1995 IS MARKED BY INCREMENTAL CHANGES; PREPARATION FOR THE TIME WHEN WIRELESS DATA BECOMES POPULAR BUSINESS TOOL (450 words) WIDE AREA NETWORKS WIDE AREA NETWORKS (561 words) UNLICENSED DATA THE WIRELESS LAN INDUSTRY ORGANIZES (746 words) IN BRIEF IN BRIEF (239 words) PACKET DATA ARDIS BELIEVES CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT TO EXPAND APPEAL TO MOBILE PROFESSIONALS (336 words) CopyrightWIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996NEW YEAR BEGINS WITH CDPD CARRIERS STILL FACING SEVERAL TASKS BEFOREESTABLISHING NATIONAL SERVICE     As of Jan. 1, cellular digital packet data (CDPD) service wasavailable in 31 of the top 50 U.S. cellular markets and a number ofsmaller markets as well.  WDN's conservative estimate is thatcommercial CDPD service is available to approximately 85 millionpeople--a third of the U.S. population.     Those figures fall below the midyear aims of the leading CDPDcarriers, which hoped to have as many as 40 of the 50 top marketscovered by the end of 1995.  Plans are in place to establish servicein most of the remaining 19 markets with a few exceptions, mostnotably Los Angeles.  Much of the coming year also will be devoted tofilling in coverage in the many markets where CDPD does not match fullcellular coverage.     A great deal of work remains before CDPD becomes a true nationalservice.  After the continued buildout, interconnection betweencellular markets becomes an increasingly important priority.  In thesix months since the first interconnection agreement was signed byAmeritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet, only one otheragreement, between GTE and Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile (BANM), has beensigned.     "The fundamental nature of the agreements is simple, but when youget into all of the elements, it ends up being time consuming as youget both sets of lawyers in motion," said Mike Franklin, BANM direc-tor-product management for wireless data.  Even for cellular lawyersaccustomed to working out more complicated roaming agreements, CDPDhas been more difficult than expected.     "I think billing has been an issue.  A lot of companies are stillchoosing their billing systems.  At the same time that they are tryingto interoperate, they haven't even determined what they are going touse to share information," said Ellen Smith, business developmentmanager-wireless data service for SNET Mobility.     A thornier problem has been caused by the complexities of the1984 consent decree managing the breakup of AT&T.  U.S. District JudgeHarold Greene's April 1995 order allowing the cellular subsidiaries ofBell regional holding companies (RHCs) to provide limited long-distance service included a clause designed to aid national CDPDservice.       The ruling allows RHC subsidiaries to provide CDPD betweenmarkets without having to provide alternative long-distance options tothe consumer.  Carriers can buy long-distance service at bulk rates,greatly reducing the cost of operation.  At the same time, however,the judge ordered the carriers to file "compliance plans" with theJustice Department before providing long-distance packet data.     Carriers also must prove that a competitive access provider (CAP)is operating in a market before the Justice Department will approveinterconnections in that market.  That process, which must be donemarket by market, has been one of the most time-consumingcomplications.  The three-week partial shut-down of the federalgovernment, which included Justice Department employees, did not helpmatters.     "We have certified [through Justice] that there are CAPsoperating in Connecticut and the New York metro market, which includesnorthern New Jersey," Franklin said.  The carrier has been waiting formonths for approval in other markets.     BANM and Ameritech are affected directly by the situation, butnon-RHCs, such as GTE and AT&T Wireless Services are affectedindirectly by the inability to provide national service that some oftheir customers demand.     "We are very anxious to put the nationwide network in place.  Weare focusing on carriers that have major markets that are of interestto our customers," said Jeff Damir, director-product marketing andmanagement for AT&T's wireless data division.  "Chicago [an Ameritechmarket] has been an important market for some time due to the factthat American Airlines is one of our most important customers."     Under the two interconnection agreements now in operation, actualcommercial roaming is limited.  It is available between GTE's marketsand BANM's markets cleared by the Justice Department.  Ameritech,which interprets the ruling somewhat differently, has opened itsmarkets to GTE customers, but Ameritech customers cannot roam to GTEmarkets, an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  Ameritech hopes to have itscompliance report approved by next month.     There is some progress in the interconnection discussions,however, and carriers are piecing their commercial markets into thebeginnings of a national service.

"Over the next six months, significant progress will be made withinterconnection agreements and the coverage that will be available toAT&T customers," Damir said.     The opening of new markets appears to be increasing.  Over thelast three months of 1995, BANM established CDPD service in its lastmajor market, Boston, and began opening the service in some of itssmaller markets that border major metropolitan areas, such asFrederick, Md., and Hunterdon, N.J.     AT&T recently began commercial service in Pittsburgh andAmeritech in St. Louis.  Ameritech is nearing commercial openings inits three Ohio markets (Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton) andMilwaukee.  GTE expects to be operating in San Diego soon.     SNET Mobility has established CDPD services to reach 70 percentof the population of Connecticut with a solid stretch of servicereaching from New York City to Hartford.  Its next priority is toestablish interconnection with other carriers to provide its customerswith service stretching throughout the northeastern United States.     Carriers' next priority after building and connecting networkswill be to do more to market the service.  "My Top 10 list [ofpriorities] starts with, 'Get more customers on the network.'  Everyother objective is a subset of that," Franklin said.Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 19961995 IS MARKED BY INCREMENTAL CHANGES; PREPARATION FORTHE TIME WHEN WIRELESS DATA BECOMES POPULAR BUSINESS TOOL     No single dramatic event or development sums up wireless datadevelopment in 1995.  It was instead a year of slow changes in mobiledevices and software and steady rollout of new infrastructure.  Itleft room for speculation of what might be, but a still unclear pic-ture of how popular the technology ultimately will be.     On the positive side, there appears to be greater confidenceamong some packet data developers, including the Ardis packet radionetwork (see page 8), that the potentially lucrative mobileprofessional market may soon be within reach, as applications improveand devices become more functional and lower priced.     But there is a negative side as well.  National cellular digitalpacket data (CDPD) service remains a project under construction and itstill may have considerable building left at the end of 1996.  Itsrival packet data carriers, Ardis and RAM Mobile Data, continue tohave a difficult time broadening their customer bases.     The two packet radio networks combined served approximately67,000 users at the beginning of 1995.  In spite of confidentpredictions, packet data still is used by fewer than 100,000customers.     Perhaps the most dramatic developments in wireless data came fromthe unlicensed system developers--wireless local area networks (LANs),unlicensed personal communications services and, perhaps one day,Apple Computer Inc.'s vision of a wireless "National InformationInfrastructure" (NII).     Even if wide-area licensed data approaches never grow into amarket of millions, the promise of unlicensed systems ensures that aconsiderable amount of data will travel over airwaves in the future.     Following is a summary of the more impressive trends and newsstories covered by WDN over the past year--the stories that are likelyto have significance in the coming year.  ...Circuit-Switched Data Solutions Are Made Practical     Even as packet data networks struggled in the marketplace,circuit-switched cellular slowly increased its subscriber base.  It isdifficult to differentiate circuit-switched voice and data trafficover a network, but cellular carriers believe that their circuit-switched data traffic is far heavier today than on any other wide-areawireless data network.     "I think in circuit-switched [in 1995] we did phenomenally.  Ithink we put on more circuit-switched users than Ardis and RAM [newcustomers] combined," said Sue Major, director-wireless data andpaging, Ameritech Cellular Services.     Along with the obvious coverage advantages, circuit-switched datapopularity is advanced by a number of technical developments.  Modempools from 3Com Primary Access and AT&T Paradyne have been or are inthe process of being installed in major U.S. markets.  Not only do thesystems smooth the way for circuit-switched data communications, butthey provide gateways for intercommunication with other networks, suchas the circuit-switched/CDPD interface approved by the CDPD Forum lastsummer.Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996WIDE AREA NETWORKS     Many carriers, especially Ameritech, have had positive reactionsto the AirCommunicator, an integrated cellular voice/datamessaging/fax device developed by Air Communications Inc., SantaClara, Calif.  The communicator comes bundled with Air Communications'"AirTrue" protocol, designed to simplify circuit-switched cellulardata transmission at 14.4 kilobits per second without having to routethrough a modem pool.     Ameritech signed a distribution agreement for the AirCommunicatorlast fall.  The first shipments are expected to begin within weeks.  ...SkyTel Launches First Two-Way Paging Service     SkyTel Corp., a subsidiary of Mobile TelecommunicationTechnologies Corp. (Mtel), became the first national narrowbandpersonal communications service (PCS) carrier, taking advantage of anFCC pioneers preference license awarded to Mtel.  That gave SkyTel ahead start over companies that won narrowband PCS licenses at auctionin 1994.     A wide variety of applications are possible over narrowband PCSchannels, including e-mail access, faxing, voice paging, point-of-saletransactions and telemetry.  However, "short messaging will be the keyapplication," said SkyTel President Jai Bhagat during the WirelessApps '95 conference in October, just a few weeks after the SkyTelservice began operation.       SkyTel operates with Motorola Inc.'s ReFLEXion 50 two-way pagingplatform.  By the time other national and regional narrowband PCSoperators are ready to come on line, there should be at least onerival technology.  AT&T Wireless Services is working with PacificCommunications Sciences Inc. (PCSI), San Diego, to develop personalair communications technology (pACT), which, unlike ReFLEXion, willoperate with equal forward and return channels, allowing users to sendand receive longer messages.     An Israeli-based company, Nexus Telecommunications Systems Ltd.,is testing a technology that would allow conventional one-way pagingcarriers to get a piece of the two-way market.  Forward short messagesare sent over the paging network.  Acknowledgments in the form ofshort canned responses are returned over the unlicensed 902-928 MHzband.  Test systems have been established in Chicago, Minneapolis andOrlando, Fla.  A consumer market test is planned for early 1996.  ...New Voice/Data Handsets Previewed     PCSI says it will begin offering an integrated voice/CDPD deviceby the second quarter of 1996.  The PCSI device and similar productsthat are under development by other companies will form a whole newcategory of communicators which PCSI calls "personal access links"(PALs).  They will be multifunctional devices designed with a heavyemphasis on the communications features.     Early personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheldcomputer devices have not been successful in the marketplace becausetheir communications functions did not work well, many industryanalysts have said.  PCSI says that a number of devices introduced inthe last year, such as Motorola Inc.'s Envoy and Marco PDAs and pagersdeveloped for narrowband PCS, already fall within the PAL definition.     The data phone will resemble "Simon," a voice/circuit-switcheddata/page communicator designed by IBM Corp. and marketed by BellSouthCellular, which fared poorly after its 1994 introduction.  The PCSIphone will be significantly smaller, lighter and less costly(approximately $600 compared to over $1,000 for Simon).  It alsopotentially could perform more applications.     Users, for example, could get the latest stock values using CDPDor access a data base to view a simple chart on the phone's liquidcrystal display.  The phone will e-mail short CDPD messages and alertthe user when a longer message is waiting.  The phone connects tolaptop computers and can act as a regular circuit-switched/CDPD modem.Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996THE WIRELESS LAN INDUSTRY ORGANIZES     The technology for data transmission over unlicensed bands at 915MHz and 2.4 GHz improved in 1995.  A wide choice of frequency hoppingand direct sequence wireless local area networks (LANs) are availableand wireless bridges and routers were introduced for increasing out-of-doors coverage.  New unlicensed data options at 1910-1920 MHz and2390-2400 MHz soon will be available.     But many potential customers do not know about the wirelessoptions.   System developers, recognizing the problem, have begundiscussing the formation of an industry group dedicated to promotingwireless LANs.  Discussions began among several companies in the fall,including 3Com Corp., IBM Wireless Communications, Proxim Inc. andSolectek Corp.  However, the talks are still at an early stage andformation of the group could take several more weeks, people near thegroup said.     At the same time, a group of five companies--Digital EquipmentCorp.; Perfsoft Inc.; Raytheon Co.; Telxon Corp., and Cushcraft Corp.(antenna system manufacturer)--formed the Wireless LAN Research Lab onthe campus of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester,Mass.  The lab is planned as an ongoing project to refine datacommunications over unlicensed bands, including performance testing,benchmark development and development of new site planning techniques.     The group is designing a wireless LAN test bed to conduct itsresearch. The test bed is being built with funds from a NationalScience Foundation grant awarded to WPI's Center for WirelessInformation Network Studies.  ...FCC Authorizes Equipment Sales for Unlicensed PCS     Wireless campus-area voice systems now are available from a fewvendors, including Ericsson and Northern Telecom, for operation overthe newly opened unlicensed personal communications band.  All currentsystems are operating over the 1920-1930 MHz isochronous PCS band. Later systems, expected to be FCC-approved and available by mid-1996,will be integrated voice/data systems which will also operate over the1910-1920 asynchronous band.     The FCC cleared the way for the new systems last May by approvinga frequency coordination plan submitted by UTAM Inc. in summer 1994. UTAM has divided the United States, county by county, into areas thatimmediately can begin unlicensed PCS operations (Zone 1) and areaswhere operations can begin only after the incumbent microwavelicensees in or near 1910-1930 MHz relocate.  UTAM is collecting feeson equipment sales in Zone 1 to apply to relocation expenses in Zone2.     It is expected to take several years to completely clear the bandfor unlicensed PCS.  The process is likely to be hastened in manyareas by adjacent broadband PCS licensees that also are engaging inmicrowave relocation talks.  UTAM will be benefitted by many of thosethird-party relocations.  The group will, however, be required toreimburse third parties for a share of the relocation costs.     In comments on the FCC's proposed microwave relocation rules,UTAM asked for flexibility in its repayment schedule.  Cost-sharingshould take effect after a third party assists in clearing all 1910-1930 MHz microwave licensees in a county, UTAM said.  The obligationalso could begin once UTAM raises the Zone 1 maximum power level orreclassifies a Zone 2 area to Zone 1.  ...Apple and WINForum Propose New Unlicensed Services     As early as this spring FCC could respond to petitions toestablish a new set of unlicensed data transmission services inunlicensed 5 GHz frequencies.  Apple Computer Corp. of Cupertino,Calif., proposed reallocating 300 MHz (5150-5300 MHz and 5725-5875MHz) for an NII band--a wireless component to the types of servicesbeing discussed by the federal government's NII Council.     Apple suggested a short-range (6-9 miles), point-to-pointtechnology operating at high speeds of 24 megabits per second (Mbps)to support applications not currently available over wireless datanetworks.  Eventually, unlicensed terminals could be linked to form anational communications service, Apple said, although the emphasis ofthe petition was on community-wide communications.     The FCC received a petition similar to Apple's from the WirelessInformation Networks Forum (WINForum), an organization of Washington-based communications lawyers and engineers.  WINForum's "SUPERNet"proposal is for use of 250 MHz (5100-5350 MHz) with less emphasis onout-of-doors communications.     Both Apple and WINForum propose compatibility with the EuropeanHIPERLAN technology as a platform on which to build even moresophisticated wireless capabilities.  Many European countries have setaside 100 MHz (5150-5250 MHz) for HIPERLAN, which is designed for 24Mbps operation in a campus-area environment.  However, a considerableamount of development still is being done on the European system.  Thefirst commercial HIPERLAN deployments are not likely to occur in 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996IN BRIEF     Digital Ocean, portable computer and personal digital assistant(PDA) manufacturer, this week at the MacWorld 1996 conference in SanFrancisco is introducing "Seahorse," a new line of rugged PDAs meantfor industrial wireless applications.  Seahorse devices, which arebased on the Newton OS 2.0 platform, are available in integrated CDPDand 915 MHz wireless local area network versions.  The system also canbe configured for infrared communications, global system for mobilecommunication links as well as global positioning service.  Thecomplete package sells for under $2,000.  Digital Ocean has scheduledthe CDPD version for the first deliveries which will be in mid-1996. (Digital Ocean, 913/888-3380.)     Wireless Telecom Inc. (WTI), Aurora, Colo., says that it is ableto sell circuit-switched and CDPD data on a national basis aftersigning new reseller contracts with several carriers last month. Companies needing the ability to integrate different circuit-switchedand packet data applications nationwide can now deal with one entity--WTI--for all hardware, software and service needs.  New contracts withAmeritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet authorize WTI resellersto offer CDPD and circuit-switched service from those carriers.  Arestructured contract with Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile adds a number ofmarkets, including Washington and Philadelphia, to an agreement thatalready included New York and Boston.  Existing agreements with AT&TWireless Services and L.A. Cellular, a Southern California partnershipof AT&T and BellSouth Cellular Corp., complete WTI's national reach,the company says.  (WTI, 303/338-4200.)Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS DATA NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996ARDIS BELIEVES CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT TO EXPAND APPEAL TO MOBILEPROFESSIONALS     E-mail software now is bundled and attractively packaged witheasy-to-use PC Cards.  The software itself is more user friendly. Devices designed for mobile e-mail links are coming down in price--slowly.  The environment is right for a more aggressive appeal tomobile professionals to try wireless data, executives at MotorolaInc.'s Ardis packet radio service believe.     "Ardis historically has loaded its network through the verticalmarketplace," said Dan Croft, Ardis senior vice president-marketingoperations.  The year-end 1995 subscriber total was about 50,000.  Atthe highest, 10 percent percent of that figure is made up of mobileprofessionals, Croft said.     But he is encouraged about the chances of increasing that per-centage through developments such as AirMobile, one of five e-mailsoftware applications supported by Ardis.  AirMobile allows Lotuscc:Mail to run seamlessly over the wireless network.  "We don't askthe user to relearn a software program, which we think issignificant," Croft said.     Ardis last month simplified the pricing of its e-mail packages inan effort to attract mobile professionals.  The four "DataPak" plansbased on kilobytes used per month (see chart) replace more complicatedpacket-based pricing. Usersthat exceed their basic kilobyte allotments will be charged 54 centsper kilobyte in all plans.

Ardis plans to apply the same pricing to other futuremobile professional applications.     Croft, who worked in the cellular industry during its early days,sees similarities in wireless data today.  Cellular phones originallywere called cellular "radios," but carriers found it easier to marketthem as "telephones."  "We're trying to achieve the same process [withArdis].  If you know how to use cc:Mail, you'll know how to use awireless link," he said.

(Advanced Radio Data InformationService) announced that they have reduced the service fees for theRadioMail wireless messaging service over ARDIS' wireless datanetwork.  The new rates went into effect Jan. 1 of this year.     Mark Elderkin, RadioMail's director of marketing, said heexpects the new rates to help spur subscriber growth, which wasless than stellar in 1995 (WMR, Dec. 5, p. 2) but started to pickup toward the end of the year.     Users subscribing to RadioMail via the ARDIS network will becharged $10 per month, plus usage fees of 5 cents per kilobyte (1kilobyte equals 1,000 characters).  ARDIS also charges 54 cents foreach kilobyte above the amount allocated in the subscriber's plan,but RadioMail said the typical subscription, including ARDIS MobileOffice air-time rates, starts at about $30 per month.  ARDIS is areseller of RadioMail.     The RadioMail service also is available on the RAM Mobile DataInc. wireless data network.  RadioMail buys capacity from RAM andresells the RAM network service to customers, along with itsRadioMail messaging service.  Elderkin said his company isnegotiating with RAM to lower its access rates, but no change isimmediately forthcoming.  As a result, RadioMail via ARDIScurrently is a somewhat better deal for subscribers, though thedifference in cost is not terribly significant, he said.     RadioMail charges $39 per month for 100,000 characters sentover the RAM network, plus 16 cents for each block of 500characters beyond 100,000.     The messaging service is expected as well to be available overseveral cellular digital packet data (CDPD) networks when cellularcarriers, such as Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet,begin offering CDPD services in the first half of this year (WMR,Dec. 5, p. 2).Competitor Plans to Lower Rates     RadioMail's primary competition is Wynd Communications Corp.,a subsidiary of Calif.-based Call America Business CommunicationsCorp., which offers Internet access, integrated services digitalnetwork (ISDN) service, toll-free 800-numbers and long distanceservices (WMR, Feb. 14, p. 1).  The company's WyndMail offering,which uses the RAM Mobile Data network to provide wireless e-mailservices bundled with paging, voice mail, text messaging, remotelocal area network (LAN) mail access and other such services,starts at a flat rate of $49 per month for 50 messages of 1,000characters each, with a usage fee of 29 cents for each messagebeyond 50.     However, a Wynd Communications spokesman told WMR that Wynd,too, is in the process of negotiating these rates with RAM MobileData in an attempt to reduce charges associated with WyndMail, andpossibly to change the rate structure as well.Wynd May Again Charge by Kilobytes     Like RadioMail's current rate structure on the ARDIS network,Wynd used to charge on the basis of kilobytes transmitted, butrecently switched to charging by characters.  However, according tothe spokesman, "a kilobyte plan is better for the customer,"because it charges for aggregate data usage rather than for blocksof characters.  Consequently, Wynd may go back to providing thekilobyte plan for WyndMail, and an announcement regarding rates andrate structures can be expected in the near future, the spokesmansaid.     RadioMail is based in San Mateo, Calif., and can be reached at(800) 597-6245 or (415) 904-7070, ext. 263.  ARDIS can be reachedat its Lincolnshire, Ill., headquarters at (708) 913-1215.

The bad news is that thestocks of the wireless companies tracked by WMR seem to have peakedin September, with the other major indices also showing signs offatigue.     The 50 stocks that now make up the WMR Index (Telsoft MobileData Inc. ceased trading a month ago) were down by about 2.2percent in December - only their second monthly decline of theyear.  There were 20 advances, 28 declines and two stocks unchangedduring the final month of 1995.     The closing prices for Dec. 29, 1995, and their comparisons toNov. 30, 1995, and Dec. 30, 1994, are listed in the index on p. 9. The same is done for the major stock indices in the chart below.     The stocks suffered a bruising fourth quarter, posting a 5.1percent decline over the period.  They did, however, gain 8.1percent in the first quarter of 1995, followed by 15.7 percent inthe second quarter and 14.5 percent in the third quarter.  Thatleaves them up by 30 percent for the year as a whole.     The charts on pp. 8 and 10 indicate top gainers and declinersfor the past month and for the past year, while Tables 1-8 on p. 11highlight the leaders and laggards within each of the four quartersof 1995.     As the line chart on p. 4 suggests, the WMR Index hit its peakthree months ago.  At the end of September, the WMR Index stood at1805.  It ended the year at 1713.  Nevertheless, it began 1995 at1261, which, after adjustments for stocks that entered and exitedduring the period, indicates there was a 30 percent gain for theyear as a whole.     During the same yearlong period, the Dow Jones Industrialaverage was up 33 percent.  The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 34percent in 1995, and the NASDAQ Composite grew by 40 percent.     Compared to two years ago, the Dow actually is up by thehighest percentage of the four indices.  Since the final tradingday of 1993, the Dow is up 36 percent, while the NASDAQ is up 35percent, the WMR Index is up 33 percent and the S&P 500 is up 32percent.     The Dow closed 1995 at a level of 5117.1.  The NASDAQ endedthe year at 1052.1, and the S&P 500 finished at 615.9.  They beganthe year, respectively, at 3834.4, 752.0 and 459.3, and eachcontinuously set new records toward the end of the year.     As the data in the line chart on p. 4 illustrate, the WMRIndex and the three major indices dipped in mid-1994, recovered bythe end of the year and spent most of 1995 on a steady decline. Taking the levels of each in December 1993 as a base point, theircourses through the past two years show how each fared month tomonth.     Interestingly, each registered two monthly declines in 1995and 10 advances.  For the Dow 30 and the S&P 500, the declines camein August and October.  For the NASDAQ and the WMR Index, thedeclines came in October and December.     Over the past two years, the biggest monthly gain for the WMRIndex (+9.4 percent) came in July 1995.  The biggest monthlydecline came in March 1994, when it fell 6.0 percent.  That alsowas the worst month of the past 24 for the three major stockindices.  Meanwhile, the Dow's and S&P 500's best month wasNovember 1995, while the NASDAQ's biggest percentage gain came inJune 1995.Showings in December     Only three stocks were up by more than 10 percent duringDecember.  Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. topped the gainerlist with a 16.5 percent advance, closing the year at $37, justfractions of a point below its new high.  The stock, which begantrading in February at about $15, fell as low as $11.50 beforestaging a comeback in November.     Sony Corp., another company whose stock suffered through theearly and middle months of 1995, also closed 1995 on a high note. It closed December at $61.38 a share, up $7.50 a share from a monthbefore, but up only $5.25 from a year ago.  Still, it was one ofthe Top 10 gainers in December.  BellSouth Corp., which also setnew highs at the end of 1995, was up $4.63 for the month and up$16.44 a share for the year.     There were an unlucky 13 stocks down by more than 10 percentduring the month.  They include the 10 listed in the chart on p. 8,plus Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc., Racotek Inc., and GrupoIusacell SA de CV.  The biggest decline was Cirrus Logic Inc.,which fell $9.25 during the month and $2.75 for the year.  Thecompany simply fell out of bed in the past few months, decliningfrom a high of $61.13 a share to a low of $11.13, before recoveringto $19.75 by year's end.  In the fourth quarter, the stock declined65.5 percent, edging out Retix and Nokia Corp. for that dubiousdistinction.     Nokia, meanwhile, closed the year at $39 a share, up $1.50from a year ago but more than $30 below its recent highs of thesummer months.  It announced some sluggish results for its cellulartelephone operations and the market drove the stock down.  This isa company that continuously has led the monthly gainers lists.  Infact, it's still more than triple its price of December 1993.  Butit's up only 4 percent for 1995, after adjusting for a stock split.     Another former high flyer, wireless modem maker U.S. RoboticsInc., also has turned on the fasten-seat belt sign.  It's down$22.50 a share in December, which sounds bad until one realizesthey were up $17.50 in November and $7.25 in October.  So it'sreally trading at its September price, give or take a few dollars. And it remains the top performer for the year, having quadrupledsince the end of 1994.     Other top gainers for the year include Bolt Beranek and NewmanInc. (BBN), Microcom Inc. and Pronet Inc.  Each has more thandoubled in price during the past year, although Pronet fell $1.25a share during the final month of the year.8 CDPD Carriers Outperform Market     Eight wireless data and/or cellular digital packet data (CDPD)carriers outperformed the market as a whole, meaning their stocksappreciated by more than the 30 percent to 34 percent of thegeneral indices.  The top-performing carrier was BellSouth, up$16.44 a share or 60.7 percent, followed by NYNEX Corp., AmeritechCorp., GTE Corp., Sprint Corp., MCI Communications Corp.,Southwestern Bell (SBC Communications Inc.) and Bell Atlantic Corp.     There were nine companies down by more than 10 percent for theyear.  In fact, there were 13 decliners and 37 advancers for theyear as a whole.  The big losers for the year were Retix and GrupoIusacell.  Grupo Iusacell can at least blame the Mexican economyand the run on the peso for its woes.  But Retix is in its 23rdmonth of decline, falling from a price of $10.38 in January 1994. It closed 1995 at $2.13 a share, down $1.88 for the year and 6cents for the month.     Tables 1-8 on the facing page highlight the top gainers anddecliners in each of the quarters of 1995.  Interestingly, only 14companies scored advances in every quarter, and nine of them arecellular or wireless data carriers - some of the same names thattopped the list in the chart above.Perfect Quarterly Scores     The companies with perfect quarterly scores are Ameritech;Bell Atlantic; BellSouth; BBN; GTE; Hewlett-Packard Co.; MCI;NYNEX; Pronet; Rockwell International Corp.; SBC; Southern NewEngland Telecommunications Inc. (SNET); Sprint; and U.S. Robotics. However, only BBN and U.S. Robotics were consistently above averagefor each of the four quarters.     Average growth in the first quarter was 8.1 percent.  In thesecond quarter, stock price growth averaged 15.7 percent.  In thethird quarter, prices were up 14.5 percent.  And in the finalquarter, the average share price decline was 5.1 percent.     Racotek nearly doubled its price in the first quarter.  CirrusLogic was a top performer during the first and second quarters. Globalstar took the top spot in the third and fourth quarters. U.S. Robotics was second or third for the first three quarters,though it fell out of the Top 10 (to 18th place) in the finalquarter.     No company suffered four quarterly declines in 1995, but threestocks were down for three out of the four.  They were:  AllTelCorp., Apple Computer Inc. and Samsung Ltd.  In addition, AmericanPaging Inc. and Nextel Communications Inc. suffered two quarterlydeclines plus one quarter in which their stock price was unchanged.     Besides the aforementioned hammering that Cirrus Logic took inthe fourth quarter, Intelligent Electronics Inc.'s 37.6 percentdecline in the third quarter and Iusacell's 36.2 percent decline inthe first quarter are the biggest quarterly declines of the year.     During the first three quarters of the year past, there werethree or four stocks in period that were down by more than 10percent.  In fact, in two quarters, only eight stocks declined atall, making a Top 10 Decliner list impossible, as Tables 4 and 6prove.     In the fourth quarter, however, there were only 22 gainers and28 decliners.  Of those, 21 declined by more than 10 percent.  Onlythe Top 10 are listed in Table 8.     Among the decliners of the fourth quarter, one common themeemerges.  Investors began to reassess the outlook for cutting-edgecompanies and their respective technologies, trimming back theirexpectations for companies such as Mobile TelecommunicationTechnologies Corp.

In a recent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "seriousinterference" to the communications operations of light rail andbus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.     The letter was made public by UTC, the TelecommunicationsAssociation, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representingincumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz(GHz) spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying ithad distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.     Anne Schelle, APC's vice president of external affairs,expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems toother spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators hasbeen a contentious issue since the Federal CommunicationsCommission first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licensees to clearthat band to make way for new PCS licensees.  The commissionrecently clarified rules adopted in the Engineering and TechnologyDocket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining"good faith" negotiations over relocation issues between licensees(WMR, Oct. 24, p. 6).Interruptions a 'Grave Threat'     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions lastfall upon which APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transitcommunications systems.  "These communications interruptions haveposed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27, 1995, letterstated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costsincurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesmanAnthony Brown declined to comment further on the interferenceproblems, noting that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."     Schelle told WMR that interference problems with the masstransit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported nopublic-safety problems resulting from interference between the tworadio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility torespond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, theattorney added.     The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APCplanned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failedto respond to a single one.     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordinationnotices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCSlicensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informedof the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APCfully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license andcould not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA isoperating at a variance from those parameters."Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS MESSAGING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 16, 1996COURT SHOULD CONSIDER Mtel LICENSE SEPARATELY, FCC SAYS     The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has told the U.S.Court of Appeals in Washington that it should not consider thecommission's licensing scheme for private paging licensees in itsdeliberations on whether Mobile Telecommunication TechnologiesCorp. (Mtel) should pay for a license obtained through the agency's"pioneer's preference" program.     Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no. 94-1552,Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the commission's authority tocharge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowband personalcommunications services (PCS) license without first receivingcongressional authority (WMR, Dec. 10, p. 5).     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the companyshould not have to pay for its two-way paging license because theFCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that willcompete with Mtel.  The court had requested supportingdocumentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paginglicenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.'Others Paid Substantially at Auction'     "Mtel is a licensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) ina newly allocated frequency band," the agency explained, addingthat all other licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paidsubstantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advancedtwo-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did notapply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," itsaid.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts ofmoney to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenseswere 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that thecommission is applying different rules to identical licenses," theagency added.Back to Headline List CopyrightWIRELESS MESSAGING REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 16, 1996MobileComm PROVIDING NATIONWIDE SINGLE-FREQUENCY PAGING     MobileMedia Corp. has completed its previously announcedacquisition of BellSouth Corp.'s paging subsidiary, MobileComm, andits narrowband personal communications services (PCS) licenses for$930 million (WMR, Sept. 25, p. 6).

The frequency is in the 900 megahertz PCSband for which MobileComm owns licenses nationwide.     "This [will be] a significant benefit for our retailers andthe consumer," said Bill Stark, MobileComm's executive director ofretail distribution.  "By offering the one frequency, multicityretail chains will be able to reduce the number of SKUs[stock-keeping units] stocked in their warehouses while providinga wider range of services....

Noting the visitors, corporate attire,employees figure these are legitimate businessmen on their wayto a company meeting. They couldn't be more wrong. Surprisingeveryone, the suit and tie executives suddenly pull outautomatic weapons and order employees to lie on the floor. Ina few terrifying minutes, they pillage the company'scomputers, remove valuable memory chips and flee withcomponents having an estimated value of $5 to $12 million!This latest chapter in an ongoing story of internationalintrigue is not a scene from a James Bond movie. Californiaand is merely a small part of the disturbing trend of risingcomputer theft and other "Techno-Crime."In California's Silicon Valley alone, it is estimated that $1million in components are lost to Techno-Thievery each week.Worldwide, overall costs to electronics and insurance firmsare approaching a staggering $8 billion a year and areexpected to soar to $200 billion by the year 2000, accordingto the Technology Theft Prevention Foundation in Clinton, NewJersey.The Foundation was started by insurance companies who, afterpaying out millions in computer theft claims, wanted todevelop ways to curtail the rising Techno-Crime Wave.According to FBI and other law enforcement agencies who areworking with the Foundation, Techno-Crime can come in manyforms that may or may not be considered thievery. But as faras theft is concerned, although everything from motherboardsto modems and disk drives are targeted by Techno-Thieves, CPUs(Central Processing Units) and SIMs (Single In-Line MemoryModules) represent the crown jewels of computer theft."Basically, these parts are non-traceable, said Keith Lowry,sergeant for the San Jose Police Department. "They are veryliquid just like gold, and the market for resale is fantasticbecause there aren't enough products to go around;It's big business and it's opportunistic," Lowry noted.Manufacturers and consumers alike are being short changedbecause Techno-Crime is having a substantial effect on thequality of available memory products on both the wholesale andretail markets.Although electronic and computer buyers believe they aregetting a good deal, they are frequently getting ripped-off.And the Techno-Crime Crime itself is sometimes not an obviousone, such as that mentioned in the beginning of this story;often the crime is difficult to identify and the price paidcan't be quantified--but consumers are paying the price. Forexample, consumers are often attracted to flashy packaging,which shows a product in its best light. Upon closerinspection, however, the product within may not live up to theadvance billing given on the box. It is not uncommon for themodule inside not to have been manufactured or assembled bythe company shown. It is important that the consumer knows whothe real manufacturer of the product is and that it is areputable company--one that is respected throughout theindustry, no t just at the store on the corner."Everybody and their brother is slapping together cheap littlememory products," explained Jim Wong, president of MicroSolutions, Inc., in Corvallis, Ore., designer of systems forhighly demanding users with specialized applications. "Youhave to be very careful about who you buy from and what youbuy." cautioned Wong. "I've heard horror stories from peoplewho haven't been, but are now our customers because they canconstantly rely upon the quality we provide," Wong said.With SIMMs comprising up to 50% of a computer system's cost,and providing much of the computing power, the quality ofmemory has become paramount, which has been a boon tomanufacturers putting emphasis on quality.One such firm is Century Microelectronics, Inc., in SantaClara, California. Century, an industry leader in themanufacture of computer memory, has implemented extra measuresto ensure its memory modules maintain the highest qualitystandards.One way Century does this is by dealing directly with only thelargest, most reputable DRAM manufacturers who have strictinternal controls. Century then adds its own qualityprotective measures. For example, each assembled module bearsthe Century name to insure strict accountability. The consumercan clearly identify that the module has been assembled byCentury and not another third party manufacturer with lowerstandards. Unless the circuit board manufacturer puts theirname on the board as Century does, there is virtually no wayto trace the product back to the manufacturer when troublesarise.Companies like Century use the highest quality components notjust in the DRAM, but in the design and manufacture of the PCboard as well. This philosophy has so far served companieslike Century well in the marketplace where wholesalers,retailers and consumers have voiced concern over the affect ofTechno-Crime on overall product quality. "A big part of mybusiness is the ability to give my customers the reliabilitythat they are getting a first rate part," said Gary Barlow,owner of RAMTECH in Boulder, Colo., the computer memorysupplier to a majority of users in that area."Most of the time price is not the issue as long as you'rereasonable," Barlow explained citing his reason for relying onCentury as his prime memory supplier. "I've been in thisbusiness a long time and I believe Century has the highestquality parts available," he said. Micro Solutions' Wong whooften utilizes Century products because of their inherentreliability, agreed with Barlow on stressing quality. "We'rejust a small company so what's really important is who ourclients are and the type of machines that we configure," Wongexplained. "We have some pretty major clients like HewlettPackard who buy our memory products for insertion into theirown machines so quality is very important to us."To less scrupulous suppliers, however, price, not quality, isthe primary motivator. Because of competition from makers ofcheap "clone" systems, keeping costs down has become paramountto both supplier and manufacturer. In this market climate,even well known original equipment manufacturers (OEMS)sometimes offer to buy back old memory chips as credit towardsnew memory purchases. These suppliers then reuse the memory,which, since it is used, has a shorter life cycle.While this might not appear to be an obvious Techno-Crime tothe consumer, such as armed theft or the like, it is, in factTechno-Crime in its worst form because while the monetary costis just as severe, the crime itself is all but impossible todetect.Another factor in the link is when OEMs put pressure on chipsuppliers to step-up production so that increasing marketdemand can be met. To please their OEM customers, memorybrokers with limited resources are often tempted to purchasesubstandard parts in the "gray market" because they are beingoffered a deal that is too good to pass up.Of particular concern to manufacturers is that substandardparts within the gray market have often failed to test to"grade All specification and instead of ending up as scrap orin a lower performance non-computer application as intended,the y often end up in machines where they are not up to thetask.A chip that shows a 60 nanosecond (60ns) rating, for instance,could really only be able to perform up to a 70ns level.Pressed for time, unscrupulous suppliers can't be botheredwith checking for quality so substandard memory batches areeither mixed with those having passed inspection, or aresimply remarked with the higher rating that OEMs require.To remark a product, third party manufacturers will actuallysand the identifying marks off of chips, remark them so thatthey appear to be higher performance chips than they actuallyare, and resell them to unsuspecting buyers. Themanufacturers, then, end up installing the lower qualitycomponents in their machines because many trust their memorydistributors to bench test the chips. But unfortunately, manydistributors in need of quick revenue unload the componentswithout testing them. Installed in machines they weren'tintended for, these parts fail immediately, or after a fewmonths of use.And while a substandard chip may only cause a computerized toyto go haywire, it could just as well put a glitch into thenavigational system of a commercial airliner or cause asurgical device to malfunction, putting patients at risk. Evenif only a small percentage of available computer chips arefaulty, but are resold as acceptable, the implications arefrightening.Because popular new software programs require more memory thanever to operate efficiently, technology market analysts saythe demand for memory modules is likely to remain higher thanthe supply. Manufacturers will probably continue to experienceperiodic chip shortages which will drive up the value ofmemory modules, and drive more OEMs into the gray market.Consumers should understand that they can easily fall victimto Techno-Thievery without realizing it because Techno-Crimesare not always obvious. Unless buyers take extra precautionsto ensure the quality of the product they are buying, they runthe risk of purchasing substandard components that could notbe able to perform up to advertised specifications, or couldfail altogether causing disastrous results.In light of all this, consumer awareness is increasing and thedemand for superior computer components from the highestquality manufacturers is expected to be greater than ever.For further information, call John W.

Some additional engineering support is being providedby the Volvo/GM Heavy Truck Div. The National Private Truck Council(Alexandria, VA) assisted in selecting the test vehicles.The NHTSA is supporting a program to combat drowsy driving, withparticular emphasis on heavy trucks because of the severe damagethese accidents cause, and the toll in human lives they extract.Over the years, surveys have shown that drowsiness, related fatigueand inattention are the major causes of truck driver fatalities.Since mid-1995, CMRI scientists have been assessing, testing anddeveloping effective drowsy driver sensor technologies.  At the endof the project they hope to have available a set of functionalspecifications for drowsy driver alert systems that can bemanufactured for use, first in trucks, and later in cars.Richard Grace (Tel: 412/268-3493) of the CMRI Advanced Devices andMaterials Group, and project co-director, said this is a two phaseeffort.  Phase I, now in progress, involves selection of sensors,systems engineering and reliability testing and finally,installation in the selected test vehicles.  Two physicalprototypes are being produced, and will, of course, be subject tofurther modification depending upon the outcome of testing.Phase II, starting in June and running until mid-1997, will consistof data collection under actual over-the-road conditions andrelating this information to previously developed drowsinessmeasurements.Grace said the prototype system will be comprised of a black boxinstalled next to the driver's seat, a sensor on the steeringcolumn, two video cameras (one to scan the driver's face along witha video recorder to capture reactions and another pointed out thewindow), a floor-mounted accelerometer, a powerful on-boardcomputer to store test data, and an audio warning device possiblydashboard-mounted.There also will be a video-based lane position sensor with aPentium processor.  This is the same unit that was developed byCarnegie Mellon's Robotics Lab, and which was featured prominentlyin last year's "No Hands Across America" trial (ATTN, September1995).These modules will communicate with each other through an Echelon(Palo Alto, CA) LanWorks communications bus.  The several modules,while being designed as stand-alone systems, will interact with oneanother as a distributed control system.The three main units will "decide" if the driver is drowsy, andthen relay this information to an independent warning system,possibly an audio device that will alert the driver.  Grace notedthat the system modules are basically simple, inexpensive toproduce and could have multiple uses in the truck.In June, with all component testing completed, the system will beinstalled in two tractor trailers supplied by Averitt Express(Cookeville, TN).  Averitt specializes in package delivery withmany of its runs taking place between midnight and 8:00 AM.  Thetest vehicles will be based at the company's Charlotte, NCterminal.In this second phase, the sensor system's ability to alert or evenrouse drivers will be thoroughly evaluated.  As part of theprocess, a camera will document lane departures, and steeringcolumn sensors will document erratic or jerky movements.  Thisinformation will be correlated with data obtained from thephysiological and psychological measures that relate to thedriver's state of alertness, e.g., eye movement and eye closing.Grace added that researchers developed drowsiness "standards"through videotapes of drivers' eyes.  In other words, thepercentage of time they are open or closed.  For example, whensomeone is sleepy, normal blinks which last about a millisecond,are extended and a person can unknowingly end up with eyes closedabout 15% of the time. Kind of scary when driving a 16-wheeleralong a crowded interstate at maximum speed.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MLANS CouldPrevent AccidentsNichols Research Corp. (NRC, 251 Edgewater Dr., Wakefield, MA02146) is working with a technology that could provide computersolutions to complicated problems not likely to be solved by pastartificial intelligence approaches.The Maximum Likelihood Adaptive Neural System (MLANS), wasoriginally funded by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization(BMDO - 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-7100) for "StarWars" space-based uses.  Actual work started some seven years agowhen BMDO was looking for a way to automatically recognize targetsin clutter and noise.NRC is currently developing a number of system applications basedon this technology.  Of primary interest to the ITS universe is thework being done on MLANS-based collision avoidance systems andcomputer-assisted road navigation systems.  These were demonstratedduring a recent test of unmanned Army vehicles.MLANS analyzes sensor data streams and adaptively classifies andtracks objects of interest while suppressing clutter and noise.The system used supplied object models and adapted them to changingenvironments, or adaptively constructed statistical models of whatobjects looked like, then refined the models as it sorted throughthe stream of image data being received.  The recent testsdemonstrated the feasibility of road tracking on dirt, gravel andpaved surfaces as well as areas that were shaded and leaf covered.According to Leonid Perlovsky (Tel: 617/246-4200), NRC's chiefscientist, the unmanned navigation vehicle technology has not asyet been tested under actual highway conditions.  He noted that hiscompany's efforts are still in the development stage and anycommercial offerings are still some years away.  Perlovsky alsosaid this point can't be reached without significant investment andat present, there is no way of knowing what kinds of dollars willbe required.In taking a closer look at the technology involved, neural networksare computer systems that can recognize an object by "learning"from previous experiences or input.  Their design uses theprinciple of brain organization--a large number of interconnectedprocessing elements called neurons.  Neural networks are attractivebecause they can be created without the lengthy and tedious processof eliciting rules from human experts and then coding them into acomputer.The MLANS, as developed by NRC, solves the long-standing artificialintelligence problem of combining adaptive learning with priorknowledge by using a priori models in a neural architecture.  Withfuzzy logic, each piece of data is associated with the appropriatea priori model.MLANS has been coded in a variety of programming languages,including FORTRAN and C, and runs on any number of systems,including personal computers.In addition to ITS applications, MLANS-based systems have potentialuses for law enforcement agencies and can also be used for medicaldiagnostics, oil exploration, or for locating objects under foliageand in heavy clutter.Perlovsky cited the development, for NASA research and rescueoperations, of an MLANS-based detection algorithm to find smallaircraft that might have crashed in heavily wooded areas.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Military TechnologyMakes Smart TrailersMilitary communications technology originally designed to "get themessage through" in spite of jamming and other battlefield signalinterference will soon be used to locate and track trailers onAmerica's highways.QUALCOMM Inc., (6455 Lusk Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/587-1121) has signed an exclusive development and supply contract withElisra Electronic Systems Ltd. (29 Hamerkava St., Holon, Israel),a subsidiary of Tadiran Ltd. (575 Lexington Ave., 21st Fl., NewYork, NY 10022; Tel: 212/751-3600), for communications hardware forUntethered TrailerTRACS, QUALCOMM's new trailer tracking system.The "TRACS" stands for Thin Route (low data rate) Alpha NumericCommunications System.The agreement also gives QUALCOMM exclusive resale rights in thiscountry for trailer tracking applications with rights to extendworldwide and to include other specific markets such as barges andtrains.According to Jim Clifford, QUALCOMM OmniTRACS Div. director of newproduct development, this is representative of Elisra's efforts tointroduce, into the commercial marketplace, technology originallydeveloped for military applications.Untethered TrailerTRACS itself should be commercially availableduring the fourth quarter this year. Standard price for a singletrailer system is expected to be $790.  The basic monitoring ratewill be about $10/unit/month.Clifford said prototypes are now being tested and evaluated, andone goal will be the ability to track a trailer within 1500 ft.  Healso noted that an optional GPS capability will be available totrack within 300 ft.  Designed to QUALCOMM's specifications, theunit is about the size of a book and measures 8 in. by 4.9 in. x2.4 in.  Enclosed in an ABS case, it can operate within atemperature range of -40(C to +70(C.The unit is battery powered.  When the tractor and trailer arepaired, it works off the tractor's 12v electrical system.  Whenunhooked, the battery takes over.  It can be recharged from thetruck when the trailer is connected and has a 35-45 day life spanwhile disconnected.  The system also offers battery condition andpresent charge-level monitoring.The unit can be mounted inside a trailer wall.  Separateomnidirectional antenna packages offer the option of mountingeither high on the "nose" of the trailer, or flat on the roof.  Theroof mounting requires approximately a half-inch clearance.Untethered TrailerTRACS will provide two-way messaging and positiondetermination of any trailer while connected to or disconnectedfrom the tractor.  Using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite servicefrom ORBCOMM (21700 Atlantic Blvd., Dulles, VA 20166; Tel: 703/406-5310) which provides global coverage.  The OmniTRACS Division is areseller of ORBCOMM services to the trucking industry.Initial service using two satellites will be "intermittent," withthree to four satellite looks per day at any point on the earth.Near continuous coverage is expected in 1997 when ORBCOMM isscheduled to launch an additional 24 satellites. Clifford notedthat this system essentially takes the intelligence that nowresides in the tractor and puts it in the trailer.  He explainedthat Untethered TrailerTRACS offers exception-based messaging.For example, an itinerary can be stored in the trailer unit.Information might include appointment times, specific destinations,layover time, trucking company involved, tractor number, orwhatever.  If the trip goes according to plan, no messages will besent.  If there is a delay, the unit can recalculate and if an ontime or near-on time arrival is indicated, there still won't be anymessages.However, if a trailer didn't move when expected, or an unplannedmove took place, or the wrong trailer is connected or disconnectedto a tractor or a trailer is late for an intermodal drop, anexception alert is triggered.This information is sent immediately to the OmniTRACS NetworkManagement Center (NMC) in San Diego (CA) and then routed to thecustomer for action. The center is staffed around-the-clock everyday.  And there also is a back-up center in Las Vegas (NV).Clifford pointed out an additional feature of the system:refrigeration system monitoring.  On an exception basis, reeferdata is sent over-the-air to alert users to an immediate problem,e.g., wrong set point, refrigeration unit failure, unloaded reeferrunning, or temperature out of range.  Wherever possible,corrections can be made remotely, or help can be summoned.QUALCOMM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses and operatesadvanced communications systems and products based on itsproprietary digital wireless technology.Elisra  is known for its electronic warfare systems and develops,manufactures and markets advanced electronics products, includingsophisticated jammers, RF and microwave components, ELINT systemsand data linksBack to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Amtech to TrackGrocery Chain FleetLast month, Amtech Systems Corp.

Beverly Fuortes (Tel: 214/733-6059),Amtech's director of corporate development, said the system is nowbeing installed and should be fully operational in March.The wireless system will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)technology to provide real-time information on the 1,500 tractorsand trailers in the H.E.B. fleet.  Equipment will be deployed atterminal gates at the grocery chain's 262 stores throughout thesouthwest.  H.E.B. will use the Amtech system to improve equipmentand inventory accuracy, as well as to eliminate paperwork andincrease employee productivity by automating the vehicle trackingprocedure at terminals.With Amtech's SmartPass readers in place at terminal exit and entrypoints, all motor fleet equipment with an RFID tag will beidentified immediately, even at unmanned terminals.  The grocerystore chain will use the Amtech system, in conjunction with itsexisting system, to gather information and match it with fleetinformation in the company's database.With this real-time data in hand, H.E.B. will be able to monitoroperations, increase tracking capabilities and improve assetmanagement - all through wireless data communications.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Clinton Inks 1996Transportation BillsThe fiscal year 1996 Dept. of Transportation (DOT) appropriationsbill was signed late last year by President Clinton.  The billincludes $223 million for federal aid to ITS projects, down about$4.5 million from $227.5 million last year.  The DOT can nowproceed with development of a plan to reorganize its surfacetransportation activities.Also part of the bill is a $17.5 billion obligation ceiling forhighways which represents a $300 million increase over presentlevels.  Another $2.3 billion will be available for emergencyrelief and minimum allocation programs, bringing the total forhighways to $19.9 billion, only $545 million below the IntermodalSurface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) authorized level.Generally speaking, the transportation budget was up by $1.8billion over 1995's $35.58 billion.  But transit funding was cut by$600 million from 1995 levels, and includes $2 billion for formulagrants and $1.6 billion for discretionary grants.  Transitoperating assistance was cut by $310 million to a level of $400million.According to ITS America, congress will give serious considerationto dropping the practice of earmarking funds for ITS in next year'sbill.Funding (in millions) breaks out as follows: $24.5 for R&D, $32.5for operational tests, $14.5 for Commercial Vehicle Operations(CVO), $14.0 for Automated Highway Systems (AHS), $11.3 for programand system support, and $13.0 for crash avoidance research, for atotal of $109.8 million.At the same time, the president signed into law the NationalHighway Systems (NHS) bill.  This legislation designates a nationalsystem of primary highways and bridges, some 160,000 miles worth,considered essential to the country's economy and defense.Among the bill's provisions are the controversial repeal of the 55mph speed limit and a repeal of funding penalties for states thatfail to enact motorcycle helmet laws.  It also delays indefinitelyany federal mandates to use signs with metric measurements, andwaives until 2000, federal requirements that states convert theirplans and specifications to metric.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Fare Hikes BecomeNationwide TrendAccording to a report recently released by the American PublicTransit Association, (APTA, 1201 New York Ave. NW, Washington, DC20005; Tel: 202/898-4115), four out of 10 of this country's publictransit systems will raise passenger fares and cut back serviceduring 1995, mostly as a result of reductions in federal transitaid.APTA said a survey of 157 transit agencies showed that fareincreases during the year will average 25% and that a typicalservice reduction will represent 11% of existing bus and trainservice.  More than three-quarters of the responding agencies saidstate and local governments are not likely to replace the lostfederal funds.The cuts will hit hardest at lines serving small and rural areas.For example, an urban transit system might raise fares about 20%and a medium area about 23%.  However, small/rural area riderscould be looking at a 34% increase.  The same impact ratios prevailin the other categories.Transit agencies attributed about three-quarters of the fare hikesand service cuts to past and pending reductions in federal transitoperating assistance.  In the federal fiscal year just ended,operating grants were reduced by 11.5%, and legislation pending inCongress could cut remaining funds by another 44% in FY 1996.  Intotal, federal operating assistance will be cut in half, from $802million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $400 million. Of the respondingagencies, 36% plan to delay expansion and 40% could cut service andraise fares.Recent fare increases implemented by New York City's MetropolitanTransit Authority (MTA) are a case in point.  Not only will theyapply to subways and busses, but later in 1996, to bridges andtunnels as well. Over the past 13 years, the MTA has spent $20billion to rebuild and modernize its system, especially thesubways.  The results are bearing fruit and have drawn wide praisefrom many of its millions of daily riders.With state and federal subsidies being cut substantially, the MTAhas had to raise bus and subway fares by 20% from $1.25 to $1.50,and commuter rail fares on average by 9%, making these rates amongthe highest in the country. Beyond that, there is the threat ofreduced service, fewer improvements and less attention paid tomaintenance and passenger comfort.  Not a pretty picture overall.In looking at the prospect of higher fares, one individualconcluded that even with a 20% increase, the subway still was stilla better deal than having to drive, put up with traffic and havingto pay even higher parking fees.In light of all this, late last month, President Clinton signedinto law H.R. 2002, the Fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill forthe Dept. of Transportation (DOT).  The law cuts federal transitaid 12.2% overall in contrast with 1995, and includes reductions of48% in operating grants for transit agencies serving metro areas of200,000 or greater.  Smaller systems will experience a 25% cut.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Neural Networkto Control TrafficNestor, Inc. (Providence, RI) and Matrix Corp. (1203 New Hope Rd.,Raleigh, NC 27610-1474; Tel: 919/231-8000) are working with JetPropulsion Lab at the California Institute of Technology (JPL,Pasadena, CA) to develop VideoTrac, an advanced trafficsurveillance system.  This effort is being administered by JPL forthe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA, Washington, DC).According to Matrix and JPL, VideoTrac "will increase trafficcapacity on existing roads and reduce the need for new highwayconstruction."  Delivery of the system is expected sometime duringthe fourth quarter this year.VideoTrac will use video cameras, Matrix's Advanced TrafficController (SmartATC) and Nestor's Ni1000 Recognition Acceleratorchips to recognize moving vehicles on highways and intersections.The Ni1000 neural network chip, developed jointly by Nestor andIntel, is at the heart of the system.  Matrix will incorporate thechip into a compact, low cost module that will plug into advancedtraffic controllers like the Caltrans 2070 or TS3.The system can control traffic signals, notify drivers of trafficconditions and redirect traffic.  Unlike systems that use sensorsburied under the roadway, VideoTrac will be able to recognizevehicles by type (car, truck, bus, motorcycle), monitor speeds,turn and lane switching movements, travel times, and even reportaccidents.The chip simultaneously performs these functions at full-motionvideo speeds across multiple lanes.  It will "see" the number ofcars heading its way and know the speed of each.  At anintersection, a traffic control device could decide whether toextend a green light or stop traffic because a line of vehicles iswaiting in the intersection.David Mosier, Matrix president and CEO, said, "There areapproximately 250,000 intersections in the U.S. that wouldpotentially benefit from video detection technology, as well astens of thousands of highway locations."Nestor, by the way, develops and markets business informationsystems that extract actionable knowledge from data through patternrecognition.

Syracuse Way, Suite 250,Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) has established an alliancewith MAVIX Ltd. (Haifa, Israel).  Both entities hope to create aninterface between their respective technologies. MAVIX provides remote intelligence surveillance monitoring andcontrol systems for the transportation and security industries withan emphasis on Automatic Traffic Management Systems (ATMS).  GDSoffers real-time Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions forATMS, traffic operations centers, transit information, vehiclepermitting and routing, and Intermodal Surface TransportationEfficiency (ISTEA) management.A GDS spokesperson said his company and MAVIX are currently workingon three joint traffic system proposals but nothing is ready toannounce at this time.MAVIX's monitoring and control systems include color cameras withpan, tilt and zoom remote control, vehicle loop detectors, rampmetering devices, variable message signs, audio devices and trafficsignal monitoring devices. Signals from these devices aretransmitted via bi-directional connectivity to traffic controlcenters to provide real-time, full-motion visual monitoring oftraffic conditions, as well as voice connection with trafficcontrol personnel and roadway SOS locations.As a result of this partnership, traffic information processed bythe MAVIX system can now be reviewed in real-time as color codedmaps on the GDS GIS-based software system.  Maps will display thecurrent locations of objects, events and their relationships, aswell as current traffic conditions at any given moment.  Trafficcontrol operators will be able to analyze and respond immediatelyto changing conditions and incidents as they happen.Both companies look on this partnership as a way to build opensystems that "are never closed to future options but allow forexpansion of capacity and functionality in an efficient, resilientmanner."Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Ford and ChinaLook at 'Good Earth'Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:313/337-2456) and researchers from the Peoples Republic of China(PRC) have joined in a cooperative effort to develop catalyticconverters using rare earth metals for vehicle emission control.The three-year cooperative catalyst research program got underwayat the end of last year, and will receive more than $1.5 million infunding support from Ford and several Chinese governmentorganizations.China has the largest proven reserves of these metals which can beused in catalytic converters to cut vehicle emissions ofhydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.  The countryrecently adopted legal guidelines for auto emissions which banproduction, sale or import of cars that exceed establishedpollution levels.  The joint research effort will also investigateenvironmental solutions to help mitigate China's rampant airpollution problems.John McTague, Ford VP of technical affairs, said, "Rare earthoxides, alone or possibly with the addition of small amounts ofprecious metals, could create a robust emission control catalystthat China can produce for its own market or for potential export."Rare earth oxides, in particular cerium and lanthanum, combine withother metals to improve the performance of an automotive emissionscatalyst.  During changes in driving speed and fuel mixture, therare earth oxides can either store or release oxygen into theexhaust mixture and keep the catalyst performing under moreconstant conditions and at a high level.These oxides can also help in cold-start emissions control.  Whenthe catalyst is cold during the first few minutes of operation, itoperates inefficiently, so much so that it is during this periodthat the majority of hydrocarbons are emitted.  If the catalystcould be moved closer to the engine and be able to withstand thehigher operating temperatures, it could warm up more quickly andreduce cold start emissions.With a new emphasis on stricter emission standards by governmentregulatory agencies, research interest in rare earth oxides hasincreased.  The Chinese are looking to use these oxides as a majorcomponent of catalytic converters for their domestically-manufactured vehicles, while minimizing the use of precious metals,e.g., platinum, palladium and rhodium.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996$7 Billion Future forOEM Safety MarketsA study just released by Business Communications Co. (BCC, 25 VanZant St., Norwalk, CT 06855-1781; Tel: 203/853-4266), explorescurrent markets and future business opportunities for OEMautomotive safety electronics in light vehicles assembled in thiscountry and Canada.According to the study, "the average safety electronics content nowstands at $329 per vehicle, and is equivalent to 1.7% of the totalvalue of the average light vehicle produced in North America."  Thereport goes on to predict that over the next five years, sales ofautomotive safety electronics are expected to increase 8.6% peryear, reaching $7.19 billion by the year 2000.By then, the average automotive safety electronics content isexpected to reach $485, equivalent to 2.0% of the total averagevehicle value. The future will continue to brighten as the publicbegins asking for more safety features and the automobilemanufacturers begin meeting this demand with new and bettertechnological approaches.The study declares that "the next five years will witness the nearuniversal adoption of ABS and driver- and passenger-side airbags.Four-wheel ABS will also largely supplant two-wheel systems duringthis period.  Rapid growth in side-impact and other airbags willpresent strong business opportunities as will Traction ControlSystems (TCS)."  Other growth areas involve production of anti-theft devices and collision avoidance systems.The report calls attention to changes in the safety electronicsmarket.   These include lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventorymanagement, outsourcing, supplier consolidation, greater design andengineering responsibility given to suppliers, and increasinglysophisticated systems as more advanced electronic features areadded to vehicles.With this in mind, the study goes on to say that the next fiveyears will see more supplier consolidation among the automobilecompanies, increased electronics content and expanded supplierresponsibilities.  "This will, however, provide unique businessopportunities for those suppliers able to adapt to the newenvironment," the report concludes.Available from BCC for $2750, the report covers such technologiesas air bags and related passenger restraint systems, ABS, collisionavoidance and warning systems, electronic traction control, anti-theft devices, and other safety electronics.  It also covers indetail the socio-political, economic, regulatory and technologicalissues that are regarded as critical to the industry's currentstate of change.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Etak RealignsProduct LinesEtak, Inc.

But in New Mexico, the Middle Rio Grande Council of Governments(MRGCOG,  317 Commercial NE, Albuquerque, NM 87102) and the NewMexico State Highway and Transportation Dept. (NMSHTD) areembarking on a project they hope will ease the pain of a $35million major reconstruction of I-40 scheduled to take anywherefrom two to three years to complete.  Work on the highway, whichruns right through Albuquerque, will start this spring.In an effort to minimize the impact of the construction in theurban area, maintain an orderly traffic flow, reduce driverfrustration and promote alternate forms of transportation, MRGCOGand the NMSHTD decided to initiate a construction impact publicawareness program.Holmes & Narver, Inc., (H&N, 6501 Americas Parkway, NE,Albuquerque, NM 87110; Tel: 505/889-4100) has been named to a teamcharged with developing and implementing a campaign to promotecommunity awareness of the construction project and how it willimpact on local streets, freeways, arterial roadways and the area'stransit system.  This public relations effort will run through 1988or later.Susan Johnson & Associates, an Albuquerque public relations firm,heads the team with H&N providing advice on construction impacts,congestion and transit concerns.  The effort, which will cost about$300,000 is being funded partly by National Highway Systemconstruction money along with state and local dollars.  A firstdraft of the program should be ready next month.Ron Forte (Tel: 505/247-1750), MRGCOG's director of transportation,said there will be massive disruption where I-40 runs through partof the city.  Also there will be considerable ramp work and verylittle opportunity to divert traffic.  "We've never done anythinglike this before and we're always being criticized for constructiondelays and a lack of information.  So we decided to develop aprogram to let drivers know what is open or closed and when, andwhat progress is being made.  We want them to know what's happeningevery step of the way," Forte added.Driver information will be provided by variable message signs,billboards with message banners that can be changed without redoingthe entire billboard when new information becomes available,newspaper and television advertising, and standard constructionsignage.Forte said the campaign signature will be New Mexico's state bird,the Road Runner (not the famous cartoon character).  It will appearon signage and advertising related to the project.

GDS says the software shouldbe in place by the second quarter this year.MDOT issues some 120,000 trucking permits annually to enforcecompliance with motor code requirements for truck weight, height,length and width. Currently, this is a totally manual operationhandled primarily by the Lansing office.  Each permit requires awritten application along with a permit evaluation by a DOT permitagent.Agency personnel fax proper documents back and forth to permitstations around the state, and any delay in response to thesetrucking permits can result in lost revenue for the state, and attimes, illegal hauling.When PARS is in place, the entire process will be automated. Withina matter of seconds, it will handle everything from ensuringapplication compliance and determining a safe route, to issuing andautomatically faxing permits, and accounting for all transactionsinvolved.David Spangenberg, MDOT engineer - utility permits, said, "OncePARS is up and running, maximum turnaround time will decreaseinstantly and we will eliminate as much paperwork as we can."PARS, which is designed to automate a full range of operationsassociated with permitting and routing oversize and overweightvehicles, was released by GDS late last year.

Now, added to that mix is the effort of a group ofstudents at the University of Alabama (Huntsville).They have brought forth a proposal outlining the financial andengineering feasibility of a high speed maglev transportationsystem operating in a corridor between the Dallas/Fort Worth andHouston metropolitan areas.Maglev, a high-speed magnetically levitated ground transportationsystem, offers transportation options which can augment existingtransportation systems.  The maglev vehicle can travel at speeds upto 300 mph, carry 1200 passengers per hour per direction for thecorridor and also provide transportation for high-value, timesensitive freight.The proposal noted that there is a significant market opportunityfor a maglev to service the Dallas-to-Houston area.  The maglev canexpect to capture substantial portions of the air passenger andfreight markets, and 5% to 9% of the enormous automobile passengermarket.   Although the passenger rail market is extremely small,maglev should capture significantly all of this market and 75% ofthe air freight market.A detailed financial performance indicated that a maglev project isfinancially feasible.  It is projected to make money andsimultaneously provide venture capitalists with a high rate ofreturn and an exit mechanism from the project.A comprehensive risk analysis, using simulation, indicated anoverwhelming probability of positive financial outcomes for theproject.  The project's projected measure of success, Net PresentValue (NPV), was predicted positive for over 95% of simulatedscenarios.  However, a significant financial commitment from thefederal government would be required to build such a system fromDallas/Ft. Worth to Houston.The maglev system is technologically feasible.  The actualengineering design presented in the proposal was based on theconcept proposed by the Foster-Miller Team in their System ConceptDefinition (SCD) study awarded under the National MaglevInitiative.  It uses mature superconducting magnet technology.Modifications to the concept were made to enhance revenue andreduce the cost of building the system.  The proposed designconsists of an at grade, single track guideway with a passing trackin the middle and meets both the passenger capacity and lightweight freight requirements.A major advantage of maglev is that because the vehicle operateswith almost no moving parts, maintenance requirements aresignificantly reduced.  The system is anticipated to have a usefullife of 50 years.  In this design, a derailment situation isvirtually impossible.  The proposed maglev system would be saferthan air, rail or conventional road transportation.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Skycar: New PRTfrom KoreaSkycar, a Korean entry in the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)technology race, is under development by Woobo Enterprises Company,Ltd. (Samwon Building, 5th Floor, Nonhyun-dong 210-1 Kangnam-Ku,Seoul, Korea; Tel: ++ 822-549-6011 or 822-549-6211/3).  Informationon how far the project has gone is somewhat sketchy.  However,Woobo is currently looking for financial support for engineeringand testing.Work on Skycar began in 1992 and several feasibility studies forspecific sites in Korea have been conducted.  It appears that theSkycar PRT concept is very similar to the American TAXI 2000 PRTconcept but with important differences in the design of theguideway and in the use of an electromagnetic switch instead of amechanical switch.According to Woobo, the system would feature three-passengervehicles, a linear motor, and guidewheels for stabilization andsteering.  The proposed guideway is a "U" shaped steel structurewith integrated power supply, signal, communication, steering andcontrol equipment.Performance specifications are based on a minimum headway of 1/2second, maximum capacity of 7,200 vehicles per hour, averagecapacity of 6,000 vph, maximum passenger capacity of 18,000 personsper hour and average capacity of 9,000 persons per hour (at anaverage occupancy of 1.5 persons per vehicle).Average speeds are expected to range from 28-35 mph (45-60 kph).Last year, a propulsion system development study and acontrol/communication system development study were performed by anindependent company.  Woobo also established an adjunctTransportation and Urban Research Institute to further developmentof the Skycar concept.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Highway Good News,Highway Bad NewsIn the short space of a week, two of this country's major dailynewspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post carriedfront page stories featuring the latest in highway technology.However, when placed side-by-side, one article was filled with hopeand the other with considerable doubt.First the good news.  In its January 2 edition, the Times heraldedthe opening of the Riverside Freeway in Orange County, CA.  Thearticle commented, "In what transportation specialists say is abold experiment in traffic management in the state that madetraffic management both an art form and an oxymoron, a privatecompany has opened a brand new toll road, the most technologicallysophisticated highway ever built anywhere, smack in the median ofthe old jammed road."The existing Freeway, also known as Highway 91, is one of the mostcongested in the state, carrying some 270,000 vehicles daily.Commuters spend hours in their cars as they attempt to complete a40 or 50 mile trip to work.Now, for those willing to pay, the new $126 million, privately-funded, 10-mile freeway will provide some respite from the dailygrind.  According to the Times, "California Private Transportationguarantees that any commuter willing to pay the price will have adelay-free, 65 mph ride through the bottleneck."Much like telephone rates, toll charges will be based on time-of-day usage (Value Pricing).  There will be five levels: 25 cents, 50cents, $1, $1.50 and $2.50.  Three persons in a car ride for free.These levels are designed to keep traffic moving by reflectingchanging traffic levels on the road.  The more traffic, the higherthe toll. Tolls are being collected electronically and there are notoll lanes or booths.  Such familiar technologies as AutomaticVehicle Identification (AVI) technology, transponders, and computerbilling are integrated into roadway operation.The article noted that the Freeway's "ultimate quality controldevice will be its toll schedule posted prominently for all to seeon overhead entrance signs. If at any point over the next severalmonths, traffic on the road becomes so heavy that delays occur,fares will be raised for that travel hour until some of theoverload shifts to the old road, however jammed its eight freelanes might already be."In other comments, the story noted that, "Besides being the firstprivate toll road to compete with an adjacent free public road, thenew road is also the world's first fully automated toll road,relying not just on transponders to collect fares but on otherspace age devices to guarantee users a smooth safe ride."  Theseinclude a traffic control center, remote television cameras and"various combinations of lasers and computers to alert authoritiesto problems."Will it all work?  Only time will tell.Now for the bad news.  In a story entitled, "Drivers Put the Brakeson Toll Road's Promise," the December 26 edition of the Post notedthat, "The nation's first privately built highway (Dulles Greenway)in 150 years has become an embarrassing flop, drawing only a thirdof the traffic that the road owner and operator (TRIP II - 109Carpenter Dr., Suite 200, Sterling, VA 20164; Tel: 703/729-4400)had predicted."Greenway traffic has been averaging 10,500 vehicles daily, and isgrowing by only 1 to 2% a month, far short of original estimates of34,000 daily customers.(It was only last November that ATTN wrote about the Greenway beingcompleted six months ahead of schedule and under budget.  At thattime, congratulations were in order for those building thisprivately owned and operated toll road, a 14 mi. route extendingfrom US Rte. 15 in Leesburg (VA) to the Washington DullesInternational Airport.  The Greenway also linked with the existing10.4 mi. Dulles Toll Road, and opened for business last October.)The Post article went on to say that revenue shortfalls are sogreat that unless the Greenway can renegotiate loan terms or findanother source of funding, it will have to turn the road over toits creditors.  The highway could remain in operation under such aforeclosure, but TRIP-II could lose as much as $82 million.In November, to stem its losses, the company laid off 19 full-timeand 20 part-time toll collectors, and to attract more drivers, itpostponed a scheduled January 1 toll increase to $2.00 from $1.75.TRIP-II is even considering a toll reduction.  The Post noted thatthis could backfire if traffic doesn't pick up enough to offset thedrop in revenue per vehicle.  The Greenway company did not releaseany financial information to the Post, but the paper reported thatformer company officials said first year toll revenue would amountto about $7 million, compared with the company's targeted $27million.So what went wrong?  According to the newspaper account, "A reviewof studies the company commissioned, and interviews with formerofficials suggest that the Greenway investors made fundamentalmistakes in calculating traffic numbers." Most notably, they neverdid any sensitivity studies to see if motorists would pay a $1.75toll, they relied on outdated traffic flow research, and wereoverly optimistic in selecting the first-year number of 34,000.Also, the company struck what was termed an "ill-advised agreementto collect for the state (VA) an extra 35 cents from Greenwaydrivers getting on the Dulles toll road."  The idea was to sparedrivers the inconvenience of paying $1.75 at the Freeway toll plazaand then stopping a half-mile later to pay the additional 35 cents.The psychological effect, however, has been to make Greenway tollsseem even higher than they are (a total of $2.10 for both roads).At a mid-December meeting in New York City, Michael Crane, CEO ofthe Greenway company, reportedly asked creditors to be patientwhile the company conducted the marketing survey it should havedone previously and determines what changes to make in the toll.He hoped lower tolls would attract riders who aren't using the roadnow and added that changes will be made after the survey iscompleted.One Washington transportation researcher told the Post there needsto be an off-peak discount.  "I'm surprised they haven't alreadydone that," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MEETINGSITS America Readyto Roll in HoustonThe 1996 ITS America (400 Virginia Ave. S.W., Suite800, Washington, DC 20024-2730; Tel: 202/484-4847)Sixth Annual Meeting and Exposition is just "around thecorner."

The two governments have established an intergovernmental commission to push the project forward this year. Project officials claim the planning is currently on schedule, with an estimated completion date for the entire link of 2002.  The intergovernmental commission "will study the possibility of financing the project," explains Maurizio Cavagnaro, president of Alpetunnel, the European economic interest group set up at the end of 1994 to coordinate the main tunnel section of the Lyon-Turin rail link. The group now involves representatives of seven ministries from each of the two countries, he says.  As well as the strengthening of the commission from both sides, the project was highlighted by the French transport ministry (Ministere de l'Equipement, des Transports et du Tourisme, or METT) earlier this month as a possible lead candidate for private financing. In an interview with Le Monde, Anne-Marie Idrac, a junior French transport minister, suggested that the finance for the high speed line construction between Lyon in southern France and Turin in northern Italy may be the best option available for private investors to get involved in rail infrastructure projects.  Up until now, the French government has resisted almost all calls from the European Commission (EC) and others to encourage private investors to support major rail -- or any other -- infrastructure projects. Idrac's assertions earlier this month were brought on in part as a result of the strike by French national railways (Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer, or SNCF) late last year. Whatever the prompt, her remarks have been greeted with relief in Brussels.  But how far is the French government prepared to go with private financing? This is a confusing issue, partly because "private" in the private finance term does not have the same meaning or implication in each European country, notes one senior rail industry observer. "The word is used very loosely" in France, he adds.  When the French ministry and SNCF say private finance, they mean "a contribution from the interested regions who would get guaranteed bank loans," the observer explains. For the French side of the Lyon-Turin link, this would primarily involve the Rhone-Alpes region. They would then be able to "capture the development benefit directly," he adds.  Cavagnaro, who splits his time between the Italian Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato, or FS) facility in Rome and the Alpetunnel offices in Chambery, France, is not surprised by the move to consider private finance for transport projects. Transport ministry officials from France and Italy "said at a meeting one year ago" that there were financial constraints at the two national rail operators, he says. As a result, that meeting concluded that for the trans-Alpine link, "construction of the new line will be in a concession in order to involve private money," he adds.  But "that's only a first indication," Cavagnaro says. "Now the question will be studied by the intergovernmental commission and be studied by Alpetunnel to examine all the possibilities of the private and public partnership," he adds.  The exact model to be used for financing the project has yet to be finalized. The whole project is expected to cost approximately ECU13.55 billion ($17.3 billion), of which more than ECU3 billion will be for the main tunnel section (see HST News, Nov. 13, 1995). The "Eurotunnel idea" is one option under consideration, Cavagnaro says.  But given the financial fiascos surrounding the Channel Tunnel initiative since its inception, it would seem unlikely if this model were followed too closely for the Alpine project. Indeed, a document published by Alpetunnel draws comparisons with the Channel Tunnel. The so-called Tunnel de Base under the Alps "shall be slightly longer than the tunnel under the Channel," it notes. But "in spite of a geological site far more complex than that of the Channel, the provisional cost of the tunnel is less."  "The intergovernmental commission will be operating now in January, and I think the end of this year it will be possible to report to the two governments" on the recommended financing model to follow, Cavagnaro says. Assuming it is a concession, as initially concluded by representatives from the two governments, "the concession will be in place maybe in 1998," he adds.  The French transport ministry is still only lukewarm at best on the possibilities of private investors wanting to get involved in track construction projects. Idrac has indicated that the government may help out SNCF on some construction projects, while leaving the private finance door ajar.  Within the French ministry, "there is a subset of young Turks who try to loosen things up" with regard to financing options, the rail industry observer comments. But if SNCF and the METT are to go down the private investment track, "there is a legal step" necessary in France in order to "loosen the shackles," he adds.  The Lyon-Turin high speed rail project is one of the 14 European transport priority projects. It is described in EC documents as one of the "key links" in the European high speed network, primarily connecting Lyon through Turin, Milan and Venice to Trieste in the north east of Italy. For the key link, however, the majority of the work is required on the French side of the project.  The new line in France -- a dedicated passenger rail facility -- will link Lyon with Montmelian. Clearly the most expensive sections of the project will be the Belledonne Tunnel from Montmelian to St Jean de Maurienne, and then the main 54 km (33 mile) Tunnel de Base continuing on to Susa over -- or rather under -- the Italian border, capable of taking freight and high speed passenger rail services in parallel.  "The project is going ahead" and some of the first main construction decisions are already being made, Cavagnaro says. "The first problems are the decisions for construction of the test tunnels. These are very important works," he stresses. "There are three test tunnels to study the geology," he explains. Two of these will be in France, with the other in Italy. "We have started the project of the civil works" for the test tunnels. "At the end of this year will be the start of construction of the test tunnels," he adds.  The French and Italian governments approved an FF800 million ($200 million) study program for the Alpine tunnel at the end of 1994. Approximately one quarter of this was allocated for work carried out last year. In addition, the EC has granted the Lyon-Turin project ECU9.0 million for feasibility study support.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996AMTRAK SCALES BACKNEC ORDER SIZE;FEBRUARY DECISION DUE  Bending to the constraints caused by a lack of capital funding in fiscal year 1996, Amtrak's Board of Directors has approved plans to order just 18 high speed train sets for the Northeast Corridor (NEC), with an option for two additional fossil-fuel units.  Amtrak has repeatedly insisted it had no plans to reduce the number from 26 train sets, despite reports from sources inside the company that it would be forced to do so (see HST News, Nov. 13, 1995).  Amtrak officials decline to say whether pressure from the two competing consortia triggered any reduction in the proposed purchase.  The Board of Directors now is expected to select a winning consortium next month, choosing either Siemens Transportation Systems or the GEC Alsthom/Bombardier team. ABB Traction was dismissed by Amtrak from further negotiations last month (see HST News, Dec. 25, 1995).  Amtrak spokeswoman Erin Clarke acknowledges that the company now hopes to obtain just 18 train sets. "The number of train sets is 18, and we're in final negotiations," Clarke says. "We'll be awarding the contract in February." Amtrak expects an initial delivery of 12 HSR trains by October 1999, and "two of those 12 would be prototype train sets that would be delivered in 1998 for testing."  Fiscal constraints finally forced Amtrak to reduce its projected equipment order, Clarke acknowledges. "Of course, Congress has been very supportive of the train set program, but has not appropriated funds for it this year [fiscal year 1996]," Clarke notes. "We've had great support -- but support doesn't buy train sets." Amtrak must move ahead using previous federal appropriations and possible vendor financing, she says.  The prototypes must be tested at the Association of American Railroad's (AAR) Transportation Test Center (TTC) in Pueblo, Colo. Asked if TTC delays could postpone the introduction of the new trains on the NEC still more, Clarke says it's not likely. "A lot of the testing will take place in Pueblo," she says, but delays are unlikely because "so many folks" will be involved. Paradoxically, the range of tests, including anything from noise to the comfort of internal amenities, will be so intense "that we don't anticipate any problems."  Clarke unveiled Amtrak's revised plan Jan. 7 to a sparsely attended session on high speed rail during the recent Transportation Research Board (TRB) annual meeting in Washington, D.C., whose attendance was severely impacted by blizzard-like weather. "There were almost no presenters from our group, except myself," she quips.  Clarke adds that, contrary to rumors that surfaced at TRB, Amtrak is still exploring the purchase of non-electrified fossil fuel alternatives to HSR. "The fossil fuel train sets -- the two -- remain in as an option, and we'll exercise that contingent on funding," she says.  Not all TRB members are reassured by Clarke's pledge. George Haikalis, a New York City-based consultant, says the fossil fuel order now falls "at the end of the option, not at the end of the initial order. That puts it in jeopardy, puts it at risk.  "The number of trains, whether 24 or 18, is fine, but they ought to all be fossil fuel, to get something up and running right now," Haikalis observers. "We're talking three million person hours of delay just to accomplish what we could accomplish sooner, at lower cost and less inconvenience."  Haikalis says Amtrak is correct to focus its resources on one HSR project, rather than spread a limited pool of funds across the country, diluting any impact. But using the NEC for fossil-fuel R&D, he says, not only is better and more cost-effective, "but they'd be advancing a technology that would have widespread application throughout the U.S. in the 'Accelerail' program."  "Amtrak and FRA may want to be sacrificing this to reduce the credibility of alternatives to electrification," Haikalis charges. "Everything must be sacrificed on the altar of electrification."  Amtrak rejects Haikalis's accusations. "If Mr. Haikalis is correct, why is 90 percent of Europe's highly acclaimed passenger rails system electrified?" says Amtrak director of media relations Clifford Black. "And why aren't they instituting fossil fuel replacements?"  Adds Clarke, "Most of our trains are running on non-electrified territory; we have every interest in developing a train that would be appropriate. We certainly haven't abandoned the fossil-fuel option," Clarke declares. "But in the entire nation, this [the NEC] is the market where we can truly dominate."  Amtrak still may add to its order of 18 trains, Clarke points out. "We got approval from the Board to move forward with 18 train sets, but I don't think that means Amtrak won't obtain 19, 20, 21 sets or whatever."  Efforts on Capitol Hill are still underway to secure a dedicated capital funding source for the railroad, though the proposal has been stymied by the budget debate. "If we get the half-penny gas tax, the number of equipment sets could change," says Black. "Regardless of our near-term capital situation, it can be assumed that a successful 18 set order could be easily expanded, if warranted and if money is available."  Black says the initial order of 18 sets will be sufficient to serve the entire NEC adequately, once electrification is extended from New Haven, Conn. to Boston. He also says the decision date for awarding a contract, which has slipped repeatedly through 1995 is now firm. "The Board will make its decision in February," Black says.  "There continues to be give and take between Amtrak and the remaining vendors on various details of the contract, including but not limited to financing and servicing requirements. We concede that it has been a very long siege," Black says. "The process has proved more complicated than anticipated."  NEC electrification, also repeatedly delayed, is now set to begin under a new contractor team headed by Balfour Beatty Power Construction, Inc. and Massachusetts Electric Construction Co. Amtrak had planned to hold a groundbreaking ceremony in early spring, with full construction underway by summer. "We're still planning a June 1996 groundbreaking with full mobilization at the same time. But I don't think we're planning a ceremonial groundbreaking."Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996AMTRAK DEFENDS DECISION TO DROP ABB TRACTION  Partisans of X-2000 tilt train technology have protested Amtrak's decision last month to discontinue negotiations with ABB Traction, Inc., one of three finalists vying for Amtrak's NEC equipment order. Amtrak reportedly dropped ABB from consideration due to higher cost estimates.  But Amtrak director of media relations Clifford Black says Amtrak's decision was not, in and of itself, a rejection of the X-2000. "We're frustrated in dealing with the continued belief, and myth, that this is somehow a competition between the X-2000, as we know it, the ICE train as we know it, and the TGV as we know it," Black says.  Black notes "we have received letters from people protesting [dropping the X-2000] because those people thought it was an excellent train. We liked it too, and thought it was an excellent train." But Amtrak's specifications call for a distinct product tailored to U.S. needs. "We're not buying an off-the- shelf train."  Some letters addressed to Amtrak suggest "we have cast off an American-made X-2000 and are now negotiating with German and Canadian companies. The irony is, regardless of who is awarded the contract, the provision calling for substantial American content remains the same," Black says.  "This is not a vote of no-confidence for the X-2000. This is an Amtrak train designed to incorporate features and characteristics that we feel will best suit our needs."Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996DG VII SHIFTS FOCUSFROM RAIL IN 2ND CALL,BUT TASKS STRESS HSR    Rail research has moved right down the priority list for the second Fourth Framework call for proposals from DG VII at the European Commission (EC). The transport directorate in Brussels is looking to allocate around ECU4.5 million ($5.7 million) to selected rail research bids due to be submitted by the March 15 deadline.  The low figure this time round is partly due to the success of rail companies in bidding for funds on offer in the first call for proposals. Rail has been allocated 16 percent of the program's overall budget of ECU256 million for projects running in the period 1995 through 1998 (see HST News, Jan. 23, 1995). But rail bids secured over two thirds of this allocation from the first round of bidding -- primarily thanks to the coordination of most of these by Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer (UIC) -- leaving just ECU13 million for rail projects in the second and third calls.  Despite the low budget on offer, there are 30 tasks directly related to rail which are open for DG VII's second call for proposals, issued on Dec. 15 (see chart page 8). But while rail proposers are likely to have to fight over just ECU4.5 million, there are other sections of the program which should have some rail elements.  The strategic research section of DG VII's program accounts for 20 percent of the overall budget. In the second call, this program section is in line for approximately ECU11.71 million; representing the largest share of the ECU48 million expected to be on offer.  In addition, the program section covering integrated transport chains -- with a budget for this call of approximately ECU4.47 million -- also has a high rail content. All seven tasks in this section were open in the first call, but the transport directorate is still accepting bids on these during the second call for proposals.  The transport chains section addresses primarily freight operations. It aims to improve freight facilities both on individual modes and in the interoperability between modes. The program section divides into tasks relating to transport terminals and networks. One of the main priorities identified in the work program relates to improved access for freight to rail infrastructure.  DG VII approved 111 projects for funding from the first call for proposals (see HST News, Dec. 25, 1995). But, with some contracts not yet signed, officials from the transport directorate have not released details of these. The only exception is the integrated transport chains projects.  Given that bids for the second call will have to make sure they do not overlap with those approved from the first, DG VII has released the list of the three projects already approved for funding in this section of the program, explains Simon Mordue, an official in the transport directorate. The current plan is to publish brief summaries of all projects -- assuming the contracts are signed -- in March, he adds.  "One result of the first call was three projects on integrated transport chains," Mordue says. INRETS (Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite) in Paris is leading the IQ (Intermodal quality) project. The consortium is planning four field trials which will aim to improve "operational and control functions within the network and the terminals," according to the additional information documents released by DG VII as part of the work program.  The Impulse (Interoperable modular pilot plants underlying the logistics systems in Europe) project, led by the German firm Krupp Fordertechnik, will address "trans-shipment facilities and the related terminal organization." PLS Consult, based in Arhus, Denmark, is the coordinator of the Freia (Towards the networking of European freight villages) project which is concerned with the role of smaller firms in intermodal transport.  Of the 30 tasks currently open in the rail section of the program, eight have an element of high speed rail. The task description included in the work program for Task 37 stresses the need for interoperability of high speed rail systems. "When analyzing the cost benefits of inter- operability in order to find reasonable levels one must not only consider the short term views but also the longer term effects especially taking account of the fact that inter- operable advanced (telematics) technology is very cost effective," it states.  Seven tasks under the title "future rail freight and passenger management" are included in the current call for proposals, all with reference to high speed rail. DG VII officials indicate that "all the tasks 44 to 50 could form one project or they could be split up on a few different projects."  "With the construction of high speed rail lines the possible use of these lines also for freight services should be considered," says the work program, which has had some minor modifications since it was first issued in December 1994, states.  The set of tasks on "future" issues ends with a pragmatic assessment of the potential for high speed rail. The task "is intended to deal with finding the optimum solution in the area of compromise between speed, comfort and costs on lines which are not obvious candidates for dedicated high speed services," according to the work program.  The majority of the 111 projects selected in the first wave of DG VII's new program have finally got down to work this month. Proposers hoping for a share of the second call budget can expect to have to start work in autumn, at which time DG VII is currently planning to release its third and final call for proposals in the Fourth Framework.  DG VII has pushed its open information policy in setting up the new program -- its largest Framework R&D effort by far. As well as having sent out paper-based information packs to tens of thousands of prospective proposers over the last year, the directorate's information has been available electronically.

One of the main changes concerns the propulsion system for the Transrapid. The "new generation" currently being installed should now stay the same through to installation on the Berlin-Hamburg line.  Testing of the new propulsion system is scheduled to start in March or April, says Rudiger Fuerst, the project manager for Siemens AG Transportation Systems Group within Transrapid in Erlangen, Germany. The modifications have required "new inverters and new rectifiers. This is now the type we want to use in the project Berlin-Hamburg," he adds.  To accommodate the synchronous motors required by the Transrapid, "we have to construct a special power supply," Fuerst explains. Since the system works by varying the current and the frequency, "we have to use inverters" which can change the frequency between zero and 270 Hz. "To use this inverter, we need rectifiers to convert" from the 50 Hz mains supply to DC.  But it is not just the propulsion system which is being modified following the initial tests on the 31.5 km test track. "The test facility has been upgraded," notes Manfred Wackers, head of marketing and system applications at Transrapid International in Munich. Since the first phase of testing, "the system has been further improved," he adds.  With prototype Transrapids being tested at speeds in excess of 400 km/h, there have been reports of wear and tear on some sections of the guideway. That is "right and wrong," Wackers observes. "We have different types of girders" holding up the guideway along the test track for evaluation purposes. It was planned from the outset that "not all of these would be used in construction," he adds.  Officials from Transrapid -- a joint venture of ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation Systems, Siemens and Thyssen Henschel Maglev Transportation Technology (Magnetfahrtech- nik) -- have identified three girder types which could be of use on different sections of the Berlin-Hamburg route. These are constructed from "concrete, steel as well as a combined technology," Wackers says.  While the new propulsion tests will not start for a few months, the Emsland track is currently being used to assess passenger comfort issues. Transrapids have been running on the track at speeds of up to 425 km/h with passengers on board, Wackers says. "Even those who are opposed to the system, they are convinced" once they have been on a test run, he claims.  For the Berlin-Hamburg line, "construction will start in 1998," as planned, says Wackers, originally from the Thyssen side of the Transrapid group. "The legal planning phases" are continuing, but "we are making progress," he notes. The intention is that this "will be accomplished by the middle of 1996."  The whole consortium is involved in carrying out the necessary assessments, Fuerst says. These cover issues such as energy consumption, noise levels, and land requirements both for the track and for the power supply facilities.  Some of the tests as part of this assessment have indicated that in a few situations Transrapid can meet noise regulations "without building a noise wall, even if the guideway is only a couple of meters away, at speeds of 200 km/h," Wackers says. A more typical spacing may be closer to 10 meters.  The proposed route is "nearly 300 km in length, so you need three to four years in the planning process," Wackers notes. "Planning for Berlin-Hamburg is now in the detailed planning phase," he says. It has reached the stage where the local and national authorities are trying "to find the right locations for the stations in the cities. Different alternatives are being evaluated," he adds.  The decision on whether the line will extend to the proposed new airport in Berlin has still to be finalized (see HST News, June 12, 1995). This is "an option," Wackers says. But the authorities still "don't know where the location [of the airport] might be." This should finally be sorted out some time later this year. The next stage in the planning process will aim to compile some "concrete cost findings into the economics of the whole project again," he says.  While the main testing should be completed within the next year, the test track will not be closed down. "We think we will need this test facility until the project Berlin-Hamburg works," Fuerst says. This is likely to be eight years from now.  In addition to Siemens, Thyssen Henschel Magnetfahrtechnik and ABB, the Transrapid group also includes Dyckerhoff Widmann, Hochtief, Philipp Holzmann and Deutsche Bahn.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 19961995: NEW WORKS ANDR&D RISE IN EUROPE;NORTH AMERICA FADES  Squabbles over the formation of European Union (EU) often obscured the substantial ongoing progress within Europe's rapidly expanding high speed transport network. As 1995 began, several HSR route additions were being constructed, more were being planned, most were assured of some funding support, and even one high speed commercial maglev project  -- the world's first -- made substantial gains.  Among Asian nations, South Korea looked to add two more HSR lines to supplement its initial route, while Malaysia worked to attract European equipment manufacturers. Japan intensified its efforts to market its well-tested Shinkansen HSR technology for export, and evaluated that technology's performance after a devastating earthquake shook Kobe Jan. 17. West Japan Railways (WJR) service was disrupted, but WJR infrastructure held up better than nearby highway elevated construction and equipment damage was judged to be minor.  Though no comparable earthquake jolted North America, both Canada and the United States fell further behind in HST development. Both Florida and Washington state advanced individual HSR programs to compensate for the lack of interest within the U.S. federal government. Canada's long-delayed HSR study, finally released, suggested North America's largest nation would play no part at all in the HSR universe.  Fiscal woes surrounding the Channel Tunnel's business operations all but overshadowed the steady presence of its everyday rail operations, including the rise of Eurostar HSR service as a dominant carrier between London and Paris. As the summer arrived, Le Shuttle tourist trains through the Chunnel also began attracting increased passenger loads, although Le Shuttle's on-time performance struggled to meet targeted projections.  Eurostar's marketing success highlighted the triumph of one more TGV variant manufactured by HSR leader GEC Alsthom. But the Paris-based company faced some tough competition in 1995, as more nations joined the HSR club, and many chose technology other than top-speed TGV designs.  Early in the year, Norwegian State Railway (Norges Statsbaner) opted for 16 electric multiple-units (EMUs) modifications of ABB Traction, Inc.'s X-2000 tilt train. The order was the first equipment export success for Vasteras, Sweden-based ABB, though it dominates its own domestic market. (ABB's tentative dismissal by Amtrak later last year only increases the corporation's stake in the Norwegian order.)  Siemens AG Transportation Systems Group, the Berlin-based maker of InterCity Express (ICE) equipment, also scored its first export sales triumph, and also through a neighboring country -- the Netherlands. Netherlands Railways (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) officials opted for six new Siemens ICE 2/2 lightweight HSR train sets to link Amsterdam with Frankfurt and Berlin.  Savigliano, Italy-based Fiat Ferroviaria had its own export success, as Finnish State Railways (Valtiorautatiet) accepted two Pendolino S200 tilt train sets for that nation's first HSR route, a 150 km (94 mile) line between Helsinki and Turku. Valtiorautatiet initiated HSR service late in the year, following conventional service upgrades and HSR testing along the route.  In a joint effort, both Siemens and Fiat Ferroviaria combined forces with two Czech firms to supply 10 HSR EMU train sets to Czech Railways (Ceske Drahy). The order bolstered Fiat's role as the dominant supplier of tilt train technology within Europe, and highlighted the Siemens/Fiat partnership being applied to other projects, including Amtrak's Northeast Corridor (NEC). The order also added the Czech Republic to the potential list of HSR nations, making the nation potentially the first former East Bloc country to join the European HSR club.  Siemens' 1995 success was not limited to just HSR, as it and several other domestic firms continued to advance Germany's long-range plan for the world's first high speed commercial maglev service. Revised plans in 1995 added city center access to Berlin as part of the mix, with officials of Transrapid Planning Corporation GmbH scouting several through-city rights-of-way for use to and through the nation's capital. The extension of the original DM8.9 billion ($6.3 billion), 283 kilometer (175 mile) route could open up better intermodal opportunities with Berlin's U-Bahn and S-Bahn services, as well as steel-wheel HST operations. Transrapid's current Hamburg-Berlin route has been criticized by industry observers for its inferior Berlin terminus at Westkreuz (West Cross) Station, which offers skeletal intermodal links.  In midyear, officials from the state of Brandenburg added another proposal to the maglev project: a connection to a new international airport now being proposed for the city. Berlin city officials were skeptical of the proposal, which would recycle Sperenberg Air Base south of the city, recently closed at part of the withdrawal of the Soviet army following Germany's unification.  The European Commission (EC), struggling to make itself effective, continued advancing two directorates in the transport field last year, with HSR high on the list of priorities. Estimates produced in Brussels last year point to a spend of ECU240 billion ($303 billion) for the infrastructure and rolling stock required to complete the high speed rail sections of the trans-European transport network. The EC's transport directorate (DG VII) has lined up ECU2.05 billion for the period 1993-1999, but there are other options through, for example, the European Investment Bank.  On the research side, DG VII selected 111 projects for the first phase of its new ECU256 million program within the Fourth Framework. Overall, rail is expected to receive 16 percent of this budget over the next four years, with the European Rail Transport Management System (ERTMS) high on the agenda. Also on the transport side, DG VII approved ECU240 million in 1995 to support the 14 priority transport projects, many of which concern high speed rail.  Elsewhere at the Brussels administration, the telematics directorate (DG XIII) garnered less attention within the rail community. DG XIII targets more funding to roadways than rail, but several rail proposals survive, including the Railway Open System Interconnection Network (Rosin). Nonetheless, roads remain the dominant mode within DG XIII, according to former director generale Michel Carpentier.  Amtrak ended 1995 just as it began it: preparing to order train sets to provide high speed rail service to its Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Washington, D.C. and Boston. Amtrak began 1995 hoping to select one of three competing consortia "in the spring." By year's end, the railroad had effectively eliminated ABB Traction, Inc. from the competition, but still had to choose between two consortia led by Siemens Transportation Systems and GEC Alsthom/Bombardier Corp., respectively. Amtrak's newest deadline for the decision is set for February, with industry observers becoming weary marking the delays.  Meanwhile, leadership within the new Republican Congress gave Amtrak a two-pronged message: (1) do more with less; and (2) don't emphasize the NEC and HSR at the expense of other long-distance intercity services.  Amtrak also marked time in extending electrification of the NEC north of New Haven, Conn. to Boston, in part due to the withdrawal of Morrison-Knudsen Corp. as the prime contractor for the project.  Though Florida's Department of Transportation (FDOT) finally pulled the plug on the ill-fated Orlando maglev project in early January, FDOT moved aggressively to attract private sector interest for an HST network linking Miami, Orlando and Tampa. By year's end, five consortia -- three HSR entries and two maglev proposals -- were submitted to the state, seeking to tap FDOT's guarantee of $70 million in state funds available each year for the next 25 years.  A more modest $40 million program in Washington State was advanced to establish incremental HSR between Portland, Ore., Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., using leased Talgo passive tilt train equipment. Washington DOT officials released their own request for proposals late in the year to lease/purchase two non-electric HSR trains, with Madrid-based Patentes Talgo, S.A. given the edge in any competition.  If the United States symbolized the downsizing of HSR ambitions in North America, Canada represented full-scale retreat. The Quebec/Windsor High Speed Rail feasibility study, begun in 1992, essentially declared HSR too expensive for the nation's needs, and thus unjustified to receive federal funds. But controversy surfaced when the 89-page study's conclusion, supported by the federal government, was disputed by the study's two other partners, particularly the province of Quebec.  Critics also noted the feasibility study predictably endorsed TGV HSR service for the route, should the national will be found to finance it, and drew a link between the endorsement and the role of Canada's Bombardier, Inc. in marketing TGV technology for North America. ABB Traction, Inc. publicly questioned the study's dismissal of lower-speed, tilt-technology trains for the route, noting Amtrak's NEC plans included tilt-train capabilities.  North America's HSR travails were mirrored by those of associations like the High Speed Rail/Maglev Association (HSR/MLA), which tried to remain relevant in spite of dwindling federal financial and political support for high-speed options. HSR/MLA president Joseph Vranich, credited with highlighting HST opportunities in the U.S., abruptly resigned from his position early in the year, leaving a leadership void for much of 1995 and an annual meeting held in Boston during the spring that sought to determine what the future held for both the organization and North American HST.  By contrast, European HST interests, led by the European Commission (EC), the Union Inter- nationale des Chemins de Fer (UIC), and others, held the Eurailspeed Second World Congress on High-Speed Rail last fall, spotlighting the rise of Lille, France, as a high speed rail and intermodal transport hub. The attitude was upbeat, reflecting a growing belief that European nations, led by the EU, would expand HSR opportunities.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996FRA SUMMARY FINDSMAGLEV DISMISSED,HSR PREFERRED  The Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) High Speed Ground Transportation Policy Outreach summary, compiling public comment from eight public meetings held in 1995 throughout the U.S., suggests that incremental improvements to passenger rail may be the best policy course, at least in the eyes of those who testified.  Those testifying at the hearings, perhaps predictably, were generally in favor of high speed transport, whether HSR or maglev, as opposed to continuing existing federal priorities which appear to favor road or air. But only one of the eight meetings -- in Albany, N.Y. -- registered any substantial support for maglev development, according to the FRA findings.  The 23 page (plus appendix) FRA report also touched on funding issues, HST as part of a National Highway System (NHS), the role of ISTEA in funding HSR, state funding options, and the role of Amtrak in any U.S. HST future.  The HSGT Policy Outreach will be used in conjunction with FRA's ongoing Commercial Feasibility Study (CFS), both mandated by ISTEA, "to determine where and what types of High Speed Ground Transportation makes sense in the United States." The CFS study, originally due for submission to Congress last September, now is scheduled to be completed by this spring (see HST News, July 24, 1995).  Besides Albany, N.Y., FRA held meetings in Richmond, Va., Portland, Ore., Sacramento, Calif., Orlando, Fla., Chicago and New Orleans. An eighth meeting was held in conjunction with the 12th annual meeting of the High Speed Rail/Maglev Association (HSR/MLA) in Boston.  "While there were several references to 'real high speed rail' with speeds of greater than 150 miles per hour, most participants focused on the short-term goals of increasing speeds to 90, 110 and 125 miles per hour." the FRA report says.  "Maglev was mentioned infrequently," it adds pointedly. "The New York State Department of Transportation reported that their 'long term goal is to evaluate the feasibility of offering very high speed service (up to 300 mph) using Maglev technology between major urban centers.' The Florida Department of Transportation is open to consideration of any HSGT technology, including Maglev, for the Miami-Orlando-Tampa corridor. Other participants, however, expressed reservations about the feasibility of Maglev." FRA notes that in New York, the Empire State Passengers Association (ESPA), a citizens group, protested the high cost relative to the modest cost savings that maglev would offer over HSR in the state's Empire Corridor linking Buffalo, Albany and New York City.  In Portland, Ore., one of ESPA's counterparts, the Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, argued that "HSGT should be able to directly compete with NHS highways in the same corridor for the same Federal funds." The FRA report notes speakers from the Pacific Northwest enthusiastically supported HSR opportunities for the region's Cascadia Corridor, running from Portland through Seattle to Vancouver, B.C.  ISTEA funding for HST was also advocated as a capital source. A statement by the National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) declared "the Federal government should provide the same opportunities for investment in high-speed (and conventional) rail as it does for aviation and highways."  FRA briefly but crisply notes the "universal agreement that the Federal Government needs to take the lead in defining safety standards for HSGT and in developing the technology of other low cost alternatives to grade separation or crossing closures." FRA Administrator Jolene M. Molitoris has made safety a priority concern for the agency, and has focused on grade crossing safety as an essential component of her campaign.  [In a speech before the Transportation Research Board in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 10, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena included rail grade crossing safety as the sole rail component of a nine point plan for Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure (ITI). The ITI plan would be included in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Operation TimeSaver, designed to speed travel in the 21st century. Pena cited the October bus/rail collision in Fox River Grove, Ill. as "a wake-up call on the importance of linking systems." Other rail issues, including HST, were not addressed by Pena in the speech, however.]  Federal priority was also urged to override state and local regulations that, by chance or design, preclude HST development. FRA notes that even Amtrak's Northeast Corridor (NEC), an existing HSR route, has been blocked by opponents of electrification; the study says one speaker testified that "incentives should be offered to states for eliminating restrictive regulations and procedures that slow the implementation" of HST.  Proponents of "gateway technologies," including non-electric HSR development and positive train control (PTC) systems, were well represented at the various sessions. The FRA found "widespread support for efforts to develop a new non-electric locomotive, a positive train control system, and positive barriers for grade crossings. However, there is concern that FRA not reinvent existing European and Japanese technology in hope of establishing a US rail manufacturing industry. Many participants believe that effort to create a new industry could unduly delay the implementation of HSGT programs. Rather than develop new train set technology, participants urged the FRA to facilitate the importation of European technology through the establishment of standards that are compatible with the International Railway Union (UIC) standards."  But FRA also noted, "Incremental improvements are being designed to benefit all potential users of the rail system" in each region where it held hearings. "Emphasis is also being placed on expanding the reach of the rail systems, by linking areas that could feed the high speed rail line. The goal behind these efforts, in all cases, is to create a stronger market for HSGT by improving the level of service currently being offered.  "Success stories were cited in every region, demonstrating savings in travel time and other effects of improving train speeds, frequency, and reliability on ridership levels, as well as on public support for new rail systems," the summary said.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996  * The decision on which of the two remaining bidders will   * The decision on which of the two remaining bidders will be selected for the construction of the U.K. Channel tunnel rail link is anticipated within the next few days. Reports over the holiday period noted that the announcement by the U.K. Department of Transport (DOT) would be expected in early February. At press time, DOT officials noted that the announcement was expected "shortly."  The construction plan has already been put back, however, with a completion date now set in the early part of 2003, six months later than scheduled. The route from London to the Channel Tunnel is 68 miles long. The two consortia, one of which will also take over the operation of Eurostar, are: London and Continental Railways, including Virgin, Ove Arup and Partners, SG Warburg and Bechtel; and Eurorail, with BICC, Trafalgar House HSBC and National Westminster Bank.  Contracts should be signed on April 1, with many U.K. rail industry observers tipping London and Continental as the likely successful bid. But with Eurostar's patronage for 1995 down more than 60 percent on predictions, that may not be the best part of the deal. Along with the contract, the successful consortium will secure considerable land, some of which could be used for potentially lucrative real estate redevelopment.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH SPEED TRANSPORT NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996  * The Italian transport engineering firm Ansaldo Trasporti   * The Italian transport engineering firm Ansaldo Trasporti and Union Switch and Signal, Ansaldo's U.S. subsidiary, are to supply the signaling and automation systems for the new railway between Beijing and Kowloon.

"Measures should be taken to review policies to establish fairer competition between modes of transport," Kinnock says in the report's introduction. "Both rail and inland waterways appear to have much lower cost recovery rates than road haulage," the report states in setting out the case that road infrastructure costs are not being met.

"I want 75 of our largest metropolitan areas outfitted with a complete intelligent transportation infrastructure in ten years," Pena said, echoing John Kennedy's call to put an American on the moon within a decade. Pena discussed the new ITS goal at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) last Wednesday.  Pena was scheduled to unveil the new plan on Monday, but the blizzard that dumped on the mid-Atlantic forced him to postpone his address to the TRB. In the meantime, word of the new initiative, dubbed "Operation TimeSaver," had already started trickling out. The Associated Press carried an item about it on Monday, and National Public Radio mentioned it briefly on Tuesday, although neither report carried much detail.  Pena said the goal of Operation TimeSaver is to reduce travel time in the U.S. by at least 15 percent. To achieve that aim, metropolitan areas will be encouraged to implement an infrastructure that integrates nine component systems for: traffic signal control; freeway management; transit management; incident management; electronic toll collection (ETC); electronic fare payment; warnings at railroad grade crossings; emergency response; and multimodal traveler information systems.  "There isn't a community in the country that has all nine," Pena said. "Atlanta comes closest, as it prepares for the Olympics. Many cities have some components, but the components aren't linked."  In connection with Operation TimeSaver, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) expects later this month to open its solicitation for two or three metropolitan areas to serve as model deployment sites. Plans for the solicitation are not new. Officials with the federal ITS program have been talking about it for months, though lack of support from Congress has forced them to vastly reduce the scope of that program. (see Inside ITS, Nov. 6, 1995).  It's clear that the DOT is not looking to Congress for the type of dedicated funding for Operation TimeSaver that it hoped to win for last year's attempt at a model deployment program, the Trailblazer Initiative. The DOT asked for $100 million for Trailblazer; instead, it received $10 million to support model deployments at the two or three sites it expects to choose this year.  "There are federal dollars to help pay for this strategic investment," Pena said of Operation TimeSaver in his speech at the TRB. But these funds will not consist of new monies devoted to ITS initiatives. Rather, ITS is moving into the mainstream. "The federal aid that states receive can be used to build 100 percent of the infrastructure," he said. Also, "we must be more creative by inviting the private sector to play a role."  A major task ahead of proponents of the ITI will be to convince state and local officials, and the public at large, that there are long term benefits to purchasing an ITI with money they might otherwise spend on concrete and steel or pothole repair. To that end, the DOT has formed a partnership with a variety of organizations to help drum up grass roots support. The organizations include Public Technologies Inc. (PTI); Public Transit; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO); the National Association of Counties; ITS America; the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE); the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA); the Surface Transportation Policy Project; the American Trucking Associations (ATA); the Highway Users Federation; and the National League of Cities.  Regional offices of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) also are being recruited for this effort, and regional employees will undergo training so that they can act as "missionaries," for ITS technology in the words of one DOT official at the TRB meeting. On Jan. 23, FHWA offices throughout the country will hold an "open house" to help introduce the program to stakeholders.  Speaking at a Monday session, William Jones, coordinator of the advanced public transit systems program at the ITS Joint Program Office, described Operation TimeSaver primarily as an outreach program to deliver the message on the local and regional levels that ITS technology is available and worthy of investment. One could speculate that local efforts might also have a second target: legislators in Washington. Last year, ITS proponents scrambled to convince Congress that ITS is neither "corporate welfare" nor "science fiction." As a new round of Congressional appropriations begins this spring, Operation TimeSaver could serve as an effort to change the language of the debate. Pena's speech, along with brochures and a video promoting the program at the TRB, focused on the human benefits of ITS. Instead of talking about radar systems, proponents are trying to push the discussions back in the direction of systems that, for example, give parents more time to spend with their children.  Although state and local transportation officials will need to rely on their general highway funds to build the ITI, the U.S. DOT has set aside money for other efforts meant to encourage ITS deployment. Pena used his TRB address to announce the award of five contracts to standards-setting organizations "to begin fast tracking the development" of ITS standards. These are AASHTO, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ITE, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The money will pay for technical support for standards-making activities (see Inside ITS, Sept. 25, 1995). Pena did not mention the value of the contracts.  Pena also said the DOT will make "a significant investment" in training DOT field personnel to deal with ITS technologies. Without naming the size of the investment, he said it will be "on the order made when we built the Interstate system." The training effort will be aimed at "expanding their technical capacity so civil engineers can become electronic and communication experts."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SNOW RAINS ON TRB'S75TH ANNUAL MEETINGIN BLIZZARD-BOUND D.C.  The Blizzard of '96 proved to be a spoiler for the 75th annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in Washington, D.C. last week. Over 17 inches of snow and winds gusting up to 35 mph closed airports, roads and above-ground sections of the Metro. After attendance last year of about 7,100 people and pre-registration this year of 5,000, the TRB was expecting a banner year. But at the end of the first full day of the meeting, only 2,733 intrepid souls had been able to get to the event.  Rodney Slater, head of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), drove a four wheel drive vehicle through the drifts to help deliver an annual report on ITS on Monday morning. Hundreds of people attended this session last year; just over 50 people, looking lost in a cavernous ballroom, took seats this year.  But the administrator drew positive parallels with the first meeting, 75 years ago, of what eventually became the TRB. About the same number of people attended that first meeting, which also was held in a blizzard. Drawing a parallel with ITS, he said the TRB started with just a few people and a big idea, and it has blossomed into something grand.  While Slater was talking about pathways to the future, Christine Johnson, the director of the ITS Joint Program Office (JPO) at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), was doing some back-breaking path work of her own -- shoveling her way out of her home for five and a half hours. "We could have used an intelligent transportation system here!" she said.  Once the blizzard hit, getting into Washington was as difficult for residents of nearby suburbs as for delegates from overseas. Early in a Monday afternoon session on international developments in ITS, 40 people listened to two speakers in the same large ballroom used for the morning's domestic ITS report. Six presenters and a moderator had been scheduled. At many sessions, the presenters who showed up actually were pinch-hitters. Speakers introduced both themselves and "who they were supposed to be." At a meeting of the TRB's committee on ITS on Monday evening, 26 people were in attendance. Jim Scott, the TRB's staff person for the committee, said this meeting typically draws 200-250 people.  Foot traffic to the exhibit hall in the Sheraton Washington had to be diverted because two skylights had broken over the main entrance to the hall. Unfortunately, not many visitors were able to stroll through a special "ITS Pavilion" festooned with banners promoting "Operation TimeSaver" (see story on page 1) or exhibits devoted to federal and state departments of transportation. Those who took the alternate route to the exhibit hall could relax and monitor outside highway conditions through feeds from the Montgomery County, Md. advanced transportation management system (ATMS). Watching the video images of roadways was like watching fish in an aquarium on cable TV. Highways that are usually filled bumper-to-bumper with cars were serenely empty. An occasional vehicle would slowly float across the screen as a gentle snow continued to fall over the Washington area.  But the task of trekking among meeting venues at the meeting was not serene. The TRB meeting took place in three hotels -- the Sheraton, the Omni Shoreham and the Washington Hilton -- that were to be connected by a shuttle service. The shuttle did not run on Monday; signs posted that evening said the service would "resume" on the second day. The buses began operating Tuesday morning, but as a fresh snowfall made the streets even more slippery, the shuttle service was abandoned by midday. That left transportation choices of taxis, which had doubled their rates and could get stuck; the Metro, which was "experiencing delays"; or bundling up and going by foot -- usually a wet foot.  Amidst the adversity, perhaps not surprisingly, spirits seemed high among the attendees. Robert Jaffe, who works for the Loral Federal Systems team on the national ITS architecture, began one session by recounting how a group of people waiting for an elevator in a Metro station where the escalator was broken learned that most of them were headed for the TRB meeting. The group "decided it was an object lesson in transportation," he said. But, he added, "I'm not exactly sure what the object was."  Despite the small audiences at many presentations, it was possible to see the future flowing into the hall at a session called "Information Superhighway: Transportation Applications of the World Wide Web and the Emerging National Information Infrastructure." Over 140 people squeezed into a small conference room, extending through the doorway and lining up two deep in the hall to hear this presentation. One of the things they learned is that a home page dispensing information on travel in Seattle is receiving 11,000 hits a day. If the home page had been for Washington, D.C., the message last week would have been, "Stay home."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NEW OPEN PROTOCOLDEMONSTRATED FORITS COMMUNICATIONS  A new protocol in the public domain that allows data communications among different types of traffic management devices from different manufacturers made its public debut at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) last week. Called the National Transportation Communications ITS Protocol (NTCIP), it is "the backbone of ITS" and will enable its widespread deployment, says Alberto Santiago, chief of the Traffic Systems Branch at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).   One of the first states to lay the groundwork for that deployment will be California. The state has passed a law that makes conformance with the NTCIP mandatory for any traffic control systems sold there after the first of this year.  People involved in the effort to develop the NTCIP are not cautious in assessing its value. It is "probably one of the most significant events in 20 years in transportation history," says Kenneth Vaughn, task manager for the NTCIP effort at PB Farradyne of Rockville, Md., which served as systems integrator in the final push to create the standard. The FHWA and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) have been working cooperatively on an open standard for several years. Last year, in an effort to accelerate the process, an NTCIP steering group was formed, composed of government agencies, systems integrators and consultants.  The work began originally as an effort to develop an open standard for communication between different traffic signal controllers and traffic management centers (TMCs). But a broader vision of possibilities developed. The NTCIP now will work "like an Internet to communication devices in the field," says Don McWilliams, senior systems analyst at PB Farradyne. Besides traffic signal controllers, potential devices that the NTCIP will support include variable message signs (VMS), controls for video surveillance systems, ramp meters, highway advisory radio (HAR) systems, automatic vehicle identification (AVI) readers, environmental or weather sensors and other vehicle detection systems. Traffic management centers can also use it to communicate with one another. The work is resulting in "a suite of protocols rather than just one protocol," says Vaughn.  The NTCIP protocol is based on International Standards Organization/Open Systems Interconnect (ISO/OSI) procedures. It uses existing standards and technology, works with high-speed and low-speed communications links and supports legacy systems.  The NTCIP will be one of many protocols to come under the umbrella of the national ITS system architecture. In one session on ITS at the TRB, agencies were urged to include the NTCIP in their specifications when they purchase equipment. The advice came from Robert Jaffe of the Loral Federal Systems team that is working on the national architecture. The keys to successful implementation of the ITS architecture are "open systems, open systems, open systems," he said.  A new catch phrase that appeared on the lips of many ITS officials at this year's TRB is "buy smart." Proponents of the NTCIP say that to purchase systems that use the new protocol is to buy smart, because it they will prove cost effective in the long run.  The NTCIP steering group is actively soliciting suggestions on how to spread the NTCIP gospel to local engineers and decision-makers. At the TRB they passed out "Surf'n NTCIP" buttons that displayed the address of the NTCIP World Wide Web home page: http://www.atms.volpe. dot.gov/ntcip/. They also distributed questionnaires asking if people had heard of the NTCIP and if they would participate in further work on it, plus a "reality check" question: "Would you use the protocol as it currently stands in a new system? If not, specify why not." Further information on the protocol can be obtained by faxing a request to Santiago at 703-285-2264.  As pressure to deploy ITS systems has built up, so has the work on the NCTIP. Participants referred to the "lightning speed" at which it was finally put together. A year ago there was not even a good draft specification, says Santiago. PB Farradyne did not charge any fee for work specifically on the NTCIP, says Vaughn. The firm is working with the FHWA, under a contract worth about $5 million, on the development of real time traffic adaptive control systems (RT-TRACS). The NTCIP is integral to this work. If an additional contract for the NTCIP had been necessary, this could have delayed the standard for about a year and a half.  A demonstration of the new protocol at the TRB went from idea to reality in four months, Vaughn says. For the demonstration, eight different signal controllers and three VMS from different manufacturers were linked to one computer over one telephone line. Another computer was linked to the first computer to show the ability of TMCs to talk to one another. Small colored lights representing traffic signals on a miniature roadway cycled through green, yellow and red either simultaneously or sequentially, depending on how they were programmed.  The first three standards of the NTCIP are currently under legal review at NEMA. The FHWA expects to stage field demonstrations this summer at various locations. What is called the Caltrans version of the NTCIP -- which is already mandated -- is now, and will continue to be, in conformity with the NTCIP, says McWilliams.  The NTCIP steering group consists of: the FHWA; the I-95 Corridor Coalition; the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans); the states of Florida and Washington; the City of Los Angeles; the Texas Transportation Institute; Rockwell/Allen-Bradley Co.; Barton-Aschman Associates; DKS Associates; Intersection Development Corp.; Loral Federal Systems; and PB Farradyne. Other participants include ANSTEC, ARINC, Oak Ridge National Laboratories, and Opus One.  Organizations planning to deploy the NTCIP include the public agencies on the steering group and Irvine, Calif.; La Mesa, Calif.; Las Vegas Area Computer Traffic System; Richardson, Texas; Santa Clara, Calif.; and Dade County, Fla., according to a Department of Transportation handout.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996RAYTHEON PROMOTESSTAMP-SIZED RF TAGFOR ITS APPLICATIONS  Raytheon Co. in Tewksbury, Mass. is touting a new 35 GHz radio frequency (RF) tag the size of a postage stamp that can be read by a standard police radar gun. The tag can be used in applications involving electronic toll collection (ETC), smart parking, smart license plates, automobile identification and vehicle registration, the company says.  In mass production, its cost would be competitive with other RF tags, says William McDonald, manager of ITS Programs at Raytheon. It's "fair to say that the retail cost of the tag would be less than $20," he says. The 35 GHz tag comes in two versions. A passive, read-only tag without a battery is the one that is the size of a postage stamp. An active tag with a battery is a little smaller than a half dollar. The communications range of the active tag is more than 1,000 feet, depending on where it is placed and on the weather, McDonald says.  A police radar gun would have to be modified to include a small flat panel display to convey the information it receives from the tag. But since that part of the technology is available more or less off the shelf, it would help keep the cost of systems integration and deployment low, McDonald says. The technology for the system was developed by Raytheon's E-Systems Group under government contract. E-Systems was acquired by Raytheon in the spring of last year.  "It will be interesting to see if they can penetrate the electronic toll market," says Don Davis, associate program leader for transportation at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who has done extensive work on automatic vehicle identification (AVI) standards at the state and local levels. No standard currently exists for ETC, but many of the big players, both users and manufacturers, have made some choices, he says. In North America, nearly all electronic toll collection (ETC) systems use technology licensed at 915 MHz; in Europe most systems operate at 5.8 GHz.  "At this point in time I think it may be more confusing than anything to add yet another option to the menu," says Davis. McDonald says he hopes future architectural standards will permit a higher frequency range than what is envisioned at this point. The situation is fluid and options are flexible, he says.  Unlike transmissions at lower frequencies, transmissions at 35 GHz are highly directional and make it possible to reduce cross-talk interference between lanes, says McDonald. The high frequency also provides a much higher rate of data exchange than tags currently used, he says.  At the top of the microwave or Ka band, where the 35 GHz band is located, there are few existing applications, reducing the chance of interference, McDonald says. The 902-928 MHz band, where North American AVI systems generally reside, is also used by other services, creating the potential for in-band interference. McDonald says he is not sure if commercial applications in the 35 GHz range require licensing but Raytheon "frequency people" are looking into that now.  The tag could prove appealing to auto manufacturers because it is small enough to be placed almost anywhere on the vehicle for different uses, he says. "I believe that there are a number of car companies at this moment that are investigating the use of RF tags for industry use." Tags could assist car makers in the assembly process and could allow the electronic retrieval of data when a vehicle comes in for servicing, he says.  Communications at higher frequencies could also find their way into automobiles through intelligent cruise control (ICC) systems, says McDonald. Within a few years, devices operating above 60 GHz will be produced and placed in cars in production volumes, he says. Another large potential market for high frequency tags is in applications involving license plates and vehicle registrations. If the tag is encrypted with a vehicle identification number (VIN) and the owner's ID, police could get an automatic read on the vehicle under zero light conditions, he says.  All of these non-ETC applications could possibly have an effect on ETC standards. If a major car manufacturer rolled out a significant number of cars with factory-installed tags, that could in effect set a standard for future "smart cars" and electronic toll payment technology.  "The industry has seen a lot of wild claims in the past. I wonder how real their product is," says Davis. But Raytheon has a track record of delivering components of radar technology. It has been involved in transponder technology for over two decades, McDonald says. It currently makes both silicon chips, used in 915 MHz systems, and gallium arsenate (GaAs) chips, used in higher frequency systems. Applications for its GaAs chips include high frequency intelligent cruise control (ICC) for a number of automotive tier one manufacturers, he says.  The Raytheon chip used in the 35 GHz tag has been patented. McDonald says he is not permitted to discuss the internal technology, which he says is "compatible with industry manufacturing techniques."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CONGESTION PRICINGMAKES ITS DEBUTIN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  Congestion pricing -- enabled by ITS -- gained a toehold last month in southern California with the opening of the privately-owned SR 91 Express Lanes. In fact, that section of California currently is the only part of North America where congestion pricing projects are emerging from the planning stage. Public outcry recently halted an ambitious collection of congestion pricing programs in the state of Washington (see Inside ITS, Aug. 14, 1995). But in addition to the new commercial roadway in Orange County, a variably-priced "HOV buy-in" project in San Diego is moving toward initial implementation this spring.  The SR 91 Express Lanes, developed by the California Private Transportation Company (CPTC) in the median strip of state-owned SR 91, opened for business Dec. 27. The ten mile road is the first in the world to collect tolls entirely through electronic means. MFS Network Technologies in Omaha, Neb. supplies the electronic toll collection (ETC) system, with automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technology supplied by Texas Instruments in Attleboro, Mass.  Patrons pay a variable toll, ranging from 25 cents to $2.50, to travel the Express Lanes. The toll varies according to a fixed schedule, so that the highest fee applies during peak travel periods and the lowest during hours when traffic is lightest. Vehicles with three or more occupants may use the lanes free of charge at all hours, though they must have transponders to validate their status. Drivers who do not wish to pay, or who do not have transponders, remain on the parallel freeway.  CPTC is not disclosing either the number of transponders it is distributing or the volume of traffic the Express Lanes have seen so far -- a privilege it is allowed because it is not a public entity. The firm is "very pleased" with the response it has received from the public so far, says Greg Hulsizer, general manager at CPTC in Anaheim Hills, Calif. "We're literally working 'round the clock to fulfill all the orders, all the applications for transponders," he says, adding that traffic volume on the road has been building since the day it opened.  As CPTC officials expected, the road is used most heavily during peak travel hours -- the westbound lanes in the morning and the eastbound lanes in the evening, Hulsizer says. This is in spite of the fact that the toll is highest at those times.  Patrons who establish toll accounts with credit cards pay no deposit for their transponders but must put at least $40 into a pre-paid toll account. Patrons who use cash or check must pay a $30 deposit and start their toll accounts with at least $50.  CPTC officials at one point in their planning had talked about using actual traffic levels, as determined by traffic surveillance systems, to determine tolls. Under this system, the cost of using the lanes at the same hour on Thursday and Friday, for example, could have been different if actual traffic volumes were different.  "We do have the capability to do that," Hulsizer says. But market research showed that customers "prefer some stability," he says. "They would prefer to know what the toll is when they wake up in the morning, and when they leave work. And so at least for the time being, we've decided to try and stick to our schedule."  A little to the south of Orange County, however, real time traffic conditions eventually will determine what drivers of single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) pay for the privilege of using a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane under San Diego's planned buy-in program. The price will begin at $2.60 and rise as demand increases. "It's going to be run by the computer, and it's going to go as high as it needs to go to maintain a level of service B," says John Duve, project manager, advanced transportation at the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG).  A consortium led by SANDAG is conducting the three year buy-in project under the federal Congestion Pricing Pilot Program, run by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The federal agency is contributing 80 percent of the cost of the $16.1 million project, which focuses on an 8.5 mile, two lane reversible HOV lane in northeastern San Diego (see Inside IVHS, April 10, 1995).  Participants had hoped to start operating an interim version of the system in the fall, but the target is now this spring. Among other things, the need to comply with regulations springing from an "executive order on environmental justice" has delayed the six month planning process, Duve says.  The interim system will operate for six months to a year while participants are installing an electronic toll collection system. Under the interim system, variable fees will not be in effect. Rather, motorists will pay $100 per month for a transponder that will allow them to use the HOV lane. California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers will use portable readers to interrogate the transponders for information indicating whether the motorist's account is up to date. Single occupancy vehicles with unpaid accounts, or without transponders, will be pulled over.  Participants still have not chosen a vendor to supply the ETC system. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is responsible for that part of the project, Duve says. It's still not clear if the state agency will treat the HOV project as an extension to its contract with MFS Network Technologies to supply ETC for toll bridges in the state, or if it will open a new procurement, he says. Any system chosen would have to conform to the Caltrans specifications for non-stop ETC.  It's also not clear yet how many transponders the project will require at the outset, but the number is likely to be small -- probably 3,000-5,000, Duve says. This is based on an estimate of 1,000 cars per hour paying to use the lanes during a three hour period when the HOV lane is open. Unlike most toll authorities, which distribute transponders through special customer service facilities, officials with the San Diego project plan to distribute tags through electronics retailers such as Radio Shack and Circuit City, he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996VOICE-BASED SYSTEMFOR ROUTE GUIDANCEREACHES THE MARKET  Two years after it announced it had developed a voice-based route guidance system, Amerigon in Monrovia, Calif. has started shipping production units. Four manufacturers of audio compact disc players -- Alpine, Clarion, Eclipse and Kenwood -- are selling the "Interactive Voice System" (IVS) under their own labels.  The IVS provides route guidance without the use of a vehicle location system. Instead, the user tells the system the location of the trip's starting point as well as the destination. Once the system generates a route, it provides a list of driving instructions, offering them one at a time, as prompted by the user. In addition to giving directions to addresses the user specifies, it can locate and direct him to restaurants, hotels, cash machines, tourist attractions and other points of interest stored in its database.  The system does not include a screen or a set of buttons. Instead, it uses a voice recognition system to accept commands from the user, and voice output to provide directions, prompts and other messages. Amerigon claims the system can understand the full range of North American dialects and accents.  Map databases and other software are stored on CDs. To operate, the IVS must be connected to a compatible car stereo CD system.  Amerigon's product has undergone several changes since the company displayed a prototype at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas two years ago (see Inside IVHS, Jan. 31, 1994). The company has abandoned its earlier name for the system, AudioNav, in favor of IVS. Each of the CD player manufacturers has given the product its own name, but the term IVS also appears on their packaging and in the software. The term is used to describe the product category; "it's sort of like VHS or GPS," says Paula Finnegan, Amerigon's sales and marketing manager for navigation systems.  More significantly, the production unit relies on a different navigation database than the prototype. Amerigon has displayed versions of the system using data from Etak in Menlo Park, Calif., and the prototype system has been displayed in Etak's booth at trade shows such as the exposition at ITS America's annual meeting.  The unit Amerigon currently is shipping, however, uses data from Navigation Technologies (NavTech) in Sunnyvale, Calif. Finnegan declines to explain the reason for the change. "We have license agreements with both and are still working with both," she says. The company could employ data from either firm, or both, in the future, she adds.  Etak's understanding is that "Amerigon has always intended to use NavTech for their introductory product, and us for later products," says Pamela Crowley, an Etak spokesperson. Crowley speculates that when Amerigon decided on this course, probably two years ago, "at that point probably NavTech had better turn-by-turn data than we did." She would not draw direct comparisons between the quality of the turn-by-turn navigation data available today from the two competing firms.  Other changes include improvements to the speech recognition system, provided by Lernout and Hauspie Speech Products of Belgium, and the addition of non-volatile random access memory (RAM). The latter allows the system to store the vehicle's location (as indicated by the driver) when the car is shut off. Upon returning to the car, if the user immediately wants directions, the system will already know its starting point.  The non-volatile RAM also allows the system to store up to ten frequently-used landmarks -- "like a speed dial feature," Finnegan says. The stored locations can be used as either starting points or destinations. To indicate a stored location the user says, for example, "number one," rather than following the usual procedure, which is to spell out the location letter by letter.  The four manufacturers are selling the IVS for prices in the $600-$700 range. But unless the user already has a compatible CD player installed, the real cost of using IVS also includes the price tag for the audio system. Kenwood is selling the IVS and a CD player in a package as well as selling them separately; the other three treat the IVS only as a separate product, Finnegan says. Pricing varies among the manufacturers and depends on the features of the CD system, but the total cost of an IVS and a compatible CD player begins at about $1,000, she says.  The IVS as sold by Kenwood and Eclipse can be linked to in-dash CD players manufactured by those companies, including systems the user may already have installed. The units sold by Alpine and Clarion connect to CD changers that are installed as add-ons to a car's existing stereo system. Customers buying the system from those companies must buy both the IVS and the changer, Finnegan says. Clarion customers also have the option of buying a "CD changer controller" to link the IVS to a previously-installed CD changer and in-dash stereo, she says.  Whatever price the user pays for the hardware, it does not include access to the map databases. The IVS comes with a package of CDs containing data for all the metropolitan areas currently available. The customer, however, must call a toll free number to obtain an 11 digit pass code which activates the software. Amerigon charges $80 to activate one metropolitan area. Customers who activate more than one metro at once receive a ten percent discount on the second and subsequent databases.  Amerigon chose to give away the discs but charge for activation, rather than simply sell the discs, largely for three reasons, Finnegan says. The first is that this saves the company money by allowing it to pack data for several metro areas on one disc. The metro database Amerigon uses requires less disc space than the corresponding database used in a screen-based navigation system because Amerigon doesn't need the code necessary to draw maps on screen.  The second reason has to do with security, Finnegan says. The pass code a user obtains is keyed to a particular hardware unit. The customer cannot use the disc in a system installed in another car. The third reason is that this distribution method doesn't require retailers to stock discs for all available metro areas as a separate product line, she says.  Databases currently available are: New York/New Jersey; Washington D.C./Baltimore; Los Angeles/Orange counties; Los Angeles five county extended coverage; San Francisco; San Diego; Las Vegas; Chicago; Detroit; and Indianapolis. Amerigon says ten additional databases will be available this spring. Material NavTech distributed at the ITS World Congress in Yokohama, Japan this fall indicates the company also has finished mapping Seattle/Tacoma; Sacramento; Santa Barbara, Calif.; San Bernadino and Riverside counties, Calif.; Phoenix; Denver/Boulder; Houston; Dallas/Fort Worth; Atlanta; Miami; Grand Rapids, Mich; and Philadelphia. It expects to complete Albuquerque, Austin/San Antonio, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Tampa/St. Petersburg this year.  As new databases become available, Amerigon will market them directly to existing customers, Finnegan says. The company also will offer annual updates to the databases; pricing for those has not been determined, she says.  Although the system's main function is to help drivers navigate, Amerigon had its eye on something more when it changed the product's name from AudioNav. "We're calling it IVS, Interactive Voice System, and getting away from just pure navigation, because there is the possibility of additional software titles in the future," Finnegan says. These might include guided tours, educational materials and children's games, all conducted through voice interaction. At the Winter CES in Las Vegas earlier this month, Amerigon demonstrated a voice-based game of blackjack "as a proof of concept," she says.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FUNDING EMERGENCIES,NEED FOR INNOVATIONCHALLENGED ITS IN '95  Last year was marked by both ITS funding crises and innovative attempts to fund ITS projects. Even as the Clinton Administration called for big cuts in spending on highways and other transportation infrastructure, the President began 1995 by asking the new Congress for close to $356 million for ITS programs in fiscal year 1996 -- $66.5 million more than he requested the previous year.  Of the new request, $100 million was for a new initiative called Trailblazer, which would fund model deployments of integrated suites of ITS technology for traffic management and travel information. Trailblazer was to be the first major foray beyond ITS research, testing and planning into the realm of real deployment. Besides this request for a new program, the budget was also complicated by the fact that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a reorganization that would consolidate 10 agencies into three and restructure its funding mechanisms.  With budget hearings still in progress, ITS proponents were alarmed to learn that the House version of last spring's balanced budget resolution called for eliminating the federal ITS program entirely. The Senate version of the resolution did not mention ITS, but the program took a hit over the summer when Clinton signed into law a compromise version of a rescission bill that took back, among other things, $40.03 million in FY95 funds that the ITS program had not yet spent.  In the transportation appropriation for FY96, the ITS program came out with $222.78 million, showing that Congress wished to see the program survive, even though it declined to expand its funding. Trailblazer received no funding, but Congress set aside $10 million to fund operational tests whose focus would coincide with the objectives of that initiative.   The tough fight for funding in 1995 could be just a prelude to more of the same in 1996. "At this juncture, the jury is still out on the question of whether the program is a sound investment of federal dollars. Some projects appear to be yielding useful results; others are floundering," says a report on the federal ITS program released by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office at the end of the year.  As a high-ticket effort that involves years of development and a new mode of transportation, the automated highway system (AHS) program made an easy target for critics who spoke of ITS as "science fiction." The program did obtain funding, although at a reduced level, which will extend the number of years the effort requires. In November, a year after it was selected to lead this effort, the National Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC) achieved its first milestone when it delivered a systems objectives and characteristics document. Another long-term effort of the DOT, to define a national ITS architecture, moved into its second phase when teams led by Rockwell International and Loral Federal Systems were chosen from a field of four competitors to work cooperatively with the DOT.  The DOT selected only four ITS operational tests for funding in 1995, down from 17 the previous year. The smaller scope reflected both the tighter funding situation and the DOT's assertion that it is time to move beyond testing and focus on deployment. Anticipating higher volumes of international traffic due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), two of the tests picked in 1995 will examine automated border crossing systems for commercial vehicle operations (CVO) in California and Arizona.  A much anticipated CVO test focused on Interstate 75 in the U.S. and Highway 401 in Canada officially began its two-year test period late in the year. Advantage I-75 is testing the use of weigh-in-motion (WIM) and vehicle-to-roadside communications (VRC) technologies to allow pre-cleared commercial vehicles to bypass weigh stations.  Another operational test was scaled back dramatically in 1995. The Chicagoland Advanced Driver and Vehicle Advisory Navigation Concept (Advance) project, once touted as the world's largest ITS operational test, slashed the size of its route guidance test from 3,000 to 75 units. Among the reasons given by officials was the need to show results and the slow development of markets for route guidance systems.  Cost was a factor in the decision by Greyhound Bus lines to remove the radar-based collision warning system it purchased from Vorad Safety Systems in 1992. The reported success of the system -- that accident rates decreased over 20 percent in the year after the system was installed -- had become a staple of speeches in support of ITS. But Greyhound officials said the benefits gained from the technology didn't outweigh the cost of keeping them running. Eaton Vorad, the Cleveland-based company formed when Vorad joined forces with Eaton Corp. in 1993, scored a success last year, nevertheless. Freightliner in Portland, Ore. began offering the firm's collision warning system as an option on a new model truck it introduced this year. Freightliner became the first truck manufacturer to offer such a system on a new vehicle.  The past year also saw several efforts to develop innovative funding arrangements for transportation projects in the U.S. The privately-financed SR 91 Express Lanes opened in southern California in December (see story on page 8). In the Puget Sound region of Washington, the idea of congestion pricing has not taken on as well. Public outcry put a stop to a cluster of transportation improvements that were to be financed through congestion pricing mechanisms, using electronic toll collection (ETC) technology to collect revenues.  On the East Coast, the Dulles Greenway, the first privately-owned toll road in the U.S. this century, was completed in September, six months ahead of schedule. So far, however, traffic on the road, which uses an ETC system, has been reported far below expectations. The adjoining Dulles Toll Road, operated by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), continued its rocky path toward the development of its own ETC system, an effort it has had in progress since 1990. Last year's events included the purchase and delivery of ETC hardware from Combitech Traffic Systems in Sweden, which VDOT ultimately decided not to use, and the firing of its prime contractor, Cubic Toll Systems. Late in the year, Syntonic Technology was appointed the new prime contractor.  Helping to clarify some issues related to standards, the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) issued a long-awaited ruling on location and monitoring services in the 902-928 MHz band. This put an end to speculation that the FCC planned to move vehicle-to-roadside communications (VRC) systems off the band entirely and assign them to higher frequencies. The ruling provided relief to many owners and vendors of ETC systems in the U.S., which all currently use that bandwidth, although it came as bad news to Combitech, which opened a U.S. office this year to help promote its own ETC systems, which operate at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz.  Elsewhere in the ETC arena, the president and CEO of AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. apologized in a letter to the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MassPike) for an "overheated" and "offensive" campaign to win an ETC contract. The letter blamed the offenses on John Hassett, who had recently resigned as president of AT/Comm. MassPike awarded the contract to MFS Network Technologies in Omaha, Neb. Specifications for the system were based on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by several Massachusetts agencies to provide for interoperable electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) standards within the state.  No fewer than 15 manufacturers displayed navigation systems at the Tokyo Motor Show, and more rental cars in America added them as options in more markets. But sales of the first factory-installed units of Oldsmobile's Guidestar reportedly have been slow. The market for navigation systems in the U.S. was complicated by a patent dispute involving the two major suppliers of map data and navigation software for that market -- Etak in Menlo Park, Calif. and Navigation Technologies in Sunnyvale, Calif. -- and Zexel USA, a NavTech ally whose technology underlies several of the onboard route guidance systems currently for sale.  While funding for ITS was in question through much of the year, laborers in the ITS field found the money to attend meetings in ever larger numbers. More than 4,500 attended ITS America's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. in March, and the 156 exhibitors there represented a 60 percent increase over the year before. The second ITS World Congress in Yokohama, Japan drew 3,400 participants with approximately 300 attendees coming from North America and just over 300 from Europe. The annual meeting of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA), combined with the third International Electronic Toll and Traffic Management (ETTM) Symposium, drew a record crowd of more than 1,100 to New York. The combined Vehicle Navigation and Information Systems (VNIS) '95 and Pacific Rim TransTech conferences, held in Seattle in July, drew about 900 registrants.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE ITS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996  * Delco Electronics in Kokomo, Ind. has named Trimble   * Delco Electronics in Kokomo, Ind. has named Trimble Navigation in Sunnyvale, Calif. its exclusive supplier of global positioning system (GPS) technology.

Stockholm-based Teleguide, a consortium consisting ofSwedish Telecom, IBM Sweden and Esselte, disclosed earlierthis month that all services would be terminated April 1. Thefledgling service began operations only last March.           Routing Never Gets Off the Ground  Volvo's routing service never made it out of the startinggate. While tests of the service were run on the videotextnetwork for two or three months, the routing feature wasnever formally introduced as a Teleguide service. Volvo hadbeen planning to offer the routing service over Teleguide aspart of a customer service package that included maintenanceand car parts information.  While Volvo officials involved in the project expresseddisappointment that Teleguide services would be terminatedthis spring, the Swedish automaker may have contributed tothe demise of the information service by delaying oreffectively cancelling its introduction of services over thevideotext network. Volvo decided in December not to offer itsplanned Teleguide services.  "Volvo's decision was important for all the Teleguideproducts. When Volvo got out, this was the 'last piece of thecoffin,'" says Thomas Rickne, marketing director ofGeographic Information Systems (GIS) and transport planningat Cyberlogik AB in Gothenburg, Sweden. Cyberlogik was thesupplier of map data and technical support for Volvo's routeplanning service. Cyberlogik, in turn, used a routingalgorithm supplied by Distribution Planning Software (DPS) inHalesowen, West Midlands in the United Kingdom. DPSmanufactures the LogiX product line of routing, schedulingand fleet management software.  Volvo's main contribution to the routing service hadfocused on the development of the user interface for theTeleguide terminals. Unlike routing software packagesdesigned to run on PCs, the Teleguide system was not designedto display maps of the recommended routes. Rather, itdisplayed the point-to-point driving directions as text ondedicated terminals. Volvo's routing service would haveprovided route recommendations for trips on the major highwayand motorway networks. Map data used in the system did notinclude street level information, which would obviouslyprevent the system from calculating routes to specific siteswithin cities.                     Coming Up Short  In explaining Volvo's decision to pull out of the Teleguideproject, Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics atthe automaker's facilities in Gothenburg, notes that the22,000 users currently on the network fall short of the80,000 that had been expected to have terminals in theirhomes and offices by now.  What really doomed the service, however, was not the lowerthan expected number of users, but a lack of willinginvestors, says Olle Elioth, managing director at Teleguide."We tried to find other investors. We were not successful inthat," says Elioth.  Teleguide officials announced the plan to cease operationsafter Swedish Telecom and Esselte, an office equipment andsoftware company, decided to withdraw from the project.Esselte, which has struggled for the past few years, decidedthat Teleguide didn't fit into the recently restructuredcompany, says Elioth.  Swedish Telecom's decision to pull out of Teleguidereflects its move out of videotext services altogether."They're tired of videotext," says Elioth, adding thatSwedish Telecom plans to shut down its business-to-businessvideotext service on Jan. 1, 1994. It has about the samenumber of users as Teleguide. "There will be no publicvideotext service in Sweden from 1994 onwards," he says.  Elioth expresses disappointment about the decision to closethe Teleguide information service: "We'll not see anything ofthis kind in Sweden this side of the year 2000," he says.  The three primary investors collectively lost 325 millionSwedish kronor ($43.5 million) on the Teleguide project,according to Elioth.  For Volvo, its troubles with Teleguide stemmed from higherthan expected development costs. Sources say Volvo hadtrouble developing applications for the videotextenvironment. "They were forced to do a lot of basicprogramming," says Cyberlogik's Rickne, who adds that thelack of good software support significantly inflateddevelopment costs. RDS-TMC Tests Set For Dynaguide InSouthern Norway  While U.S. transportation policy officials continue todebate the data transmission capabilities of RDS-TMC, theircounterparts in Europe are conducting additional tests of thesystem's ability to broadcast traffic information. In thelatest move, transportation officials in Norway are planningthe country's first RDS-TMC (radio data system-trafficmessage channel) tests. The Public Roads Administration islaying the groundwork for a TMC test in Norway's southeasterncorner, not far from Oslo.  Initial plans call for using the Dynaguide TMC unitsdeveloped by Sweden's Volvo AB. Dynaguide, unlike most otherTMC designs, displays traffic information graphically, ratherthan displaying TMC text messages.  "The plan is to test 10 of the Dynaguide units this summerto see if RDS receivers can work with Dynaguide," says FinnBerg, project manager for the traffic information project forthe Public Roads Administration in Tonsberg, Norway.      Volvo Wraps Up First Round of Dynaguide Tests  Volvo is concluding an initial round of tests inGothenburg, Sweden of the first 100 or so Dynaguides built.Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at the Swedishautomaker, says Volvo engineers are compiling informationabout a six week evaluation of the Dynaguide units. The tests-- which involved 70 drivers -- got underway in the firstweek of December. Hellaker says response to units has been"very good."  Dynaguide hardware and software were developed for Volvo byMMI Systems AS in Sandefjord, Norway. Erik Hovland, an MMIofficial, says a handful of the units originally built forVolvo's tests in Gothenburg could be used for the plannedproject in Norway. "We've not decided how many units would beused," he says. Cost estimates for the project are also notavailable.  The scope of the project should become clearer as Hovlandcompletes a study about RDS-TMC for the Norwegianauthorities. He says it should be finished by the first ofMarch. The official name of the project is "trafficinformation and control -- year 2000."  While Berg acknowledges that the government will mostlikely foot the bill for the project, he declines to divulgehow much money has been budgeted for the initiative. Berg andHovland recently met with the Road Directorate in Oslo toinform the national office about the project. Presumably,funding approvals were sought as well.          Lillehammer Olympics Could Benefit  Assuming the project in Tonsberg -- a popular weekenddestination for Oslo residents in the summer -- issuccessful, the RDS-TMC network could be expanded north toLillehammer in time for the winter Olympics next February. "Ithink the Roads Administration is very interested to see theexpansion of this project up to the Lillehammer area," saysHovland, who cautions that such planning is "verypreliminary."  For the Tonsberg area tests, the planning for which is moreadvanced, Hovland says the ALERT-C message protocol used inthe Dynaguide tests in Gothenburg would also be used inNorway. Modifications recently made to ALERT-C by theEuropean Broadcasting Union would not be incorporated intothe planned Norway tests, Hovland says. Traffic messages,however, would have to be translated from Swedish intoNorwegian.  Dynaguide is an in-vehicle information system that convertsTMC text messages into visual symbols displayed on adigitized roadway map. The unit consists of a 5" color LCDthat interfaces to a conventional RDS radio.  Early planning for the Norway project has focused on theDynaguide unit. But the Public Roads Administration is alsoconsidering other text-based TMC devices. "We're looking atboth text and graphical displays," says Berg.  As the manufacturer of Dynaguide, MMI's Hovland isobviously keen to feature Dynaguide in the test. "As far as Iknow, no text-based TMC receivers are under consideration,"says Hovland, who first approached Berg about establishingthe Oslo area RDS-TMC project.  While Volvo is not directly involved in the project, adelegation of Norwegian project officials is scheduled tovisit the automaker's R&D facilities in Gothenburg in midMarch. The trip is designed to familiarize the Norwegianofficials with operation of the TMC network.  In addition to using similarly configured in-vehicle units,the Norwegian project will use the same TMC transmissiongear, which is supplied by Sweden-based Teli. "We have to useequipment we know for the Norway project," says Hovland.Negotiations are currently underway with NRK, the Norwegianbroadcasting company, and a local radio station, abouttransmitting the TMC messages over their subcarriers, saysBerg.             PC Version Also Available  Along with the portable units, project officials in Norwayare interested in testing stationary TMC units that featurethe same graphical interface as the Dynaguide design. Hovlandsays the PC version of Dynaguide could be installed in hotellobbies, gas stations and ferry terminals. "It's alreadydeveloped," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE INTELLIGENT HIGHWAY via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1993JAPAN POLICE AGENCY ADVANCESIVHS EFFORTS OUTSIDE OF VICSby Robert L. French  While Japan's VICS program may be stuck in the mud, twoIVHS initiatives associated with the country's police agencyappear to be making headway independent of the cooperativeprogram. The Japan Traffic Management Technology Association(JTMTA), an industry organization that operates underNational Police Agency (NPA) auspices, has helped develop areal-time traffic information service and a new infrared (IR)vehicle detector.  Rather than challenging the legitimacy of VICS (vehicleinformation communication system), the JTMTA claims the twoinitiatives could spur VICS officials to get their projectgoing. But industry observers note that the new traffic infosystem, called ATISS for advanced traffic information supplyservice, essentially serves some of the same functions asVICS aims to.  VICS has been moving at a slower pace than RACS and AMTICS,the competing predecessor projects that were more or lesssubsumed by VICS in 1991. The Ministry of Post &Telecommunications -- which is the equivalent of the FederalCommunications Commission in the U.S. -- practically forcedRACS and AMTICS participants to join the VICS project, saysources.  The RACS (Road Automobile Communication System) project ofthe Ministry of Construction (MC) and the AMTICS (AdvancedMobile Traffic Information Communication System) project ofthe NPA were vigorously pursuing independent trafficinformation and communication infrastructures to serviceessentially identical in-vehicle navigation and informationsystems. RACS and AMTICS underwent several stages ofexperimentation between 1986 and their consolidation in 1991.  The most visible VICS activity in recent months has beenthe preparation for a VICS demonstration experiment,according to the recent issue of the VICS Newsletter. TheVICS demo is scheduled to be in operation in Tokyo later thisyear.           A New Traffic Information Service  In the meantime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,in conjunction with JTMTA, has spent two years developingATISS to make graphic traffic information available in real-time to terminals -- i.e., computers, fax machines, TVs, --in homes or offices via public switched telephone networks orCATV networks. ATISS may also service in-vehicle units viamobile telephone networks. Computers and in-vehicle terminalsmay use the ATISS information in conjunction with digitalroad maps stored on CD-ROM.  Traffic information to be supplied by ATISS is essentiallythe same as that originally planned for AMTICS, but with theaddition of current travel time for selected road links. AnATISS operating company owned jointly by the Tokyo metropolitangovernment and private industry will be started in June 1993 toprovide traffic information, for a fee, within the Tokyometropolitan area. The company will maintain an ATISS trafficinformation database using data from the traffic control centerof the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and will interfacewith the communications media. Commercial operation of ATISS isexpected to commence after two years of experimental operationinvolving up to 4,000 terminals Officials are planning a similarventure for Osaka.            NPA Develops Optical Beacon  The second police project is the "optical beacon," a newtype of IR vehicle detector that also serves as a high-bandwidth communication device for supplying trafficinformation to, and for receiving link travel times from,equipped vehicles. The optical beacon was developed by theNPA in conjunction with the JTMTA.  As a vehicle detector, the optical beacon reportedlyfunctions as well or better than the ultrasonic detectorwidely used in Japan. In addition, the optical beacon hastwo-way communication capability with a downlink data rate of1,024 kilobits and an uplink rate of 64 kilobits per second.Sources say the optical detector is considerably lessexpensive than the ultrasonic device. The NPA plans toinstall 5,000 optical beacons per year starting in April thisyear. The devices will be integrated into the traffic controlcenters already in place in 74 major cities throughout Japan.  The NPA's objective is to upgrade the existing trafficcontrol system and move toward the next generation systemunder the UTMS (universal traffic management system) concept;the optical beacon would function as an enabling technologyof the new system.             VICS to Evaluate Optical Beacon  The VICS Promotional Council, which has responsibilitythrough its committees for conducting investigations andresearch as well as for promoting the use of VICS technology,has agreed to study the optical beacon as one of severalpossible communications media. Other candidate communicationlinks explored by VICS and/or the predecessor RACS and AMTICSprojects include microwave beacons, tele-terminals (cellular-like mobile data communication systems) and FM sidebands (seeIH, September 1992).  An agreement last fall by the VICS Promotional Council thatits operational body would be organized after consulting withrelevant government authorities lends credence to the notionthat the program has been stalled. The supply of VICSinformation would begin soon after the operational body isestablished. The VICS operation will collect and consolidatetraffic data from the MC for intercity and urban toll roadsand from the police departments for urban streets.

Other current VICS activities include those of theinternational liaison office of the VICS Promotional Councilwhich, in addition to publishing the VICS Newsletter, servesas the principal interface between Japanese IVHS activitiesand those in Europe and North America.

Theproject's two stumbling blocks -- funding support and alicense from the Department of Transport to operate a dynamicroute guidance system in central London -- are beingaddressed with renewed vigor by private and publicparticipants.            Statement in House of Commons  The importance the British government is putting on the newproject was highlighted in late December when Steven Norris,the Transport Minister for London, took the unusual step ofissuing a statement in the House of Commons explaining thebackground of the project. In the statement he confirmed theview that the latest developments in cellular radio havesuperseded the infrared (IR) technology and a new trial wasbeing prepared which the government would monitor closely.  However, due to the adverse publicity stemming from thecontinued delay in implementing the IR beacon-basedAutoguide, both the Department of Transport and GEC, TIGER'smain backers, are wary about publicizing the new project.        License Could Be Granted Within 10 Weeks  In any event, it looks as if the project is proceeding.Eric Sampson, a senior official at the Department ofTransport, estimates that a license under the Road TrafficAct could be granted to TIGER (Traffic Information andGuidance on European Roads) officials within the next 10weeks. Several versions of a licensing agreement have beendrafted. "Lawyers are crawling over it, as lawyers do," hesays.  While Sampson acknowledges that the licensing process isadvancing slowly, he says GEC is largely responsible for thepace of the negotiations and that the firm does not seemunhappy with the current status of the effort. "GEC is not onmy doorstep screaming and shouting," he says.  In addition to seeking the license, TIGER officials haveapplied for government funding for the project from theDepartment of Trade and Industry. GEC's Nigel Stansfield, theproject manager, says the total cost of the trial should be10 million pounds sterling to 15 million pounds sterling.Project costs would be shared among TIGER participants andthe British government. Funding from the Department of Tradeand Industry would be channeled through the PROMETHEUSprogram, which Stansfield says could provide 25 to 40 percentof the project costs.  Along with GEC, TIGER participants include: Ford, BritishTelecom, and the two main motoring organizations, the RoyalAutomobile Club (RAC) and the Automobile Association (AA).           200 to 500 Cars Could Be Equipped  Stansfield says each of the main participants will have aspecific role within the project. GEC will manage the trialas well as operating a dedicated traffic information center,which is slated to be in North London. Ford would supply testvehicles, probably up to 200 but maybe as high as 500. TheRAC is set to supply the traffic information, which would betransmitted to the North London traffic center from the RAC'sown traffic control center in Croyden, south London. The AAwould supply the in-vehicle digitized road maps while British.Telecom would supply the in-vehicle communications hardware.as well as the cellular link. TIGER is planning to use Cellnet,a private cellular company which is 60 percent owned by BritishTelecom.  For in-vehicle navigation systems, TIGER will most likelyuse equipment from Philips, Motorola and Robert Bosch,according to Stansfield. Following the trial, TIGER officialsmay decide to market one of the three systems or anotherdesign.  TIGER is designed to guide motorists through the leastcongested streets. Dynamic traffic information would betransmitted to the specially equipped cars over the cellularnetwork. The vehicles themselves would act as probes of theroadway network as vehicle positions and travel speeds wouldbe transmitted back to the traffic center. The field trial'sboundaries have not yet been established. But it's expectedthat the route guidance system would cover the area withinthe city's North and South Circular Roads.              Local Concern About Rat-Runners  While the Department of Transport may be in favor of theTIGER project, some local authorities have another opinion.John Davies, director of highways for the Royal Borough ofKensington and Chelsea -- one of the busy inner Londonboroughs -- and also transport advisor to the London BoroughsAssociation -- which represents the views of many Londonboroughs -- fears route guidance systems are likely toencourage motorists to abandon the main roads and start usingotherwise quiet residential streets, much to the annoyance oflocal residents.  He believes the deployment of more traditional trafficmitigation measures would be a more effective way of reducinglocal congestion. Davies favors better parking control and"urban clearways," rather than trying to displace vehiclesfrom busy streets altogether.  If necessary, Davies says he will not hesitate to preventcars equipped with route guidance systems from usingresidential streets in his borough. "We shall make some sidestreets one-way only and put chicanes and speed humps onothers to make sure motorists won't use them."  Like other London borough engineers, Davies says he alreadygets many letters from local residents complaining aboutexcessive traffic on residential streets, and he fears that aroute guidance system would simply encourage more motoriststo become "rat-runners," (who try to dodge traffic on themajor roads by driving on smaller, residential routes).  The Department of Transport's Sampson acknowledges thatlocal concerns about rat-runners have to be addressed. "Theboroughs are worried that route guidance systems will sendtraffic from the larger roads onto smaller roads," he says.  As part of its role in the project, the Department ofTransport has announced it will hold discussions with all therelevant bodies that might be affected by the project. Theyinclude representatives from London's 33 borough councils,the Metropolitan Police and London's Traffic Director.  Despite his concerns, Davies does believe a dynamic routeguidance system would be useful in helping motorists find thebest bridges to drive across the river Thames. At present, hesays many motorists make uninformed guesses about whichbridges are least congested.  Stansfield predicts that the main trial should begin in thesummer of 1994 and will last for at least six months.Assuming the project is a success, he estimates that acommercial product could be available by 1996 or '97, perhapswith a price tag as low as 500 pounds sterling with an annualsubscription fee of 100 to 200 pounds sterling.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE INTELLIGENT HIGHWAY via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1993U.S. DELEGATION SEEKS EUROSUPPORT FOR NEW ISO PANEL  A group of IVHS industry officials in the U.S. is spearheadingan intiative to establish international IVHS standards. The IVHSdivision of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) inWarrendale, Pa. has succeeded in establishing an internationalIVHS standards committee within the International StandardsOrganization (ISO) in Geneva.  Earlier this month, the new technical committee, TC 204,held a "preparatory meeting" in Geneva in an attempt tosolicit support and cooperation from European IVHS/RTIofficials already involved in standards making activity.Seventeen officials attended the meeting. The mainstandardization organizations in Europe were represented atthe one-day event, including the InternationalElectrotechnical Commission (IEC), European ElectrotechnicalStandardization Organization (CENELEC), EuropeanStandardization Organization (CEN), International Telegraphand Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) and theInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU).      SAE Serves as Secretariat of New Committee  "We really have the support of all these nationalorganizations," says Arlan Stehney, an SAE official who isserving as secretariat of the new ISO committee. SAE, as anorganization, will serve as secretariat of TC 204 on behalfof the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),according to Stehney.  While the list of organizations and acronyms may beconfusing, the stated purpose of the new committee is not,say its organizers. "What the ISO does is really pull themall together," says Stehney. "Their standards efforts willchannel into the ISO committee." He stresses that the new ISOcommittee will not replace other RTI/IVHS standardizationefforts currently underway.        International Standards: A Tall Order  Electronic toll collection and other related applications,such as road pricing, is an area of immediate concern to RTIofficials in Europe and to their counterparts in the U.S. Asthe number of electronic toll systems competing in themarketplace continues to grow rapidly, the incompatibility ofthose systems threatens to compromise the convenience gainspromised by the technology. The well-documented difficultythat state and regional officials have encountered in tryingto establish standards for electronic tolling underscores thecomplexity of the issues the ISO is trying to address on aninternational scale. The establishment of regional, let alonenational, standards has proved to be a daunting task.  The initiative is obviously an ambitious one and it remainsto be seen whether the existing standardizing bodies willfully cooperate with ISO's new IVHS committee, which,incidentally, has tentatively adopted the European acronymRTI, for road transport informatics.             Duplication of Work Avoided  Considerable work on IVHS/RTI standards is already underwayin Europe, particularly within CEN and CENELEC. "We're tryingto avoid any kind of duplication of work," says Siemens'director of exterior relations, Heinz Sodeikat, who attendedthe ISO meeting on behalf of the IEC and CENELEC. Sodeikatpoints out that CEN and CENELEC have previously reachedagreements about which RTI application areas the two groupswill develop standards for. CENELEC focuses on"electrotechnical" issues while CEN covers non-electrotechnical systems, he says.  While Sodeikat expresses a willingness to cooperate withthe new ISO committee, he notes that there are already "toomany" committees working on RTI standardization issues."Unfortunately, it's inevitable," he says.  Dik Van Wijk, a project manager from the Dutch Ministry ofTransport who serves as chairman of CEN's RTI committee, issupportive of the new ISO committee. What's more, he sayssupport for it is growing in Europe. Initially, officialsfrom many European countries "did not show much enthusiasm"for the ISO initiative, says Van Wijk. But since the ISOtechnical board formally approved the RTI committee plan inDecember, more countries have expressed a willingness tocooperate with it.  Six countries, including three in Europe, have alreadyestablished official links to the ISO committee. They are theNetherlands, U.K., Czechoslovakia, Japan, China and the U.S.Others are expected to join. "Germany has already indicatedthat they're interested," says Stehney.  Even with their most optimistic outlook, organizers of theISO committee don't expect to establish internationalstandards for all IVHS applications. "There may be areaswhere international standards are not viable," acknowledgesStehney, who cites radio frequency allocation as a likelyproblem area. "You can't standardize frequencies," he says.  Richard J. Weiland, vice chairman of SAE's IVHS division,agrees. "The magic word in the international arena isharmonization," he says. Weiland is the general manager ofSEI Technology Group as well as chairman of the standards andprotocols committee of IVHS America, the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that serves as an advisory committee tothe U.S. Department of Transportation.  Along with other members of the U.S. delegation, Weilandwas pleased with the outcome of the Geneva meeting. Twoinformal resolutions were passed. One recognizes theorganizations currently involved with RTI standardization inEurope and recommends that once an initial work program isaccepted, that an ISO/CEN coordination meeting be convened.The other resolution stemmed from a separate meeting the sameday with an existing ISO committee -- TC 22 -- that isalready working on RTI standards. TC 22 is ISO'sroad/vehicles committee. The new and existing ISO committeeshave agreed that TC 22 will retain primary responsibility forman-machine interface and other in-vehicle systems while thenew RTI committee -- TC 204 -- will be responsible foroverall systems and infrastructure issues.       ISO Committee Proposes 11 Working Groups  ISO's new RTI committee is proposing to establish 11working groups. They are 1. architecture and open systeminterfaces; 2. spatial databases; 3. traffic/transit/parkinginformation collection and distribution; 4. trafficmanagement systems and coordination; 5. public, emergency andcommercial fleet management; 6. short range communications;7. wide area communications; 8. navigation, positioning androute guidance; 9. safety critical software; 10. humaninterfaces and ergonomics; and 11. vehicle/highwayautomation.  The structure of the new committee and its program of workwill be discussed further at the first formal meeting of TC204, which will be in Washington, D.C. Stehney says the eventis scheduled to take place April 19-21 at the GeorgetownUniversity Conference Center. The meeting is open tointerested parties.

For an undisclosed sum, Westinghouse hasacquired the exclusive rights to market and operateTrafficmaster in four regions of the U.S. The system, whichnotifies motorists about traffic congestion on localhighways, is currently operating on the M25 motorway inLondon.            Westinghouse Becomes U.S. Licensee  "It's the only commercialized system successfully operatingin the world. There's no reason we shouldn't have it here,"says Dan B. Zeitlin, manager of IVHS systems at Westinghouseand the person in charge of its Trafficmaster project.  As part of the agreement, General Logistics will supplyWestinghouse with the in-vehicle hardware and roadsideequipment as well as training and engineering support.Depending on which firm you ask, the agreement extends for 12or 15 years. Both parties describe the pact as a "long termagreement."   Westinghouse is planning to launch two Trafficmaster pilotprojects this year and to introduce commercial service atthose same sites next year. Don't expect to seeadvertisements for Trafficmaster, however. The system will bemarketed under a different name, which Westinghouse hasn'tyet selected. The firm is open to suggestions, according toZeitlin, who says Westinghouse's legal department andmarketing gurus are mulling over a list of proposed names."It's a huge list," he says.  While the two firms signed the agreement in late December,neither has formally announced it. What's more, neither partywill say what the contract is worth nor what regions of theU.S. are covered in the agreement. "I'm not at liberty todisclose the value of the deal. But we're very happy withit," says David K. Martell, chairman and managing director atGeneral Logistics.  Westinghouse plans to release more details about theagreement after it has secured approval from a localtransportation authority to proceed with a pilot project."Clearly, we need the public authorities' approval," saysZeitlin. "We're having discussions with transportationofficials."           Trafficmaster on Capital Beltway?  Sources close to the project say Westinghouse is initiallytargeting the Capital Beltway in Washington, D.C. and theBaltimore Beltway as sites for the first pilot projects.While Zeitlin declines to confirm this, he doesn't deny iteither. "Certainly, Maryland is of great interest becausewe're based here. And the D.C. area is a good market," saysZeitlin in response to questions about the two sites.  Martell says the agreement permits Westinghouse to operateTrafficmaster services in four states. Zeitlin says thelicensing agreement covers four territories, and that morethan four states are included in those territories. In anyevent, Zeitlin says Westinghouse wants to establishTrafficmaster services on the east coast, west coast and inthe midwest.  At present, Westinghouse is the only Trafficmaster licenseein the U.S. General Logistics, however, is currently engagedin negotiations with other firms interested in marketingTrafficmaster elsewhere in the U.S. Martell doesn't expectany other agreements will be signed in the next "couplemonths." He says the Westinghouse deal is "by far the mostadvanced" of the initiatives underway in North America.General Logistics has already signed licensing agreementswith firms in Italy and Austria.           U.K. Expansion Set for April 27  Back in the U.K., General Logistics has set April 27 as thelaunch date for the expanded Trafficmaster network, whichwill extend to Birmingham, Bristol and the Channel ports. Theexisting network includes 120 infrared (IR) traffic detectorsites; the expanded network will add 300 more sites. Martellsays detectors at 230 of the 300 new sites have already beeninstalled.  To date, Martell says there are more than 3,000Trafficmaster subscribers using the London area network. Overthe past six months, he says 200 new subscribers have beenrecruited per month. "With the geographic expansion, thatfigure should increase dramatically," he says.  Unlike most other IVHS projects in the U.S., Westinghouse'sTrafficmaster plan doesn't call for federal funding.Trafficmaster is a commercial service: in the U.K., theportable unit is priced at 199 pounds sterling and themonthly subscription charge is 20 pounds sterling.Installation is 50 pounds sterling. A rental option permitssubscribers to pay 30 pounds sterling per month in user feesin addition to the 50 pound sterling installation charge.  While pricing has not been established for the U.S.introduction of Trafficmaster, the basic system design willnot be modified by Westinghouse, at least not initially. Theportable receiver is designed to work in a vehicle. Theunit's backlit LCD displays areas of congestion on themotorway network by means of flashing blocks, which show thelocation, speed and direction of snarled traffic.  The system relies on a dedicated network of IR trafficdetectors that log the speed of passing vehicles. If the IRdevices determine that traffic is traveling below a pre-setthreshold of 30 mph, a message is relayed via a data radiolink supplied by Paknet, Ltd. to the Trafficmaster controlcenter in Luton. Updated traffic information is thentransmitted every three minutes from the control center tothe in-car receivers. The information is broadcast to theportable units over the Air Call Paging network. Westinghouseis planning to use IR traffic detectors and a paging networkfor its Trafficmaster system in the U.S. "We're innegotiations with a paging company," says Zeitlin.Westinghouse may not, however, use a data radio link totransmit information from the remote traffic detectors to thecontrol center. Zeitlin says project officials areconsidering other means of transmitting the raw traffic data,such as land lines.         Westinghouse Initiates Negotiations  The Westinghouse/General Logistics deal stemmed fromnegotiations initiated by Westinghouse. "They approached usabout a year ago," says General Logistics' Martell.Westinghouse, which is making a considerable investment inseveral IVHS applications areas, sees Trafficmaster as one ofits traveler information system offerings. "This is only partof it," says Zeitlin. In the future, Westinghouse mayintegrate the Trafficmaster data with other trafficmanagement systems, he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE INTELLIGENT HIGHWAY via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1993U.K. RTI GROUP LINES UPSTEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS  The newly formed RTI/IVHS information group in the UnitedKingdom has established a steering committee that includesseveral key players in the industry. RTI Focus (UK) Ltd., anew group with non-profit status based at the government'sTransport Research Laboratory in Berkshire, has the supportof the Department of Transport and major electronics firms,transport consultancies and academia.      Department of Transport Supports New Group  Susan Harvey, the company's founding chief executive, saysthe steering committee consists of representatives from theDepartment of Transport, the Department of Trade andIndustry, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), PeekTraffic, GEC Traffic Controls, Jaguar, Dowty Electronics, theRoyal Automobile Club (RAC), the Met Office, University ofLondon Transport Studies Unit, Croyden Borough Council(London), Strathclyde Borough Council (Glasgow), LondonTransport, the Metropolitan Police, Travers Morgan andHalcrow Fox.  Harvey says that the steering committee members have had topay a hefty 4,000 pound sterling annual subscription fee,which will help defray the 150,000 pound sterling start-upand operating costs. However, she says the annual fee for thesteering committee members is expected to decline to 3,000pounds sterling in the second year and to 2,000 poundssterling in the third year.  Harvey says the next step for RTI Focus is to recruitadditional members. She expects the group to be fullyoperational by June and, in time, to include up to 200 firms.The cost of becoming a member without representation on thesteering committee has been set at 500 pounds sterling.  The group's primary role, according to Harvey, is topromote the interests of its members as well as advancing RTIdevelopments. One of the main benefits of membership, shesays, will be access to the large RTI database which is to beestablished at the TRL and will contain details of industryfirms in the U.K. as well as RTI developments abroad.  In addition, she says the group will publish a quarterlynewsletter, arrange four meetings a year for the steeringcommittee and organize two seminars per year which allmembers would be eligible to attend.         Liaison Sought With Other Associations  RTI Focus has received support from officials in Brusselsand from the Department of Transport in London aboutpresenting papers at upcoming seminars, Harvey says. In thefuture, she hopes the group will have enough funding to beable to commission its own RTI research. The group has alsoestablished contacts with officials at the ERTICO and DRIVEoffices in Brussels and at the IVHS America office inWashington, D.C.  Prior to starting up the RTI association, Harvey was anindustrial advisor and transport specialist at the NationalEconomic Development Office (NEDO) in London. In addition toHarvey's role at RTI Focus, she has recently established anew transport consultancy in London, named Traffic SolutionsLtd. Harvey, along with partner Peter O'Neil, who formerlyworked at the DRIVE office in Brussels, is planning to do RTIconsulting work.                 How Big Is The Market?  A recent NEDO report estimates the size of the UK RTIindustry at about 60 million pounds sterling. By the year2010, NEDO estimates the RTI market will be worth 3 billionpounds sterling. "The same phenomenal growth is also beingpredicted worldwide," says Harvey. The biggest potentialgrowth areas in RTI are dynamic route guidance systems andelectronic tolls, she says.  Eamonn McArdle, managing director of Peek Traffic, believesthe new group will play a significant role in promoting RTI."We hope the group will campaign on behalf of major RTIissues as well as helping to push sales of new U.K. RTIproducts for all the members."Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE INTELLIGENT HIGHWAY via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1993NEWS IN BRIEF  *It looks as if the new presidential administration inWashington, D.C. will continue to support, and fund, IVHS. Aspart of his recently unveiled economic plan, President BillClinton is calling for $345 million in IVHS funding forfiscal years 1994-1997. The plan also calls for $100 millionin IVHS funding for FY98, which is beyond Clinton's currentterm.  While these numbers appear to be reduced from the IVHSfunding levels outlined in the six-year Intermodal SurfaceTransportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) passed in 1991, thebudget numbers cited above reportedly are intended to beadditions to the ISTEA provisions, according to the FederalHighway Administration, which sought an explanation of thefigures from the Office of Management and Budget. ISTEAauthorizes $113 million per year in IVHS funding. If Congressapproves Clinton's plan, federal funding for IVHS over thenext four years could top $200 million per year. Bycomparison, the federal government -- under the BushAdministration -- has budgeted $143 million in IVHS fundingfor the current fiscal year.  *Copies of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT)IVHS strategic plan are available from the FHWA's office oftraffic management and IVHS. The DOT submitted the five yearplan to Congress in December as required by ISTEA. Requestsfor copies can be faxed to the FHWA at 202-366-2249 or mailedto the agency at 400 7th Street S.W., Washington, D.C.,20590.  The 67 page document outlines the goals and milestones ofthe DOT's IVHS program for the next five years. "What isneeded is a 'smarter' surface transportation system, one thatactually functions as an integrated intermodal system,offering improved safety, more efficient use ofinfrastructure, and enhanced user choices through theapplication of IVHS technologies and services," writes theDOT in the executive summary of its report.  While the report acknowledges IVHS America's contributionto DOT's plan, the federal agency's report does not derivedirectly from the five year strategic plan developed by theWashington, D.C.-based advocacy group, says George Beronio, asystems engineer at FHWA.  DOT's plan establishes 18 milestones to be accomplishedduring the next five years. "Beyond 1997, deployment of anationally compatible IVHS system will become theDepartment's primary concern. Work will shift towardssupporting deployment of IVHS user services, and continuingprogress on long-term IVHS goals, especially the AutomatedHighway System," writes the DOT.  *Following expansion of its Trafficmaster network up to theBirmingham area, General Logistics is hoping to establish itstraffic information system in Scotland. David K. Martell,chairman and managing director at General Logistics in Lutonnear London, says negotiations are underway with the ScottishOffice about installing Trafficmaster on the motorways in theGlasgow and Edinburgh area. While compatible with the systemin England, Martell says the Scottish system would beoperated separately.  *For electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) systemvendors, the order of the day seems to be to sue one another.In the latest move, AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. has filedtwo patent infringement suits against its chief competitors,Amtech and Mark IV/Vapor.

The loss emerged after the railway operator bought preferredshares issued by its Hawaiian subsidiary as part of its capitalincrease, using 84 million dollars Seibu lent to it producing aforeign exchange loss of 2.85 billion yen, Masao Horiguchi, managingdirector of Seibu, told a news conference.     Horiguchi said the replacement of the loans with preferredshares is to reduce the burden of interest payments by Aina KamaliiCorp. and thus to improve its earnings standing.     Aina Kamalii runs hotels and golf courses in Hawaii.     Seibu Railway has no plans to revise its earnings projection forthe current fiscal year ending March 31, announced Nov. 24, becausethe loss had already been factored in, he said.     According to the projection, Seibu Railway's unconsolidatedpretax profit will reach 500 million yen on operating revenues of 229billion yen.  Net profits are expected to hit 2.3 billion yen.     By the end of next March, the company will replace another 76million dollars worth of the loan with preferred shares to be issuedby Aina Kamalii, producing a foreign exchange loss of some 2.3billion yen, but this loss, too, has been discounted, Horiguchi said.     The rest of Seibu Railway's loans to Aina Kamalii, totaling 560million dollars, will be replaced with preferred shares in the nextfiscal year, he said.     This is likely to incur a foreign exchange loss of some 4billion yen, which the company is considering offsetting by sellingland, he said.Back to Headline List WT03-B14-27IA086-000621-B041-115http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ts08.html 205.156.212.5 19970122054142 text/html 28930HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:39:35 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:16 GMTContent-length: 28743Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ts08.html Sample Issue Copyright TRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNet November 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FINALISTS IN OPORTO METRO PROJECT TO BE CHOSEN (115 words) ADTRANZ AND POLISH RAIL TO SIGN USD200 MILLION DEAL (141 words) BRITISH AIRWAYS AND BANQUE RIVAUD TO SAVE AIR LIBERTE (166 words) UNITED STATES APPROVES SAS/UNITED AIRLINES ALLIANCE (87 words) AIRBUS: HISTORIC DEAL WITH USAIR (263 words) AIRPORTS: PANOPLY OF INITIATIVES TO REDUCE NOISE (346 words) OPEN SKIES STILL OVER THE HORIZON (285 words) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL: WILL THE EUROPEAN UNION JOIN A REVAMPED EUROCONTROL?

Thisagreement, for which a final contract must still be prepared, is worthsome USD18 billion and constitutes a victory over Boeing, Airbus's maincompetitor.For the past several months, Airbus has been running nearly neck and neckwith Boeing. Last Spring, the European consortium sold 30 A320s to China,a market until recently dominated by Boeing and its B737. In July, Airbuswon a contract worth USD two billion to sell 45 aircraft to GeneralElectric's leasing company. Since their introduction in the early 1980s,1,110 planes from the A319/320/321 family have been sold to 64 airlines(450 of them to North American customers), of the 2,204 machines thatAirbus has sold worldwide. The diversification of a single type ofaircraft into several versions is a concept that appeals to airlines, asit allows them to achieve operational economies. The same pilot isqualified to fly all three aircraft, which have identical cockpits, andmaintenance, a source of considerable costs, is also similar. During thefirst ten months of the year, Airbus captured 42% of the market with 125-and 350-seat planes, the same range covered by the A319/320/321/330twin-engine models and the four-engine A340.Copyright 1996 TRANSPORT EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 15, 1996AIRPORTS: PANOPLY OF INITIATIVES TO REDUCE NOISEfrom TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67As the European Commission launches an offensive against noise within theframework of its November 5 Green Paper on this issue (see separatearticle in Section III), European airports are up in arms. After Britishauthorities enacted drastic regulations on London's airports, sparkingprotests from airlines, the Italian Environment Ministry introduced aseries of measures aimed at quelling noise around the country's airportson October 21.The Italian measures would close airports between midnight and six in themorning and apply only to civil aviation. The international airports ofFiumicino in Rome and Malpensa in Milan would remain open, but only forinternational flights. This proposed noise reduction Decree would alsochange certain flight paths, institute a noise inspection for eachaircraft every two years and require airport management companies topresent a noise reduction plan to municipalities affected by theiractivities. Companies that break the rules will be fined two million Lirefor violations during the day, five million for excessive night noise andseven million for nocturnal landings at international airports. A secondDecree concerns urban development in the areas surrounding airports andwould prohibit the construction of housing where noise exceeds 65 decibels.IATA protests against British measures.The anti-noise regulations published by the British Government last Summersets maximum noise levels for aircraft taking off from Heathrow, Gatwickand Stansted at three decibels below international standards, effectiveJanuary 1, 1997. More frequent inspections and heavy fines for violatorsare also provided for. The International Air Transport Association (IATA)is opposed to the regulations, "the main impact of which will be topenalise all airlines, including those with the most modern aircraft".Parallel to its General Assembly in Geneva, the Association decided toinitiate legal proceedings against the British Government's Decree. Thenew standards, which would be the strictest in the world, according to theIATA, would prevent companies from using their planes at full capacity andpenalise even those most concerned about the environment.Copyright 1996 TRANSPORT EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 15, 1996OPEN SKIES STILL OVER THE HORIZONfrom TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67Meeting in Geneva on November 4 and 5, the member companies of theInternational Air Transport Association (IATA) observed that their numbersinclude both supporters and opponents of worldwide deregulation. The majorAmerican, European and Asian companies take an ultra-liberal view, whilethe smaller companies of the developing world, unsure as to whether theycan survive in an overly competitive environment and desirous of remainingindependent on issues of national sovereignty, have reservations or simplyreject the idea of global liberalisation. While not categorically opposedto deregulation, some smaller airlines in the European Union wonder howthe process of deregulation, already largely under way within theCommunity, can be enlarged to encompass non-European, i.e. Americancarriers.However, the prospect of an open sky between Europe and the United States,which have similar attitudes to liberalisation, is still apparently sometime off, given the harsh competition on this market of 600 milliontravellers, which accounted for more than half of worldwide passengertraffic in 1995, according to the IATA. The Americans criticised thesubsidies that European carriers receive and the Community regulationsthat protect them, while the European Commission's representative accusedAmerican authorities of not considering the liberalisation of its market apriority.The 254 member countries of the IATA are expected to achieve record netprofits of USD5.5 billion in 1996, a return rate considered encouraging.The main reasons are restructuring and reductions in operating costs,although the rising price of fuel is still a concern. The next GeneralAssemblies of the IATA will be held in November 1997 in Amman, Jordan, andin June 1998 in Montreal.Copyright 1996 TRANSPORT EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 15, 1996AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL: WILL THE EUROPEAN UNION JOIN A REVAMPED EUROCONTROL?from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67In the wake of its March White Paper on air traffic control, the EuropeanCommission unveiled a draft brief for the negotiation of Communitymembership in Eurocontrol, which is responsible for management of airtraffic in Europe, on November 13, "so that the European sky can bemanaged as a common resource, unrestricted by national boundaries".However, the Community cannot join Eurocontrol unless its current areas ofcompetence and powers are reformed and enhanced. The Commission is hopingthat the Council of Transport Ministers will reach a common position onthe proposed mandate at its December 12 and 13 meeting. The European CivilAviation Conference (ECAC) will issue an opinion on the revision of theEurocontrol Convention in February 1997, within the framework of itsINSTAR strategic study.In a White Paper published on March 6, the Commission discussed the needto improve European air traffic control and combat growing congestion,which causes delays and creates additional costs for carriers. The thirdoption set out in the White Paper, and the Commission's favourite,provides explicitly for the EU's accession as a full member to a"reinvented Eurocontrol", to ensure Community competence over air trafficmanagement and avoid any clash of competence between the two organisationsby allowing the Member States to speak with a single voice. This approachwould separate regulatory tasks (which would be the province of the newEurocontrol) and operational activities (the responsibility of the MemberStates).In the draft mandate it tabled on November 13, the Commission defines thesteps it considers necessary to take to implement the recommendations ofthe White Paper. But two main elements must still be clarified, i.e. whatadditional responsibilities and powers will be conferred upon Eurocontrolto make the organisation capable of fulfilling its new role, and underwhat procedure will the Community become a member of the reformedorganisation? Thinking strategically, the Commission plans to submit itsproposals for the Council's opinion before the end of the year (with aview to a common position at the Transport Council of December 12 and 13),to pre-empt any attempt by the 33 member countries of the European CivilAviation Conference (ECAC) to reform Eurocontrol without taking account ofthe Community position at their Ministerial meeting in February.Eurocontrol Convention review.The EU's Transport Ministers must take a position as to whether to grantthe Commission a brief to negotiate with the non-EU members of Eurocontrolon a revision of the Eurocontrol Convention which would expand theorganisation's role and allow the European Union per se to join. Themandate is also expected to give the EU the right to vote and thus tooppose any decision it considers contrary to Community interests.Two models for Eurocontrol reform.Meanwhile, the ECAC is working to finalise INSTAR, a strategic study onthe reform of European air traffic control. Although the Commission wouldprefer the particular approach mentioned above, the White Paper left theway open to new discussions with all concerned organisations, includingECAC. In the intervening months, the two models have convergedsignificantly, although certain important points, including some relatedto the competence of the future Eurocontrol, must still be settled,including:* the principle of a separation between regulatory functions and provisionof services;* proposals concerning management of airspace (the Commission sees thefuture Eurocontrol as having responsibility for structuring the Europeanairspace, defining military zones and flight paths and improving controlin border areas);* the definition of common objectives for safety services and access toairspace (which would devolve upon the revamped Eurocontrol under option 3of the White Paper);* coordination of technological research and development activities (theECAC would like this to be the task of Eurocontrol, while the Commissionwould prefer this coordination to take place within the EU's FrameworkProgrammes for research);* the creation of financial mechanisms to support common policy on airtraffic control (the Commission considers it important to allow the newEurocontrol to fund common initiatives).Eurocontrol presents annual report for 1995.In 1995, Eurocontrol had two good reasons to be satisfied with itsperformance: on the one hand because it practically completed the thirdand final phase of its EATCHIP programme on the harmonisation andintegration of air traffic control, and on the other as the new CentralFlow Management Unit (CFMU) took up its mission to reduce the congestionof European airspace (becoming fully operational in March 1996).Eurocontrol currently has 22 member countries: the EU Member States minusFinland and Spain (accession pending), plus Turkey, Malta, Cyprus,Hungary, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Romania(the accession of Croatia and the Slovak Republic is being formalised).Eurocontrol also has an important role to play in the management ofEuropean air traffic since, having been recognised as the responsibleauthority by a European Parliament Resolution of November 1995, it is nowregarded by the European Commission as having an essential contribution tomake to reforming the management of Europe's skies.Copyright 1996 TRANSPORT EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 15, 1996BRITISH AIRWAYS/AMERICAN AIRLINES ALLIANCE ON HOLDfrom TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67A proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, aimedat establishing the world's largest air transport entity, is conditionalupon a number of decisions. It must be approved by London, Washington andthe European Commission, and its fate is also hinges on the outcome ofopen sky pact negotiations between the United States and the UK. TheUnited States' approval is contingent upon the conclusion of an open skyAgreement. The approval of the British Government is considered the mosteasily overcome regulatory obstacle for BA and American, which are hopingto get the go-ahead by the end of November. Based on a report by theOffice of Fair Trading, one of the UK's competition authorities, theMinistry of Trade and Industry could accept the project, subject itsapproval to conditions or instigate another phase in the competitioninquiry, by submitting the proposal to the Monopolies and MergersCommission.The resumption of negotiations between the UK and US in Washington onNovember 7 and 8 is considered a good omen for the future of BritishAirways. Discussions so far have always foundered (on August 27, theAmerican delegation suspended talks on the ground that British proposalswere inadequate) and experts doubt that the companies will be able toimplement their agreement before the planned date of their alliance inApril 1997. Talks between the two countries could resume at Ministeriallevel in early December. The main point of discussion is access forAmerican carriers to London's airports, including Heathrow. The proposedBA/AA alliance sparked a strong reaction from USAir, the fifth largestAmerican company, which criticised a code-sharing agreement with BritishAirways in protest.Copyright 1996 TRANSPORT EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 15, 1996FORMAL GO-AHEAD FOR AIR TRANSPORT NEGOTIATIONS WITH CEECS.from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67The EU's Council of Ministers gave the formal rubber-stamp on November 11to a Decision (on which the Transport Ministers had already agreed inprinciple at their October 3/4 Council meeting) giving the EuropeanCommission a mandate to negotiate air transport Agreements between the EUand Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia (see last issue of TransportEurope).Copyright 1996 TRANSPORT EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTRANSPORT EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 15, 1996NEW APPOINTMENTS AT INTERNATIONAL UNION OF RAILWAYS.from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67Meeting in Paris on October 31, the General Assembly of the InternationalUnion of Railways (UIC) appointed officers for the next few years.

The additional funds would be usedfor trans-European transport networks and the budget line on transportpolicy, in which the Council planned to make severe cuts.As is its right within the limits of the financial perspective, theParliament restored credits that the Council had dropped in July. In thearea of internal policy, the Parliament decided to create a reserve of ECU300 million, including putting ECU 73 million in a negative reserve tofinance the 14 priority trans-European transport projects. This accountingtrick would allow it to dip into funds from heading 3 during execution ofthe Budget.

Life is livedout at full throttle as motorcycles seem to hoot their way not justaround you, but over and under you, in their impatience to get onwith life.I had insisted we travel only by the ubiquitous cyclo - still aleading form of transport outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. But Ihadn't bargained for the aftermath of typhoons Frankie and Nicki,which left me knee-deep in water before I had even reached therendezvous.When I finally arrived, my guide, Mr Hieu, was all smiles - and sowas I when I found he had lined up a car as well as a couple ofcyclos for us.First stop for visitors to Hanoi is usually the Ho Chi MinhMausoleum, a fascinating if somewhat eerie monument housing theembalmed body of the former leader affectionately known as UncleHo.It was Thursday and the mausoleum was closed. We headed instead tothe modernist, Russian-built Ho Chi Minh Museum for a quick tour ofthe former leader's life. The exhibits are interesting but theEnglish language is scarce so a guide is much needed.Next stop was the One Pillar Pagoda where we interruptedpreparations for a ceremony honouring a leading monk who hadrecently died. Later we saw the charming Tran Quoc Pagodaoverlooking West Lake and the White Horse Pagoda where a white-bearded monk talked about travel writer Barbara Cohen.Hanoi's French quarter - walled colonial villas in wide tree-linedboulevards - was seen from the comfort of the car en route to theTemple of Literature, an 11th century centre of learning where MrHieu pointed out the faint etchings on stone tablets that list eachyear's three most outstanding scholars.We were plunged from this scene of erudition into living Hanoi afew minutes later, as we eased ourselves in cyclos and bumped andswerved our way around the Water Tower, past half-hidden pagodasand through the 36 narrow streets that make up the old quarter -Silk Street, Herb Street, Steel Street and Flower Street.Silk Street is the heart of Hanoi's tourist district and, accordingto Mr Hieu, the owners of the yellow and green shophouses areprosperous enough to own a second family home in other areas ofHanoi where space and water are in better supply.Beyond Silk Street, however, and we were passing family rattanfactories and wizened old women with blackened teeth sellingobscure cigarettes for a few cents each.Proprietors here have not fared as well. Life is traditional,fascinating and raw. This part of Hanoi will not live out economicreforms.This tour was arranged by Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City, tel:(844) 826-4154. Similar tours are available on request from mosttourism companies. Scheduled tours can be picked up at the city'sbackpacker cafes.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996A DESTINATION WITH AUTHENTICITYfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078AGAINST a spectacular backdrop of silver-scarred mountains anddescending fog, a group of foreign tourists sit in a wooden hut.They are offered bitter tea by a barefoot hostess clad inembroidered scarlet, huge silver earrings hanging from her earlobes.She belongs to one of the 60-odd ethnic minority groups based inVietnam's central highlands and mountainous north. Closely linkedto the Thai hilltribes, some of these groups have lived in Vietnamfor hundreds of years, others for thousands.Virtually all retain a traditional lifestyle yet to be eased bysuch conveniences as electricity and potable tap water.The foreign tourists, meanwhile, form part of a growing group ofnot-so-young visitors to Vietnam, willing to trek considerabledistances from base camps at places such as Sapa, Hoa Binh or MaiChau and to temporarily forego modern comforts for the chance toget firsthand experience of the ethnic minority lifestyle beforethe area becomes over-trekked.Saigontourist, Ben Thanh Tourist, Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh Cityand other leading tour operators offer trips around central ornorthern Vietnam which include between two and five days of walkingand one or two overnight stays in ethnic villages.While such tours are not a priority on the Vietnam NationalAdministration of Tourism's (VNAT) agenda, they nonetheless fit innicely with the image the NTO is trying to promote - as a richcultural destination."Cultural tourism" is the buzzword in industry circles and althoughdefinitions are understandably soft, it is perceived aseducational, relatively environmentally friendly, and non-intrusivefor the host country.More importantly, it addresses growing concerns shared by otheremerging destinations about the possible loss of Vietnam's culturalidentity in the face of increasing numbers of foreign visitorstouring more diverse destinations.Explained Mr Do Quang Trung, chairman of the VNAT: "We are tryingto preserve our cultural and ecological environment and at the sametime promote tourism, which is a difficult task."I think we need to focus more on introducing our culture toforeign visitors for this."The idea of cultural tourism is not new and Vietnamese touroperators are fired up by the idea of boosting cultural interest.Said Mr Nguyen Van Nhi, general director of Vietnamtourism Ho ChiMinh City: "We need to learn from other countries on how topreserve the unique features of our country."We also need to create a more interesting product for tourists,take them into the rural countryside, fruit gardens and potteryvillages."Or maybe take them into small family homes so they can see what afamily altar is like, rather than just be told."Basically we need to increase the cultural interest of tours inVietnam, not just in obvious ways."Culture influences so much, down to the way we arrange ourbelongings in our houses. We need to create a specificallyVietnamese product that is to do with history and culture."I believe that this is what people really want."Vietnamese, for example, are very interested in American culture,and I am sure it works the other way too."The new emphasis on culture - both popular and refined - is makingits way into tour programmes with Saigontourist now incorporatingfarm visits in its Mekong Delta tours.Conservationists in the former imperial capital of Hue are planningauthentic arts performances in the former Royal Theatre whenrestoration work is finished next year.It is also matched by a national enthusiasm for architecturalconservation that is applauded by most but has caused havoc fordevelopers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.Sadly, few believe such enthusiasm is enough.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HONG KONG: RITZ-CARLTON'S AUTUMN DELIGHTfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078THE Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, is offering an Autumn Delight Package,valid until December 10 and subject to space availability.The package includes Garden View accommodation, buffet breakfastfor two in The Cafe, use of the fitness centre, free dailynewspaper, welcome tea and fruit, 10 per cent discount at the giftshop, and a farewell gift.The rate for single or double occupancy is HK$1,980 (US$257),subject to 10 per cent service charge and five per cent governmenttax.The Ritz-Carlton is located in the heart of Hong Kong Central andclose to the shopping and entertainment districts in Kowloon by wayof the Star Ferry, or the Mass Transit Railway system.It is also right in the centre of the entertainment and shoppingareas on offer on the island.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HONG KONG: CRUISE POTENTIAL HAMPERED BY FACILITIESfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078AMAGINE a Hong Kong-based tour operator offering two- to three-night cruises into southern China, passing through old villages,visiting ethnic communities and historic sights, and seeing the newhouses of rich Chinese who have returned after making money inHawaii.After the cruise, passengers would have the option of a trainconnection across the Thai border and down all the way intoMalaysia.Or, with the generating interest in eco-tourism, take a cruise to astalagmite colony in coral under the waters near Sai Kung and westof Tun Mun.These are potential new cruise opportunities which 26-year tourismindustry veteran, Mr Edmund Tsang, sees as future possibilities forHong Kong's cruise tour industry.Mr Tsang, who joined Watertours of Hong Kong in January this yearas general manager, is deputy chairman of the Travel IndustryCouncil of Hong Kong. While he has an interest in promoting theproducts of his own company, he has a broad perspective on thecruise industry, having served on the boards of a string of traveltrade associations.Watertours of Hong Kong, the largest of the local cruise touroperators, handled about 130,000 passengers last year. Mr Tsangpredicts a modest 15 to 20 per cent increase in the business in thenext few years, but growth, he believes, will be contingent on thegovernment's willingness to improve and increase the number ofberthing facilities."Right now, part of the harbour is a bit discouraging because ofthe choppy waters caused by high-speed water traffic," he said."There is no real concern by the government for those who loveboating."With many people trying to board private and corporate vessels atthe same time, the tour operators are loading at Queen's pier andthe Kowloon public pier."The situation is jammed."The Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) among others, isadvocating that a new international passenger terminal be built,perhaps at the present Kai Tak site.Mr Tsang would like to see this also used as a boarding place forlocal boating.He has recommended to the government that other new boarding areasfor pleasure junks and tour operators be located in different partsof Hong Kong, closer to where people live, such as at Tun Mun orKwun Tong.His interest is not just in the overseas market, but also localresidents, partly because the expanding market of visitors fromChina rely on Hong Kong relatives to guide and accompany them onlocal sight-seeing tours.Boarding points have to be conveniently located, and tours suitablypriced and promoted, for local people to think of taking theirChina relatives on a trip.Mr Tsang wants to see tours such as those to Lei Yue Mun and LammaIsland marketed to Asian visitors not only as a seafood-eatingopportunity, but also as a chance to worship at the old temples inthe area.On Lamma, he sees there are opportunities for Chinese and othervisitors to have a drink in the bars with the establishedexpatriate community, to talk to them and find out why they enjoythe simpler style of life they have chosen in Hong Kong.Mr Tsang notes that the water cruise business has adapted over theyears to accommodate the different interests of tourists as themarket changes and grows more sophisticated."In recent years, Asians have dominated the market. Many,especially young Asians, are western-educated and are interested inthe cultural and historical side of Hong Kong."They are interested in seeing Po Lin Monastery on Lantau."The elderly don't tend to have this interest. They want toconcentrate on shopping."But younger Japanese, Malaysians and Singaporeans in particularwant to do what the European tourists do."They are likely to have afternoon tea at the Peninsula and travelon the same boat as Europeans."Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HONG KONG: THEME PARK IDEA TAKING OFFfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078THE Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) has given a working titleto its plans to host a massive fair at the end of the century onthe runway at Kai Tak airport.  Mr Mason Hung, the senior manager for product development at theHKTA, said there would be so many millennium fairs around the worldthat it had been provisionally decided to call Hong Kong's event anexposition to set it apart from the rest.  Plans for the Hong Kong Exposition are now being put to afeasibility test, but could include a major business and tradeevent.  There could also be a permanent theme park on the huge site,which will become available once the airport is relocated to ChekLap Kok in 1998.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HONG KONG: GOING TO WATER FOR HANDOVERfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078AFTER 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China on June30 next year. Inbound tourist operators are advising clients not tovisit during the week of the handover - unless they have a specialinterest in politics and already have accommodation confirmed.Plans for the official change of sovereignty ceremony on June 30and the celebrations on July 1 are expected to be announced at theend of September. But a mascot for the celebrations has alreadybeen chosen. The Preparatory Committee - the body appointed byChina to prepare for the new Special Administrative Region - hasselected the dolphin as the celebration mascot.The dolphin may seem a strange choice, considering Hong Kong is notusually associated with these animals.However, a rare white (or pink) dolphin (sousa chinensis) is nativeto Hong Kong, it can still be seen in the waters north of LantauIsland, in the same area where the new Chek Lap Kok airport isbeing built.If there is irony in choosing an endangered animal as the handovermascot, the Preparatory Committee seems to have missed it.Seeing Hong Kong's dolphins in the wild is the latest touristattraction being marketed to international visitors by the HongKong Tourist Association (HKTA). Two cruises are available,organised by Hong Kong Dolphinwatch, a small, independent eco-tourism operation.Another new special interest cruise, the New Airport Tour, has beendeveloped by the HKTA for aviation enthusiasts and those interestedin the massive new airport construction.The tour takes passengers into roughly the same waters as Hong KongDolphinwatch, passing under the nearly completed Tsing Ma Bridgeand around to the north side of Lantau.A land section of the tour visits the old Kowloon Walled City site,now a park, where jets can be seen flying low over the tops ofbuildings, then to Lung Cheung Lookout where aircraft are viewedlanding and taking off from the Kai Tak runway.Before boarding the boat, tourists are taken to the Chek Lap KokAirport Core Programme Exhibition Centre.Watertours of Hong Kong is among those operators which willorganise the New Airport Tour on request for special groups.Other new or improved water tours have added to Hong Kong's cruiseoptions.While visitors can still enjoy Pearl of the Orient harbour cruisesby day or night, they can now spend more time exploring the 235islands which surround Hong Kong.Lantau Island is particularly favoured by the tour operators,partly because it is a tranquil green contrast to Hong Kong, butmainly because of the popularity of the Giant Buddha at Po LinMonastery and Tai O fishing village.Both Watertours and HYFCO Travel Agency offer cruises to Lantau,but Watertours has recently extended its Lantau trip to give peoplethe option of an overnight stay on the island.Mr Edmund Tsang, general manager of Watertours, says that in thepast people visiting Lantau and Cheung Chau have asked to spendmore time looking around the island.To meet the demand, he has modified two cruises. The Cheung ChauIsland Hopping Tour now enables passengers to spend 90 minutesvisiting the beach and historic sites on Cheung Chau, as comparedwith just 40 minutes in the past, and gives people the option tohop across to Lantau IslandOn the "Romantic Lantau" trip, tourists can elect to stay a nightat Lantau's Silvermine Bay Hotel or hop across to Cheung ChauIsland.Watertours also offers tailor-made cruises for groups. Theseinclude trips to Lamma Island for hiking and a seafood dinner,treasure hunt expeditions to the old pirate haunt on Cheung Chau,and tours which couple inspections of the new airportinfrastructure with archaeological sites.The cost of the New Airport Tour depends on group size anditinerary. Watertours' Cheung Chau Island trip (without the Lantauadd on) is HK$310 (US$40).The Lantau tour, without an overnight stay is HK$465 for adults,including lunch. With an overnight stay, prices start at HK$850.Visitors who prefer a little adventure and independence canformulate their own itinerary and visit the islands for a fractionof the organised tour prices.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HONG KONG: NEW PARK PLANS CONSIDEREDfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078AN exhibition and observation centre is being planned as a possibleaddition to a new theme park in Hong Kong.Ma Wan island is the site proposed for a theme park presenting thehistory of Hong Kong and a south China fishing village. The islandis likely to be selected as the locale for a "film city" projectintended to be an Asian Universal Studios.Ma Wan island is the location of one end of the Tsing Ma Bridge,the world's longest suspension bridge built as part of the trafficinfrastructure for the new airport.The Hong Kong Tourist Association is embarking on feasibilitystudies and is in discussion with the Hong Kong government aboutthe various plans.An option is to incorporate a site at Wok Tai Wan, providing anobservation point for one of Hong Kong's newest landmarks.Meanwhile, Pearl of the Orient has two new destinations combiningLantau Island and Tsing Ma Bridge. From Victoria Harbour, visitorscan visit the Po Lin Monastery and the Buddha on Lantau Island.The Tsing Ma Bridge is the major sightseeing point during the trip.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HONG KONG: A BACK-FLIP ON ECO-TOURISMfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078IT is an extraordinary sight. On the edge of the dusty, flattenedtract of reclaimed land soon to become Hong Kong's new airportrunway, eight or nine curious dolphins surfaced by our boat.Children and adults alike, poised with binoculars and cameras saidin chorus: "Wah! There they are again!"I saw a six-year-old boy look at his father and exclaim: "It's evenbetter than the fireworks at Chinese New Year".Environmentalist Mr Bill Leverett has been taking Hong Kongresidents on cruises around the north of Lantau island to see thedolphins since March 1995. Only recently, with the help of the HongKong Tourist Association (HKTA), has he begun marketing his toursto international visitors."I wanted to raise awareness of the plight of the pink dolphins,give them an economic value by helping them contribute to thetourist economy, and generate revenue for research and campaigns,"he said.Hong Kong Dolphinwatch is one of the territory's few attempts ateco-tourism. Passengers learn about the dolphin, how they areendangered, and what can be done to help protect the marineenvironment.I was astonished that, while the dolphins are threatened by loss offood, overfishing, pollution and boat traffic, Hong KongDolphinwatch has about a 98 per cent success rate in sighting someof the 80 to 200 dolphins which live in the area,In less than 18 months, Hong Kong Dolphinwatch has taken about3,500 people on dolphin-spotting trips.There are two versions of the tour.The one I took runs on Wednesdays, beginning with a 10.00 pick-upat Queen's Pier, Central, and by the Star Ferry Pier in Tsim ShaTsui.The comfortable pleasure cruise motored across the harbour underthe new Tsing Ma suspension bridge, then meandered slowly throughthe waters near Chek Lap Kok on the lookout for the dolphins.We sighted our first dolphin within a couple of hours of leavingCentral. We saw them in twos and threes at regular intervals, somebone porcelain white, others a pinky colour.After a large hot buffet lunch served on board, the boat wassurrounded by eight or nine dolphins.On Sundays, the trip gives passengers more time near the dolphins,with less time on the boat.The weekend takes passengers from Tsim Sha Tsui by coach to TuenMun, where a larger boat waits. Lunch is served at Tai O, the oldfishing village and tourist attraction on the north shore ofLantau.The tour costs HK$400 (US$52) per adult and HK$200 for children.Mr Leverett contributes 10 per cent of proceeds from his cruises toHong Kong's Friends of the Earth Water Action Group.Hong Kong Dolphinwatch also sells dolphin-related merchandise suchas tee-shirts, postcards and books.Hong Kong Dolphinwatch can be contacted at tel: (852) 2984-1414,fax: 2984-7799 and it can also be E-Mail: at dolphins@hk.super.net.

At present, onlyeight per cent of all visitors to Hong Kong - and 18 per cent ofvisitors from mainland China (now Hong Kong's largest and fastestgrowing visitor market) - take a trip to Lantau. Most of thesevisitors see little more than the Giant Buddha at Po Lin Monasteryand Tai O fishing village.The Hong Kong Tourist Association's (HKTA) major Visitor andTourism Study (Vistour), which outlines the NTO's strategies forthe future of tourism in the Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion, recommends the south-west part of Lantau be officiallyclassified as "Leisure Island".The study recognises the appeal of the island's mountain scenery,attractive coastal areas and its open environment. It also notesthat accessibility to Lantau is about to be radically altered bythe creation of new infrastructure serving the airport on its northside which will link the island by rail and road to Kowloon andHong Kong.Fortunately for Lantau, and the quality of life of Hong Kongresidents who enjoy the island on weekends, the HKTA does notrecommend all out tourist development. It recognises that there isa fine line between giving the greatest number of people access tothe island and retaining the tranquil, green environment which iscentral to the island's appeal.Plans for the island include a cable car link between the townshipof Tung Chung - formerly a small, remote fishing village on thenorth side of the island which has grown in the past couple ofyears into a thriving settlement servicing the airport constructionteams - to Ngong Ping (Lantau Peak). The project, which would be relatively inoffensive to the naturalenvironment, would enable easier access to the Giant Buddha and thesurrounding country park trails.The government says it will not develop the present one-lane roadconnecting Tung Chung with the southern part of the island.The HKTA notes the increased number of people likely to useLantau's country parks and landscape protection areas would need tobe monitored."Any new development would need to be very carefully considered andsited," the Vistour study said.Nonetheless, the HKTA does propose a resort-style hotel near Po LinMonastery, possibly in conjunction with a golf course at TungChung.It is worth discovering Lantau Island, with its ancient forts, oldfishing villages and serene hillsides before the new airport iscompleted (due in the first half of 1998) and whatever changes aredue to take place - well thought out or accidental, good or bad -alter the character of the island and bring it into the 21stcentury.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996HIGH AIRPORT INVESTMENTfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078HONG KONG - Asia/Pacific hubs face radical change as extended-rangetwinjets allow point-to-point flights to overfly traditionaltransfer points, according to a leading regional aviation boss.Mr John Mok, head of strategic planning for the Airport Authorityof Hong Kong, has predicted "the Asia/Pacific region alone willneed up to US$200 billion in airport infrastructure investment by2010 to keep pace with traffic growth".He said high capital costs in Asia/Pacific are a function of highdemand forecasts - 400 million passengers over the next 15 years,more than half the world's total."Asia/Pacific is investing more in the development of its aviationinfrastructure than any other region in the world today," he said."However, it is in Asia/ Pacific where the competition for funds tobuild a broad spectrum of infrastructure...is also the greatest."The potential risk of inadequate funding for airport developmentwill only grow in the future."Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996NAME CHOICE FOR CONRAD HKfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078HONG KONG - The Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong might change its name tothe Conrad Hilton, following the agreement between US-based HiltonHotels, which manages it, and Britain's Ladbroke, which owns HiltonInternational and the rights to the Hilton name outside the US.Ladbroke and Hilton are going to invest in each other as part of aglobal marketing alliance.Mr Dieter Huckestein, president of hotel operations at HiltonHotels and Conrad International, said the decision on the hotel'sname rested with the owners, which included Swire Pacific.

Currentsurcharges in Indonesia range from 25 to 50 per centConcern has been heightened after a ministerial decree increasedrates on international long distance telephone calls from Batam toSingapore.The new Indonesian rate from September 1 increased Batam toSingapore calls to Rp1,300 a minute (US$0.52) from Rp1,000. OutsideBatam, the calling rate to Singapore from any point in Indonesia isRp2,600 per minute. Calls from Singapore to Batam are S$0.50 perminute, and S$1.80 per minute to other points in Indonesia.The new rate and the current surcharges make calls from Indonesianhotels one of the most expensive within the ASEAN region. Althoughthere are discounted hours, the state-owned domestictelecommunications provider, PT Telkom, has changed the period when50 and 75 per cent discounts apply on long distance calls.Telkom offers 50 per cent discount on long distance calls between18.00 and 21.00.Discounted calls of 75 per cent have been moved from 21.00-06.00 to23.00-08.00. Hotel surcharges are 25 per cent to 50 per cent morethan the normal rate for long distance calls.PT Telkom said the decision to change was caused by a strong demandfor long distance calls after 21.00, which has "surpassed thecapacity of Telkom network facilities".Long distance calls from 06.00-09.00 and from 15.00-18.00 aresubject to normal tariffs.In 1994, Casa Grande, a group of Jakarta hoteliers, was able todefer a plan by the ministry of telecommunications to regulatesurcharges on phone calls at a lower rate than that imposed byhotels.Most Jakarta hotels levy a surcharge of 45 to 50 per cent whileother provinces, including Bali, add 25 per to all hotel calls.Jakarta hoteliers said they have not received any complaints fromguests over the surcharges. However, with the increase in telephonerates and with surcharges being arbitrary, hoteliers are concernedthat they may be asked to reduce their surcharges to make doingbusiness in Indonesia more competitive.One hotelier told TTG Asia calls from Singapore have been reducedto a bare minimum "because they feel it will attract the MICEmarket, now that there is a decline in tourist arrivals toSingapore".Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996EXPEDIA FOR LEISURE TRAVELLERSfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078MICROSOFT is launching an Internet-based booking system thisautumn.

Cost levels are increasing,and new forms of charges such as cancellation fees have arisen."Due to the economic undercurrents, airlines, hotels and othertravel service companies will choose to have fewer travel agents,pay less commissions and move towards greater direct sales throughvarious automation options."Technology is increasing the capability for leaving the travelagent - and even the CRS - out of the distribution chain entirely,"Mr Lyle said.For example, the method of selling airline tickets - through a CRSor on-line service - is changing.Airlines such as Lufthansa - which is using CD-ROMs - and Alitalia,British Airways/ USAir, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Swissair andUnited - which use diskettes - are either giving access to a CRSvia an airline server or direct access to the airline's individualreservation system.On the hotel side, Hilton is now distributing CD-ROMs to facilitateInternet booking."Next, you have the recent substantive entrances into marketingthrough World Wide Web sites on the Internet, as well as by manyother travel services."Currently, more than 100 major airlines from 62 countries have Websites. Further, US-based airlines have responded to the economicundercurrents by placing a commission cap on domestic fares," saidMr Lyle."After considerable initial fuss, the concept now seems to havetaken a firm foothold in the US. The first year of the cap isreported to have produced an improvement in the bottom line of USairlines to the tune of about US$400 million, no significant changein market share between airlines imposing the cap and otherairlines, and a significant but not earth-shattering increase inthe number of closings of travel agents."Not surprisingly, therefore, airlines outside the US areconsidering similar action. More than one European airline isreducing overrides and incentive payments.Lufthansa has already announced it will be reducing basic levels ofcommission where electronic ticketing is concerned. SAS haseffectively reduced commission via the SAS Travel Plan, a form ofelectronic season pass, and start-up carrier EasyJet in Europeappears to be taking the ValuJet approach to commissions, that is,avoiding them if possible.Another quirk in the commission structure is that at least oneairline in the US is now offering a bigger commission for bookingoutside a CRS than when using a CRS.While the CRS will stay in a focal role for some time, Mr Lylebelieves there will be a greater use of other travel distributionchannels that are now becoming available along with greaterinteraction amongst these channels."One particular benefit of the evolution of new distributionchannels, notably the Internet, has been to sharpen the competitiveedge of the incumbents and the CRS."Are we seeing the beginning of the end of the travel agent? Mr Lylethinks this seems unlikely."First, travel agents provide a much broader and often much morepersonalised service to passengers than the airlines do directly."They are not tied to an individual supplier and offer expert (andhopefully impartial) advice on different carriers, fares androutings, different hotels and different car hire companies, justto name a few products, and agents can themselves offer benefits.For example, a franchising chain already has a frequent travelleraward programme."Second, sonic travel agency chains have major purchasing power andare able to negotiate private fares with the airlines, passing onat least some of the savings to their clients."They are acting as consolidators as well as agents. Thus, there isno reason why a travel agent cannot make greater use of theInternet to serve these clients."Consequently, while there is likely to be some sort of shake-out,coupled with more intensive consolidation into consortia orfranchising networks, travel agents appear to be here to staybecause of the value-added services they provide."However, the surviving agent will be aggressively automated, in aniche market or part of a chain, and, most importantly, clientdriven," said Mr Lyle.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996NEW LIFE TO EVENT WHICH MAINTAINS ITS INTEGRITYfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078PATA's recent acquisition of VUSAMART, a three-day fair for NorthAmerican inbound traffic from September 9-12, gave new life to theevent's educational dimension but kept its original integrity of a"business marketplace" intact, said show founder and PATA directorfor the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio."When you have an organisation with one mind running it, mine,there's always a limit," Mr Valerio told TTG Asia.PATA broadens the event's educational scope and educates theAmerican market on Asia/Pacific trends before it is too late, hesaid, citing a speech during the PATA marketing conference on thegrowing economies and travel patterns of the Asia/Pacific."Now we have people who can deliver a real message, somethingpeople can chew on," he said.Mr Bill Hastings, PATA director-communications, added: "PATA bringsa global creditability, certainly a high level with Asians andprovides us with more opportunities (with companies) who have beentraditionally outbound operators in the Pacific Asia."The reality is Asians like big cities, but new niche markets ofyounger travellers are emerging, said Mr Valerio.In October, he and PATA president and CEO, Mr Lakshman Ratnapala,are meeting the Mexican minister of tourism to discuss ways todevelop infrastructure and marketing capabilities suited to theAsia/Pacific region.Travel to South America remains limited due in part to a lack ofair lift.Mr Valerio has met industry leaders in Brazil, Argentina and Chileto discuss ways forward.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996MYSTERY OF ABSENT FRIENDSfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078Travel planners from Australia, New Zealand and India were not tobe found in the halls of the Walt Disney World Resort conventionhall at this year's 11th annual VUSAMART.Australia and New Zealand, invited for the first time this year,were not in participation possibly due to short notice.Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the Americas, began talkingwith their national carriers in January to assist him inidentifying qualified companies.India's absence, on the other hand, remains a mystery.In 1994, one Indian company attended, followed by an additionalthree last year.

People tendto travel firstly within a very small radius from their own homeand then to increasingly remoter destinations as theirsophistication and spending capability increases."This means that by the time an Asian traveller hits North America,he or she has probably already had several trips within Asia andtherefore, in relative terms, is quite a sophisticated traveller."On India, a vast country frequently overlooked by its Asianneighbours, Mr Deeson noted: "There are an estimated 300 millionIndians who could be classified as middleclass and thus have theability to travel outside the country as their lifestyles improve.The market potential is therefore enormous."Indian expenditure first goes to appliances, then cars and thirdlytravel, he said, adding that the greatest hindrance to increasedoverseas travel has been a lack of international connections.Mr Deeson was upbeat on "the recommencement of around-the-worldflights by United Airlines, taking in Delhi on a daily basis andthus linking it to Europe and North America via Hong Kong".On the Korean market, one of North America's most important inAsia, Mr Deeson said overseas travel is fashionable and the desireand means for such a leisure activity is spread throughout thecountry.Prospects for growth are good. The 1996 forecast for departuresvaried from 4.2 to 4.5 million and double-digit growth per yearwill be sustained until the year 2000.Travel remains dominated by group tours."Korea is only what one operator termed 'flirting' with FITtravel," he said.Growth from Singapore, which on a per capita basis has the highestnumber of travellers in the world, is expected to reach a plateauby the turn of the century due to its small population. From 1991to 1995, the number of visitors to the US grew marginally from57,000 to 88,000."While the overall market will not grow, there are tremendousopportunities for growing target niche-market segments," noted MrDeeson.Thailand was also highlighted as "one of the more advanceddeveloping countries in Asia" with a population exceeding 60million.Thai traffic to the US doubled from 1991 at 47,000 to 94,000 lastyear.As for Taiwan, similar in some travel habits to Koreans andJapanese, the over-50 crowd took a million trips abroad in 1994 andare greatly influenced by what tour operators are featuring.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996MIXED VIEWS OVER PULL-OUTfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078REACTIONS to the announced pull-out of the Canadian TourismCommission from PATA were mixed at the annual VUSAMART.Mr Randy Ng, manager of Classic Holidays Tour & Travel ofVancouver, said the decision will have a "spiritual effect" on theAsian market."Before (Tourism Canada was a PATA member), people didn't thinkCanada belonged to the Pacific Rim, but with PATA there's a senseof belonging," Mr Ng told TTG Asia."Asians think Canada is cold, in the North Pole. But when withPATA, they think it's part of the Pacific. It's easier to sell."Representatives of two other Canadian-based travel companiesbelieved Tourism Canada paid so little attention to Asian marketsthat the move will have virtually no impact."The influence will not be that crucial as far as the Asia/ Pacificmarket is concerned because most Canadian operators have their ownconnections and do their own sales trips," said Ms Cynthia Lau,deputy general manager of TourLink Holidays, which focuses on theThai, Malaysian and Singaporean markets.She said the national tourist office does not see Thailand andMalaysia as potential markets, only as a surplus, "something like adessert".Mr Raymond Chu, sales manager of Royal Canadian Travel of Ontario,whose major market is Thailand, agreed: "Even though they pulledout of PATA, we still sell to the Orient. We have our ownclientele."Those agents don't care if it's PATA or not PATA. As long as youoffer good service and good price, they give you business."Last month, Tourism Canada announced the NTO was not renewing itsmembership of PATA, citing a lack of sufficient benefits.The organisation has a grace period until July 1, 1997, whenmembership fees are due again.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996THUMBS UP FOR PATA'S FIRST US FAIRfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078ASIA/Pacific travel buyers expressed general approval for PATA'sfirst attempt at running VUSAMART.Mr Warren Ho, director of Ambience Holidays of Singapore, a GSAoperator and wholesaler, said the show was well-organised andprecise.He said: "Not much time is wasted.

While her clients to California haveseen Disney World and Universal Studios in action, Orlando alsooffers Pleasure Island, an attraction she considered to be a hitwith her younger guests.Although she had spoken with several hotels and ground agents, MsLim was not looking for direct hotel contacts as she brought inonly two to three groups to the US per month and had a groundhandler to make all hotel arrangements.She will be back next year to follow the trends.Mr Kim Young-sun, president of The Korea Times Travel of Seoul,said: "First I'm here to meet old friends, to exchange opinions andto promote common interests."Mr Kim was disappointed at not seeing everyone he had hoped wouldattend the Orlando event.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996NEW THEME PARKfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078MANILA - An 11 billion peso (US$440 million) theme park is to bebuilt in Cavite by local developer, Fil-Estate Land, over the nexttwo years.The theme park will have a water park, aquarium, retail centres,museums, hotels and villas.

The idea of exclusiveness andhygiene appeal to consumers' tastes and they are prepared to payfor quality.Mr Ng said: "For eco-adventure tours, you can't be cheap because itaffects the quality and aim of such travel."Mr Chang said a key reason for growth was that clients belonged tothe upmarket category."Even with the economic slowdown we are not affected because ourclients can afford the tours."But he said the danger of eco-adventure tours lay in the abuse ofthe term. He said: "Anyone can organise an 'eco-adventure' tour butthey may not carry out environmentally friendly practices."He cited trekkers to the Himalayas, who used firewood instead ofkerosene, hence contributing to deforestation.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996JAKARTA HOTEL NAME CHANGEfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078JAKARTA - Hotel Equatorial Jakarta has changed its name toMillenium Sirih Jakarta after CDL Hotels Group, owners of MilleniumHotels and Resorts, took an 80 per cent majority ownership fromformer owner Tanah Abang.Agents and operators' contracts and agreements will be honoured,according to the hotel.General manager, Mr Alfred Portenschlager, is no longer affiliatedwith Hotel Equatorial after receiving a notice of termination whenMillenium's management revealed plans to bring over a new teamstarting September 15.A new general manager, Mr Joseph Khong, will be installed,replacing acting general manager, Mr Klaus Doehling.Mr Portenschlager has joined Santika Hotels, an Indonesian company,as general manager and corporate technical assistant director.He will be responsible for the opening of the four-star 320-roomJakarta Santika in the third quarter of 1997.This is the third name change for Hotel Equatorial, which startedout as Grand Metro Equatorial.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996ANA FLAT OUT FOR SUCCESSfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078TOKYO - All Nippon Airways (ANA) is claiming high acclaim fromfirst class passengers with the introduction of a new seat on itsBoeing 747s.The hi-tech seat, developed by ANA in co-ordination with France'sleading aeroplane seat maker Sicma for nine months, is designed torecline 180 degrees at the touch of a button.The aptly named "Full Flat Seat" has been introduced aboard thefirst class cabins of the B747-400 jets, in operation for long-haulservices.

This is a scenario that has played itself all to often inCambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and at times even Thailand.We are often reminded that this can easily happen in New York or inEurope, and cases of Asian visitors slain on trips to North Americaare not unknown.But that knowledge does little to soften the loss.Few foreigners, in Laos, or in other countries in the region havedone more for their adopted country than Mr Vincent.He was fond of saying that Laos was his country, his people, and heworked with a passion that showed his commitment to his adoptedland.After moving to Laos, he was one of only five or six expatriateswho stayed on after the liberation of Vientiane in 1975.Having started a tour company in the early 1970s, he continued tooperate tours for visiting dignitaries heading to Vietnam until aVietnamese Embassy opened in 1977.From 1977 untill 1989 he worked in trading coffee and in thetransportation industry, which opened his eyes to the beauty ofsouthern Laos, where several of Sodetour's lodges are located.After returning to tourism with the Lao National Tourism Company in1989, Mr Vincent started Sodetour in 1992, and the network oflodges soon followed.He was active in forming the Tourism Development Coalition in 1993and was well know in the foreign community as a liaison betweenLaotians and westerners.This sad event should make the industry as a whole pause forthought as operators rush into expanding markets. Concerns overpeople's safety and security should never exceed the need to buyand sell travel.His passing also serves as a reminder of the dangers of tourismexpanding faster than the infrastructure and national developmentin countries around the region.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996LAO AVIATION STRUGGLESfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078VIENTIANE - Lao Aviation's new management team from joint-venturepartner China Yunnan Airlines is struggling to improve service andbring the national carrier into the black one year after takingover the reins.Low load factors and local agents' expressed reluctance to sell theairline leave several unanswered questions.The Vientiane-Chiang Mai route is only running in the 30 per centrange.Nevertheless, Lao Aviation will still lease a second B737-200(delivered on November 1) from the US and apply to fly to HongKong, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.

The question we ask is, to what extent?"Mr Terence Wong, manager of Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services,said travel agents would not worry about hiked rates.He said air fares would not be able to climb too high as therewould be heightened competition as more airlines used the newairport.Another industry source believed that airlines had inherentstructures to provide leeway for such increases."Airlines will have to do cost-altering in other aspects of theiroperations to balance off the increase so that it will not causeair fare hikes which are too high," he said.He believed that Hong Kong's airport would continue to be strategicfor airlines compared to neighbouring airports in China and Macau.Various Asian airlines want to see at least some of the airportauthority's books before agreeing to pay higher charges for ChekLap Kok.Orient Airlines Association, the major regional representativeairline body, warned of the detrimental effects the hiked rateswould have on airlines and travellers.Mr Richard Stirland, director-general of the association, said thenews was "extremely disturbing for airlines and bad news fortravellers".Mr Stirland expected a negative impact on tourism and trade to bethe result.He said it was idle to assume airlines could simply absorb such anincrease without either passing it on to passengers through higherfares or re-examining the economics of all services to Hong Kong.Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996AGENTS CAN WIN GAMES EXCLUSIVEfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078By Laura LeeKUALA LUMPUR - Travel agents are being promised a share of theaction by the company which has been appointed to handle hotelreservations for the Commonwealth Games in 1998.Sukom Accommodation Bureau (SAB) '98, a specialised department setup between organisers Sukom Ninety Eight and the UK-based ByromConsultants to organise lodging for visitors to the games, is notdesigned to take away business from travel agencies.Sukom Ninety Eight executive chairman, Gen (R) Tan Sri Hashim MohdAli, told TTG Asia that SAB '98's role was a complementary one.It would not have a monopoly over room bookings for theCommonwealth Games as organisers want to avoid sky-high prices.An estimated 6,000 rooms, ranging from dormitory-style to five-starsuites, have been selected from 44 hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Selangorand Langkawi.

The more complicated holiday plans will entaildifferent itineraries and flight schedules from various airports,which customers don't have the patience for, even if theinformation may be available to them," he said.For such service, the customer will still turn to the travel agent.Mr Li was commenting on a recent announcement by Dutch airline KLMthat limited ticket booking service for its flights would beavailable via the Internet. Cathay Pacific Airways also said it waskeen to sell tickets on the Net within the next two years.Mr Richard Willis, regional director and general manager of P&OTravel, encouraged travel agents to embrace these technologicaladvancements as they would come fast and slick. "Most travellerscannot handle the complex fare structures and won't really haveaccess to all the comparative airline fares and schedules," hesaid.Going on the Net, he said, would only serve to highlight the travelagent's role as consultant and "custodian of the client"."It would only be a threat if travel agents become complacent andfail to face up to technology," said Mr Willis.Ms Ridy Suen, leisure travel manager for Thomas Cook, said that theInternet could be turned into an advantage for the agent. "On ourpart, we have begun packaging holiday destinations - which includeair fare, accommodations and other services - and made themavailable on our Web site and the response has been very good."But Mr David Ho, managing director of Sime Travel in Singapore,said: "Whether it is KLM or any other airline, the moment itinfiltrates into customer fares, it will affect agents. But thosewho need other services will still go to agents."Mr James Reinnoldt, Northwest regional managing director for South-east Asia and Greater China, said: "In Internet sales, airlinesfind the customers.

They do not expect swift action as thepresent airport was built with 70-80 per cent foreign aid.The travel trade says pollution and lack of planning is leading tothe decline of Nepal's tourism.Lufthansa, the only European carrier flying directly to Kathmandu,has explained why it is almost certain to withdraw from Nepal.Low yields, the end of double digit tourism growth and difficultieswith the location of its international airport, are being cited asmain reasons.Lufthansa flew more than 25,000 passengers last year into Nepal butthe airline's board is expected to decide for a stop in operations.Following Lufthansa's directive to German tour operators that thecarrier will not accept bookings to Nepal after April next year, MrKavin Sethi, corporate communications director Asia/Pacific, flewto the country to inform the trade.Mr Sethi said: "The board is reviewing the viability of the routeas part of an overall exercise to ensure permanent competitivenessfor the Lufthansa product."The unique location of Kathmandu airport in a valley, with a 3,000mrunway instead of the conventional 4,000m, is being cited byLufthansa as a reason for a cut in profits.Most aircraft flying into Kathmandu are twin-engined. To ensuresafety in case of engine failure during take-off, either passengeror fuel load has to be reduced. Except for nearby-based ThaiAirways International, all carriers stop en-route to refuel.Mr Sethi said: "This has led to additional costs as we requirethree sets of crew as against two on a direct haul for the samedistance.Lufthansa started operations in Nepal nine years ago. Since then,its presence in the Himalayan kingdom has grown continuously.To meet the growing travel and export demand in the Nepalesemarket, Lufthansa has three weekly flights via Karachi toFrankfurt."We have been the only western carrier to offer direct services toKathmandu."The others are all east-bound carriers."Copyright 1996 Travel Trade Gazette AsiaBack to Headline List CopyrightTRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA via NewsNetSeptember 26, 1996NO MORE FLIGHTSfrom TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078KATHMANDU - The Royal Nepal Airlines has cancelled its India andParis flights for an indefinite period because of a shortage ofaircraft.For several days, the airline has run press advertisements tellingclients to contact travel agents without spelling out its impendingintentions.The India sector is the most lucrative route for the carrier.

Dr. William Close discovered the value, timeliness and breadth of NewsNet's international newswires in finding exactly this type of information. For many years, Dr. Close has relied on NewsNet to help keep him informed on the current happenings in Zaire, where he lived and worked for 16 years, as well as several other Central African Countries. Dr. Close, who first went to live in Zaire in 1960, has extensive experience with third world countries. He served as the personal physician to the President of Zaire, the chief doctor for the Congolese army, and as manager of a 2,000-bed hospital. When the first Ebola epidemic struck in Zaire in 1976, he ran logistics for the team of international scientists who dealt with the epidemic. Since his return to the U.S. in 1976, Dr. Close has maintained regular contact with his associates in Zaire and helps to facilitate medical relief by acting as an unofficial liaison between the Center for Disease Control and the Zairian government. Dr. Close, has become a regular NewsNet user in order to stay current with news and events taking place in Zaire and other countries, and finds that the international newswire services provide the best coverage for his needs. One topic he monitors regularly on NewsNet is the Ebola virus. Drawing on his experiences living in Africa, Dr. Close wrote a documentary novel this year titled "Ebola," published by Ballantine/Ivy. The book deals with events in the tropical rain forests before the arrival of the scientists. It is the story of people involved in a terrifying intrusion seen through the eyes of a Flemish nun. Dr. Close is an avid NewsFlash user, he finds it to be particularly useful while he's traveling. "With NewsFlash," he said, "I can keep up to date with what's going on all over the world." Too many people today are misinformed about third world countries, according to Dr. Close, and keeping up to date with the help of NewsNet and NewsFlash is one way individuals can combat this problem for themselves. "If you have NewsNet," he related, "you can download tailored information in order to be well informed in the areas relating to your particular interests."

Our portfolios are fully invested and havethe same exposure to these factors as the benchmark. We add valueat the portfolio level through our stock selection process, anddiversify investment risk across the several hundred holdingsin our portfolios. At heart, we are fundamental investors. We believe that stockprices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected futureearnings of companies, their "fundamental value". Sincemarket prices will converge towards fundamental value over time,we believe that any investor who can accurately determine fundamentalvalue, and who applies a disciplined investment process to selectthose stocks that are currently misvalued, will outperform themarket over time. The premise of our investment philosophy is that there is a linkbetween the price of a stock and the underlying financial characteristicsof the company. In other words, the price reflects the market'sassessment of how well the company is positioned to generate futureearnings and/or future cash flow. We identify and purchase thosestocks which are slightly misvalued -- they are cheaper than similarstocks with the same financial characteristics. We are confidentthat the market will recognize the "better value" andmove to correct the mispricing by purchasing the stocks in ourportfolio. Common sense suggests that this relationship betweenprice and fundamentals will persist and our strategy will be successfulinto the future. Our determination of the "average" valuation for a stockis based upon a comparison of similar companies. We know thatin any group of similar companies, there are always some thatare overvalued, some that are undervalued, and some that are fairly-valuedrelative to the average valuation for the group. These moderatevaluation errors are present in every sector of the market andcan be identified through rigorous quantitative analysis of fundamentaldata. In determining whether or not a stock is fairly priced, our systemconsiders each company's current valuation, its future earnings,and investor sentiment toward the stock. We identify an undervaluedstock, hold it in the portfolio until the market recognizes andcorrects for the misvaluation, then sell the stock at a significantpremium to its purchase price. A simplified example of this wouldbe purchasing a stock which is 10 percent cheaper than similarstocks and holding it until the market corrects the relative misvaluationto within 3 percent. Our portfolios are composed of undervaluedstocks from every sector represented in the client's benchmark,with a typical portfolio consisting of several hundred stocks. Rosenberg's decision process is a continuum. Our research functionanalyzes the 15,000 securities in our global universe, both fundamentallyand technically, and determines the risk characteristics of theclient's benchmark. Our portfolio management function optimizesportfolio composition, executes trades, and monitors performanceand trading costs. Factors crucial to the success of our approach include: (1) accurateand timely data on a large universe of companies; (2) subtle quantitativedescriptors of value and predictors of changes in value; (3) insightfuldefinitions of similar businesses. The essence of our approachis rigorous attention to all aspects of the investment process,from stock selection to portfolio construction, to trading. Wetake great care assimilating, checking and structuring the inputdata on which our models rely. We are confident that if the dataare correct, the recommendations made by our system will be sound. Fundamental valuation of stocks is key to our investment process,and the heart of our valuation process lies in the Appraisal Model.Analysis of companies in the United States and Canada is conductedin a single unified model. The model discriminates where the twomarkets are substantially different, while simultaneously comparingcompanies in the two markets according to their degrees of similarity.European companies and Asian companies (other than Japanese) areanalyzed in a nearly global model, which includes the United Statesand Canada as a further basis for comparative valuation but whichexcludes Japan. Japanese companies are analyzed in an independentnational model. An important feature of the appraisal model is the classificationof companies into any of 166 groups of "similar" businesses.We decompose each company into its individual business segments,and compare each segment with similar business operations of othercompanies operating both within national markets and across markets.Subject to the availability of data within national markets, weappraise the company's assets, operating earnings, and sales withineach business segment, accepting the market's valuation of thatcategory of business as fair. We then integrate the segment appraisalsinto three valuation models for the total company: balance sheet,income statement, and sales and simultaneously adjust the segmentappraisals to include appraisals for variables which are declaredonly for the total company, such as taxes, capital structure,and pension funding. The result is a single valuation for eachof the 15,000 companies we follow. The difference between Rosenberg's valuation and the market pricereflects an opportunity for profit. We develop "appraisalalphas"--the expected rate of extraordinary return--by adjustingfor the rate at which the market has corrected for such misvaluationsin the past. A second sphere of analysis is captured by our proprietary EarningsChange Model, which analyzes more than 20 explanatory variablesto predict individual company earnings over a one year horizon.The variables are fundamental and fall into three categories:measures of past profitability, measures of company operationsand consensus earnings forecasts. The earnings change model isindependent of the appraisal model and projects the change ina company's earnings in cents/current price. The value of theprojected earnings change is converted to an "earnings changealpha" by multiplying the projected change by the market'shistorical response to changes of that magnitude. Finally, Rosenberg's Investor Sentiment Model quantifies investorsentiment about features of stocks which influence price but whichare not captured by the appraisal model or the earnings changemodel. We identify high quality companies by looking at past pricepatterns and by predicting the probability of deficient earnings.Our models also capture market enthusiasm towards individual stocksby looking at broker recommendations and analyst estimates. Each company's earnings change alpha and investor sentiment alphais added to its appraisal alpha to arrive at a total company alpha.Stocks with large positive total company alphas are candidatesfor purchase. Stocks held in a portfolio with total company alphasthat are only slightly positive, zero or negative in ranking arecandidates for sale. Before trading, we systematically analyze the short-term pricebehavior of individual stocks to determine the timing of trades.Our model quantifies investor enthusiasm for each stock by analyzingits short-term performance relative to similar stocks as wellas changes in analyst and broker opinions about the stock, andearnings surprises. We develop "trading alphas" - theexpected short-term extraordinary return - which enables us topurchase stocks from supply and to sell stocks into demand, greatlyreducing trading costs. The portfolio optimization system optimizes the trade-off betweenrisk and reward relative to the client's benchmark. It exploitsthe information developed by the stock selection models to maximizeactive return, while eliminating unnecessary active risk. Withineach of the following zones, the optimizer recommends positionsin companies which in aggregate constitute the most efficientportfolio: the United States, Canada, Europe, Pacific Basin, andJapan. The optimizer simultaneously considers fundamental alphas,trading alphas, and risk and quantifies the "net benefit"to the portfolio of each recommended transaction. A stock is consideredfor sale when a higher alpha stock with complementary risk characteristicshas been identified. No transaction will be executed unless theopportunity offered by the purchase candidate sufficiently exceedsthe potential of an existing holding to justify the transactioncosts. In most markets, portfolios are reoptimized continuouslythroughout the day, allowing us to respond immediately to investmentopportunities. Our trading system aggregates the recommended transactions fromthe individual portfolios and determines the feasibility of eachrecommendation in light of the stock's liquidity, the expectedtransaction costs, and general market conditions. It relays targetprice information to our trader for each stock considered forpurchase or sale. All transactions are executed within the pricerange determined by the trading system. As portfolios are reoptimizedthroughout the day, new targets are set which reflect relativechanges in the valuations of our holdings. We continuously monitortrading costs to determine the impact of commissions and pricedisturbance on our portfolios. In the U.S., trades are executed through any one of four tradingstrategies: traditional brokerage, networks, accommodation, andpackage or "basket" trades. The network arrangementswe have developed with Instinet, POSIT, and other institutionalinvestors facilitate large volume trading with little or no pricedisturbance and low commission rates. Accommodative trading (whichwe also refer to as our "match system") allows institutionalbuyers and sellers of stock to electronically present us withtheir "interest" lists each morning. Any matches betweenthe inventory which the brokers have presented and our own recommendedtrades are signaled to our traders. Since the broker is doingagency business and has a client on the other side of the trade,we expect that he will be accommodative in the price. Our objectivein using this match system is to execute most trades on our sideof the bid/ask spread so as to minimize market impact. In Europe, the method of trading depends partially on the marketon which we trade. On the European continent, we typically tradeon the exchange, giving orders to brokers for execution eitheron an electric exchange (France, Germany, Spain), via open cry(Switzerland, the Netherlands), or via auction (Italy). We occasionallydeal directly with market makers who effect trades on the ISEfor United Kingdom stocks and on the SEAQ for European securities. The high fixed commission schedule in Tokyo combines with the30 basis point transfer tax on sales to create a costly tradingenvironment. At the same time, because there are not many marketmakers, opportunities exist to improve market impact through carefultiming of trades. In general, our approach in Japan relies on limit orders: we prefera patient approach to trading, waiting for the other side of themarket to come to our limit. We place limit orders at the openingauction and selectively place limit orders throughout the day.In some cases, we use the expertise of the broker to help us withthe timing and structure of these orders. We also use workingorders when trading urgently, especially when investing an initialcash flow.

We exploit unrealistic forecasts... Most investors emphasize a company's earnings growth prospectswhen making investment decisions. When formulating their earningsgrowth forecasts, these investors focus too much on past earningsgrowth and are unrealistic in expecting current trends to persist.Most investors don't recognize, for example, that more than 90%of the companies in the top decile of earnings growth do not sustainthat growth in subsequent years. Even among companies with justabove-average earnings growth, 80% fail to sustain that growth!These examples show how the powerful forces that drive competitiveeconomies greatly influence the prospects of individual companies. At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, our process is designed to temperindividual stock analysis with rigorous consideration of the broaderforces at work in competitive economies. Evidence from analystearnings forecasts indicates that these competitive forces areunderestimated by most professional analysts, creating errorsand inconsistencies in the way analysts and other investors valuecompanies. Our systems are designed to systematically search outand exploit these inconsistencies. We avoid the shortcutstaken by other... The human mind cannot process the overwhelming amount of informationthat is available on markets, industries and individual companies.Research in behavioral science shows that when people try to makeimportant and timely decisions based on overwhelming amounts ofinformation, they often rely on decision shortcuts. Used incorrectly,these decision shortcuts can lead to incorrect conclusions. Thesedecision shortcuts often lead investors to: Extrapolate recent trends too far into the future. Rely too much on the experience of a particular company withoutproperly considering the experiences of all similar companies. Ignore information that contradicts their existing beliefs. Infer that simultaneous occurrences necessarily have a cause-and-effectrelationship. At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, our expert systems do not takethese decision shortcuts. Our comprehensive approach to valuinga company allows us to consider a change in any of the 200 fundamentalfactors we evaluate in the complete context of all the other factors.We will not fall prey to overweighting the one or two factorsthat grab traditional investors attention at the moment. We build superior models... Research in many fields, including financial analysis, documentsan interesting phenomenon regarding expert decision making. Ifyou can quantify enough of the key variables that an expert looksat in making a decision and do a good job of describing the analyticalsteps the expert takes in forming a judgement, you can build amodel of the expert's decision process that will outperform theexpert. This counter-intuitive finding stems from the fact thathuman experts often apply their judgments inconsistently. Evenif the model misses some details, these are more than offset bythe benefits of consistency. Investors often can't employ exactlythe same standards used in judging a stock today that were usedyesterday. The more details an expert has to consider, the morelikely it is that inconsistencies in judgment will arise. At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, we have put a great deal of effortinto developing innovative and systematic models of a financialexpert's reasoning. By consistently applying these models, ourinvestment process ensures the discipline necessary to make superiordecisions.WT03-B14-41IA091-000971-B007-253http://riem.com:80/http_r/fc/small.html 192.216.236.3 19970117211948 text/html 1839HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/html U.S. Small Capitalization Fund Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management who we are | mutualfunds | education | news| contact us | home U.S. Small Capitalization Fund Philosophy and Strategy Fund Management Benefits and Features Prospectus Each Fund's prospectus contains more complete information, includingcharges and expenses, and should be read carefully before investingor sending money.

Absent such agreement by the Manager to waive its fee and bear such expenses, management fees would be 0.90% for the U.S. Small Cap Series and Total Fund Operating Expenses for the U.S. Small Cap Series would be 1.25% for Institutional Shares, 1.50% for Adviser Shares and 1.75% for Select Shares and management fees would be 1.00% for the Japan Series and Total Fund Operating Expenses for the Japan Series would be 7.26% for Institutional Shares, 7.51% for Adviser Shares and 7.76% for Select Shares. Absent such agreement by the Manager to waive its fee and bear such expenses, management fees would be 1.00% for the International Small Cap Series. Assuming average daily net assets of the International Small Cap Series for the first year of operations are $10,000,000, it is estimated that Total Fund Operating Expenses for the International Small Cap Series for such fiscal year will be 3.73% for Institutional Shares, 3.98% for Adviser Shares and 4.23% for Select Shares. See "Management of the Trust." (b) For the U.S. Small Cap Series, Other Expenses are based on actual results for Institutional Shares for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996. Actual Other Expenses for the Institutional Shares of the Japan Series for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1996 were 6.26% and the percentages listed for the Japan Series under Other Expenses above reflect expenses borne by the Manager during such fiscal year. Assuming average daily net assets of the International Small Cap Series for the first year of operations are $10,000,000, it is estimated that actual Other Expenses for the International Small Cap Series for such fiscal year will be 2.73% and the percentages listed under Other Expenses above reflect estimated expenses that would be borne by the Manager for such fiscal year.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES U.S. Small Capitalization Series The investment objective of the U.S. Small CapitalizationSeries is to seek total return greater than that of the Russell2000 Index through investment primarily in equity securities ofsmaller companies which are traded principally in the marketsof the United States. Total return is a combination of capitalappreciation and current income (dividend or interest). In thecase of the Fund, total return will be measured by changes invalue of an investment over a given period, assuming that anydividends or capital gains distributions are reinvested in theFund rather than paid to the investor in cash. The Fund does notseek to maximize total return but, as indicated above,seeks a total return greater than that of the common stocks referredto above. Because the companies in which the Fund invests typicallydo not distribute significant amounts of company earnings to shareholders,the Fund's objective will place relatively greater emphasis oncapital appreciation than on current income. The Fund's investmentobjective is nonfundamental and thus may be changed by theTrustees without shareholder approval. It is currently expected that, under normal circumstances,most of the Fund's assets will be invested in common stocks ofcompanies with total market capitalization of less than $750 million("small capitalization securities"). This correspondswith the defining range of market capitalization of companiesin the Russell 2000 Index. Investments in issuers of small capitalizationsecurities may present greater opportunities for capital appreciationbecause of high potential earnings growth, but may also involvegreater risk. See "General Description of Risks and FundInvestments - Companies with Small Market Capitalizations"below. To meet redemptions or pending investments in commonstocks, the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assetsnot invested in small capitalization securities in full faithand credit obligations of the United States government (e.g.,U.S. Treasury Bills) and in shortterm notes, commercialpaper or other money market instruments of high quality (i.e.,rated at least "A2" or "AA" by Standard &Poor's ("S&P") or Prime 2 or "Aa" by Moody'sInvestors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")) issued bycompanies having an outstanding debt issue rated at least "AA"by S&P or at least "Aa" by Moody's, or determinedby the Manager to be of comparable quality to any of the foregoing.See also "General Description of Risks and Fund Investments -Stock Index Futures" below. Also, the Fund may invest without limit in commonstocks of foreign issuers which are listed on a United Statessecurities exchange or traded in the United States in the OTCmarket. Investments in common stocks of foreign issuers may involvecertain special risks due to foreign economic, political and legaldevelopments. See "General Description of Risks and FundInvestments - Special Consideration of Foreign Investments"below. The Fund will not invest in securities which are principallytraded outside of the United States. Fundamental Policies.The Fund will normally invest most of its assets in small capitalizationsecurities, and it is a fundamental policy of the Fund, whichmay not be changed without shareholder approval, that at least65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in small capitalizationsecurities. International Small Capitalization Series The investment objective of the International SmallCapitalization Series is to seek total return greater thanthe Cazenove Rosenberg Global Smaller Companies Index excludingthe United States ("CRIEXUS") through investment primarilyin equity securities (i) that are traded principally in securitiesmarkets outside of the United States and (ii) that representinterests in companies currently with market capitalizations ofbetween $15 million and $1 billion at the time of purchase bythe Fund. Such companies are referred to herein as "smallcapitalization companies." CRIEXUS is comprised of stocksof small capitalization companies in mature markets. Total returnis a combination of capital appreciation and current income (dividendor interest). In the case of the Fund, total return will be measuredby changes in value of an investment over a given period, assumingthat any dividends or capital gains distributions are reinvestedin the Fund rather than paid to the investor in cash. The Funddoes not seek to maximize total return but, as indicatedabove, seeks a total return greater than that of the common stocksreferred to above. Because the companies in which the Fund investstypically do not distribute significant amounts of company earningsto shareholders, the Fund's objective will place relatively greateremphasis on capital appreciation than on current income. The Fund'sinvestment objective is nonfundamental and thus may be changedby the Trustees without shareholder approval. There are no prescribed limits on geographic assetdistribution and the Fund has the authority to invest in securitiestraded in securities markets of any country in the world. It iscurrently expected that the Fund will invest in approximatelytwenty different countries across three regions - Europe,Pacific and North America (excluding the United States). Undercertain adverse investment conditions, the Fund may restrict thenumber of securities markets in which its assets will be invested,although under normal market circumstances, the Fund's investmentswill involve securities principally traded in at least three differentcountries. See "General Description of Risks and Fund Investments -Special Considerations of Foreign Investments" and "GeneralDescription of Risks and Fund Investments - Foreign ExchangeTransactions" below. Under normal circumstances, at least 90% of the Fund'stotal assets will be invested in common stocks of small capitalizationcompanies. It is the nonfundamental policy of the Fund toinvest at least 65% of the Fund's total assets in common stocksof small capitalization companies. Investments in such companiesmay present greater opportunities for capital appreciation becauseof high potential earnings growth, but may also involve greaterrisk. See "General Description of Risks and Fund Investments -Companies with Small Market Capitalizations" below. The Fund will not normally invest in securities ofUnited States issuers traded on United States securities markets. Japan Series The investment objective of the Japan Series isto seek total return greater than that of the Tokyo Stock PriceIndex ("TOPIX") of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. TOPIX isa capitalization weighted index of all stocks in the First Sectionof the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Total return is a combination ofcapital appreciation and current income (dividend or interest).The Fund will seek to meet this objective primarily through investmentin Japanese equity securities, primarily in common stocks of Japanesecompanies. The Fund expects that any income it derives will befrom dividend or interest payments on securities. The Fund's investmentobjective is nonfundamental and thus may be changed by theTrustees without shareholder approval. It is currently expected that, under normal circumstances,the Fund will invest at least 90% of its assets in "JapaneseSecurities," that is, securities issued by entities ("JapaneseCompanies") that are organized under the laws of Japan andthat either have 50% or more of their assets in Japan or derive50% or more of their revenues from Japan. While the Fund willinvest primarily in common stocks of Japanese Companies, it mayalso invest in other Japanese Securities, such as convertiblepreferred stock, warrants or rights, as well as shorttermgovernment debt securities or other short term prime obligations(i.e., high quality debt obligations maturing not more than oneyear from the date of issuance). See "General Descriptionof Risks and Fund Investments - Foreign Exchange Transactions"below. The Fund will not customarily purchase warrants or rights,although it may receive warrants or rights through distributionson other securities it owns. In those cases, the Fund expectsto sell such warrants and rights within a reasonable period oftime following their distribution to the Fund. The Fund does notcurrently expect to own warrants or rights with an aggregate valueof greater than 5% of the Fund's assets. Refer to the Statementof Additional Information for further information with respectto the Fund's investments in warrants or rights. The Fund currently intends to make its investmentsin Japanese equity securities, principally in wellestablishedJapanese Companies that have an active market for their shares.Japanese Companies will be considered wellestablished ifthey have been subject for at least two years to the financialaccounting rules for a company whose securities are tradedon a Japanese securities exchange. In the discretion of the Fund'smanagement, the balance of the Fund's investments may be in companiesthat do not meet all such qualifications, although the natureof the market for the shares will always be an important considerationin determining whether the Fund will invest in such shares. TheFund anticipates that most Japanese equity securities in whichit will invest, either directly or indirectly (by means of convertibledebentures), will be listed on securities exchanges in Japan. Index Futures. The Fundmay also purchase futures contracts or options on futures contractson the Tokyo Stock Price Index ("TOPIX") or the NIKKEI225 Index ("NIKKEI") for investment purposes. TOPIXfutures are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade and NIKKEI futuresare traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. See "GeneralDescription of Risks and Fund Investments -Stock Index Futures"below. Risks of Investing in Japanese Securities.Unlike other mutual funds which invest in the securities of manycountries, the Fund will invest almost exclusively in JapaneseSecurities. Generally, the Manager will not vary the percentageof the Fund's assets which are invested in Japanese Securitiesbased on its assessment of Japanese economic, political or regulatorydevelopments or changes in currency exchange rates. However, theManager reserves the right to hedge against a possible declinein the Japanese Securities market by utilizing futures and optionson futures on Japanese stock indices as described above with respectto 100% of the Fund's total assets. Because a high percentage of the Fund asset's willbe invested in Japanese Securities, investment in the Fund willinvolve the general risks associated with investing in foreignsecurities. See "General Description of Risks and Fund Investments -SpecialConsiderations of Foreign Investments" below. In addition,investors will be subject to the market risk associated with investingalmost exclusively in stocks of companies which are subject toJapanese economic factors and conditions. Since the Japanese economyis dependent to a significant extent on foreign trade, the relationshipsbetween Japan and its trading partners and between the yen andother currencies are expected to have a significant impact onparticular Japanese companies and on the Japanese economy generally.The Fund is designed for investors who are willing to accept therisks associated with changes in such conditions and relationships. Fundamental Policies.The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assetsin Japanese Securities, and it is a fundamental policy of theFund, which may not be changed without shareholder approval, thatat least 65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in JapaneseSecurities. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF RISKS AND FUNDINVESTMENTS Investment Risks. An investmentin the Funds involves risks similar to those of investing in commonstocks directly. Just as with common stocks, the value of Fundshares may increase or decrease depending on market, economic,political, regulatory and other conditions affecting a Fund'sportfolio. These types of risks may be greater with respect toinvestments in securities of foreign issuers. Investment in sharesof the Funds is, like investment in common stocks, more volatileand risky than some other forms of investment. Companies with Small Market Capitalizations.As specified above, the U.S. Small Capitalization Series andthe International Small Capitalization Series will investa relatively high percentage of their assets in companies withrelatively small market capitalizations (generally, market capitalizationsof under $750 million for the U.S. Small Capitalization Series andunder $1 billion for the International Small Capitalization Series).Companies with small market capitalizations may be dependent upona single proprietary product or market niche, may have limitedproduct lines, markets or financial resources, or may depend ona limited management group. Typically, such companies have fewersecurities outstanding, which may be less liquid than securitiesof larger companies. Their common stock and other securities maytrade less frequently and in limited volume and are generallymore sensitive to purchase and sale transactions. Therefore, theprices of such securities tend to be more volatile than the pricesof securities of companies with larger market capitalizations.As a result, the absolute values of changes in the price of securitiesof companies with small market capitalizations may be greaterthan those of larger, more established companies. Special Considerations of Foreign Investments.Investing in foreign securities (i.e., those which are tradedprincipally in markets outside of the United States) involvescertain risks not typically found in investing in U.S. domesticsecurities. These include risks of adverse change in foreign economic,political, regulatory and other conditions, and changes in currencyexchange rates, exchange control regulations (including currencyblockage), expropriation of assets or nationalization, impositionof withholding taxes on dividend or interest payments, and possibledifficulty in obtaining and enforcing judgments against foreignentities. Furthermore, issuers of foreign securities are subjectto different, and often less comprehensive, accounting, reportingand disclosure requirements than domestic issuers. In certaincountries, legal remedies available to investors may be more limitedthan those available with respect to investments in the UnitedStates or other countries. The laws of some foreign countriesmay limit a Fund's ability to invest in securities of certainissuers located in those countries. The securities of some foreignissuers and securities traded principally in foreign securitiesmarkets are less liquid and at times more volatile than securitiesof comparable U.S. issuers and securities traded principally inU.S. securities markets. Foreign brokerage commissions and otherfees are also generally higher than those charged in the UnitedStates. There are also special tax considerations which applyto securities of foreign issuers and securities traded principallyin foreign securities markets. The risks of investing in foreign securities maybe intensified in the case of investments in emerging marketsor countries with limited or developing capital markets. Pricesof securities of companies in emerging markets can be significantlymore volatile than prices of securities of companies in the moredeveloped nations of the world, reflecting the greater uncertaintiesof investing in less developed markets and economies. In particular,countries with emerging markets may have relatively unstable governments,present the risk of nationalization of businesses, restrictionson foreign ownership, or prohibitions of repatriation of assets,and may have less protection of property rights than more developedcountries. The economies of countries with emerging markets maybe predominantly based on only a few industries or dependent onrevenues from particular commodities or on international aid ordevelopment assistance, may be highly vulnerable to changes inlocal or global trade conditions, and may suffer from extremeand volatile debt burdens or inflation rates. Local securitiesmarkets may trade a small number of securities and may be unableto respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentiallymaking prompt liquidation of substantial holdings difficult orimpossible at times. Consequently, securities of issuers locatedin countries with emerging markets may have limited marketabilityand may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.Also, such local markets typically offer less regulatory protectionsfor investors. Foreign Exchange Transactions.The International Equity Portfolios of the Trust (i.e., the InternationalSmall Capitalization Series and the Japan Series) do notcurrently intend to hedge the foreign currency risk associatedwith investments in securities denominated in foreign currencies.However, in order to hedge against possible variations in foreignexchange rates pending the settlement of securities transactions,the International Equity Portfolios reserve the right to buy orsell foreign currencies or to deal in forward foreign currencycontracts; that is, to agree to buy or sell a specified currencyat a specified price and future date. The International EquityPortfolios also reserve the right to invest in currency futurescontracts and related options thereon for similar purposes. Forexample, if the Manager anticipates that the value of the yenwill rise relative to the dollar, a Fund could purchase a currencyfutures contract or a call option thereon or sell (write) a putoption to protect against an increase in the price of yendenominatedsecurities such Fund intends to purchase. If the Manager anticipatesa fall in the value of the yen relative to the dollar, a Fundcould sell a currency futures contract or a call option thereonor purchase a put option on such futures contract as a hedge.If the International Equity Portfolios change their present intentionand decide to utilize hedging strategies, futures contracts andrelated options will be used only as a hedge against anticipatedcurrency rate changes (not for investment purposes) and all optionson currency futures written by a Fund will be covered. These practices,if utilized, may present risks different from or in addition tothe risks associated with investments in foreign currencies. Stock Index Futures. Astock index futures contract (an "Index Future") isa contract to buy an integral number of units of the relevantindex at a specified future date at a price agreed upon when thecontract is made. A unit is the value at a given time of the relevantindex. In connection with a Fund's investment in commonstocks, a Fund may invest in Index Futures while the Manager seeksfavorable terms from brokers to effect transactions in commonstocks selected for purchase. A Fund may also invest in IndexFutures when the Manager believes that there are not enough attractivecommon stocks available to maintain the standards of diversityand liquidity set for the Fund pending investment in such stockswhen they do become available. Through the use of Index Futures,a Fund may maintain a portfolio with diversified risk withoutincurring the substantial brokerage costs which may be associatedwith investment in multiple issuers. This may permit a Fund toavoid potential market and liquidity problems (e.g., driving upor forcing down the price by quickly purchasing or selling sharesof a portfolio security) which may result from increases or decreasesin positions already held by a Fund. Certain provisions of theInternal Revenue Code may limit this use of Index Futures. A Fundmay also invest in Index Futures in order to hedge its equitypositions. In contrast to purchases of a common stock, no priceis paid or received by a Fund upon the purchase of a futures contract.Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be requiredto deposit with its custodian in a segregated account in the nameof the futures broker a specified amount of cash or securities.This is known by participants in the market as "initial margin."The type of instruments that may be deposited as initial margin,and the required amount of initial margin, are determined by thefutures exchange on which the Index Futures are traded. The natureof initial margin in futures transactions is different from thatof margin in securities transactions in that futures contractmargin does not involve the borrowing of funds by the customerto finance the transactions. Rather, the initial margin is inthe nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on thecontract which is returned to the Fund upon termination of thefutures contract, assuming all contractual obligations have beensatisfied. Subsequent payments, called "variation margin,"to and from the broker, will be made on a daily basis as the priceof the particular Index fluctuates, making the position in thefutures contract more or less valuable, a process known as "markingto the market." A Fund may close out a futures contract purchaseby entering into a futures contract sale. This will operate toterminate the Fund's position in the futures contract. Final determinationsof variation margin are then made, additional cash is requiredto be paid by or released to the Fund, and the Fund realizes aloss or a gain. A Fund's investment in Index Futures involves risk.Positions in Index Futures may be closed out by a Fund only onthe futures exchanges on which the Index Futures are then traded.There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist forany particular contract at any particular time. The liquidityof the market in futures contracts could be adversely affectedby "daily price fluctuation limits" established by therelevant futures exchange which limit the amount of fluctuationin the price of an Index Futures contract during a single tradingday. Once the daily limit has been reached in the contract, notrades may be entered into at a price beyond the limit. In suchevents, it may not be possible for a Fund to close its futurescontract purchase, and, in the event of adverse price movements,a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash paymentsof variation margin. When the Fund has purchased a futures contract,its risk is, however, limited to the amount of the contract. Thefutures market may also attract more speculators than does thesecurities market, because deposit requirements in the futuresmarket are less onerous than margin requirements in the securitiesmarket. Increased participation by speculators in the futuresmarket may also cause price distortions. A Fund will not purchase Index Futures if, as a result,the Fund's initial margin deposits on transactions that do notconstitute "bona fide hedging" under relevant regulationsof the Commodities Futures Trading Commission would be greaterthan 5% of the Fund's total assets. In addition to margin deposits,when a Fund purchases an Index Future, it is required to maintain,at all times while an Index Future is held by the Fund, cash,U.S. Government securities or other high grade liquid debt obligationsin a segregated account with its Custodian, in an amount which,together with the initial margin deposit on the futures contract,is equal to the current value of the futures contract.

EachFund may purchase "illiquid securities," defined assecurities which cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinarycourse of business within seven days at approximately the valueat which a Fund has valued such securities, so long as no morethan 15% of the Fund's net assets would be invested in such illiquidsecurities after giving effect to the purchase. Investment inilliquid securities involves the risk that, because of the lackof consistent market demand for such securities, the Fund maybe forced to sell them at a discount from the last offer price. Portfolio Turnover. Portfolioturnover is not a limiting factor with respect to investment decisions.Although the rate of portfolio turnover is very difficult to predict,it is not anticipated that, under normal circumstances, the annualportfolio turnover rate for each of the Funds will exceed 100%.In any particular year, market conditions may well result in greaterportfolio turnover rates than are presently anticipated. The rateof a Fund's portfolio turnover may vary significantly from timeto time depending on the volatility of economic and market conditions.High portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater brokeragecommissions and other transaction costs, which will be borne directlyby a Fund, and could involve realization of capital gains thatwould be taxable when distributed to shareholders of such Fund.To the extent portfolio turnover results in the realization ofnet shortterm capital gains, such gains ordinarily are taxedto shareholders at ordinary income tax rates. Loans of Portfolio Securities.Each Fund may lend some or all of its portfolio securities tobrokerdealers. Securities loans are made to brokerdealerspursuant to agreements requiring that loans be continuously securedby collateral in cash or U.S. Government securities at least equalat all times to the market value of the securities lent. The borrowerpays to the lending Fund an amount equal to any dividends or interestreceived on the securities lent. When the collateral is cash,the Fund may invest the cash collateral in interestbearing,shortterm securities. When the collateral is U.S. Governmentsecurities, the Fund usually receives a fee from the borrower.Although voting rights or rights to consent with respect to theloaned securities pass to the borrower, a Fund retains the rightto call the loans at any time on reasonable notice, and it willdo so in order that the securities may be voted by the Fund ifthe holders of such securities are asked to vote upon or consentto matters materially affecting the investment. A Fund may alsocall such loans in order to sell the securities involved. Therisks in lending portfolio securities, as with other extensionsof credit, include possible delay in recovery of the securitiesor possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrowerfail financially. However, such loans will be made only to brokerdealersthat are believed by the Manager to be of relatively high creditstanding. Investment Policies. Exceptfor investment policies which are explicitly described as fundamental,the investment policies of each of the Funds may be changed withoutshareholder approval. In addition to the policies described inthis Prospectus, please see the Statement of Additional Informationfor a statement of fundamental and nonfundamental policiesof the Funds. INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE Manager's Discussion of U.S. Small CapitalizationSeries Performance For the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996, thetotal return of the U.S. Small Capitalization Series was35.69% after deduction of fees and expenses, more than 6 ½percentage points above the total return of the Russell 2000 Index.The Manager believes that the U.S. Small Capitalization Series'total return was the result of an overall rise in the market combinedwith the Manager's identification of undervalued U.S. small companystocks. In the last fiscal year, the prices of the undervaluedU.S. small company stocks selected by the Manager generally rosetowards the Manager's estimates of their fair value. The U.S. Small Capitalization Series has builta diversified portfolio that closely tracks the risk factor andindustry profile of the Russell 2000 Index while emphasizing companiesthat are selling at prices below the Manager's estimates of theirfair value. The total return of the U.S. Small CapitalizationSeries has exceeded the total return of the Russell 2000Index since inception of the Fund as well as in the latest 3and 5 year fiscal periods of the Fund. U.S. Small Capitalization Series (Based on the Performance of InstitutionalShares only) (1) Based on minimum initial investment of $1,000,000 for Institutional Shares less applicable Fund Reimbursement Fees. Note that the minimum initial investment for Adviser Shares is $100,000 and for Select Shares is $10,000. (2) Fund returns are net of all fees while the Russell 2000 Index returns are based solely on market returns without deduction of fees or transaction costs for rebalancing. Average Annual Total Return (for periodsended 3/31/96) 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years Since Inception (2/22/89) U.S. Small Capitalization Series (Institutional Shares) 35.69% 19.45% 19.31% 15.14% Russell 2000 Index 29.10% 14.77% 16.05% 13.31% The numbers reported in both the graph and thetable represent past performance and are not predictive of futureperformance. Manager's Discussion of Japan Series Performance During the last fiscal year, the total return ofthe Japan Series after deduction of fees and expenses was lessthan the total return of its Tokyo Stock Price Index ("TOPIX")benchmark; however, the Series has outperformed the TOPIX benchmarkover the latest 3 and 5year periods. Since inceptionin January 1989, the Japan Series has outperformed the TOPIX byan average of 1.66% per year while matching the risk factor, industry,and capitalization characteristics of the benchmark. The JapanSeries maintains a diversified portfolio of moderately undervaluedsecurities identified by the Manager's proprietary stock selectionmodels. Under normal circumstances, the Japan Series' investmentsin securities will be in yendenominated securities, thusits value in U.S. dollars depends on prevailing exchange rates.During the last fiscal year, the Yen depreciated by more than20%, offsetting the overall rise in the Japanese equity market.Since the inception of the Japan Series, the yen has appreciatedalmost 15%. Japan Series (Based on the Performance of InstitutionalShares only) (1) Based on minimum initial investment of $1,000,000 for Institutional Shares less applicable Fund Reimbursement Fees. Note that the minimum initial investment for Adviser Shares is $100,000 and for Select Shares is $10,000.

The Manager's General Investment Philosophy andStrategy The Manager attempts to add value relative to thedesignated benchmark through a quantitative stock selection process,and seeks to diversify investment risk across the several hundredholdings in each Fund. In seeking to outperform each Fund's designatedbenchmark, the Manager also attempts to control risk in the Fund'sportfolio relative to the securities constituting that benchmark.So that each Fund is substantially invested in equities at alltimes, the Manager does not earn the extraordinary return, or"alpha," by timing the market. The Manager seeks toavoid constructing portfolios that significantly differ from therelevant benchmark with respect to characteristics such as marketcapitalization, historic volatility, or "beta," andindustry weightings. Each Fund seeks to have a similar exposureto these factors as the designated benchmark. Investment Philosophy.The Manager's investment strategy is based on the belief thatstock prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expectedfuture earnings of companies, their "fundamental value."The Manager believes that market prices will converge towardsfundamental value over time, and that therefore, any investorwho can accurately determine fundamental value, and who appliesa disciplined investment process to select those stocks that arecurrently undervalued (i.e., the price is less than fundamentalvalue), will outperform the market over time. The premise of the Manager's investment philosophyis that there is a link between the price of a stock and the underlyingfinancial and operational characteristics of the company. In otherwords, the price reflects the market's assessment of how wellthe company is positioned to generate future earnings and/or futurecash flow. The Manager identifies and purchases those stocks whichare undervalued (i.e., they are currently cheaper than similarstocks with the same characteristics). The Manager believes thatthe market will recognize the "better value" and thatthe mispricing will be corrected as the stocks in the Funds' portfoliosare purchased by other investors. Determination of the relative valuation of a stockis based upon a comparison of similar companies. In any groupof similar companies, it is the Manager's view that there arealways some that are overvalued, some that are undervalued, andsome that are fairlyvalued relative to the average valuationfor the group. These moderate valuation errors are believed tobe present in every sector of the market and can be identifiedthrough rigorous quantitative analysis of fundamental data. In determining whether or not a stock is attractive,the Manager considers the company's current estimated fundamentalvalue as determined by the Manager's proprietary Appraisal Model,the company's future earnings, and investor sentiment toward thestock. The Manager identifies and causes a Fund to purchase anundervalued stock and to hold it in the relevant Fund's portfoliountil the market recognizes and corrects for the misvaluation.The Funds' portfolios are composed of undervalued stocks fromevery sector represented in the relevant Fund's benchmark, witha typical portfolio consisting of several hundred stocks. Decision Process. TheManager's decision process is a continuum. Its research functiondevelops Models which analyze the 12,000 securities in the globaluniverse, both fundamentally and technically, and determines therisk characteristics of the relevant Fund's benchmark. The portfoliomanagement function optimizes each portfolio's composition, executestrades, and monitors performance and trading costs. The essence of the Manager's approach is rigorousattention to important aspects of the investment process. Factorscrucial to successful stock selection include: (1) accurateand timely data on a large universe of companies; (2) subtlequantitative descriptors of value and predictors of changes invalue; and (3) insightful definitions of similar businesses.The Manager takes great care assimilating, checking and structuringthe input data on which its Models rely. The Manager believesthat if the data is correct, the recommendations made by the systemwill be sound. Stock Selection. Fundamentalvaluation of stocks is key to the Manager's investment process,and the heart of the valuation process lies in the Manager's proprietaryAppraisal Model. Analysis of companies in the United States andCanada is conducted in a single unified Model. The Appraisal Modeldiscriminates where the two markets are substantially different,while simultaneously comparing companies in the two markets accordingto their degrees of similarity. European companies and Asian companies(other than Japanese companies) are analyzed in a nearly globalModel, which includes the United States and Canada as a furtherbasis for comparative valuation, but which excludes Japan. Japanesecompanies are analyzed in an independent national Model. The Modelincorporates the various accounting standards which apply in differentmarkets and makes adjustments to ensure meaningful comparisons. An important feature of the Appraisal Model is theclassification of companies into one or more of 166 groups of"similar" businesses. Currently, in the United States,160 groups are applicable; in Japan, 122 groups are applicable;and in Europe, 154 groups are applicable. Each company is brokendown into its individual business segments, and each segment iscompared with similar business operations of other companies doingbusiness in the same geographical market. In most cases, the comparisonis extended to include companies with similar business operationsin different markets. Subject to the availability of data in differentmarkets, the Manager appraises the company's assets, operatingearnings and sales within each business segment, accepting themarket's valuation of that category of business as fair. The Managerthen integrates the segment appraisals into balance sheet, incomestatement, and sales valuation models for the total company, andsimultaneously adjusts the segment appraisals to include appraisalsfor variables which are declared only for the total company, suchas taxes, capital structure, and pension funding. The result isa single valuation for each of the 12,000 companies followed. The difference between the Manager's appraisal andthe market price is believed to represent an opportunity for profit.For each stock, the Manager develops "appraisal alphas"(i.e., the expected rate of extraordinary return) by adjustingfor the rate at which the market has corrected for such misvaluationsin the past. A second sphere of analysis is captured by the Manager'sproprietary Earnings Change Model, which analyzes more than 20variables to predict individual company earnings over a one yearhorizon. The variables are fundamental and fall into three categories:measures of past profitability, measures of company operationsand consensus earnings forecasts. The Earnings Change Model isindependent of the Appraisal Model and projects the change ina company's earnings in cents/current price. The value of theprojected earnings change is converted to an "earnings changealpha" by multiplying the projected change by the market'shistorical response to changes of that magnitude. Finally, the Manager's proprietary Investor SentimentModel quantifies investor sentiment about features of stocks whichinfluence price but which are not captured by the Appraisal Modelor the Earnings Change Model. This Model measures company qualityby looking at past price patterns and by predicting the probabilityof deficient earnings. The Investor Sentiment Model also capturesmarket enthusiasm towards individual stocks by looking at brokerrecommendations and analyst estimates. Investor sentiment alphasare developed by multiplying the Model's sentiment scores by themarket's historical response to such scores. Each company's earnings change alpha and investorsentiment alpha is added to its appraisal alpha to arrive at atotal company alpha. Stocks with large positive total companyalphas are candidates for purchase. Stocks held in a portfoliowith total company alphas that are only slightly positive, zeroor negative are candidates for sale. Before trading, the Manager systematically analyzesthe shortterm price behavior of individual stocks to determinethe timing of trades. The Investor Sentiment Model quantifiesinvestor enthusiasm for each stock by analyzing its shorttermperformance relative to similar stocks, changes in analyst andbroker opinions about the stock, and earnings surprises. The Managerdevelops a "trading alpha" for each stock (i.e., theexpected shortterm extraordinary return) which is designedto enable the Funds to purchase stocks from supply and to sellstocks into demand, greatly reducing trading costs. Optimization. The Manager'sportfolio optimization system seeks to optimize the tradeoffbetween risk and reward relative to each Fund's benchmark. Itexploits the information developed by the Manager's stock selectionModels to maximize return relative to the benchmark, while avoidinga portfolio with exposure to any other extraneous factors thatwould distinguish the Fund's portfolio from the stocks constitutingthe relevant benchmark. Within the geographic zone appropriatefor each Fund, the optimizer recommends positions in companieswhich in aggregate constitute the most efficient portfolio. Theoptimizer simultaneously considers total company alphas, tradingalphas, and risk and quantifies the expected "net benefit"to the portfolio of each recommended transaction. A stock is consideredfor sale when a higher alpha stock with complementary risk characteristicshas been identified. No transaction will be executed unless theopportunity offered by the purchase candidate sufficiently exceedsthe potential of an existing holding to justify the transactioncosts. In most markets, portfolios are reoptimized continuouslythroughout the day, allowing the Manager to respond immediatelyto investment opportunities, subject to certain limitations onshortterm trading applicable by virtue of each Fund's intentionto qualify as a regulated investment company under the InternalRevenue Code. Trading. The Manager'strading system aggregates the recommended transactions for eachof the Funds and determines the feasibility of each recommendationin light of the stock's liquidity, the expected transaction costs,and general market conditions. It relays target price informationto a trader for each stock considered for purchase or sale. Tradesare executed through any one of four trading strategies: traditionalbrokerage, networks, accommodation, and package or "basket"trades. The network arrangements the Manager has developedwith Instinet Matching System (IMS), Portfolio System for InstitutionalTrading (POSIT), and the Arizona Stock Exchange (AZX) facilitatelarge volume trading with little or no price disturbance and lowcommission rates. Accommodative trading (which we also refer to asthe Manager's "match system") allows institutional buyersand sellers of stock to electronically present the Manager withtheir "interest" lists each morning. Any matches betweenthe inventory which the brokers have presented and the Manager'sown recommended trades are signaled to the Manager's traders.Since the broker is doing agency business and has a client onthe other side of the trade, the Manager expects that the otherside will be accommodative in the price. The Manager's objectivein using this match system is to execute most trades on the Manager'sside of the bid/ask spread so as to minimize market impact. Package trades further allow the Manager to tradelarge lists of orders simultaneously using state of the art toolssuch as the Instinet RealTime System, Instinet Order MatchingSystem and Lattice Trading System. Those tools provide order entry,negotiation and execution capabilities, either directly to otherinstitutions or electronically to the floor of the exchange. Theadvantages of using such systems include speed of execution, lowcommissions, anonymity and very low market impact. The Manager continuously monitors trading costs todetermine the impact of commissions and price disturbance on theFunds' portfolios.

Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent Furman Selz LLC ("Furman Selz" or the "Administrator"),a Delaware limited liability company with its principal placeof business at 230 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10169, servesas the Trust's administrator and generally assists the Trust inall aspects of its administration and operation. As compensationfor its administrative services, Furman Selz receives a monthlyfee based upon an annual percentage rate of 0.15% of the aggregateaverage daily net assets of the Funds plus an annual fee of $30,000for each Fund. Furman Selz has also entered into an agreement withthe Trust for the provision of transfer agency services (and isreferred to herein as the "Transfer Agent" in such capacity)and dividend disbursing services for the Funds. The principalbusiness address of the Transfer Agent is 230 Park Avenue, NewYork, New York 10169. On June 28, 1996, Furman Selz and BISYS Group, Inc.("BISYS") announced a definitive agreement which providesfor Furman Selz to transfer its mutual fund clients to BISYS.This transaction is expected to close on or before September 30,1996. BISYS, headquartered in Little Falls, New Jersey, supportsmore than 5,000 financial institutions and corporate clients throughtwo strategic business units. BISYS Information Services Groupdesigns, administers and distributes over 30 families of proprietarymutual funds consisting of more than 365 portfolios, and provides401(k) marketing support, administration, and recordkeeping servicesin partnership with 18 of the nation's leading bank and investmentmanagement companies. It is expected that BISYS and its affiliateswill serve in Furman Selz' current capacity as Administrator andTransfer Agent for the Funds on and after the closing of the transaction. State Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Custodian")serves as custodian of the assets of the Funds. The principaladdress of the Custodian is Mutual Funds Division, Boston, Massachusetts02102. A further discussion of the terms of the Trust'sadministrative, custody and transfer agency arrangements is containedin the Statement of Additional Information. Distributor Adviser and Select Shares of each Fund are sold ona continuous basis by the Company's distributor, Barr RosenbergFunds Distributor, Inc. (the "Distributor"), awhollyowned subsidiary of Furman Selz. It is expected thatthe Distributor will become a whollyowned subsidiary ofBISYS upon the closing of the abovereferenced transaction.The Distributor's principal offices are located at 230 Park Avenue,New York, New York 10169. Institutional Shares are purchased directlyfrom the Funds. Solely for the purpose of compensating the Distributorfor services and expenses primarily intended to result in thesale of Select Shares of the Funds, such shares are subject toan annual Distribution Fee of up to 0.50% of the average dailynet assets attributable to such shares in accordance with a DistributionPlan (the "Distribution Plan") adopted by the Trustpursuant to Rule 12b1 under the 1940 Act. Currently, eachFund pays the Distributor an annual Distribution Fee of 0.25%of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to SelectShares. Activities for which the Distributor may be reimbursedinclude (but are not limited to) the development and implementationof direct mail promotions and advertising for the Funds, the preparation,printing and distribution of prospectuses for the Funds to recipientsother than existing shareholders, and contracting with one ormore wholesalers of the Funds' shares. The Distribution Plan forSelect Shares went into effect on August 5, 1996. The DistributionPlan is of the type known as a "compensation" plan.This means that, although the trustees of the Trust are expectedto take into account the expenses of the Distributor in theirperiodic review of the Distribution Plan, the fees are payableto compensate the Distributor for services rendered even if theamount paid exceeds the Distributor's expenses. The Distributor may also provide (or arrange foranother intermediary or agent to provide) personal and/or accountmaintenance services to Adviser and Select shareholders of theFunds (the Distributor or such entity is referred to as a "ServicingAgent" in such capacity).

Signature guaranteesare required for (1) redemptions where the proceeds are tobe sent to someone other than the registered shareholder(s) atthe registered address, (2) redemptions of $25,000 or more,and (3) share transfer requests. Signature guarantees maybe obtained from certain eligible financial institutions, includingbut not limited to, the following: banks, trust companies, creditunions, securities brokers and dealers, savings and loan associationsand participants in the Securities and Transfer Association MedallionProgram ("STAMP"), the Stock Exchange Medallion Program("SEMP") or the New York Stock Exchange Medallion SignatureProgram ("MSP"). Shareholders may contact the Trustat 18004473332 for further details.

The Transfer Agent's records of such instructionsare binding and the shareholder, and not the Trust or the TransferAgent, bears the risk of loss in the event of unauthorized instructionsreasonably believed by the Transfer Agent to be genuine. The TransferAgent will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructionscommunicated are genuine and, if it does not, it may be liablefor any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.The procedures employed in connection with transactions initiatedby telephone include tape recording of telephone instructionsand requiring some form of personal identification prior to actingupon instructions received by telephone. Systematic Withdrawal Plan An owner of $12,000 or more of shares of a Fund mayelect to have periodic redemptions made from the investor's accountto be paid on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis.The maximum payment per year is 12% of the account value at thetime of the election. The shareholder will normally redeem a sufficientnumber of shares to make the scheduled redemption payments ona date selected by the shareholder. Depending on the size of thepayment requested and fluctuation in the net asset value, if any,of the shares redeemed, redemptions for the purpose of makingsuch payments may reduce or even exhaust the account. A shareholdermay request that these payments be sent to a predesignated bankor other designated party. Capital gains and dividend distributionspaid to the account will automatically be reinvested at net assetvalue on the distribution payment date. Further Redemption Information Redemption proceeds for shares of the Trust recentlypurchased by check may not be distributed until payment for thepurchase has been collected, which may take up to fifteen businessdays from the purchase date. Shareholders can avoid this delayby utilizing the wire purchase option.

There willbe no Fund Reimbursement Fee on redemptions in kind of InstitutionalShares. Securities used to redeem Fund shares in kind will bevalued in accordance with the Fund's procedures for valuationdescribed under "Determination of Net Asset Value."Securities distributed by the Fund in kind will be selected bythe Manager in light of the Fund's objective and will not generallyrepresent a pro rata distribution of each security heldin the Fund's portfolio. Investors may incur brokerage chargeson the sale of any such securities so received in payment of redemptions. The Trust may suspend the right of redemption andmay postpone payment for more than seven days when the New YorkStock Exchange is closed for other than weekends or holidays,or if permitted by the rules of the Securities and ExchangeCommission, during periods when trading on the Exchange is restrictedor during an emergency which makes it impracticable for the Fundsto dispose of their securities or to fairly determine the valueof their net assets, or during any other period permitted by theSecurities and Exchange Commission for the protection of investors. EXCHANGE OF FUND SHARES The Funds offer two convenient ways to exchange sharesin one Fund for shares of another Fund in the Trust. Shares ofa particular class of a Fund may be exchanged only for sharesof the same class in another Fund. There is no sales charge onexchanges, but both the Fund from which the exchange is made andthe Fund into which the exchange is made will charge any applicableFund Reimbursement Fee. Before engaging in an exchange transaction,a shareholder should read carefully the information in the Prospectusdescribing the Fund into which the exchange will occur. A shareholdermay not exchange shares of a class of one Fund for shares of thesame class of another Fund that is not qualified for sale in thestate of the shareholder's residence. Although the Trust has nocurrent intention of terminating or modifying the exchange privilege,it reserves the right to do so at any time. Except as otherwisepermitted by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,the Trust will give 60 days' advance notice to shareholders ofany termination or material modification of the exchange privilege. An exchange is taxable as a sale of a security onwhich a gain or loss may be recognized. Shareholders should receivewritten confirmation of the exchange within a few days of thecompletion of the transaction. A new account opened by exchange must be establishedwith the same name(s), address and social security number as theexisting account. All exchanges will be made based on the respectivenet asset values next determined following receipt of the requestby the Funds containing the information indicated below. Exchange by Mail To exchange Fund shares by mail, shareholders shouldsimply send a letter of instruction to the Trust. The letter ofinstruction must include: (a) the investor's account number;(b) the class of shares to be exchanged; (c) the Fundfrom and the Fund into which the exchange is to be made; (d) thedollar or share amount to be exchanged; and (e) the signaturesof all registered owners or authorized parties. All signaturesmust be guaranteed by an eligible guarantor institution includingmembers of national securities exchanges, commercial banks ortrust companies, brokerdealers, credit unions and savingsassociations. Exchange by Telephone To exchange Fund shares by telephone or to ask questionsabout the exchange privilege, shareholders may call the Trustat 18004473332. If you wish to exchange shares,please be prepared to give the telephone representative the followinginformation: (a) the account number, social security number andaccount registration; (b) the class of shares to be exchanged;(c) the name of the Fund from which and the Fund into whichthe exchange is to be made; and (d) the dollar or share amountto be exchanged. Telephone exchanges are available only if theshareholder so indicates by checking the "yes" box onthe Account Application. The Trust employs procedures, includingrecording telephone calls, testing a caller's identity, and sendingwritten confirmation of telephone transactions, designed to givereasonable assurance that instructions communicated by telephoneare genuine, and to discourage fraud. To the extent that a Funddoes not follow such procedures, it may be liable for losses dueto unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions. A Fund willnot be liable for acting upon instructions communicated by telephonethat it reasonably believes to be genuine. The Trust reservesthe right to suspend or terminate the privilege of exchangingby mail or by telephone at any time. DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE With the exception of the Japan Series, the net assetvalue of each class of shares of each Fund will be determinedonce on each day on which the New York Stock Exchange is openas of 4:15 p.m., New York time. In the case of the JapanSeries, the net asset value of each class of shares of that Fundwill be determined once on each day on which the Tokyo Stock Exchangeis open as of 3:00 p.m., Tokyo time. Due to the 14 hour timedifference, 3:00 p.m. Tokyo time corresponds to 1:00 a.m.New York time (with adjustments for daylight savings time). Accordingly,purchase orders received for the Japan Series after 1:00a.m., New York time (with adjustments for daylight savings time)will receive the offering price determined on the next businessday in Japan. See "Purchase of Shares" above. The net asset value per share of each class of aFund is determined by dividing the particular class's proportionateinterest in the total market value of the Fund's portfolio investmentsand other assets, less any applicable liabilities, by the totaloutstanding shares of that class of the Fund. Specifically, eachFund's liabilities are allocated among its classes. The totalof such liabilities allocated to a particular class plus thatclass's shareholder servicing and/or distribution expenses, ifany, and any other expenses specially allocated to that classare then deducted from the class's proportionate interest in theFund's assets. The resulting amount for each class is dividedby the number of shares of that class outstanding to produce the"net asset value" per share. Portfolio securities listed on a securities exchangefor which market quotations are available are valued at the lastquoted sale price on each business day, or, if there is no suchreported sale, at the most recent quoted bid price. Price informationon listed securities is generally taken from the closing priceon the exchange where the security is primarily traded. Unlistedsecurities for which market quotations are readily available arevalued at the most recent quoted bid price, except that debt obligationswith sixty days or less remaining until maturity may be valuedat their amortized cost. Exchangetraded options, futuresand options on futures are valued at the settlement price as determinedby the appropriate clearing corporation. Other assets and securitiesfor which no quotations are readily available are valued at fairvalue as determined in good faith by the trustees of the Trustor by persons acting at their direction. DISTRIBUTIONS Each Fund intends to pay out as dividends substantiallyall of its net investment income (which comes from dividends andany interest it receives from its investments and net realizedshortterm capital gains). Each Fund also intends to distributesubstantially all of its net realized longterm capital gains,if any, after giving effect to any available capital loss carryover.Each Fund's policy is to declare and pay distributions of itsdividends and interest annually although it may do so more frequentlyas determined by the Trustees of the Trust. The Funds' policyis to distribute net realized shortterm capital gains andnet realized longterm gains annually, although it may doso more frequently as determined by the Trustees of the Trustto the extent permitted by applicable regulations. All dividends and/or distributions will be paid outin the form of additional shares of the Fund to which the dividendsand/or distributions relate at net asset value unless the shareholderelects to receive cash. Shareholders may make this election bymarking the appropriate box on the Account Application or by writingto the Administrator. There is no Fund Reimbursement Fee chargedon reinvested dividends or distributions. TAXES Each Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulatedinvestment company under Subchapter M of the Internal RevenueCode of 1986, as amended. So long as a Fund distributes substantiallyall of its dividend, interest and certain other income, its netrealized shortterm capital gains and its net realized longtermcapital gains to its shareholders and otherwise qualifies forthe special rules governing the taxation of regulated investmentcompanies, the Fund itself will not pay federal income tax onthe amount distributed. Dividend distributions (i.e., distributionsderived from interest, dividends and certain other income, including,in general, shortterm capital gains) will be taxable toshareholders subject to income tax as ordinary income. Distributionsof any longterm capital gains are taxable as such to shareholderssubject to income tax, regardless of how long a shareholder mayhave owned shares in such Fund. A distribution paid to shareholdersby a Fund in January of a year is generally deemed to havebeen received by shareholders on December 31 of the precedingyear, if the distribution was declared and payable to shareholdersof record on a date in October, November or December ofthat preceding year. Each Fund will provide federal tax informationannually, including information about dividends and distributionspaid during the preceding year. If more than 50% of a Fund's assets at fiscal yearendis represented by debt and equity securities of foreign corporations,the Fund may (and the Japan Series and the International SmallCapitalization Series intend to) elect to permit shareholderswho are U.S. citizens or U.S. corporations to claim a foreigntax credit or deduction (but not both) on their U.S. income taxreturns for their pro rata portion of qualified taxes paidby the Fund to foreign countries. As a result, the amounts offoreign income taxes paid by such Fund would be treated as additionalincome to shareholders of such Fund for purposes of the foreigntax credit. Each such shareholder would include in gross incomefrom foreign sources its pro rata share of such taxes.Certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code may preventshareholders from receiving a full foreign tax credit or deductionfor their allocable amount of such taxes. The foregoing is a general summary of the federalincome tax consequences of investing in a Fund to shareholderswho are U.S. citizens or U.S. corporations. Shareholders shouldconsult their own tax advisers about the tax consequences of aninvestment in the Funds in light of each shareholder's particulartax situation. Shareholders should also consult their own taxadvisers about consequences under foreign, state, local or otherapplicable tax laws. DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST AND OWNERSHIPOF SHARES The Trust is a diversified openend series investmentcompany organized as a Massachusetts business trust under thelaws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement andDeclaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust") datedApril 1, 1988, as amended from time to time. The U.S. SmallCapitalization Series commenced operations on or about September 13,1988. The Japan Series commenced operations on or about January 3,1989. The International Small Capitalization Series expectsto commence operations on or about the date of this Prospectus. The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees toissue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficialinterest which are presently divided into three series. Interestsin each of the Funds described in this Prospectus are representedby shares of such Fund. The Declaration of Trust also permitsthe Trustees, without shareholder approval, to subdivide any seriesof shares into various subseries of shares with such dividendpreferences and other rights as the Trustees may designate. Whilethe Trustees have no current intention to exercise this power,it is intended to allow them to provide for an equitable allocationof the impact of any future regulatory requirements which mightaffect various classes of shareholders differently. The Trusteesmay also, without shareholder approval, establish one or moreadditional separate portfolios for investments in the Trust ormerge two or more existing portfolios. Shareholders' investmentsin such a portfolio would be evidenced by a separate series ofshares. Each Fund is further divided into three classes ofshares designated as Institutional Shares, Adviser Shares andSelect Shares. Each class of shares of each Fund represents interestsin the assets of that Fund and has identical dividend, liquidationand other rights and the same terms and conditions except thatexpenses, if any, related to the distribution and shareholderservicing of a particular class are borne solely by such classand each class may, at the Trustees' discretion, also pay a differentshare of other expenses, not including advisory or custodial feesor other expenses related to the management of the Trust's assets,if these expenses are actually incurred in a different amountby that class, or if the class receives services of a differentkind or to a different degree than the other classes. All otherexpenses are allocated to each class on the basis of the net assetvalue of that class in relation to the net asset value of theparticular Fund. Each class of shares of each Fund has identical votingrights except that each class has exclusive voting rights on anymatter submitted to shareholders that relates solely to that class,and has separate voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholdersin which the interests of one class differ from the interestsof any other class. Each class of shares has exclusive votingrights with respect to matters pertaining to any distributionor servicing plan applicable to that class. Matters submittedto shareholder vote must be approved by each Fund separately except(i) when required by the Investment Company Act of 1940,all shares shall be voted together and (ii) when the Trusteeshave determined that the matter does not affect all Funds, thenonly shareholders of the Fund or Funds affected shall be entitledto vote on the matter. All three classes of shares of a Fund willvote together, except with respect to any distribution or servicingplan applicable to a class or when a class vote is required asspecified above or otherwise by the Investment Company Act of1940. Shares are freely transferable, are entitled to dividendsas declared by the Trustees and, in liquidation of a Fund portfolio,are entitled to receive the net assets of that portfolio, butnot of the other Funds. The Trust does not generally hold annualmeetings of shareholders and will do so only when required bylaw. Shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding sharesmay remove trustees from office by votes cast in person or byproxy at a meeting of shareholders or by written consent. The Declaration of Trust provides for the perpetualexistence of the Trust. The Trust, may, however, be terminatedat any time by vote of at least twothirds of the outstandingshares of the Trust. Shareholders could, under certain circumstances,be held personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. However,the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on accountof that liability is considered remote since it may arise onlyin very limited circumstances.

Our research convinces us that modest valuation errors amonggroups of similar companies are present in every sector of themarket. We have developed a series of quantitative models whichrigorously analyze fundamental data to identify these misvaluations.Using the results from these models, we build broadly diversifiedportfolios of these undervalued stocks, holding the individualstocks until the market recognizes and corrects the misvaluation.Our Fund's portfolios are composed of undervalued stocks fromevery size sector and industry group represented in each Fund'sspecific benchmark, with the typical portfolio consisting of severalhundred stocks. Each Barr Rosenberg Mutual Fund relies on our proprietary stockselection and risk models. In constructing the portfolios forthe Funds, we will avoid significant deviations from the size,industry and risk factor characteristics of the respective benchmark.In addition, we will not seek to earn extraordinary return bytiming the market, so the Funds will remain nearly fully investedin equities at all times.WT03-B14-56IA091-000971-B008-344http://riem.com:80/http_r/fc/fund.html 192.216.236.3 19970117212608 text/html 4959HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsMIME-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/html Welcome to RIEM Online Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management who we are | mutualfunds | education | news| contact us | home fund management Fund Management Each Fund is advised and managed by Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management.

The first three models identify undervalued stocks, whilethe Risk Model helps build optimal portfolios. These models operatein real time so that our portfolios always reflect the most currentinformation available. Appraisal Model The Appraisal Model is the heart of our approach. This modelcarefully analyzes the detailed fundamental data for all companiesin the market and determines the "fair value" for eachcompany. The model makes subtle and detailed measurement of thevalue of every company's business, based upon a comprehensiveassessment of earnings, assets and sales in the industries inwhich the company operates. The model appraises detailed lineitems of the balance sheet and income statement, as well as off-balancesheet items. The Appraisal Model identifies companies that arecurrently priced below their fair value as stocks to buy. Earnings Change Model The Earnings Change Model forecasts future earnings for companies.It enables Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds to invest in companiesthat are expected to have superior future earnings growth, andto sell companies that are expected to have declining earningsin the future. Investor Sentiment Model The Investor Sentiment Model forecasts short-term price trends.It assists us in buying stocks before they have a rise in performance,and in selling stocks before their prices fall. The model studiesdetailed data on investor attitudes, including analysts' earningsestimates, brokers' recommendations and dealers' positions as well as stock market returns and trading volume, to infer momentum and enthusiasm for individual stocks. Risk Model The Risk Model uses the information developed by the stockselection models to maximize return while minimizing active risk.It predicts the contribution of each stock to the risk and rewardof the aggregate portfolio. The size of any one position is determinedby the optimizer as it constructs the most efficient portfolio.WT03-B14-59IA057-000944-B024-104http://gw.sentin.com:80/ 206.26.168.119 19970109200303 text/html 6787HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Thursday, 09-Jan-97 20:10:40 GMTContent-type: text/html Sentinel Homepage Since 1983, Sentinel has provided clients with professional environmental and industrial hygiene services.

RELY ON SENTINEL TO PROVIDE LEAD INSPECTIONS, RISK ASSESMENTS & LABORATORY ANALYSIS. The incidence of Lead-Based Paint (LBP) poisoning is the Number 1 environmental cause of illness and death among pre-school children. The federal Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately one in six young children have elevated blood-lead levels associated with such adverse health problems as hemotologic and endocrinologic disorders, decreased intelligence and learning ability and behavioral distrubances. As concerned parents, teachers, and owners of childcare centers and pre-schools, it is imperative to know if our homes, educational institutions, and recreational facilities pose potential Lead-Based Paint hazards to our children. The horrors of Lead-Based Poisoning are common and all too real; the good news is Lead-Based Paint Poisoning IS entirely preventable. There are two basic assessment techniques recognized by federal and state governments to determine Lead-Based Hazards. The first is the Lead-Based Paint Risk Assessment which is designed to identify circumstances where children are at risk for Lead-Based Paint Poisoning generally in the forms of Lead contaminated dusts generated from renovations, soils and water. The second is the Lead Inspection which is design to identify each structural component within the home or other facility which contains Lead-Based Paint. Though banned in 1978, it is estimated that approximately fifty-seven million homes, excluding public housing contain Lead-Based paint. Sentinel is committed to the elimination of childhood Lead poisoning; as a public service, we have designed the following Risk Assessment & Lead Inspections informational surveys. These surveys are intended to alert parents and owners of facilities frequented by pre-school children of potential Lead-Based Paint dangers. After completing the surveys, please proceed to the informational section entitled "Lead-Based Paint Poison Prevention" if your survey results indicate LBP risk factors are present.

Radon and it's daughter by-products are naturally occurring radioactive compounds resulting from the normal decay of uranium. As radon gas forms, it seeps upward to the surface of the Earth and spews into the open air, quickly dissipating. As it escapes through soil and rock, it may enter basements, foundations, or crawlspaces of houses and buildings through cracks and crevices. Upon entering a dwelling, it may become concentrated inside, resulting in radon exposure risks to occupants. While inhalation of radon gas poses the most significant health risk, radon gas may also pervade groundwater supplies, posing a health hazard in drinking water as well. Next to tobacco smoke, radon gas and its daughters are the most serious environmental carcinogen known. It is invisible, tasteless and odorless; without proper testing, its presence cannot be detected. Continued exposure to radon can significantly increase the risk for lung cancer. As with many other environmental pollutants, risks due to radon exposure are far greater for smokers and those persons affected by passive smoking. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Action Level is 4 pCI/L. The EPA has estimated that radon concentrations in 1 out of 4 homes in the United States exceeds the Action Level. Fortunately, radon can be easily detected and steps taken to greatly reduce radon risks. Sentinel offers affordable test kits to measure radon levels in your home or occupied facility.

Yes No 1.Do children under seven years of age or a pregnant female occupy residence or frequent a facility built prior to 1980? Yes No 2.If the answer to Question 1 was Yes, is the paint in fair or poor condition,i.e., is the paint worn, chipping, peeling, chalking? Or is the substrate deteriorated? (This includes friction or impact surfaces such as window sashes and doors.) Yes No 3.Have any renovations been performed in the home or facility built prior to 1980? Yes No 4. Following a rainstorm, do you notice that exterior paint appears to run, leaving a residue on soils below? Yes No 5.Do your pre-school children frequent a playground built prior to 1980? Yes No 6.Does any member of the family work in an industry where there is apotential exposure to Lead fumes, dust, or paint chips, etc.? Yes No7.Does any member of the family engage in a hobby (stained glass, pottery,making fishing weights or bullets etc.) where lead dust or fumes might beproduced? Yes No8.Are home remedies such as "Azarcon" and "Greta" once thought to aid intestinal disorders used by family members? Yes No9.Do children have access to imported toys, (including crayons) which may contain Lead or be painted with Lead-Based Paint? Yes No10.Does the family eat imported canned foods or store food and/or beverages in imported pottery, cookware, plates or crystal? Yes No11.Do family members, particularly children and infants consume water fromLead-containing plumbing? If unknown, a water sample should be collected and analyzed for Lead After completing this survey, you may select the button entitled "Is Lead present in my Drinking Water?" for details on obtaining a Lead Analysis on the water in your home. Yes No 12.Do children exhibit symptoms of Lead-Based Paint Poisoning (Decreased intelligence, developmental delays, behavioral distrubances, seizures at very high level, coma at very high levels, decreased stature, altered vitamin D metabolism, elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels, anemia)? Please note that these symptoms are largely non-specific and may be indicative of medical problems other than Lead-Based Paint Poisoning. If the answer to one or more of the above questions was "Yes", it is advisable that the following precautions be taken: Have your pediatrician or the Department of Public Health check your child's blood lead level. Should your child's blood-lead level be elevated, your health care professional will recommend precautionary measures to follow and/or treatment for your child. Pregnant females answering "Yes" to any of the above questions should also have a blood test performed for Lead. While the greatest concern for LBP poisoning is focused on young children and unborn fetuses because of the severe developmental impacts on these individuals, adults may also experience health risks to virtually every organ system in the body when lead is ingested or inhaled. Therefore, adults answering "Yes" to one or more of the above questions, should also consider blood testing for Lead. Have a Lead Risk Assessment performed by a Lead Risk Assessor accredited through the USEPA Model Curricula Program. To obtain names of Accredited Risk Assessor in your area, you may call Sentinel for assistance at (205) 534-9800; Fax (205) 534-9878; or by e-mail Go to Lead-Based Paint Poison Prevention.

GA provides a multitude of straight forward methods for not only automating your work, but streamlining your operations: Software Features all manifest forms (hazardous/non-haz) custom forms you design (mail-merge) manifest return tracking and COD's spreadsheets for ad-hoc reporting container labels (hazardous/non-haz) extensive profiling optional features: sample tracking bar coding (inventory recommended) generator contact management container inventory control disposal facility decision support waste shipment management waste disposal cost analysis generator biennial reports (forms OI, GM) waste disposal history DRMR features The accuracy and accessibility of information is of equalimportance. The companies who possess quick access to accurate informationabout waste streams, waste quantity, disposal history and on-site inventoryhave a distinct advantage over companies who do not. How organized are yourcompany's records? Knowing the disposition of your waste is important tostate regulators and Generator Associate is the answer. MANIFEST Printing No need to create shipping documents from scratch. The system contains an extensive list of transporters, disposal facilities and waste streams to make manifesting quick. If you choose to manage your inventory, just point at the on-site inventory to ship and you're done. Even if you are shipping waste to many different states, the system includes all state specific manifests. We can recommend several different printers for printing through these 6 and 8 part forms. ESS can provide you with inexpensive dot-matrix printers for printing 6 and 8 part manifests. MANIFEST Returns and COD's After shipping waste is complete, the system will help track and ensure the return of your manifests and track certificates of disposal, recycling, etc. These reminders insure your company has complete documentation to avoid potential costly fines. Inventory CRADLE to GRAVE GA is capable of handling your on-site waste inventory. As soon as waste begins accumulation, GA starts tracking the waste for eventual on-site disposal, on-site recycling or shipment to an off-site disposal facility. Generator Associate can handle repackaging of waste, consolidation of waste into other containers and disposal processing. Container LABELING GA is designed to make container labeling a side effect of your other work instead of a job unto itself. Simply select a manifest and GA prints all the labels you will need in just about any format. Bar coding of waste turns outbound shipments into a painless task. In cases where you need a manifest quickly, simply choose a profile and a generator and you're done. LAB PACK Support When you are faced with sorting, packing and tracking individual items in a lab-pack, GA can help you catalog, organize and even bar code these items. GA tracks all of your lab-pack items individually, the container in which they are stored and the eventually destruction of the container's contents. You begin by entering and categorizing each item in the system, optionally attaching a bar code. You then generate reports which group the items by compatibility class, physical characteristics, etc. And last, you assign each item to a container, optionally using the attached bar code to speed the process. Disposal Facility DECISION SUPPORT When you are faced with disposing of your waste off-site you want to choose dependable facilities which also provide a competitive price for their service. Generator Associate keeps up with all of your disposal facility pricing and where waste has gone historically. Drawing on this data, GA can provide you the information you need to quickly find a disposal site to match. Waste Stream PROFILES GA's extensive profiling capability makes characterizing waste a snap. Track as little or as much information as you need. You can quickly build manifests using your company's profiles. Destination facility profiles include their effective dates to remind you before your profiles are about to expire. You can easily create general profiles and customize them on your manifests. Custom FORMS you design Generator Associate is flexible enough to handle just about any form you will need, even if they are specific to your company. The system contains a document editor which allows you to build upon the pre-designed forms. Should you need a special work order or other forms, simply start the editor, add your company logo and go from there! Management Reports Included are management reports which use your site's hazardous/non-hazardous waste disposal history. These reports can assist you with determining trends within your company. Waste Disposal History Once you have recorded waste shipments, the system tracks the specific waste disposal costs for each shipment. The system automatically maintains a list of all shipments that have not been invoiced and allows you to quickly enter the disposal costs directly from the facility or contractor's invoice. You can easily request reports by waste stream/waste stream category (dept.) to pinpoint your waste disposal costs. State BIENNIAL reporting (forms OI and GM) and TAX forms In most states, reporting typically only comes once every two years, but when the time comes, collecting all the detailed records can be tedious at best. All companies must track a tremendous amount of information concerning hazardous waste, EPA I. D. numbers, waste streams and classes, transporter information and disposal certification to complete these reports for state regulators. Generator Associate turns your state reporting nightmare into a dream. Using waste receipts and outgoing shipments already tracked through manifesting, the system combines all of this information to automatically print the reports for you. Optionally, in some states you can submit the report using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Integrated SPREADSHEETS Once you have accumulated historical data, Generator Associate allows you to quickly manipulated it using a built-in spreadsheet. With just a few easy menu choices you can manipulate your historical data using the system. For users who are already familiar with Excel, the system allows you to save the data in Excel spreadsheet format. Easily IMPORT from legacy systems In some cases companies will have an existing system for tracking some part of their hazardous waste and/or material. Generator Associate has a user friendly import feature to smooth your transition. Importing can draw upon any DBF or comma-delimited format file. Your SUPPORT and TRAINING Sentinel provides extensive support to get your company up and running with Generator Associate quickly. To keep your system up to date, we can offer extended service which includes updates for new features, changes in manifest forms, container labels and regulatory reporting requirements.
