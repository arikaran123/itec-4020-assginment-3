They say that their surprise #7.5 million purchase of all UKrights to the 1996 Cricket World Cup will be the first of manyprogramme ventures in the near future.The operators will bid for further sports rights, films and events andlook to launch new niche channels, including local and ethnic services. They will commission original British programming to compete against``the more American'' Rupert Murdoch, 50-per-cent owner of BSkyB.  Thisis likely to involve co-operative deals with independent televisioncompanies and possibly investments in, as well as commissions for,independent production companies.The cable operators and telephone companies plan to launch an Asianchannel later this year, produced by Yorkshire Television.  A sportschannel is also likely to be launched, a spin-off from Wire TV, thelifestyle and sports channel owned by the group which bought thecricket rights.The telephone companies, like the biggest of the cable operators,TeleCommunications Inc, are rich enough to fund the drive towards moreand better programming.  As one telephone-company executive put it,``the #7.5 million for cricket rights is small change if you look atthe millions we're putting into building cable.''But what about the less rich, middle-sized cable companies?  Canthey afford programming investment?  According to the same executive,``they recognise, as much as we do, that there is a ``need to createcable-controlled production so Murdoch cannot go on telling us what todo.''Only the cable operators were prepared to offer the money being askedfor the World Cricket Cup rights asked by rights owner WorldTel.  Therewas no bidding.BSkyB, the BBC and Channel Four were interested -- but unwilling to talkthe same language (see separate story).The cable operators argue that, although BSkyB's channels are theprogramming powerhouse in UK new media, the situation must not beallowed to continue ad infinitum.  They respect the pioneering workdone by Murdoch in developing satellite programming, but they aredetermined that he should not be allowed to control the destiny ofcable because of his dominance in programming.The cable operators have always regarded cable-only programming asimportant, but the only operator with the cash and will to get intoprogramming in a major way has been TeleCommunications Inc.  TCI, whichtransmits some of its channels on the Astra direct-to-home satellite,spent many months persuading the operators to get together to formCable Programme Partners 1 to launch Wire TV last May.CPP1, comprising three telephone companies (US West, Nynex andSouthwestern Bell) and two US cable operators (Comcast and TCI), hasgradually become a forum for strategic thinking on cable programming,``no longer worrying about what's going to be on Wire at 7.30pm,'' asone member put it (though by no means all the group is happy with thechannel).  The purchase of the Cricket World Cup rights has acceleratedthis movement, galvanising the operators to consider: What next?The CCP 1 operators will be joined by two others -- General Cable, whichhas several franchises in Yorkshire, and Jones Cable, which runs theLeeds franchise -- to launch a new Asian channel, Hum.  The operators,which will form a new partnership (CPP 2), will provide some upfrontfunding for production and start-up, but talks are continuing withYorkshire TV, which will produce the channel, over whether it will alsotake a stake and over what kind of access it will have to advertisingtime.The operators do not believe that the existing channels, TV Asia,AsiaNet (formerly Asiavision) and Namaste Asia Television, are goodenough and that a much better service could be provided.  Yorkshiresuggested a range of possible schedules to the operators, with varyingquantities of original, UK-produced and bought-in programmes.  Hum(Hindi for ``all of us'' or ``mine'') would show films, factualprogrammes, soaps, children's programmes and music.The channel is a good example of local or ethnic programming whichcable is well-suited to provide.  Narrowcasting and regionalism will beimportant weapons in cable's battle against BSkyB, according to RobinWilliamson, executive director of US West.  As part of this, theoperators will have to build links with the UK independent productioncommunity, which at the moment relies on ITV and Channel Four for mostof its business.However, the new economics of the ITV sector are changing.  Independentcompanies are having to find new markets for their product as the ITVmarket consolidates, and Williamson suggests that cable operators mayinvest directly in the companies and their facilities.  Direct co-operation with the production arms of the ITV companies themselves isalso a possibility.Senior ITV executives such as Ted Childs, head of drama at CentralTelevision, and Jonathan Powell, heads of drama at Carlton, point outthat the trend in ITV is towards a separation of production from thebusiness of running a channel.  Stand-alone production subsidiarieshave been created at all the ITV companies, and these subsidiaries arebeing encouraged to mould themselves as separate profit centres.This pushes them towards taking in partners, such as internationalpartners, BSkyB or the cable companies.  Programmes, Childs and Powellsay, could be produced by the production ``arms'' and never get shownon the ITV network.One of the toughest areas facing the cable operators is the provisionof feature films, given BSkyB's virtual monopoly of pay-televisionrights to Hollywood films for the foreseeable future.That has left the pay-per-view rights to go for, with the operatorsleaving the job to the London Interconnect group of operators, whichwants to launch a film ppv service this spring over the system linkingtheir networks.  Most of the operators own systems across the country,so a national roll-out would start, hopefully, towards the end of theyear, using digital compression on a satellite transponder provided byTCI.The Interconnect group consists of TeleWest (comprising TCI and USWest, both members of CCP1), Nynex and Comcast (also members of CCP1),General Cable (CPP2), Videotron and Encom (run by Bell Canada).Hollywood has stymied a spring launch, the operators' second attempt toget a film service going.  According to one Interconnect executive, thefilm studios are uncertain of the merits of pay-per-view, given itsdisappointing performance in the USA.The London operators say that talks are ``ongoing'' and they still hopeto reach agreement.  Some cable executives believe, however, that thestudios have not seriously put the ppv rights ``in play''.  Accordingto Williamson, US West, the largest single shareholder in Time Warner,will be given the opportunity to join any bidding for Warner Bros ppvrights.Williamson believes that the UK could ``probably sustain a number ofmovie channels''.  The top films will be hard to get.  But there arealternatives.  Film distribution company, Odyssey Film Distributors,for instance, is planning its own cable-exclusive channel, drawing on alibrary of mini-series, US made-for-television product and B movies.CPP could also conceivably strike deals with other independentdistributors.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994ONLY CABLE ACCEPTS SOARING VALUE OF CRICKET CUPThe cable operators' #7.5 million acquisition of rights to the 1996Cricket World Cup took the terrestrial broadcasters and British SkyBroadcasting by surprise.  The cable operators were for the first timebidding for major sports rights -- and were prepared to go far higherthan the rest of the players.The players -- the cable operators' Cable Programme Partners 1, BritishSky Broadcasting, Channel Four and the BBC -- did not formally bid.Instead, WorldTel, which owned the rights, told them that it valued therights at #7.5 million.  Only the cable operators said they werewilling to pay that price.BSkyB had paid #1 million for the 1992 cup.  Four years earlier the BBChad paid #150,000.  So did the operators pay too much?  That will notbe clear for some time, though they did buy more rights than BSkyB andBBC had bought for the earlier competitions.The operators are taking all UK rights, including those for all formsof live and delayed terrestrial, microwave, DTH and cable transmissionand for all video, radio and advertising.  They could sell many ofthese on to terrestrial broadcasters, particularly those for delayedtelevision transmission and radio.Mark Mascarenhas, president of WorldTel, says that his valuation was inline with the growing cost of sports events worldwide.  A one-daycricket international, he argues, has 71 minutes of advertising slotswithin it and should be priced accordingly.BSkyB was surprised by the valuation, even though it has been asresponsible as anybody for lifting the price of rights in recent years,accepting that they had been undervalued.  The low values were to alarge extent the result of the main customer being the BBC, which doesnot carry advertising.ITV then started competing more fiercely and BSkyB came on to thescene, with Murdoch showing ``genius'' in understanding the need for ahigher valuation and winning several high-profile events.  At the sametime, sports governing bodies grew more adept at valuing their ownproduct and television revenues became more important to the sportsthemselves.No one is suggesting that Murdoch is taking a more cautious line.Recently, he paid #1 billion for the rights to North American footballgames for his Fox television network, taking them away from CBS.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994MEDIA BODIES COULD FORCE KIRCH TO CUT PRO 7 STAKEA group of German state media authorities is threatening to force theKirch family to sell part of its stake in film-based television channelPro 7, on the grounds that the holding may be in breach of German ruleson the concentration of ownership in the new-media sector.Fourteen out of the 15 authorities have told Pro 7 -- which is 47.5-per-cent owned by Thomas Kirch, son of media magnate Leo Kirch -- that itmust provide details of its finances to prove that it is independent.They say that the information must be supplied by the end of thismonth.  Pro 7 has so far refused to comply.The group of authorities -- which includes all except the mediaauthority of Schleswig-Holstein, the authority which actually grantedPro 7 its licence to broadcast -- dispute the channel's claim that theThomas Kirch shareholding is entirely independent of Leo Kirch'scontrol.  They argue that it should be treated as part of the Leo Kirchempire which includes stakes in the general-entertainment channel Sat1, the pay-television channel Premiere and the sports channel DSF.They say that the Kirch holding in Pro 7 should thus be no more than 25per cent -- the maximum level that would be allowed if the stake wereheld by Leo Kirch directly.The group of authorities say that if the channel refuses to co-operatethey will put pressure on Schleswig-Holstein to strip the channel ofits licence.  Schleswig-Holstein has up to now supported the channel,but could find it difficult to maintain this position if it is opposedby everybody else.The 14 authorities have told Pro 7 to submit financial information onthree specific points which they believe will resolve the question ofPro 7's independence.  But Pro 7 says that it will not supply theinformation on the grounds that it is ``commercially sensitive.''First, the authorities want Pro 7 to supply details of the financialcircumstances surrounding Thomas Kirch's original 1988 investment inthe channel's predecessor, Eureka TV.  The authorities say that thereis no indication as to where Thomas Kirch could have raised the moneyother than from his father.Second, the authorities require information about the arrangements thatthe channel made with its banks to cover its debt in the yearsfollowing its relaunch as Pro 7 in January 1989.  They suspect that Pro7's bank loans were guaranteed by Leo Kirch.Third, the authorities want details of the film-supply deals which Pro7 has with companies owned by Leo Kirch.  The authorities believe thatPro 7 has been given preferential terms which involve it being allowedto delay payment for films, and also to pay for films on an individualbasis.They say that if the required information is not supplied by thebeginning of April, they will seek to persuade Schleswig-Holstein torescind Pro 7's licence immediately.If Pro 7 does comply with the request, but the information does notdemonstrate that the channel is independent, the authorities willdemand that Thomas Kirch should reduce his share in the channel below25 per cent within one year -- with the threat of licence removal if hedoes not comply.George Kofler, chief executive of Pro 7 and a minority shareholder,says that the channel will not comply with the authorities' requests,which he claims are part of a political campaign against the channel,resulting from the Kirch family's affiliation with the right-wing CSUparty.Kofler says that he has shown all the cited documents to the mediaauthority of Schleswig-Holstein and that circulating the documents tothe other 14 authorities could lead to leakage of sensitive commercialinformation on issues such as programme-supply contracts.He says that the director of the Schleswig-Holstein media authority,Gernot Schumann, was satisfied with the information, and so the o0herauthorities should allow Pro 7 to continue without furtherinterference.  He does not believe that Schumann will order any actionagainst Pro 7.Kofler argues that Thomas Kirch's original acquisition of a stake inthe channel did not cost that much because it was made at a time whenEureka TV was effectively a ``bankrupt station.''  He adds that thechannel's backers have not had to put in any more money since thenbecause investment has been financed by bank loans and by ploughingback into the company any surplus from advertising, which has grownsteadily as Pro 7 has grown into the third most popular private channelin Germany after RTL-tv and Sat 1.A total of DM150 million was invested for the relaunch, since whenadvertising revenues have climbed steadily, growing from DM11 millionin 1989 to DM45 million in 1990, DM165 million in 1991 and DM400million in 1992.  The channel is thought to have taken DM600 million in1993 and is projected to take DM650 million in 1994.Kofler adds that Pro 7's banking arrangements have satisfied Schleswig-Holstein's financial experts -- despite the suspicions of the otherauthorities about the involvement of Leo Kirch.On the specific question of programme acquisition, he says that Pro 7buys its material on the same terms as every other channel.The media authorities deny that their action has a political nature.They say that Pro 7 must convince them all of its independence -- notjust Schleswig-Holstein.  They say that the burden of proof rests withPro 7, and that if the channel cannot prove its independence, then itwill be treated on the same basis as it would be if it were 47.5-per-cent-owned by Leo Kirch himself.Schumann argues that this is the wrong approach.  He believes that theburden of proof on disputed questions of media ownership rests with themedia authorities.  Since they cannot prove Pro 7's connection with LeoKirch, he says, they should leave the channel alone.Leo Kirch's shareholdings in German television comprise: 43 per cent inthe full-service general-entertainment channel, Sat 1; 25 per cent inthe thematic pay channel Premiere; and 24.5 per cent in the thematicsports channel DSF.Other cases: The media authorities have been considering several caseswhere there have been worries about concentration of ownership, buthave decided to take no further action beyond that which is in processalready.RTL2, which has in the past been a source of concern to the authoritieson the grounds that the coupling of CLT and Bertelsmann amongst theshareholders matched the position in RTL-tv, is no longer seen as aproblem because the authorities accept that the two companies are notworking in concert in either case.Other ownership questions, such as that of Bertelsmann's share of Vox(Satellite TV Finance 4:13), are already being addressed separately.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994CHANNELS WANT CHANGES TO OWNERSHIP RULESPrivate television companies in Germany are calling for changes in thelaw on the ownership of cable and satellite channels to ease theintroduction of new channels based on digital compression.  They saythat the number of new channels will be greatly reduced unless theregulations are changed.The programme-providers want changes to the rules limiting the numberof themed channels they are allowed to own.  They say that the presentrules, which impose severe limits, will result in too many new channelsbeing owned by smaller or new-to-television companies, which are lesslikely to have the expertise to operate successful themed channels.The existing rules, they say, will also encourage foreign companies tobeam channels into Germany, for instance from the UK or Luxembourg, totake advantage of unfulfilled opportunities.  Digital compression islikely to be introduced in two to three years.Dr Peter Luke, head of the legal department at Sat 1, which is keen onthe changes, said that the company does not have specific plans forthemed channels but wants the law changed for the good of the Germantelevision industry.The Verband Privater Rundfunk Telekommunikation, which represents theprivate channels, is also worried about the existing rules on politicalbalance in themed channels.  It accepts that ``full-service'' channelsshould have to provide balanced coverage of news and current affairs,but that it should be unnecessary for themed channels: there will bemany, perhaps hundreds of themed channels and political balance will beachieved across the whole range, taken together.The programme providers say that themed channels should be exemptedfrom some of the regulations because they will be so numerous and getsuch small audiences -- even now the channels attract less than a two-per-cent viewing share each compared with more than 10 per cent for themost popular ``full-service'' channels, and because they cover singleissues, such as particular sports or types of music or hobbies, whereit could be unreasonable to expect strict impartiality.The media authorities are sceptical about changing the regulations.Lothar Jene, deputy director of the Hamburg media authority, said thatrelaxing or removing the regulations could lead to channels definingthemselves as themed channels but still broadcasting general-entertainment programming.  He thought that the media authorities wouldbe unlikely to deregulate the channels.  Joachim Becker, deputydirector of the Hessen media authority, also thought that a change inthe law was unlikely.Ingebord Ludwig, a legal adviser at the Berlin-Brandenburg authority,was more encouraging.  She said that the likely proliferation ofchannels could lead to a relaxation because it would not be sensible torestrict very small channels.The present law lays down that a company may own more than 25 per centof only one full-service channel (that is, one which shows a range ofprogramming) and up to 25 per cent of as many as it likes.  It can alsoown more than 25 per cent of one themed channel and, again, up to 25per cent of as many as it likes.A company which does not own a full-service channel can own more than25 per cent of two themed channels and up to 25 per cent of as manyothers as it likes.  Themed news channels are restricted as if theywere full-service channels.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994MTV MAY BE ONLY MEMBER OF SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGEMTV Europe, the satellite pop-music channel, may be the only member ofan encrypted subscription package to Astra dish homes launched inGermany this autumn.  Other UK channels which have been hoping to jointhe Selco marketing package, set up by the Kirch family's Pro 7 andRupert Murdoch's News Datacom, are unlikely to have sorted out rightsproblems in time to join the package at launch.Selco believes that MTV, encrypted in News Datacom's Videocrypt system,will attract between 200,000 and 300,000 subscribers over two years --compared with the present Astra dish market in Germany of 4.5 million.So MTV would lose the bulk of its German dish market -- and possiblysome advertising revenue -- for the sake of a relatively small amount ofsubscription revenue.The move, part of a German-wide and European-wide switch to encryptionfor the channel, is an ambitious one, given its present German market,and flies in the face of the accepted wisdom for pay-channels to sticktogether in numbers.  MTV refused to comment.  However, Germantelevision executives believe that MTV's strength in the German marketgives the channel a better chance than most of making a stand-alonesubscription offer work.Astra dish owners in Germany will initially have to pay a monthlysubscription of between DM5 and DM10 to receive MTV -- on top of buyinga videocrypt decoder costing between DM200 (#79) and DM300.  When otherchannels join Selco, MTV could be sold as part of the package, which iswhat Selco would prefer, or as a stand-alone service attached to themain package.The channel has already reached an agreement with Deutsche Telekom inwhich it will receive a fee for distribution to the company's near-14million cable subscribers -- in return for the channel continuing to bedistributed in the clear.  MTV will continue to pay Deutsche Telekomabout DM1 million a year for the downlinking of the channel signal, butwill now end up slightly in the black.  The channel is seeking asimilar deal with the private cable operators.In the UK, the channel is set to encrypt and join the Sky Multi-Channels package this autumn.  It is also talking to Filmnet aboutinclusion in its MultiChoice Kaleidoscope mini-pay package sold inBenelux and Scandinavia and due to be extended to Hungary, the CzechRepublic and Portugal.  Further talks are taking place with cableoperators in several European countries.Selco was due to launch a package of four to six encrypted English-language Astra channels to DTH homes in Germany, Austria andSwitzerland this April, but put back the launch because of theirdifficulty in clearing German-market rights.  It will providesubscription-management services such as billing, smartcarddistribution, and customer support.MTV will retain control over the subscription fee, at least while it isthe only channel in the package.  It is unlikely to have little leftafter paying Selco's costs, but the terms of the deal are still beingnegotiated.The channel is calling for what amounts to a larger fee-per-subscriberfrom Germany's private cable systems than it got from Deutsche Telekom:30 pfennigs a month against a likely 0.7 pfennigs.  It has told theprivate operators association Anga that, if it is unable to reachagreement with the association and individual operators seek a dealafter encryption, the charge will double.  An Anga source said that,despite MTV's huge popularity in Germany, some operators may beprepared to make do with Viva, the rival music channel launched inDecember.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994CAN CANAL PLUS AFFORD TO KEEP OUT OF PPV?The approaching launch of a pay-per-view service on Paris cablenetworks has raised the question of whether Canal Plus will seek toretain its dominance in French pay-television by launching its own pay-per-view service.The channel says that it will not, that the market and the technologyis not ready for it.  It will, instead, wait for digital compressionand launch a near-video-on-demand service in two or three years time.But observers question whether (1) the company can afford to let arival service develop and (2) whether political factors, once again atthe centre of French media, will dictate a change in policy.The cable ppv service, founded by Lyonnaise Communications and FranceTelecom, was always seen as a commercial rival to Canal Plus and as anattempt to pre-empt Canal Plus from introducing its own ppv service.Now that Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and TF1 have jumpedon board, the service looks to be an even stronger threat to CanalPlus.CLT has made no secret of its wish to break Canal Plus' monopoly of pay-television.  But what if, as some observers suggest, in the wake of theshareholding and personnel changes at Canal Plus, CLT were to becomemore closely allied with the pay-television operator?  Would the twogroups want to come together?  If not, would it make commercial sensefor Canal Plus to carry on waiting for the market to mature?Even within the present media environment, without any further majorchanges, Canal Plus and its shareholders will face a dilemma when,later this year, the Paris ppv service begins to be rolled out acrossthe country.  Compagnie Generale des Eaux, thought now to be a verypowerful force within Canal Plus, will have to decide whether to takethe ppv service on its cable networks, the most extensive in thecountry.Several analysts believe that it will not; that, whatever technical orprogramming reasons CGE gives, it will not be prepared, as a majorCanal Plus shareholder, to take a service from a rival group ofcompanies.  But it may have difficulty simply watching from thesidelines.  As one senior CGE executive put it, ``although politicallythe company might not wish to get into bed with [the Paris group], ithas to run its systems profitably.  It will obviously be under pressureto take it.''  The service, he said, would be taken if it were likelyto be popular.Some analysts believe that CGE and Canal Plus, which is being forced bythe government to get more involved in cable, could launch its ownjoint service.  If the rival service were popular, Canal Plus and CGEwould find it difficult to wait.For the moment, Canal Plus argues that the French market is not well-enough developed for ppv to be successful.  The cable service will notbe profitable, it says, because the US studios are unlikely to beinterested until there are one million subscribers -- French cable as awhole has only 870,000 broadband subscribers -- and the cable group hasenough power to negotiate good film rights.It says that US experience suggests that a wide choice of programmesneeds to be offered at frequent intervals.  So, it says, it is muchbetter to wait two or three years until digital compression creates thecapacity to provide a near-video-on-demand service.  Viewers need to beoffered a choice of films -- between four and 10 -- with the possibilityof choosing any of the films every 15 to 30 minutes.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994STAR RETHINKS PAY-TV AFTER WHARF BREAKDOWNStar TV, the pan-Asian satellite broadcaster controlled by RupertMurdoch, is to suspend its four premium pay-television services,following this week's breakdown of negotiations with Wharf Cable inHong Kong over carriage terms.Star says that it is to re-examine the channels -- all of which weredevised initially for relay on Wharf, but were also intended forsubsequent broadcast across Asia via satellite -- and that it couldamend some of them or abandon them altogether.  But it adds that itstill wants to launch pay channels in some form.The Star move has come as a shock to the Asian News and BusinessChannel, the pay channel specially commissioned by Star from NBC, FTTVand Reuters TV.  The partners in ANBC, which had been hoping to useWharf as a base from which to launch the service in other Asianmarkets, will meet in the next two weeks to discuss whether the channelshould continue, and if so how.The other three pay services -- two film channels and a children'schannel -- were all produced by Star itself.This week's breakdown of discussions between Wharf and Star followed along-running dispute between the two, part of which concerned Wharf'scarriage of the four pay channels.  Star has been sending these toWharf by landline since the launch of the latter's cable service lastOctober.Under the terms of its Hong Kong government licence, Wharf is obligedto carry ``regional'' premium pay channels from Star.  But it had beenrefusing to distribute the four existing channels on the grounds thatthey did not qualify as regional until they were transmitted bysatellite (NMM 11:22).Star and Wharf had reached an outline arrangement for the carriage ofthe pay channels -- and for three of the five clear channels that Staris transmitting via Asiasat 1 -- as part of a wide-ranging contract thatwas agreed in June 1993.  However, reaching a final and detailedagreement became difficult after Murdoch's News Corporation purchased acontrolling stake in Star in July.The discussions on the outline agreement broke down in January thisyear when Wharf Cable began legal action to prove that the agreementwas not legally binding.  In advance of this case being heard in thehigh court in Hong Kong, the two sides had begun discussions on acompletely new agreement.However, Star now says that it cannot reach a ``workable arrangement''with Wharf and has withdrawn from discussions, at least temporarily.Wharf says that Star's move reflects its recognition that last June'soutline agreement is not legally binding.But if Star is to launch new premium pay-television channels fromAsiasat 1 satellite -- as it says it will -- the two sides will have tonegotiate carriage terms or seek involvement of the Hong Konggovernment in brokering a carriage deal.  Star's right to have Wharfcarry the premium pay-channels lasts three years and expires in June1996.Wharf believes that it can still reach an agreement with Star for thecarriage of premium and clear services.  A well-placed source said:``We were talking until last week, we have no idea why they havestopped talking, or what they want to do''.Meanwhile, Wharf is seeking other arrangements for the supply ofchannels to compensate for the loss of Star's clear services (SatelliteTV Finance 5:2).Star has yet to decide a distribution strategy for the launch of itspremium pay services.  Its original plan was to use its sparetransponder on Asiasat 1 to broadcast the four channels using digitalcompression.  It is understood that the plan was blocked by Murdoch,who has bought a house in Hong Kong to spend time working directly onStar TV.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994BBC PREPARES FOR LAUNCH OF OVERSEAS THEME CHANNELSThe BBC's World Service Television this week put a little bit moreflesh on its plans to launch satellite channels around the world.  Itsaid that it is ``very seriously'' examining the idea of launchingthemed channels of BBC product as well as news and information channelsin the near future.The themed channels, consisting primarily of BBC product, would beentire channels dedicated to a certain area, such as documentary orcomedy, or a group of ``strands'' branded as a single channel,covering, for instance, wildlife, drama and music.The channels, suggested by Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy directorgeneral, at a Financial Times conference last month, would be clusteredaround WSTV's News and Information Channel, versions of which the BBChopes to launch in Europe and the USA this year.Chris Irwin, WSTV chief executive, said this week that quality will beof prime importance in the development of new channels because of theimportance of maintaining the BBC's reputation and brand worldwide.The BBC increasingly sees its reputation as a marketable commodity,since it gives both the BBC and its partners a head-start in newmarkets.  Irwin argues that the BBC is more attractive to potentialdistribution partners because of this head-start; the power of theBBC's reputation is such that it can be expressed as a form ofinvestment in itself.The reputation will be even more important in the multi-channel future. Irwin sees it developing as a kind of ``publisher's imprint'' -- arecognisable name in what is likely to be a confusingly varied myriadof channels.Increasingly, it is the policy of the BBC to ``manage'' its brand-name,to nurture it as a market commodity.  This lies behind much of theBBC's strategy at home and abroad, and has distinct implications forWSTV's new services.For instance, the brand-name of the BBC is one factor in the type ofNews and Information Channel it will launch in Europe and the USA; theother factor is that the market for new channels in both territories islimited.In both the USA and Europe, the BBC will aim for a very defined (andclosely researched) market.  It is not seeking to compete directly withwhat is already available, both for reasons of market share and becausethe perceived quality and tone of BBC news provision would not beappropriate for this kind of head-on competition with the likes of CNN;it would require a major change in emphasis, and a consequent majorshift of how the BBC's brand is perceived in those territories.Likewise, the BBC will not seek to compete with the domestic newsservices of Europe.Irwin says that WSTV has identified a significant minority in Europeand the USA, primarily among AB social groups, with an internationaloutlook and an interest in an alternative news source.  The minority ismainly to be found among the academic, media and business sectors.  Thenew services will be adapted from the existing News and InformationChannel specifically for this audience.Irwin uses the analogy of The Economist to explain BBC strategy in thetwo markets: to develop and consolidate a niche among the mostinfluential and powerful social strata, without competing directly withexisting media.WSTV is also pouring more money into developing its own news-gatheringservice, distinct from the domestic service.  Most of its news is stilleither commissioned from news agencies or adapted from domestic servicebulletins, but the proportion of news produced directly by WSTV isincreasing and Irwin would like to see this continue.WSTV is now in the middle of a training programme designed to provideBBC World Service Radio's reporters with TV experience; in addition,the imminent launch of WSTV's Arabia service, to be transmitted inArabic, is forcing WSTV to create its own Arabic news-gathering servicewhich, Irwin maintains, ``will be the best in the world.''WSTV, which is embroiled in a legal dispute over carriage of its Newsand Information Channel on Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, is ``re-gaugeingthe competitive environment'' in Asia.WSTV said recently that it wanted to maintain the Star relationship aslong as possible, and that constructive talks were taking place betweenthe two parties.  Two weeks ago, Phillis said that either party coulddrop out at the end of 1994, but that he hoped the relationship wouldcontinue.Irwin now says that ``Star is not the only player in Asia,'' addingthat ``there is a deep and growing concern about any one individualcontrolling the global gateways, in other words subscriber managementand services.  Rupert Murdoch is a very strong partner to have, becauseof his knowledge of the market, but there are other partners.''There are a number of options, which could include joining the group ofchannels which is setting up in opposition to Star on the Apstarsatellites.  Alternatively, the BBC could go it alone and startbroadcasting from one of the new satellites, Apstar 1 and 2 and Asiasat2.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994HOW BIG IS BSKYB'S BILL FOR BRITISH SCREEN FILMS?BSkyB would have paid between #262,966 and #279,113 for UK pay-television rights to the highly successful UK feature The Crying Game,had its new output agreement with British Screen Finance, thegovernment-backed film subsidy body, been up and running in 1991/92.It would also have paid at least #385,687 for Orlando and at least#413,750 for Damage.These prices have been calculated on the basis of the payment terms setout in the deal, signed two weeks ago, which will give BSkyB the UK pay-television rights to at least 30 British Screen-supported features overthree years.  These terms set out formulae under which the prices ofthe rights to each film are calculated according to its productionbudget and its cinema box-office takings.There is a basic price for the main pay-television window, which willopen between 15 months and 18  months after the film's theatricalrelease, last for between 11 and 12 months, and provide for 12screenings.  This price includes two elements: an initial licence feeequivalent to eight per cent of the production budget up to #2.5million, and three per cent of the sum by which the budget exceeds #2.5million; and an additional licence fee, equivalent to five per cent oftotal box-office receipts (excluding VAT) in the UK and the IrishRepublic up to the point where the film passes to BSkyB.There is an additional price for an optional second pay-televisionwindow, which will open three years after a film's first broadcast onfree television.  This price is equivalent to five per cent of theinitial licence fee plus 10 per cent of the additional licence fee.The Crying Game, which in world market terms is the most successfulfilm ever backed by British Screen, was made on a budget of #2.6million.  So the initial licence fee would have been #203,000.  Thefilm has so far taken #1,453,726 at UK and Irish cinemas, according toits distributors Mayfair, yielding a VAT-exclusive figure of#1,199,324.  So the additional licence fee would have been #59,966.Had BSkyB opted to buy a second pay-television window -- highly likelygiven the international success of the feature, which earned directorNeil Jordan an Oscar for best original screenplay, and picked up threeother Oscar nominations -- it would have paid an additional #16,147.The terms of the deal set a cap of #325,000 on the initial licence feethat BSkyB will have to pay for any individual film in the first yearof the deal's operation.It would not have had to pay this for any of the films shown here --although it would have come close with both Orlando and Damage (each ofwhich had a budget of #6.6 million), where the initial fee would havebeen #323,000 in each case.In each case BSkyB's investment is substantially lower than the priceit was asked to pay in an earlier attempt to open up a pay-televisionwindow for UK features.Just over a year ago David Elstein, BSkyB's head of programming,approached Channel Four with a bid to buy UK pay-television rights to apackage of features -- including The Crying Game -- in which theterrestrial broadcaster had invested in return for equity and alltelevision rights in line with its normal practice.But the terrestrial broadcaster effectively rejected the offer, sayingthat BSkyB that would have to offer at least twice Channel Four'sinitial licence fee -- believed to have been between #300,000 and#500,000 in each case -- before such a bid would even be considered(Satellite TV Finance 4:3).Of the other examples shown, both No Worries and Blue Black Permanentwould have been excluded from the deal as currently constituted.  Thefirst because it has no theatrical distribution deal and the secondbecause its budget is below the #750,000 minimum stipulated in theagreement.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994BT SEEKS BROADBAND SERVICES DEALBritish Telecom may offer the government a deal whereby it wouldinstall fibre-optic cable throughout the network, including the localloop to each customer, at a cost of #15 billion, in return for beingallowed to provide a range of broadband services, including videoentertainment.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE TV FINANCE via NewsNetMarch 3, 1994ITC SUGGESTS CHANGES TO RULES ON CROSS-OWNERSHIP OF TV CHANNELSThe Independent Television Commission told Peter Brooke, NationalHeritage secretary, who is reviewing cross-media ownership regulations,that the restriction on a company owning more than two ITV franchiselicences should be replaced by a market-share limit of 25 per cent oftotal television advertising revenue, including that of satellite andcable television.  It also said that cross-media ownership rules couldbe applied to satellite channels as satellite viewing increases.The ITC said that newspaper groups should be able to have 30-per-centstakes in ITV companies, instead of the present 20-per-cent limit, andthat ITV companies should be able to have a 30-per-cent stake in theplanned Channel 5 instead of 20 per cent.

Both figures were the highest for at least 15 years (usingcurrent price comparisons).  The average budget was #4.07 million, thebest figure for at least four years.The investment total represents a rise of 19.4 per cent on the #259.26million spent on the 70 UK-producer films that went before the camerasin 1994 (Screen Finance 8:1), and is 133.8 per cent higher than the#132.4 million spent on 60 such films in 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).However, the amount of money invested in the five films shot by foreignproducers in the UK was only #111.25 million, 37 per cent less than the#176.50 million put into eight such films in 1994 (although it was 38per cent higher than the #81.3 million put into seven such films in1993).As a result, total investment in all UK-linked productions fellslightly to #420.79 million.  This was 3.4 per cent lower than the#435.76 million figure recorded in 1994, but still 97 per cent abovethe #213.7 million invested in 1993.The drop in overall investment came despite the fact that the totalnumber of 81 film starts was three more than in 1994 (Screen Finance8:1), and 14 up on 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).But the relative lack of foreign films is likely to be a short-termphenomenon, given the number of big-budget features that haveprovisionally booked space in UK studios for this year.  These includethe $65 million Fifth Element, Cinergi/Really Useful Group's Evita andWarner Bros' The Avengers (Screen Finance 8:17).A total of 40 features were wholly UK in origin -- that is, they weremade solely by British production companies -- with a combined budget of#169.59 and an average budget of #4.24 million.  Of these films, 35were shot mainly or wholly in the UK and had a combined value of#135.67 million.  The other five were shot mainly or wholly abroad andrepresented a further investment of #33.92 million.The level of investment in wholly British features is noticeably higherthan in 1994, when 38 such films were made (33 of them mainly orentirely in the UK) with a combined budget of #110.96 million and anaverage budget of #2.92 million.  In 1993 there were 31 films in thiscategory with a total value of #62.39 million (average #2.01 million).There was also an increase in the number of international co-productions involving UK producers.  There were 36 films in thiscategory last year, with a combined investment of #139.95 million(average #3.89 million).  This compares with 32 co-productions in 1994(total investment #148.30 million, average #4.63 million) and 29 in1993 (total investment #68.01 million, average #2.35 million).However, UK producers played the leading or equal role in only 11 oflast year's co-productions (of which only four were shot mainly orwholly in Britain) with a combined value of #52.14 million (average#4.74 million).  The remaining 25 co-productions, with a combinedbudget of #87.81 million (average #3.51 million), had only a minorityUK involvement.  Given that 22 of these were shot mainly or whollyabroad, it is likely that only a small proportion of this money willhave accrued to the UK production sector.The generally positive picture for UK production is reflected in thenumber of medium-to-large-budget UK films.  Last year 15 of the 76films with UK-producer involvement (19.7 per cent) had budgets of #6million or more.  While this is slightly down on the 1994 figure of 17out of 70 (24.3 per cent) it is well up on the 1993 total of three outof 60 (five per cent).And last year's total includes four features with budgets of more than#15 million -- the #20 million Fierce Creatures from Fish Productionsand Jersey Films, the #17 million Goldeneye from Eon Productions, the#18 million Blood and Wine from Recorded Pictures (see below) and the#15.5 million Pinocchio from Allied Pinocchio in collaboration withDavis Films of France and Etamp Film Productions of the Czech Republic. Only the fourth of these was not a wholly British production.This figure compares with two films in this category in 1994, one in1993, and none in 1992.Main investorsPolygram Filmed Entertainment was again one of the heaviest investors,backing eight of the 76 films with UK-producer involvement -- Jude theObscure, Trainspotting, Walking and Talking, Dead Man Walking,Pinocchio, The Eighth Day, The Pillow Book and This the Sea.  It alsobacked one of the five foreign films shooting in Britain -- Portrait ofa LadyMiramax, as usual, was the most active US backer, with money in five UK-producer projects -- Brassed Off, Emma, I Love You -- I Love You Not, TheLast of the High Kings, and Snakes and Ladders.Twentieth Century Fox had three UK-producer projects -- The SecretAgent, Blood and Wine and Stealing Beauty.  Walt Disney also had threein this category -- The Wind in the Willows, Firelight and Lapropietaire (The Proprietor) -- plus two US projects shooting in the UK-- The Muppet Treasure Island and 101 Dalmatians.Three US investors backed two UK-producer projects each: United Artists(Goldeneye and Richard III); Trimark (Proteus and Crimetime); and NewLine/Fine Line (Twelfth Night and Total Eclipse).Single project investors included Universal (Fierce Creatures), Unapix(The Proposition), Warner Bros (Surviving Picasso), Summit (TwelfthNight), Visionary Communications (Two Blind Mice), Columbia Tristar(The Wind in the Willows), Castle Rock (Othello), Kushner Locke(Pinocchio), HBO Showcase (Deadly Voyage) and the Overseas Film Group(This is the Sea).Two other US companies backed foreign productions shooting in Britain --Paramount (Mission Impossible) and October Films (Breaking the Waves).As in other years there was an almost total lack of commercial UKinvestors, other than the usual ones such as J&M Entertainment,Majestic Films and Television and Capitol Films, with the occasionaldistributor pre-buy from distributors such as Entertainment, FirstIndependent, Guild and Electric/Polygram.Private investors are evident in a handful of films.  But only one ofthese, the #4.5 million Grotesque, had a budget of more than #2million.One noticeable continuing trend is the decline of low-budget films(those with budgets of less than #2 million).  This year 23 of the 76UK-producer films (30.3 per cent per cent) fell into this category, and16 of the 40 wholly-UK films (40 per cent).  This compares with the1994 figures of 28 out of 70 UK-producer films (40 per cent) and 20 outof 38 wholly-UK films (52.6 per cent).  In 1993 the figures were 34 outof 60 (56.7 per cent) and 20 out of 31 (64.5 per cent per cent).Last year also saw the first decline for some time in the number andproportion of films depending on some members of the cast and crewdeferring their fees -- a practice which applies almost entirely towholly-UK films.In 1995 only four of the 40 wholly UK films (10 per cent) relied to agreater or lesser extent on this approach -- Bob's Weekend, Driven,Respect and Two Blind Mice.  This compares with 14 out of 33 in 1994(42 per cent) and 10 out of 28 in 1993 (36 per cent).There was also one minority-UK co-production using deferrals last year-- This is the Sea.Subsidy moneyOf the 76 features involving UK producers, 35 received some form ofpublic subsidy.  Thirty of these were international co-productions.Far and away the most active body was Eurimages, the Council ofEurope's co-production fund, which backed 21 UK-producer projects(including five in which the UK company was the lead producer).Unfortunately, this line of finance is now being closed following theUK government's decision last November to withdraw from the fund (seeseparate story on page 12).Of the UK sources, British Screen Finance provided backing from itsmain fund for four films -- The Near Room, Nothing Personal (formerlyAll Our Fault), Richard III and Sweet Angel Mine (Screen Finance 8:23).The European Co-production Fund, which is administered by BritishScreen, has supported five films -- Total Eclipse, This is the Sea, TheKiller Tongue, Portraits Chinois and The Castle of the Monkeys.A key emerging UK source is the Arts Council of England (ACE), whichprovides National Lottery money for film production and backed three ofthe films that went into production last year -- A Midsummer Night'sDream, The Woodlanders and Crimetime.  The ACE, and the parallel ArtsCouncils of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have also providedLottery money for a number of forthcoming productions (Screen Finance8:22).Other bodies providing funds included the Glasgow Film Fund, whichbacked The Near Room, Small Faces (aka Easterhouse) and Carla's Song.Television financeAs usual, there was also a major contribution from television companiesboth from the UK and other European countries.  At least 43 of the 76UK-producer films received support from one of these sources.Channel Four, as in previous years, was by far the most active.  Itbacked 19 films that went into production in 1995, compared with 12 in1994 and eight in 1993.  These were Beautiful Thing, Brassed Off,Guardians, Indian Summer, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Trainspotting, TheWoodlanders, Walking and Talking, Carla's Song, Crimetime, The HollowReed, A Further Gesture, The Disappearance of Finbar, Trojan Eddie,Truth (aka Mike Leigh's Untitled '95), Nothing Personal, PortraitsChinois, La proprietaire and The Pillow Book.  The Welsh Channel Four,S4C, backed one film, The Proposition.The BBC backed six films compared with four in 1994 and two in 1993.Last year's films were Different for Girls (aka Crossing the Border),Jude the Obscure, Small Faces, Twelfth Night, Deadly Voyage and Swann.BSkyB backed six films -- The Bruce, Richard III, The Near Room, SweetAngel Mine (aka Love's Executioner), The Castle of the Monkeys, This isthe Sea -- mostly through its output deal with British Screen.However, no films received investment from any of the ITV companies.Canal Plus, the French pay-television channel, backed three co-productions involving UK companies -- I Love You -- I Love You Not, TheButterfly Effect, and The Castle of the Monkeys.  It also backed theforeign-produced Breaking the Waves.Two other European broadcasters, RTE of Ireland and TVE of Spain, alsobacked three co-productions each.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996EC FINALLY ISSUES CALLS FOR IO TENDERSThe European Commission last week finally published its long-awaitedcalls to tender for the contracts to run the four IntermediaryOrganisations (IOs) that are to be set up under the Media IIinitiative, successor to the Media Programme which officially came toan end last month.Final discussion of the IO tenders took place at the December 15meeting of the Media Committee and the documents were made public onJanuary 5.  These call for applications to be submitted by February 23. The EC is hoping that the winners will be selected by mid-April (aheadof the start of the Mip-TV programme market on April 19), and that theIOs will begin operation by May or June.However, the documents say that tenderers must keep their proposalsopen until November 23, suggesting that there are fears that theselection process could be considerably extended.The EC is now hoping to issue the invitations for bids from potentialbeneficiaries -- that is, the call for potential end users to apply forMedia II funds -- by the end of this month.  Various draft proposalswere discussed at the December 15 of the old Media Committee, and willbe considered further at the January 22 meeting of the new Media IICommittee which is to replace it (but which is likely to haveessentially the same membership).The delayed date for issuing the call for bids for the first round offunds will almost inevitably put back the timetable for submissions.For instance, it will be very difficult to maintain the timetable ofsubmitting bids for training projects in February, to be followed bydecisions in March (Screen Finance 8:23).The January 22 meeting is also due to discuss the rules and regulationsfor the governing of the Committee itself.The Committee has been strengthened according to EC ``commitology''lore, improving its role from a purely advisory one to something with afew more teeth.  The result is that the Committee can advise on moredecisions, and has to be consulted each time that a project is inexcess of the budgetary ceilings laid down by the Council of Ministers-- Ecu200,000 for training, Ecu300,000 for development, and Ecu500,000for distribution (Screen Finance 8:22).If the Committee and the Commission disagree on a matter of policy, theCouncil of Ministers will be informed.  In such an event, theCommission must defer taking action on the point for two months.  TheCouncil can then decide on a different course, should it disagree withthe Commission's position.IO tendersThe EC documents say that contracts for the four IOs -- covering theareas of training, development, distribution and management/finance --will be awarded for an initial year, which will then be extendable onan annual basis to take the total to a maximum of five years.  At thebeginning of each contract, the IOs will be paid 30 per cent of theyear's forecast expenditure.  Actual costs will be reimbursed on aquarterly basis.Tender proposals will have to address every aspect of the Commission'sdesires for each specific IO.  Any proposal that does not will berejected.In addition, the Commission published the implementation decisions ofthe Council of Ministers which describe the events which led to theestablishment of each programme, the aims of the programmes, thepercentage of funding they can contribute to projects they support, andthe role of the Media II Committee in each initiative.  The plans covera five-year span from January 1 1996 to December 31 2000.Distribution and developmentThe distribution and development programme will have a combined five-year budget of Ecu265 million.  It will have two separate IOs.  Tendersfor these IO contracts will be judged on the quality of the workschedule put forward, the tenderer's specific expertise in the areas ofaudiovisual development and distribution, the ability to respondquickly to the Commission, and financial conditions.Beneficiaries under this scheme must supply 50 per cent of theirproject funding themselves.The Commission estimates that the distribution and development IOs willgenerate the following number of contracts per year:Theatrical distribution      225Video publishing              50Television broadcasting       50Promotion/market access       20Total contracts              345The distribution and development IOs will have two calls for proposalseach year, and two selection jury meetings.The distribution IO should be designed to strengthen European cinemaand video distribution by improving networking, encouraging thetransnational distribution of European film product, and promoting theworldwide circulation of European television programming.  It shouldfocus on video publishing, television broadcasting and supportingnetworks of cinema theatres programming European films.  In additionthe distribution programme is geared toward active support oflinguistic diversity in the audiovisual sector as well as the promotionof independent European production.In the development area, the aim is to offer financial and technicalassistance to the development of production projects.  The developmentmandate specifically mentions the promotion of animation via newtechnology.  The development IO is intended to provide support forproduction projects, the development of European production companies,and the creation of industrial platforms in new technologies, animationand the enhancement of the audiovisual heritage.Media training programmeThe training programme will have a five-year budget of Ecu45 million.Its mandate is to give audiovisual industry professionals the skillsthey need to ``manage projects and businesses that make a real impacton the market.''  The idea is for the training part of the programme tosupport professional training in the areas of economic and commercialmanagement and new technologies in two ways.  The first involves long-term post-graduate courses as well as training courses for trainers.The second involves shorter-term training modules for the continuingeducation of industry professionals.The Commission hopes that the training network fostered by thisinitiative will create a forum for the exchange of all kinds of ideasthat will help the European audiovisual sector to stay competitive inthe global marketplace. Recipients of funding under the training schemewill have to put up 50 per cent of their budget themselves, or 25 percent in very special (and as yet unspecified) cases.The Commission estimates that the training IO will make two calls forproposals each year and have two selection jury meetings.  It isanticipated that the training IO will generate 80 contracts per year.Management IOThe management IO will be a Brussels-based organisation which willassist in the management and financial planning for Media II as awhole.It is still a somewhat controversial topic, as it is not clear whatsort of jurisdiction, if any, the management IO will have over theother IOs.Overall IO dutiesThe following is a general list of how the Commission views the dutiesof the various IOs:General tasks:1. Advice on measures to be taken2. Processing of project submissions3. Setting up and operation of a database4. Setting up an information, publication and distribution system5.

The DNH said thatamendments passed by the committee went against a ``politicalagreement'' between the member states to stick with the existingwording.However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible forthe wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, willget a further chance to quash the changes.The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw outthe controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively onthe basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other stateshave used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement. They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainmentprogramming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several othercontroversial amendments, including one which would have bannedadvertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and anotherwhich would have required a health warning before advertisements foralcoholic drinks on television.The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament onFebruary 12.  But the committee has still not finished going throughthe 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be consideredat a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51amendments.The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments beforesending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  Thecouncil will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' onthe amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval bythe parliament.The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has beenthe one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After manyarguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should bescrapped completely, and France, which believes they should betightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of lastyear, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendmentunder which certain light-entertainment programmes would not counttowards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would notbe eligible.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by theseshows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and filmsto contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainmentchannels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talkshows.A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soapoperas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears ofsome UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these wouldstill count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council andthe parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that therewould ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment whichswitches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving thebroadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving countryjurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries withjurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken forgranted that the parliament will accept what the committee hasproposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the councilof ministers.The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope ofthe directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-demand.  It said that these services should properly be consideredseparately under telecoms legislation.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996NOVEMBER ADMISSIONS FALL BY 5.2 PER CENTUK cinema admissions for the whole of 1995 now seem set to reach atotal about nine per cent below the record figure returned in 1994,which saw admissions rise by 9.7 per cent in comparison with 1993.According to figures from the Cinema Advertising Association (CAA),November admissions to cinemas taking advertising totalled 8,498,275, afall of 5.2 per cent on the record figure of 8,960,554 admissionsrecorded for November a year ago (Screen Finance 8:1), but ahead of theNovember 1993 figure of 7,619,875 (Screen Finance 7:1).Admissions to cinemas not taking advertising -- the National FilmTheatre and about half the British Film Institute-supported RegionalFilm Theatres -- added about another 85,000 to take the all-cinemastotal for November to around 8.6 million admissions.Average weekly admissions for November were 1.98 million, among thelowest figures for 1995, but a strong performance for the month whencompared to other November results, coming in second only to lastyear's November weekly average of 2.09 million.The total number of visitors to CAA-monitored advertising cinemas inthe first 11 months of the year was 104,244,582, down 9.8 per cent onthe comparable figure of 115,540,746 for November 1994 (Screen Finance8:1), and only 352,637 admissions ahead of the corresponding 1993figure of 103,891,945.According to Screen Finance estimates, admissions to non-advertisingcinemas add another 1.08 million to take the end-November total for1995 to approximately 106 million.The top-grossing film of November was Goldeneye, the first Bond film insix years, which opened on November 24, and took #5,554,527 in itsfirst week.  It was followed by Crimson Tide, which opened on November3 and took #4,221,056 for the month.  Other strong performers inNovember were Disney's Pocahontas (with #2.3 million), the UK/USA co-production French Kiss (with #1.8 million) and To Die For (with #1.5million).End-1995 resultsAccording to Catherine Booth-Clibborn of the CAA, December 1995admissions are expected to top the 1994 result for the month, thanks toseveral strong performers at the box office.UIP's Goldeneye has continued to perform well at the box office, takingover #9.2 million during December, and taking third place in the listof top box office performers for the year with #14,785,676, just behindBatman Forever and Casper.Other strong box offices performers were Babe, The Santa Clause, andAce Ventura -- When Nature Calls, which took #3.2 million in its firstweek.If the December 1995 admissions figure does indeed exceed that for thesame month in 1994, this would imply a total of about 8 million,bringing the end-of-year total to about 112.3 million for advertisingcinemas.  Given the Screen Finance estimate of approximately 1.2million admission for 1995 for non-advertising cinemas, this would takethe end-of-year total to about 113.5 million, only 8.6-per-cent lowerthan the total admissions figure for 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996UK FILM PRODUCTIONThere was only one production start last month -- one more than lastyear.  This was the #3.1 million A Further Gesture, a UK-led co-production by CSL Films in partnership with with Samson Films ofIreland and Road Movies of Germany.This film, which went before the cameras in Dublin on December 3, isbacked by Channel Four, Pandora of Germany and Nippon Film andDevelopment (NDF) of Japan.  It is also receiving subsidies fromEurimages, the Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen and the Irish FilmBoard, and has some investment raised through Ireland's section 35 tax-incentive scheme.A Further Gesture is directed by Robert Dornhelm from a Ronan Bennettscript, and produced by Chris Curling.  It stars Stephen Rea as anescaped IRA prisoner on the run in New York, who finds himself caughtup in a plot to carry out a political assassination.  After its initialthree weeks in Dublin, the film is scheduled to continue shooting inNew York for five weeks from mid-January.Two other films started in November but were omitted from the ScreenFinance list for the month (Screen Finance 8:22).One is the latest Recorded Pictures production Blood and Wine, which isbeing directed by Bob Rafelson from a script he wrote in collaborationwith Nick Villiers, and produced by Jeremy Thomas.  It went intoproduction on November 27 in Miami, Florida.  The #18 million film isbacked by Twentieth Century Fox, which has taken English-speakingrights, and by Majestic Film and Television, which is handling sales inthe rest of the world.Blood and Wine stars Jack Nicholson, Judy Davis, Michael Caine, StephenDorff and Jennifer Lopez.  Nicholson plays a womanising wine dealerwhose weaknesses have brought him to desperate straits.  He devises theperfect crime to solve his financial problems at a stroke.The other film was Firelight, a majority UK-co-production betweenCarnival Films and Wind Dancer Productions of the USA, which beganshooting from November 27 at Pinewood, and from January 3 to mid-February in Sussex and Normandy.The #5.15 million feature is directed by William Nicholson, produced byBrian Eastman of Carnival and executive-produced by a five-person teamfrom Wind Dancer, led by Matt Williams.  It is backed by HollywoodPictures.  The film stars Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and KevinAnderson.  It tells the story of a beautiful Swiss governess and anEnglish landowner who meet in secret to fulfil the terms of a businessagreement; the encounter lasts three days, and awakens a desire thatchanges their lives for ever.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996DNH PONDERS DECISION ON EURIMAGES FUNDING ROUNDThe UK's Department of National Heritage will have to decide in thenext month whether it is prepared to amend its stance on Eurimages, theCouncil of Europe co-production fund from which it controversiallydecided to withdraw last November.The DNH, which has seen its decision come under strong criticism fromUK film-makers and other Eurimages members, has been told that it willhave to provide more money if it wants UK-linked projects to beconsidered for backing at the next funding meeting of the Eurimagesboard of management, which is scheduled for February 6 and 7.Twelve of the projects on the agenda have UK producers.  Many of themhad already submitted their applications when the DNH make its shockwithdrawal announcement on November 29 (Screen Finance 8:22).  Whilesome of these applications will be withdrawn for various reasons in thenext few weeks, half can be expected to remain on the list by the timethe meeting convenes.Eurimages has told the DNH that if it wants UK-linked projects to beeligible for this funding round, the first of five in 1996, then itwill have to provide at least one fifth of its projected subscriptionfor the year.  This would be about #450,000 at current exchange rates.Under this arrangement, the UK's active membership would end after theFebruary meeting, although according to the rules of Eurimages, itsactual membership would continue until the end of the year.But the DNH is proposing to pay only #300,000 -- representing theremainder of the money that it had allocated for Eurimages out of itsbudget for 1995-96 (the UK government operates on the year to the endof March, whereas Eurimages operates on the calendar year).So the DNH appears to be faced with a choice between finding another#150,000 to satisfy the Eurimages requirement for the February meeting,or taking back its #300,000 and leaving the UK producers high and dry.But it may be able to negotiate a compromise.The other 23 members of Eurimages say that the UK should pay the wholeof its subscription for 1996, because it has not followed the correctprocedure for withdrawing from the organisation (Screen Finance 8:23).These countries concede that they cannot actually force the UK tocomply, but say that it is likely to come under considerable diplomaticpressure if it does not do so.UK film-makers argue that the withdrawal decision should be reversedaltogether.  This view was strongly put to the national heritagesecretary Virginia Bottomley at a meeting with leading film-makersorganised by the Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact)on December 21.The meeting was attended by Lord Attenborough, chairman of the BritishScreen Advisory Council (BSAC), Simon Perry, chief executive of BritishScreen Finance, Andrew Quinn, chairman of the British Film Commission,Sir Sydney Samuelson, the British Film Commissioner, Wilf Stevenson,director of the British Film Institute, John Woodward, chief executiveof Pact, Fiona Clarke-Hackston, director of BSAC, David Norris of lawfirm Marriott Harrison, who is vice-chairman of film at Pact, SimonRelph of Skreba and Greenpoint, who is vice-chairman of film at theBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta), Steve Woolley ofScala Productions, who is a council member of Bafta, and Richard Holmesof Gruber Brothers, representing the New Producers' Alliance.The purpose of the meeting was for these UK film industryrepresentatives to express their frustration and disappointment withthe policy decision.  Having ``expressed their views forcefully'',according to one participant, the group is now awaiting Bottomley'sresponse, promised for the New Year.If Bottomley refuses to budge, the consequences for UK producers couldbe fairly dire.  Already, 11 projects have dropped a UK co-producerfrom their roster because non-members are not eligible for Eurimagesfunds, according to Barrie Ellis-Jones, the British executive secretaryof Eurimages, who has himself felt obliged to resign as a result of theDNH decision.UK executives believe that there may be some room for negotiation onthe point of how much the UK should pay for its annual subscription.``It's likely it is not just a matter of money, but a matter of thehandling of the event,''  according to Clarke-Hackston.  ``I stillbelieve DNH could go to Eurimages and say they've got a budgetaryproblem.  They would have to make it clear that the UK would stay infor a specified number of years, but I don't think the situation cannotbe resolved.''But Eurimages president Gaetano Adinolfi says that it would beimpossible to reduce the UK's annual subscription.  He says that everyyear the total Eurimages budget has grown according to the voluntaryincreases agreed to by all of its members.  Last year the UKcontributed FFr19.5 million to the total Eurimages budget of FFr160million.  Even without the UK's presence, the 1996 budget should run toabout FFr140 million, representing an increase for the remainingmembers.Adinolfi made clear his opinion of the UK move shortly after it wasannounced six weeks ago: ``Every member of the Council of Europe has afree choice of whether to be a member of the Fund or not.  However, Ihave been working in the Council for over 40 years and I do notremember anything of this kind happening before.''Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996EURO AIM TALKS DRAG ON, WITH AUDIT AND LEGAL ACTIONEuro Aim, the Media 95-backed initiative to support independentEuropean production, is still negotiating with the European Commissionin an attempt to resolve the long-running dispute over the EC's refusalto hand over the money the agency says it is owed.Euro Aim says that the EC owes it Ecu3.7 million, representing theremainder of the Commission's contribution to the agency's 1994 budgetand the whole of its contribution to the 1995 budget.Although Euro Aim reopened after Christmas on January 8 with its staffstill essentially intact, except for a few who had been employed underlimited term contracts, the organisation is weeks away from bankruptcy,according to executives.  The Commission supplies 42 per cent of EuroAim's total budget, and without its contribution, the agency has had tosuspend its attendance at any of the important television and filmmarkets where it had functioned as an umbrella organisation forindependent European producers.Euro Aim, which initiated legal action against the Commission onDecember 4, had a court hearing scheduled for December 15 (ScreenFinance 8:23).  But neither side was willing this week to comment onthe status of the court action, which is bound up in the settlementnegotiations.The talks are also linked to the outcome of the audit of Euro Aim'sbooks which the EC had demanded as a prerequisite before handing overany funds.  This audit, which was carried out by the Commission'saccountants in collaboration with an outside firm of auditors, wascompleted in the week before Christmas (Screen Finance 8:22).  Butneither side is willing to discuss the results.Although Euro Aim has not been able to attend any markets without ECfunding, it is continuing talks on a proposed joint venture to createan electronic trading system which could very well lessen theimportance of such events.  The online system would allow producers anddistributors to access real-time information concerning film andtelevision productions in development.Euro Aim is partnered in the venture by the Dutch electronics giantPhilips.  The two are seeking other collaborators after losing theirthird partner last month as a result of the EC row (Screen Finance8:22).  Executives expect within the next month to compete the businessplan for the scheme -- which envisages a three-year start up phaseduring which a commercial network of users will be brought together.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996BRITISH SCREEN PLANS NORTH-WEST SHORTS STRANDBritish Screen Finance (BSF) is furthering its commitment to a regionalfocus for its short film funding scheme with the initiation of ShortWave, a northwest-oriented strand modelled on the Prime Cuts programmewhich is already under way in Scotland.British Screen is setting up the north-west strand in partnership withGranada Television and the Merseyside-based Moving Image DevelopmentAgency (Mida).  It is intended to fund the production of six shortfilms, each of which will last twelve-and-a-half minutes and will havea budget of #30,000.The Short Wave strand, like the Scottish one, is being set up on a one-off basis, but is likely to be repeated next year.  Other regionalstrands are likely to be set up in the near future, possibly includingstrands in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south-east.The various strands are being set up to replace the Short and Curliesprogramme which BSF used to fund in partnership with Channel Four.  BSFwithdrew from this programme last year, partly because it wanted todevelop projects with a more regional edge (Screen Finance 8:4).  Italso wanted to spread its annual shorts budget -- currently running atabout #150,000 -- over more projects.  The four or five projects backedeach year under Short and Curlies had budgets of about #90,000 each.The projects backed under the new strands will have budgets of no morethan a third of this.The three partners in Short Wave are still hammering out the finaldetails of their agreement.  But Granada has pledged #60,000 to theprogramme, according to Mike Spencer, the executive in charge of thecompany's participation, leaving the remaining #120,000 or so to bedivided between the other two.  Mida will contribute money from its``Objective I'' fund, which is part-backed by the European RegionalDevelopment Fund (Screen Finance 8:15).  It will also be running thestrand's publicity programme it expects to launch later this year.Writers will be invited to submit scripts from the beginning of nextmonth, with a deadline in April.  The partners expect to start filmingover the summer.  The films will air on Granada in the autumn, mostlikely on a weekly transmission after the News at Ten,although a one-hour compilation would be another possibility.The partners will be looking for fictional scripts (comedy or drama) ofwhich some may be animations.  The films will also have a ``northwestfeel'' to them.  ``There will probably be no restrictions as to age,background or experience, says Spencer.  ``But the films will have tobe about the northwest. It would help particularly if the talent wasfrom the northwest.''  Roger Shannon, the head of Mida, says thatprojects are expected to come from northwest-based writers anddirectors.The Scottish Prime Cuts initiative, which was BSF's first regionalshort film project, also involves three partners -- BSF, ScottishTelevision and the Scottish Film Production Fund.  This scheme, whichwas set up last April,  involves six projects, each of which will lastfive minutes and will have a budget of #23,000.  These projects, whichwere chosen in October, will be shot in February and March and willsubsequently be shown on Scottish Television.The total funding for the programme is #160,000, including #140,000 forproduction and #20,000 for administration, publicity and promotion.  Ofthis total, about #60,000 was provided by the Scottish Film ProductionFund, using some of the National Lottery money it has been allocated bythe Scottish Arts Council.  The other #100,000 was divided evenlybetween BSF and Scottish Television.One of the benefits of the programme for Scotland, according toCatherine Aitken, project developer at the Scottish Film ProductionFund, is that it has brought British Screen's head of developmentSteven Cleary into the region with more frequency, thus drawing to hisattention the wealth of burgeoning Scottish talent.  ``It is a goodthing for Scotland,'' says Aitken.  ``The response to Prime Cuts andthe quality of the applications reflect what is happening in theScottish film industry.''The six projects for this year's strand were chosen from a short-listof 18 which was itself whittled down from an original list of 175applications.All of the projects had to be based in Scotland, using Scottish crews.But the themes could be universal.  Although there were no specificcriteria on gender, it has turned out that three of the six films areto be directed by women.  All of the films are dramas, and none areanimated.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996UK MULTIPLEX MARKET SET FOR NEW SURGE OF GROWTHThe UK multiplex market, which has been experiencing fairly steadyexpansion for the past three or four years, with about six newmultiplexes being opened every 12 months, could be set for a new spurtof growth if operators' current plans come to fruition.UK operators say that they are planning to open 22 new sites in 1996,with a total of 201 screens, to take the installed base to 101 siteswith 907 screens.  A further 16 sites are already planned for 1997.This would represent a growth rate that would be considerably higherthan the one enjoyed in the boom period of 1989-91, when operators werelaunching an average of 14 sites a year.The current expansion plans involve a mixture of larger multiplexes,with up to 14 screens, together with smaller multiplexes of betweenfive and eight screens, representing two distinct operator approaches.The large operators, which have plans for 15 multiplexes in 1996, witha further 11 already on the books for 1997, are concentrating on largesites.  They are attempting to reach an audience which traditionallydoes not visit cinemas regularly by including several leisureactivities in one place, so that a visit to the multiplex can becombined with a meal or even some shopping.  They also aim to expandtheir audience by covering the market more thoroughly, building inareas which do not have easy access to traditional cinemas and offeringmore variety in mainstream movies.The smaller operators are looking at smaller sites with a view toexpanding in the art market, which they see as under-exploited.  PeterBuckingham, managing director of Oasis Cinemas, thinks that the artmarket could benefit from some form of expansion, whether through theopening of smaller multiplexes or through more traditional cinemas,which would give more people access to art films.Six in 1995For the third year running, there were six multiplexes opened in the UKin 1995, four by large chains and two by smaller independents.  Thesesites represent an increase of 44 screens, to which two further screenswere added by a National Amusements expansion to an existing site.UK exhibitors and their plans for multiplexesApollo LeisureTotal sites: 16Total screens: 52Total seats: 9,521Current multiplexes:Rhyl, 5 screens, 750 seatsPlanned multiplexes:Huddersfield, 10 screens, 2,100 seats (Autumn 1996)Bangor, 5 screens, (1996/97)Gatley, 5 screens, (1996/97)Barrow, 6 screens, (1997)*Artificial EyeTotal sites: 3Total screens: 4Total seats: 1,952No multiplexes plannedCAC LeisureTotal sites: 6Total screens: 13Total seats: c4,000No multiplexes plannedCine UKNo current multiplexesPlanned multiplexes:Ashford, 10 scrs, c1,900 seats, (Autumn 96)Stevenage, 12 screens, c2,244 seats, (Autumn 1996)Wakefield, 12 scrs, c2,000 seats, (Dec 96)Wandsworth, 14 screens, c3,000 seats, (Dec 1996)Curzon CinemasTotal sites: 5Total screens: 5Total seats: 1,576No multiplexes plannedFilm NetworkTotal sites: 2Total screens: 9Total seats: 2,280Current multiplexes:Peckham, 6 screens, 1,500 seatsPlanned multiplexes:Manchester, 6 screens, 1,600 seats (1996)Metro Goldwyn MayerTotal sites: 116Total screens: 406Current multiplexes:Sites: 18Screens: 134Seats: 32,850Bedford, 6 screens, 1,571 seatsBelfast, 10 screens, 2,474 seatsBirmingham, 9 screens, 2,209 seatsBrighton, 8 screens, 2,055 seatsChester, 6 screens, 1,631 seatsEastbourne, 6 screens, 1,577 seatsGloucester, 6 screens, 1,641 seatsHarlow, 6 screens, 1,532 seatsLiverpool, 8 screens, 2,076 seatsNorthampton, 9 screens, 2,028 seatsParkhead, 7 screens, 1,936 seatsSalford Quays, 8 screens, 1,830 seatsSlough, 10 screens, 2,113 seatsSouthampton, 5 screens, 1,629 seatsStaples Corner, 6 screens, 1,582 seatsStockport, 10 screens, 1,717 seatsSwindon, 7 screens, 1,874 seatsTrocadero, 7 screens, 1,375 seatsPlanned multiplexes:Rochester, 9 scrs, 2,256 seats (end 1996)Oxford, 9 screens, 2,150 seats (1996/97)Wigan, 9 screens, 2,200 seats (1997)Aberdeen, 9 screens, 2,028 seats (1997)Newport, 9 screens, c2,000 seats (1997)Mainline PicturesTotal sites: 5Total screens: 8Total seats: 1,456No multiplexes plannedNational AmusementsTotal sites: 11Total screens: 143Total seats: 36,540Current multiplexes:Sites: 11Screens: 143Seats: 36,540Birmingham, 12 screens, 3,600 seatsBristol, 14 screens, 3,408 seatsCoventry, 14 screens, 4,440 seatsDerby, 11 screens, 2,549 seatsLeeds, 14 screens, 3,725 seatsLiverpool, 12 screens, 3,408 seatsManchester, 14 screens, 3,191 seatsNottingham, 13 screens, 3,307 seatsPeterborough, 13 screens, 3,365 seatsTeeside, 14 screens, 3,400 seatsWalsall, 12 screens, 2,070 seatsPlanned multiplexes:Coatesbridge, 14 screens, (end 1996)Reading, 14 screens, (1996/97)Newham, 14 screens, (1996/97)Oasis CinemasTotal sites: 3Total screens: 9Total seats: 1,553Current multiplexes:Brixton, 5 screens, 830 seatsAmong the large operators, Odeon Cinemas and Warner Bros Theatres eachopened two new multiplexes in 1995.

The Odeon chain opened one in HemelHempstead in August, with nine screens and 1,600 seats, and one inLincoln in November, with six screens and 1,000 seats.Among the smaller operators, Apollo Leisure opened its first multiplexin Rhyl, with five screens and 750 seats, and now has plans for atleast four more multiplexes over the next two years.  And Oasis Cinemasopened the five-screen Ritzy in Brixton, which has 830 seats and isaimed mainly at filling a gap in the art market.The other change in the multiplex landscape in 1995 was the addition oftwo screens to the National Amusements' multiplex in Coventry, takingthe number of screens to 14 and the number of seats to 4,440.  Thistype of conversion seems to be one of the main trends for the future.One further multiplex which had been planned for the end of 1995(Screen Finance 8:12), the Film Network six-screener planned as part ofthe new Nynex Arena in Manchester, has been put back to 1996.These openings take the total number of multiplexes to 79 with 706screens.  Multiplexes thus account for 10.4 per cent per cent of the762 sites in the UK and 34.3 per cent of the 2,057 screens.Future developmentsOne of the most active developers is Odeon, with seven projects on itsbooks for 1996: a five-screen project in Camden, a six-screen complexin Wrexham, an eight-screen complex in Southend, two nine-screen 2,000-seaters in Guildford and in Sunderland and a 12-screen complex plannedfor Glasgow.  These new sites will, if they all go ahead, take thenumber of Odeon multiplexes to 17 sites with 127 screens.Another interesting operator to follow in 1996 and 1997 is Warner Bros,which announced in August that it plans to build about 20 newmultiplexes in the UK, all with at least eight screens and 2,000 seats. This will involve investment of about #75 million in the London area,and a further #65 million in the rest of the UK.UK exhibitors and their plans for multiplexesOdeon CinemasTotal sites: 71Total screens: 320Total seats: c90,000Current multiplexes:Sites: 11Screens: 78Seats: 17,262Bromborough, 7 screens, 1,896 scrsCardiff, 5 screens, 1,258 seatsDundee, 6 screens, 1,600 seatsHemel Hempstead, 9 screens, 1,600 seatsHull, 10 screens, 1,850 seatsIpswich, 5 screens, 1,561 seatsLincoln, 6 screens, 1,000 seatsRomford, 8 screens, 1,897 seatsSheffield, 7 screens, 1,600 seatsStoke-on-Trent, 10 screens, 2,000 stsTaunton, 5 screens, 1,000 seatsPlanned multiplexes:Camden, 5 screens, 850 seats (1996)*Southend, 8 screens, 1,850 seats (1996)Guildford, 9 screens, 2,000 seats (1996)Glasgow, 12 screens, 2,500 seats (1996)Sunderland, 9 screens, 2,000 seats (1996)Wrexham, 6 screen, 1,200 (1996)Panton Film DistributorsTotal sites: 5Total screens: 11Total seats: 4,317No multiplexes plannedRobins CinemasTotal sites: 12Total screens: 26Planned multiplexes:Mile End, 5 screens, (1996)Camberly, 5 screens, (1997)*Basildon, 5 screens, (1997)*United Cinemas InternationalTotal sites: 26Total screens: 232Total seats: 53,818Current multiplexes:Sites: 24Screens: 225Seats: 50,613Bracknell, 10 screens, 2,160 seatsClydebank, 10 screens, 2,554 seatsDerby, 10 screens, 2,068 seatsDudley, 10 screens, 2,518 seatsE.

In accordancewith their policy to invest in smaller catchment areas, a sector whichhas not been the chosen target of other major operators, Cine-UK hasplans for four multiplexes in Ashford, Stevenage, Wakefield andWandsworth, each with between 10 and 14 screens and 1,900 and 3,000seats.  All are scheduled to open in the last quarter of 1996.United Cinemas International (UCI) has plans for two multiplexes in1996, at Surrey Quays in London and in Leeds.  Both will have ninescreens with about 2,000 seats.  These would take the UCI total at end-1996 to 26 sites and 243 screens, with an additional site planned atCrystal Palace for a long delayed nine-screen multiplex to open in 1997(Screen Finance 7:19).  UCI has also said that it is looking forsuitable sites for up to four additional projects.Another large operator with plans for 1996 is National Amusements,which is expecting to open a 14-screen development in Coatesbridge atthe end of the year, which would take its total to 12 sites and 157screens.  In addition, according to Ed Knudsen, general manager ofadvertising and publicity, the company is still developing a 14-screendevelopment in Reading and another in Newham, both scheduled for 1997.The MGM chain, which was bought last year by the Virgin Group fromCredit Lyonnais for #195 million, is also planning to expand, initiallyunder its own name, although there are suggestions that it may take onthe Virgin banner in the long run.  Virgin/MGM has announced one buildfor 1996, a nine-screen project in Rochester which will seat 2,256.This will take the number of Virgin/MGM multiplexes to 19 with 143screens.  In 1997, Virgin/MGM has plans for four nine-screenmultiplexes, in Oxford, Wigan, Aberdeen and Newport.Of the smaller independent operators, in addition to the Film Networkdevelopment in Manchester, there are plans for four Apollo Leisuremultiplexes -- one 10-screen build in Huddersfield with 2,100 seats toopen in the autumn of 1996, two five-screens in Barrow and Gately, anda six-screen conversion from a four-screen in Barrow, all expected forsome time in 1996/97.Robins Cinemas is also planning three conversions, a five-screen atMile End for 1996, and two five-screens (from three) in 1997, one inCamberley and the other in Basildon.  According to Ben Friedman,managing director, this is part of a new ``policy of rationalisation inthe sites, investing in larger sites with more screens in larger towns,rather than investing in smaller towns.''This means that by the end of 1997, independent multiplex operatorswill be running about 15 sites with 111 screens.In addition to all these projects, one other operator, American Multi-Cinemas (AMC) is expected to re-enter the UK market in the near future,having announced plans to invest in up to 20 sites with 24 screens each(Screen Finance 8:12).  AMC says that it is currently searching forsuitable sites in the UK but has not yet made any decisions on specificprojects.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996LEADING FILM COMPANIES WANT COPYRIGHT CHANGESEuropean film companies are in danger of missing out on theopportunities of the future unless copyright laws are amended to takeaccount of the digital age, according to the European Film CompaniesAlliance (Efca), a group of seven leading European media conglomerates.The group has this week been asking the European Commission -- which washolding discussions on copyright with interested parties on January 8and 9 -- to ensure the creation of a suitable legislative framework toprotect copyright, and the implementation of global rules to enforcethe rights of copyright owners.Efca argues that Europe's position in the entertainment and culturalsector will be determined by the level of copyright it grants to itsfilm companies.  It says that the USA has always had strong copyrightlaws, and that this has been a significant factor in the strength ofthe USA in the global entertainment market.The members of the group -- Bertelsmann, Chargeurs, Ciby 2000, Polygram,Rank, RCS and Sogepaq -- are concerned that the emergence of digitaltransmission methods for films and music will soon make it impossiblefor copyright owners to enforce their rights to payment for the user oftheir works.  They say that if owners' investment is to be maintained,it will be necessary to update the current legal definitions regardingbroadcasting, rental, distribution and reproduction in order to takeaccount of new digital technologies and consumer habits.Efca argues that copyright protects the expression of intellectualcreation.  ``If the creative industries are prevented from realising acommercial gain from the use of their products, they will have littleincentive to associate themselves with the information society.''  Itsays that this could cost Europe dearly in terms of jobs andinvestment.The seven members say that there are three main issues that need to beaddressed regarding the electronic transmission of music and films:* They argue that film companies should be granted the exclusive rightsto authorise or prohibit the distribution and copying of their materialon electronic networks such as the Internet.  This will enable them tocontrol the commercial usage of their productions.* They maintain that these exclusive rights are essential if theindustry is to avoid the ``damaging'' principle of compulsory licensingwhereby companies are ``forced to sell their output at pre-determinedrates''.  They believe that it is much better to leave such matters tothe market.* They say that copyright legislation can be effective only if it isproperly enforced, and that co-operation between the hardware andcreative industries will be essential in order to devise technologicalstandards for systems of protection.  Efca is calling on the Commissionto take a leading role in ensuring that this takes place, arguing thatlegislation will be required in order for any such technical protectionto be effective.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996NEW BODY CREATED TO AID MEDIA II TRAINING BIDSA new trade association has been set up by a group of Europeanaudiovisual industry professionals who share a common interest in thepossibility of proposing new independent training initiatives inresponse to calls for tender under Media II.The new body, which is known as the Trade Association for New TrainingInitiatives (Tanti), is intended to provide a method of communicatingwith the European Commission and national ministries on points ofinterest and concern regarding the aims, target groups, content andtechniques of training as well as the procedure for the award of fundsunder Media II (see separate story on page one).The association, which is a loose grouping of individuals without anyofficers, is also designed to provide a means of exchanging informationbetween members on the timing and procedures of calls for tenders,expressions of interest, bids and the evaluation and results of bids.The members of Tanti (which means numerous in Italian) are all peoplewho have taken part in training initiatives under the old MediaProgramme and are considering participating in the new one as well.They see the creation of the new body as a means of reminding the ECthat there are other people interested in offering training under MediaII apart from those involved in the existing structures.The association contains a number of members in London, includingMichael Ryan and Matthew Payne of J&M Entertainment, Katrina Wood ofMediaXChange, John Durie of Strategic Film Marketing, Julian Friedmannof Blake Friedmann, Sandy Lieberson of the National Film and TelevisionSchool and Angela Jackson of Angela Jackson Solicitor.Others include Philippe Kern of Polygram and Geoffroy de Foestraets ofCoppens van Ommeslaghe Hormans & Fauras (both in Brussels), LuigiFerrara of Studio Legale Ferrara Santamaria (Rome), Jose Antonio SuarezLozano of Suarez de la Dehesa Abogados (Madrid), Margaret O'Connor ofNorthern Arts (Newcastle), Kriton Metaxopoulos and Christine Pigaki ofA.

The 14 or so films planned for thisyear include Dead Man Walking, Farga and Portrait of a Lady.Universal will continue to release a select number of films throughGramercy including Grace of My Heart and Cold Comfort Farm.Back to Headline List CopyrightSCREEN FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996UK BOX-OFFICE HOLDS STEADY AT #381 MILLIONThe total amount taken at the UK box-office in 1995 was #381,361,499,from 305 films on release.  The result is almost exactly the same as itwas the year before, when 299 films generated revenues of #381,871,307.Given that admissions figures for the year are expected to be down byabout nine per cent (see separate story on page 5), this implies asignificant rise in average revenues per ticket.  This appears to bedue partly to an increase in prices, and partly to a relative absencein 1995 of attractive children's films.The statistics show that 186 US films were on release in the year,grossing #319,157, 478 (83.69 per cent of the total) and averaging#1,715,900 each.  Thirty two wholly-UK films were shown, earning#32,954,094 (864 per cent) at an average of #1,029,815.  Seventeen UKco-productions were on release, taking #6,881,635 (1.8 percent) at anaverage of #404,802.The figures thus continue to exhibit the distortion caused in 1994 bythe phenomenal success of the Rank/Polygram-distributed Four Weddingsand a Funeral, the most successful British film ever, which grossed #27million, helping to push the UK share up to 10.53 per cent and US sharedown to 85.63 per cent, compared with a usual level of more than 90 percent (Screen Finance 8:1).The 1995 UK figures have also been skewed by the performance of asingle film - the UIP-distributed Goldeneye, which was released onNovember 24 and had taken #14,785,676 by the end of December, or 3.88per cent of the total box-office for the year.  This made it the thirdmost popular film of 1995 after Warner Bros' Batman Forever(#20,013,560) and UIP's Caspar (#16,011,194).The rest of the figures have been affected by the surprisingly strongperformance of the two Australian films which made in into the top 40 -Muriels's Wedding (number 12 with #7,919,101) and Babe (number 18 with#6,717,643).  The overall Australian total for the year was #14,720,199(3.86 per cent).  The strong UK and Australian showings have combinedto keep the US share down.But if Goldeneye is excluded, the remaining 31 wholly UK featuresgrossed only #18,168,418, for an average of #586,078.  This reflectsthe fact that only three other UK films made it into the top 40 for theyear -- Shallow Grave (#5,078,079 and 23rd), The Madness of King George(#4,258,079 and 28th), and Jack and Sarah (#3,195,793 and 40th).No other non-US films made it into the chart.Forty other European productions were on release over the year -- 28national productions (15 from France) and 12 international co-productions (with no UK participation).  The 40 films grossed#5,196,465 (average #129,912), with the 12 co-productions taking#2,392,725 (average #199,394).The 30 releases from countries outside the USA and Europe earned#17,171,826 (average #572,394).  But without the two top-ratingAustralian films the figure would have been only #2,535,082 (average#90,539).The top distributor, as in previous years, was UIP.  Its 25 filmsgrossed #94,281,817 -- boosted by Caspar, Goldeneye and the fourth-placed Apollo 13 -- to take 25.35 per cent of the market.Next was Buena Vista, which released 32 films, more than anyone else,helping to counter the fact that its top films Pocahontas and Die HardWith a Vengeance came no higher than seventh and eighth in the chart.It took a total of #77,759,690 (20.91 per cent).In third place was Warner Bros with 24 releases and #68,047,766 (18.30per cent).  Nearly half of this came from two films -- Batman Foreverand the sixth-placed Interview With the Vampire.Fox was well behind with 17 releases and #24,654,826 (6.63 per cent).This reflected the fact that after the fifth-placed Braveheart its nextbest film was The Usual Suspects in 24th place.  Columbia Tristarsimilarly had 18 releases and #23,483,992 (6.31 per cent).  Its bestfilm was Bad Boys in 22nd place.No European company came anywhere near the top US-owned distributors.None achieved more than six per cent of the market, and much of therevenue they did get was due to a handful of films.For instance, Guild was ranked sixth, with 13 releases taking#19,394,278 (5.22 per cent).  But more than half of this was due to theninth-placed Stargate.  Similarly, Polygram (4.06 per cent) dependedheavily on Shallow Grave and Jack and Sarah, and First Independent's2.97 per cent was almost entirely reliant on the performance of Dumband Dumber.* The top film for the weekend of January 5-7 was Entertainment'sSeven, which took #2,628,821 from 300 screens over its first threedays.  This was the best opening since Goldeneye on November 24, andcontributed to a record-breaking aggregate of #7,408,828 over theperiod (more than twice the figure recorded over the pre-Christmasweekend).This result put the Brad Pitt-Morgan Freeman thriller well ahead ofWarner Bros' Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, the new Jim Carreyvehicle, which took #1,477,912 from 339 screens over its secondweekend, to take its total gross to #6,272,986.Both films overtook the surprise Christmas hit Babe, distributed byUIP, which had been at the top of the chart for the previous threeweeks.  Its most recent weekend take of #1,451,553 from 360 screenstook its total gross so far to #10,057,900.Only one UK-linked film was released in the last four weeks -- Ate deJong's All Men are Mortal, a co-production led by Sigma PictureProductions of the Netherlands in partnership with Nova Film of the UKand Rio of France.  This film stars Stephen Rea and Irene Jacob, wasreleased by Warner on January 5 and took #2,490 from three screens overits first weekend.Apart from Babe, only four other non-US films were released over theperiod.  Jean Cocteau's 1946 classic La Belle et la Bete was re-released by the BFI on December 15 and took #14,141 before ending itsrun two weeks later.  The White Balloon, the festival hit from Iraniandirector Jafar Panahi, was released by Electric on December 29 and hasso far taken #37,241.Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 1830s swashbuckler The Horseman on the Roof wasreleased by Artificial Eye on January 5 and took #49,920 from 14screens over its first three days.  Lars von Trier's The Kingdom wasreleased by the ICA on the same day and gained a weekend take of #3,717from once screen.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-3IA087-000629-B027-64http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/pb68.html 205.156.212.5 19970122042429 text/html 159028HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:21:59 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:16 GMTContent-length: 158840Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/pb68.html Sample Issue Copyright TELEVISION BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FEATURE THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 1 OF 7) (2041 words) THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 2 OF 7) (2063 words) THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 3 OF 7) (2130 words) THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 4 OF 7) (1528 words) THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 5 OF 7) (1935 words) THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 6 OF 7) (370 words) THE BUYERS' GUIDE TO PROGRAMS AT NATPE (PART 7 OF 7) (3012 words) MASS APPEAL (1941 words) RUSSIAN RATINGS (153 words) NEW NET IS WIRED TO THE MAX (AND MACS) (867 words) CABLE OPERATORS PLUG IN TO ANALOG SET-TOPS (1420 words) MORE TV NEWS, OR MORE OF THE SAME?

Chris Dziadul reportsRussia's embrace of free-market principles since the end of one-partyrule and the thawing of the cold war has not been withoutcomplications. But the well-documented political and economic crisesafflicting the country have tended to overshadow the continued growthof its tv industry.Television services in Russia, especially at a local level, areflourishing, and revenues from tv advertising - which only came intoexistence in 1990 - now exceed $500 million a year.In Moscow, viewers have a choice of 11 terrestrial channels includingORT (formerly the national broadcaster Ostankino), RTR (Russian publictelevision), 2x2 (a music and entertainment station) and NTV (thelargest independent commercial network in the country), along with theU.S.-backed microwave operator Kosmos TV. In St Petersburg the choiceis the same if not even greater thanks to the city's proximity to theNordic countries. Even some of Russia's remotest cities are now servedby local stations, and one (Nika TV in Petrozavorsk) boasts one of themost sophisticated cable networks in the country.Russia's two national publicly-owned broadcasters, ORT (Channel 1) andRTR (Channel 2), are both having to adjust to the needs of anincreasingly selective tv audience. RTR, which can be received by 92.2%of the population and almost four-fifths of the inhabitants of theformer Soviet Union - effectively 300 million people - was launched inMay 1991.RTR shows a variety of programming ranging from the highly popularVesti news bulletin (regularly watched by two-thirds of all Russianviewers) to Santa Barbara. Partly-privatized ORT, on the other hand,took over the functions of Ostankino when it was declared bankrupt inearly 1995 and covers the entire area of the former Soviet Union.While ORT is still in a transitional phase, RTR has decided to embarkon an ambitious plan to launch the country's first digital satellite-delivered tv package. A joint venture with an undisclosed UK company -Network, it will, according to deputy chairman and director of thisMarch or April. Beaming from a transponder on Intelsat 604, thechannels will reach a potential audience of 40 million "collectivecustomers" served by cable systems throughout the former Soviet Union.The start up costs for equipment alone are likely to be between $10-15be added to the package in the near future.Bunevich feels the service will introduce viewers to the idea of payingfor their programming and alleviate RTR's financial problems. Althoughthe broadcaster currently earns around 15% of its income fromadvertising, the remainder is obtained from the government, and up to75% of its total revenue is paid directly to the ministry oftelecommunications for the use of its transmission facilities. WhileRTR is likely to remain a state holding company, it will in the futureprobably undertake all of its entrepreneurial activities through agroup of daughter companies.The most successful of the privately-owned broadcasting ventures hasbeen the NTV television company. Backed by three major Moscow banks(Most-bank, Stolichny and Natsionalny Kredit), it was given officialapproval by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1993, became fully self-supporting in mid-1995 and currently - through having airtime on thenear-national Channel 4 (which it shares with 2x2) and affiliates inseven locations including St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don - reaches an estimated 102 million viewers in 168 towns and citiesin Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.NTV has built up a reputation for strong and independent newsreporting, with two of its three daily newscasts (Segodnya at 7pm and10pm) regularly achieving a 34% audience share and the midnight news(Segodnya v polnoch) peaking at 45%. Itogi, a weekly news and currentaffairs program, also scores consistently high ratings.The station in addition allocates 53% of its airtime to high-qualityfilms and each week carries eight foreign and three Russian movies,along with six hours of serial telefilms. According to AndreiGolovanov, its head of international relations and acquisitions, it hasagreements with over 30 distributors including Warner Bros, MCA, MGMand 20th Century Fox and has been the first channel in the country toair such movies as Jaws, The Deer Hunter and Silence of the Lambs.Although NTV currently acquires almost all of its programming, it hasstarted to co-produce a 30 x half-hour series of documentaries namedCriminal Russia with a U.S. company and is "also considering some otheroffers." In Golovanov's view, its success has been built on independentnews, a good selection of movies and working efficiently "without toomuch bureaucracy." For this to continue, however, it may have toincrease its Russian output as "people are becoming tired of westernprograms."It is at a regional and local level, however, that the greatestactivity in Russian broadcasting is currently taking place. There arecurrently several dozen stations (out of some 3,000 non-governmentalindependent services around the country) operating on this basis whichstarted out three to four years ago as little more than pirates buthave since matured into highly professional organisations. Theirnumbers include Skat TV (in Samara), Tomsk TV (Tomsk) and Afontovo,which operates two TV channels and a radio station in the far easterncity of Krasnoyarsk.Several of these broadcasters have teamed up to create associations,which have in turn developed into loose horizontal networks. One ofthese (the 126-member Nezavisimaya Veschatelnaya Sistema - NVS) startedoff in mid-1994 exchanging 26 minutes a week of programming includingnews, tv movies, series and soaps and has since increased this to fourhours daily. Run on a co-operative basis, it has a potential audienceof 80 million and is seen by many as a potential rival to NTV.The driving force behind such projects is Internews, an internationalnon-profit organization founded in the U.S. in 1981 which supportsindependent television in newly-emerging democracies. Its activities inthe former Soviet Union, which date back to U.S.-Soviet "space bridges"in the 1980s which brought people together face-to-face by satellite,now include the Russian-American Media Partnerships Program (RAMP) andOpen Skies.According to Grigory Libergal, Internews' programming director, OpenSkies was launched in January 1995 with aid from the Soros Foundationand provides one hour of documentaries a day free of charge to allstations willing to take part on condition that they respect copyright.Some of the programming is produced by Internews itself and the numberof stations participating in the scheme throughout the former SovietUnion has grown from 45 to over 180. During 1996 the service will berestructured to offer more specials, series and retrospectives, withairtime at weekends being increased to two 90-minute slots.Internews has also operated a news exchange scheme called Local Timesince 1993. While at first also involving broadcasters in the Ukraine,Belarus and Central Asia who have since gone on to run their ownversions, this is now a wholly Russian service which brings togethersome 60 independent stations from around the country. Most file newsreports to Internews' head office in Moscow which are then compiledinto a weekly 30-minute show including some foreign items and sent backto the stations for rebroadcasting.While some observers may be surprised at the popularity of newsprogramming in Russia, Bruce Macdonald, the chairman of Moscow-based adagency BBDO Marketing, feels the country is "in the middle of apendulum swing" and that news will "always be popular and remain so ina society that moves this fast." In his view, although it has gonethrough its "romance" with soaps (Baywatch and Dynasty have both beenhugely successful and Dallas is expected to arrive shortly), theRussian audience is still enjoying such programs as audienceparticipation shows purely for their novelty value and at the same time"yearning for something that is Russian-produced."Macdonald feels that one of the keys to the future of broadcasting inRussia is the country's newly-emerging middle class, which althoughstill small is growing rapidly. The microwave service Kosmos TV, whichoffers some 16 foreign satellite channels to 1,500 individual andinstitutional subscribers in the capital, was initially aimed atexpatriates but has recently begun to introduce more local programmingincluding a film channel in recognition of these "new Russians."Macdonald sees the launch of more national or near-national channels asa distinct possibility and expects Murdoch to eventually establish apresence in Russia - which could happen sooner rather than later ifBSkyB links up with the RTR Network. He also predicts tv ad spend -which in 1995 BBDO estimates will total $486-594 million - should riseby between 25-40% per year compared to the levels of 4-5% more commonin western Europe.However, there are some worrying trends in an industry that was rockedto the core by the murder of Vladislav Listyev, the general manager ofOstankino, a year ago. Whereas in 1994 Russian advertisers accountedfor 55% of the total, the figure fell to 30% in 1995 as restrictions ontobacco and alcohol advertising began to bite and two types ofcommercials - financial categories and pyramid schemes - completelydisappeared. "The problems lie in the belief and understanding inadvertising and investment marketing per se," Macdonald said. "WhileRussia is a very production-oriented country, consumers have until nownot been a consequence in a market which offered little if any choice."The Russian advertising industry is currently dominated by two groupswhich wholesale ad airtime (Premier SV and Video International) andseveral smaller ones including Maxima, InterVID and Ekran-TV who haveto go through them in order to serve broadcasters. While VideoInternational handles RTR, NTV and 2x2 exclusively, Premier SV jointlytakes care of the accounts of ORT, Channel 5, TV6 (a Moscow stationonce part-owned by Turner Broadcasting) and MTK with other wholesalers.Dina Kalugina, the media director of Young & Rubicam Europe, is upbeatabout the future of television advertising in the country. In heropinion 1994 was a significant year for the industry as media inflationstood at an unacceptably high level of 5-7% a month. This has sincestabilized and after the upcoming summer's presidential elections themarket is likely to be boosted by new advertisers. It will also behelped by a new advertising law which was adopted in July 1995 andspecifies, among other things, the percentage of broadcast time allowedfor commercials.Kalugina added that current primetime rates range from $12-30,000 and$19-30,000 per minute on ORT and RTR respectively, while those on suchlocal channels as 2x2 ($2,500 plus) and TV6 (up to $5,600) areconsiderably cheaper. NTV is an exception, however, for although itsrates start as low as $8,000 they shoot up to $28,000 for its weeklynews program.Kalugina also identifies a problem with programs or advertising blockswhich are pre-empted and replaced either officially or illegally bylocal stations' programming. There is lack of information specifyingwhen these cutoff points occur and advertising blocks placed in betweenprograms appear to be most at risk.Furthermore, she believes present programming trends will continue,with news still drawing large audiences and soaps such as Santa Barbara(RTR) and Marie Yelena Cassandra (2x2) being popular for a long time.Sport, on the other hand, will continue to decline in popularity withRussian viewers.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

Today a new network ain't a network unlessit's on the network, the Internet. It probably has to be on multiplecomputer networks.At least that's how you might feel after you read about CNN's newfinancial network, CNNfn. In what will probably be a model forbroadcast networks of the future, not only will CNNfn be available viathe Galaxy 1R C-Band satellite, DirecTV, Prime Star, Netlink,Superstar, Time-Warner and others, it will be wired to the max.Not content with a mere broadcast presence, CNN is bringing out"distinct but complementary content" on a number of digital networks aswell as the traditional cable and satellite venues. From launch onDecember 29, CNNfn has had its own website on the Internet.Additionally, the CNN and CNNfn website will be accessible from AT&T'snew online service, the AT&T Business Network. Last but not least,CNNfn will be part of the CNN at Work service developed by CNN andIntel.CNNfn is promising initial programming daily from 7 am to 7 pm ET. Itsprogram offerings will include coverage of the financial markets,technology and business, personal finance, Washington's impact onfinance, profiles of corporate managers and even tips on handlingstress. Interaction with the online audience (questions and answersfrom the web site) call-ins and live remotes will be a big part ofCNNfn's overall modus operandi.CNNfn has established "inter.face," a computer networked solution thatwill allow CNNfn to set up "mini studios" in the offices of financialmanagers and advisors, economists, consultants and other players in thefinancial world around the country. These camera, monitor and Compaqcomputer based teleconferencing set-ups use a proprietary modificationof Intel's Pro-share product to link sites around the country withCNNfn's New York studio.Inter.face studios in the offices of companies like Goldman-Sachs,Merrill Lynch, Ernst and Young and Lehman Brothers will allow CNNfn torespond immediately to changes in the market and get perspectives fromexperts who can be interviewed on the job.This saves them the trip to a studio for the interview and gets CNNfnthe interview faster than if they had to send out a remote truck. Theteleconferencing data, transferred over MFS Datanet's ATM network, willbe converted and broadcast out of the CNNfn studio.The CNNfn website, CNNfn.com, will be grabbing content from CNNfn'sbroadcast, plus creating additional content for the site, right in thenewsroom. The website will provide multimedia coverage of businessnews, follow the U.S. and international markets, provide personal andcorporate financial management tips, disseminate market tips and gossipand solicit comments and questions from surfers to use on air. Archivesavailable via the website will include programming information,transcripts and air schedules of CNNfn and CNN programs, corporateprofiles, a business glossary, stories from Lexis-Nexis and, of course,links to other sites.Members of the AT&T Business Network, a dial-up online service, willhave a seamless link to the CNNfn web site. They'll also have exclusivechat and message boards related to topics and stories on CNNfn.CNN at Work is CNN's video and print news service for corporations. Itsends Headline News, CNN and CNNfn video over corporate LANs to desktopPCs in the workplace. It features topic filtering, so you can have thesystem look for subjects like "oil." CNN at Work will then grab relatedstories from Time, Fortune, Lexis-Nexis and Knight Ridder FinancialNews for you. It will alert you whenever stories about oil come up onthe three CNN services and then let you display the video in real-timeor tape it for later viewing.For now, CNNfn's efforts will be focused on and deployed in the U.S.There are hopes, but not a definite time table, for expansion toelsewhere in the world.All this action puts CNN at the forefront, not only in breadth oftechnology, but in the re-purposing of content. Freelance writers havealways tried to resell the same story in different form to multiplepublishers just to survive. For years visionaries on the leading edgeof interactive television have pointed to news coverage as a primemarket. These information technologists have always seen the four hoursof background and additional data that didn't make the two-minute airedpiece as a goldmine. With interactive tv, they said, this additionalfootage could be viewed by viewers who "wanted to know more" about anygiven story. Obviously, CNN's websites and wired ventures will allow itto take advantage of this gold mine, in addition to opening up new waysto create exciting, original online content.And that's not all. Remember, CNN has an interactive media division aswell. I wouldn't be surprised to see a whole shelf of CNNfn CD-Roms inmy local computer store in the next year or so.Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTELEVISION BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CABLE OPERATORS PLUG IN TO ANALOG SET-TOPSThough high-speed PC services have displaced video-on-demand as thecable industry's hot new revenue stream, operators have not given up onanalog tv as a near-term platform for advanced, interactive services.Jean-Luc Renaud and Mitch Shapiro review an analysis from hardwaremanufacturer Scientific-Atlanta.Anaheim's Western Cable Show made it clear that cable operators andsettop decoder suppliers have begun seriously to explore a strategythat would use a new generation of "advanced" analog set-top boxes todeliver limited interactive tv capabilities using on-screen text andgraphics transmitted via the vertical blanking interval (VBI).These relatively low-cost devices will allow operators to create"virtual channels" that require neither extra bandwidth nor aninvestment in digital video compression.Among the services that can be supported by advanced analog set-topboxes are interactive viewing guides (IVGs), enhanced pay-per view(EPPV) services, interactive advertising, subscriber messaging and textand graphics-based information channels.As cable operators have come to realise that near-term revenue streamscannot justify the cost of digital set-top boxes and the othercomponents of a VOD system (such as broadband switching, servers andmodulators), many have pushed back their timetables for deployment ofdigital set-top equipment.As this occurs, advanced analog set-tops are emerging as a near-termalternative to their digital counterparts. Whereas the latter areexpected initially to cost $375-$600, depending upon theirfunctionality, the former are priced just $25-$60 above the standardanalog converters which cable operators now purchase for $110-$130 perunit.According to a paper issued by Scientific Atlanta (S-A), one of theleading suppliers of cable tv set-tops, "the installed base of advancedanalog set-top boxes in 1995 (in the U.S.) may exceed one millionunits, while digital set-tops will be less than 50,000."The paper, entitled Advanced Analog Systems: Providing Revenue-Generating Applications for Today's Network Systems, was commissionedto Probe Research's Gary Kim, described as a long-time observer of thebroadband industry.In its paper, S-A provided some estimates of the new incrementalrevenue streams that might be generated by interactive services runningon advanced analog set-top platforms.The analysis begins with a pay-per-view business model (Table 1) whichconsiders three scenarios: low (12,000 subscribers), baseline (15,000)and high (18,000). Annual operator revenues from PPV (for the averagesystem) can range from $27,000 to more than $133,000. But operators canmake more money through making PPV "more innovative."The S-A analysis considered low, baseline and high estimates for aninteractive guide business and for two versions of a "virtual channel"information service: the first funded by advertisers, the second fundedby subscriber fees.The types of content that might be delivered via virtual channelinformation services, the paper suggests, include news summaries,weather, traffic, sports, financial information, local event listings,restaurant menus/delivery, lottery results, health tips and communityevents.Scientific-Atlanta's analysis considers three combinations of IVGpenetration and pricing (Table 2). The "low" revenue model assumes 30%penetration and a monthly subscriber fee of $0.50. The figures for the"base case" and "high" estimates are 50%/$1.00 and 80%/$1.95,respectively.For all three scenarios, it is assumed that a cable operator would keep90% of IVG fees, passing on 10% to the provider of program scheduledata. Based on these assumptions, per-subscriber annual revenues in thethree scenarios are: $1.62 (low), $5.40 (base) and $16.85 (high).The advertiser-funded virtual-channel model (Table 3) is considerednext. In this model, the advertiser provides content and sponsorship.The network operator's advertising sales department sells the virtualchannel, just as it sells "local avails" now. "From the advertiser'sperspective, this is a strong vehicle for target marketing, is lessexpensive to deliver than traditional advertising and marks theadvertiser as an early adopter of technology," argues the S-A paper.The model considers three monthly prices an advertiser might pay foreach sponsored virtual channel: $500, $1,200 and $1,900. Annual per-subscriber revenues generated by a single virtual channel under thesethree assumptions are: $0.50 (low), $0.96 (base) and $1.27 (high).Estimated annual operator revenues for advertiser-funded virtualchannels can range from $5,000 to more than $22,000 per channel. Usingrates from various cable advertising sources, estimated rate structurescould range from $500 to $1,900 a month per channel.Scientific-Atlanta's model for subscription-based virtual informationchannels (Table 4) assumes subscribers are charged a monthly fee for apackage of channels and that operators pass on 10% of these fees tocontent providers.The model considers three combinations of monthly pricing andpenetration: $1.00/30% (low), $2.00/42% (base) and $3.00/60% (high).The annual per-subscriber revenues for these three scenarios are $3.24,$9.07 and $19.44, respectively.Based on S-A's analysis, a cable operator using advanced analog set-topboxes to deliver an IVG and a package of subscription-based virtualchannels, might generate incremental annual revenues ranging from $4.86to $55.73 per subscriber.This does not include any additional PPV or subscription-servicerevenues that might be generated by IVG and virtual channel promotionalmaterial.It also does not include potential revenues from direct-responseadvertising in which subscribers use their remote control to requestfollow-up mailings containing information about a product featured in atv ad. Experience with 800-number direct response ads suggestsadvertisers are willing to pay significant amounts for access to suchself-selected prospects.Estimated annual operator revenues for subscriber-based virtualchannels can range from $38,000 to more than $349,000 per package ofchannels.The S-A paper also offers the hybrid model - supported by subscribersand sponsored by advertising. The subscriber pays an o-la-carte fee forcustomized information; the advertiser charges lower advertising rates - possibly half the rate for completely advertiser-funded channels.Benefits of this hybrid model include reduction of sponsorship costsfor the advertiser, allowing smaller advertisers to participate; theability for an advertiser to reach a specific target market, forexample, subscribers who pay for sports information; the provision tosubscribers of customized information at a reasonable price; and theadvantage for network operators to relay on two revenue streams(advertiser and subscriber).Virtual channels create a new market for content providers who developapplications for virtual channels and software vendors who provideauthoring tools that facilitate building and testing applications.So, given their potential revenues and modest incremental costs, it isnot surprising that advanced analog set-top decoders are gainingincreased attention from cable operators that face capital constraintsyet are eager to explore the brave new world of interactive tv.Table 1: Pay-Per-View Business Model         Number   %            Unit         Subs Price  Oper. %Range    of subs  Penetration  Penetration  per Mo.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightTELEVISION BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MORE TV NEWS, OR MORE OF THE SAME?ABC is launching a 24-hour news channel in the U.S. to capitalize onits brand name, worldwide reporting resources and 200-plus broadcastaffiliates. NBC and Microsoft are launching a 24-hour news network for,well, the same reasons, with the added boast they will take advantageof emerging online distribution technologies.Rupert Murdoch may launch a 24-hour news channel, he too for thereasons cited by ABC and NBC, and  because CNN is too left-wing. "Wethink it's time for a truly objective news channel," the mighty mogulsaid during a speaking engagement.While the ABC, Microsoft-NBC and Murdoch networks are six months to ayear or longer in the offing, just days ago CNN launched its third newschannel, CNN Financial News (CNNfn). And NBC is already on the air withtwo info-oriented channels, CNBC and America's Talking. (NBC will, infact, drop America's Talking in favor of the new news network, MSNBCCable, thereby plugging it into 20 million homes the day it launches.)If the rest of the mystic distribution puzzle can be solved, Americanswill be flooded with news. Unfortunately, they'll drown before they'reever informed.ABC executives talk about offering their network's top-rated programs -shows like World News Tonight, Nightline and Good Morning America -along with live coverage of major breaking news stories. In otherwords, they'll chop up what they already produce, repackage it and thenadd that greatest of all-news-network fillers, pictures of any oldevent you can point a camera at.It will be CNN with the one thing CNN doesn't have, big-name news showsfronted by big-name news stars. NBC will do the same, though furtherchopping up pictures and sound and graphics into finer bits and bytesso all that content  can be downloaded from Microsoft's online service-cum-web-site-cum-cyber-offering. Ditto Murdoch, though presumably hiswill have to add in that special something that makes live shots ofpress conferences, trials and Congressional hearings less left-wing.These 24-hour wheels of news will spin and spin. Sparks will fly.Images will leap from our televisions.No doubt one of these networks will be on hand with a portable uplinkthe day war breaks out somewhere. It will be the live shot of thecentury.No doubt all of them will switch on the next time a criminal-turned-celebrity or celebrity-turned-criminal hears his verdict from the jury.It will be a defining moment in our lives.We and these networks will jump from live shot to defining moment tolive shot. Television news will finally give up any pretense that itshould, even every once in a while, explain what its cameras see orexamine what its microphones hear.And let me be clear: explaining, examining, you don't do this by askingyour reporter on the scene for twenty seconds of what she thinks, oreven sitting five or six of them down in a studio to hash things over.In the U.S., since the verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial, not one ofthe networks has attempted anything like a definitive documentary onthe problem of race in this country - only the issue that looms largestin America at the end of this, the American century. I'd expect such adocumentary to use all the story-telling technique and productionpizzazz I'm always told tv news can bring to bear on a story. Why wasthe independent low-budget film Hoop Dreams a better examination ofrace than anything any network attempted during or after the Simpsontrial?When American troops are involved in skirmishing in Bosnia, no doubtcamera lenses will spring out of the brush faster than gun barrels. Hasany network even tried to explain how the former Yugoslavia got to bethe way it is, and, then, American soldiers got to be there? This is aconflict where - at least until U.S. military involvement began -  theU.S. public didn't care what was going on. So the network newsdivisions didn't try too hard to explain it.All of us, commentators and news executives alike, have for yearsaccepted the conventional wisdom that the U.S. networks had to give upon serious documentary work. Prime-time just became too competitive towaste it on old-time habits like examining and explaining. Today, whenthe networks put current affairs in prime, the vehicle is the newsmagazine, a salacious mix of consumer scare stories, celebrity (androyalty) interviews and "investigative journalism" in which the goodguys and bad guys are clearly identified, and nothing much is learnedabout a system or plan or idea.But the broadcasting universe is changing. ABC and Microsoft-NBC, for astart, are setting up new news networks, with all that round-the-clocktime to fill. Will we get what we gave up, or will it just be more - inthis case oceans more - of the same?Copyright:  21st Century Publishing Limited.

SHUTDOWN     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting Jan. 18 was very much in doubtbecause of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight betweenAdministration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commissionpolicy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sentto commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days beforemeeting (TVD Oct 23 p5), although that deadline can be waived bycommissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCCsources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters alsowill be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because noone has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrumissues, to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interestin spectrum matters.  At that meeting, new ways to allocatespectrum were to be discussed by invited witnesses.  Commission isrequired by law to meet at least once each month and there's nowtalk that Jan. 30 session will be considered as meeting for month. However, since agency legally can't put out notices or newsreleases during budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must awaitits formal return to work, according to sources.     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been outside govt.contractors, such as maintenance, security, vending, transcriptionservices.  Martin Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, saidhe's losing $20,000 daily and has laid off all but 10 of his workforce of 45.  A few are on board because auctions generated smallamount of business, he said.  Clark said he kept his employees onpayroll during week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it2nd time.  He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses becauseexperience has shown average daily revenues of $20,000 "don'tchange" after snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employeesfor Christmas Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry,very angry about this.  Millions of people across the United Statesthat do work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack offunds, some were permitted to continue working on such things asauctions, court arguments and international matters (TVD Dec 25p4).  FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day ofshutdown, and ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess. Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec.18.  SMR auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Someauction staffers continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div.Dec. 29. revealed "7 or 8" employees were on board, along withWireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau ChiefRosalind Allen in front office.     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Dec. 28, weren't backnext day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common CarrierBureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified asessential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with MassMedia Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," saidemployee on 8th floor Dec. 29.     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leavingbuilding from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not stayinglong, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permittedto work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' stafferscontinued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in atleast one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviserto Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghousetakeover of CBS (TVD Nov 27 p3).     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be onagenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing commentshave passed while Commission has been closed, and in addition tocomments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaintsand applications once it reopens.  One lawyer said stacks ofpetitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting tobe filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCCfiling rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. RobertHoggarth said.     Meanwhile, President Clinton resumed meetings with SenateMajority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)Dec. 29 in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expectedto continue through New Year's weekend.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELEVISION DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations onbudget and telecom bills said Dec. 29 that staff-level negotiationshave rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early returnof analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources saidno deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talkscontinued at White House.  They also said that there would be "nogiveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statementcontradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), whowas reported by Reuters Dec. 28 as objecting to what he called"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there wereproblems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.     Sources said some published estimates of value of analogspectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting servicesto digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While somereports have put value as high as $70 billion, sources said figureis more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount, they said,wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and consumersconvert to new technologies before either is ready.  Negotiatorsalso rejected White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy toconsumers to help them adjust to conversion through purchase ofset-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short term to usetechnology that market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuitdevelopment of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill sources said,adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine whether ATVlicenses should be awarded and what conditions should be attached,including disposition of analog spectrum.     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" inbill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of havinghim contradict rest of Senate leadership, including CommerceCommittee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee DemocratHollings (D-S.C.), who said deal was in final form.  HouseRepublicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to makechanges, principally in sections that had been removed from billand that they wanted restored.     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal ofprovision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,provision that was in House version but not in Senate's.  Housemeasure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill alsoaimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate onregulation provision revolved around argument that there's notelling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it becommon carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separatetitles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preemptregulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working tohave clauses restored.      ACLU sent letter Dec. 22 to members of conference committee ontelecom bill urging vote against another part of Cox/Wyden/Whiteproposal, dealing with cyberporn on Internet.  ACLU urged rejectionof plan because it "will immediately damage freedom of expression,the bedrock value at the core of the First Amendment and willstructure the telecommunications industry so that free speech andprivacy are in permanent jeopardy."  Laura Murphy, dir. of ACLUWashington office, and Donald Haines, legislative counsel, listed3 objections to bill:  (1) It would "establish a big governmentcensorship regime" for Internet and on-line communications byproviding criminal penalties for what adult users can see on theirown computers and by regulating protected speech.  (2) It would setup similar "big government censorship" for TV programs.  ACLU saidV-chip would "vest the government, not parents," with control overTV set through ratings system "driven by government guidelines oncontent."  (3) It would "foster communications monopolies thatstifle diversity and free speech."     Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that would liftrestrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier licenses. Sources said there was no agreement between House and Senate onmeasure, so it was dropped because Senate language that would allowFCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S. businesses was"worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to receive conferencereport this week after returning from break.  But some senators notonly received it, but signed it, before leaving for Christmas.  Itwill be up to parliamentary experts to determine status ofconference report if lawmakers have signed, believing it to befinal version, while others say it's still open for discussion. House sources said bill isn't final until majority of confereeshave voted for it, but at same time they don't expect majorchanges.     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the workof the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement forfacilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.Bliley (R-Va.) and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by theSenate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final productshould be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetingsthis week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority LeaderArmey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to beresolved.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELEVISION DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MUST-CARRY APPEAL OPPOSED     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule formust-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have beendecided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid forquick action (TVD Dec 25 p4).  Govt. brief, signed by SolicitorGen. Drew Days, also said expedited schedule would be hardship forgovt. because of federal shutdown and holidays.  Cable interestshad hoped for quick decision on expedited treatment, but hadn'tbeen notified by Court by our deadline.     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in thiscase," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by SupremeCourt in earlier decision (TVD July 4/94 p2).  Now, govt. said,Court must evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidencesubmitted to lower court to determine whether Congress had enoughevidence to back its decision to impose must-carry.     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, NAB, INTV,APTS, PBS and CPB said in joint brief.  However, they said it took5 months for lower court to consider evidence and upholdcongressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would berequired before this Court could reverse that judgment and strikedown a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how muchthis appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Courtto decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,just quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heardthis term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmersrepeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time ifnecessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't makequick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't overfacts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also saidmajority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at allbecause one judge backed full hearing on merits.     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staffemployees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply withexpedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows thatmust-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth inchannel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry onchannel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers havemore, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry wasimposed, so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cableargument that quick decision is needed because next date forselecting between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct.,said any burden of that deadline is on broadcasters who are willingto accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision onmust-carry for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision becauseno advanced TV will be in service before Court's next term.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELEVISION DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CONTRIBUTIONS AID FIELDS     House Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.

Cited as of"nominal value" and acceptable are "baseball cap or a T-shirt,"while flowers for office "every week" from same lobbyist aren'tacceptable.  New Senate gift rules also are effective Jan. 1, butthey aren't as restrictive as those for House.     For instance, on Senate side gifts worth no more than $49.99may be accepted, with gifts valued at no more than $100 (below $10doesn't count) okay from any one source over 12-month period. Current Senate limit is $250 per year for gifts from one source. On House side, any gifts of value will be banned except from familymember or close personal friend of long standing.  House rulesdon't define "nominal value," but do list several items under thatcategory that wouldn't be acceptable, along with those that would.     In explaining new policy (House Rule 52), House Committee onStandards of Official Conduct uses such terms as "Larry Lobbyist"and "Moe Member," "Lucy Lobbyist" and "Carl Congressman," "JoeCollege" and "Roy Representative," "Connie Constituent" and "MyrnaMember."  Among "biggest changes," said memo explaining new rules,is elimination of local meal exception.  That means member orstaffer no longer will be able to accept meal at someone else'sexpense, while senators and their staffers may continue to do so. Also prohibited by House are gifts to relatives or close associatesof members.     However, meals for House members still are acceptable duringtravel or speaking engagements "in connection with officialduties."  It said members and staff "may still accept food andrefreshments of nominal value... e.g., coffee and donuts, horsd'oeuvres [liquor isn't mentioned] at a reception" and "freeattendance at a widely attended event."     Tickets to sports events, plays and musicals also areforbidden under new House rules.  As example, "Stanley Staffer" nolonger may accept tickets to hockey game offered by "LauraLobbyist."  If "Chloe Congresswoman" goes to widely attended event,she may not accept "entertainment collateral to the event," such astheatre tickets or food "not provided in a group setting." However, gifts up to $250 in value from long-time friends still maybe accepted, while gifts of more than $250 must be approved byCommittee.     Attendance at charity events (including with spouse) stillwill be exempt under new rules, but gifts of travel and lodging inconnection with such events won't.  For instance, "RonRepresentative" and his wife may accept tickets offered by"National Assn. of Do-Gooders" for its annual fund-raising dinnerbut they may not accept tickets from "MegaCorporation" thatpurchased table for same dinner.  Do-Gooders also host celebritygolf tournament in Palm Springs and if Ron Representative wants toparticipate he must pay his own transportation and lodging but mayaccept meals and waiver of entrance fee.     New rule continues to allow payment of travel by House membersand staffers to NAB conventions, for example, because "funding ofthis kind of activity is deemed reimbursement to the House and nota gift to the individual traveler."  Such free travel is limited to4 days in contiguous 48 states, 7 days (excluding travel days)elsewhere.  All privately funded travel expenses must be itemizedand made public within 30 days.     On Senate side, gifts are defined as "any item having monetaryvalue."  Annual gift restriction of $100 ($250 from personalfriends) doesn't apply to home-state products for promotionalpurposes, personal hospitality (except from lobbyists and foreignagents), political contributions, training "in the interests of theSenate," charitable fund-raisers "as long as activities are notsubstantially recreational."  Unlike House, senators and staffersmay accept travel and lodging for such events.  Senate rules alsocontain section on "special prohibitions for lobbyists and foreignagents."  Under old Senate rules, only gifts valued at $100 or morecounted toward $250 annual total permitted from single source, andspouses' and dependents' gifts were counted separately.     Unrelated to House and Senate ethics rules, on Dec. 19President Clinton signed into law first major revision of lobbyingrestrictions since 1946.  While old law applied only to lobbying ofCongress, new restrictions also affect senior Exec. Branchofficials and cover lobbying by nonprofit groups.  Said Presidentin signing bill:  "Lobbyists in the back room, secretly writing lawand looking for loopholes, do not have a place in our democracy." New law specifies that persons who spend more than 20% of theirwork time on lobbying must register.  Generally speaking, broadcastlobbyists said new law would have little or no impact on them. They already file reports 4 times annually (new law requires 2 suchreports per year), listing percent of their salaries that goestoward lobbying activities.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELEVISION DIGEST via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996     Board of CBS parent Westinghouse Electric adopted "poison     Board of CBS parent Westinghouse Electric adopted "poisonpill" plan Dec. 29 to be triggered in case of unfriendly takeoverattempt.

"Fiber trunking is justbeginning," said Jim Chiddix, senior vice president ofengineering and technology at cable multiple system operator ATC."There were only a few systems installed in 1988, a couplehundred in 1989, and we're expecting a thousand or so in 1990,"he said.     Cable operators are hoping that better picture quality andgreater system reliability will translate into happier customers--and take the heat of pending reregulation off the cableindustry.  "More than half of cable subscribers cite picturequality and reliability--and, more importantly quick response todifficulties that arise--as problems facing the cable industry,"says Nick Hamilton Piercy, vice president of engineering andtechnical services for Rogers Cable TV in Canada.  With that inmind, Piercy says Rogers' experimental system in Toronto featuresa fiber backbone ring structure that can send signals in bothdirections if service is interrupted.  "There's self-healing ifthere is a cut," he says.  In addition, the installation of asecondary ring reduces the number of subscribers served per hub.It also cuts the amount of coaxial cable (and therefore thenumber of amplifiers or power boosters) between the headend andhomes.CABLE'S FIBER CHALLENGE: ADAPTING OPTICAL DEVICES TO CATV ANALOGNEEDS     Reducing the number of devices between the signal source andsubscribers is essential to improve signal power and reducepicture noise and distortion.  But off-the-shelf laser devices(built for digital transmission) need to be adapted to the analogrequirements of cable television, says ATC's Chiddix.  Mostoptical components developed for digital modulation intelecommunications were designed for simply turning on and offhigh-speed signals, and therefore encounter difficulties whenused to transmit compressed video information in analog form.     Nonetheless, advances in distributive feedback (DFB) lasersare resulting in higher power from cable headends with lowernoise and distortion, reports Dave Robinson, director of JerroldDivision's Cableoptics.  Robinson notes that the first high-performance lasers built with cable applications in mind(manufactured by Ortel Corp.) resulted in a 3-5 dB carrier tonoise improvement in Jerrold's second-generation AM Fiber OpticsBackbone system.     Jerrold's new system can now deliver 80 channels (anincrease of 35 channels) on two fibers for 10 miles with a 56 dBcarrier to noise ratio.  Field trials will begin in April or Mayin Cablevision systems in the Northeast, with volume purchasesexpected in July, Jerrold's John Burke tells VTN.     Robinson says Jerrold will continue to take fiber "to-the-tap" (the tap is a device installed in cable feeder lines thatprovides signals to the subscriber's drop), rather than all theway into the home--at least for the next 10 years.  "Coaxial drophas one gigahertz (GHz) capability and there is a large costpenalty extending beyond the tap directly into the home," hesaid.     On the drawing board are optical amplifiers to replacecurrent devices.  Howard Westlake, research engineer at BritishTelecom Research defines optical amplifiers as "devices thatincrease the intensity of an optical signal without translatingthe signal between an optical and electrical regime."  Westlakesays advantages of optical amplifiers include their compactness,low component requirements and wide bandwidth capacity for systemupgrades for HDTV and other enhanced services.CABLE SYSTEM BANDWIDTH INCREASING, BUT THERE MAY BE POINT OFDIMINISHING RETURNS     Despite skepticism, cable operators are adamant thatconsumer appetite for more and more channels will continue,either for greater variety of programming, or for futurebandwidth-intensive services such as HDTV, video-on-demand andtwo-way interactive services.  Rogers' Piercy, for example,forecasts a rise in system channel capacity from the current 35-40 level to 58 channels by the end of 1990, 77 channels by 1993and possibly 150 channels by 1998.     With the addition of channels, cable systems have seen acorresponding evolution of bandwidth from 200 MHz to the 550 MHzsystems shown in force on the exhibit floor--and the industry istalking about a further increase to a one GHz platform.  However,one GHz systems may be 8-9 years away, says Intermedia consultantDave Large, and "it may not be as simple to make increasedbandwidth increments" as it was in the past.  For example, whilenew fiber backbone systems decrease amplifier cascades (or thenumber of amplifiers in a sequence), maintenance costs foramplifiers are not eliminated and signal leakage is stillunaffected.  Furthermore, optical amplifiers for one GHz fiber AMbackbone systems are "a long time in coming--hopefully availableby 1998," adds Bob Young, director of product marketing atJerrold.     But Large says the most daunting problem may lie in homes.While cable equipment manufacturers are doing their best toeliminate set-top converters (see story next page), consumer TVsets will not be able to tune in the ever-increasing number ofchannels unless manufacturers change their TV design.  Inaddition, home automation standards (such as the EIA's CEbus)can't handle one GHz signals.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990SOLUTIONS TO CABLE'S CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INTERFACE PROBLEM ONLYADDING CONFUSION     Several solutions have been proposed to solve the cableindustry's consumer electronics interface problem (which formillions of viewers has resulted in a mass of wires and deviceson top of TV sets and the inability to use remote controls.)  Butclose investigation of the alternatives only leads to moreconfusion, says Alex Best, senior vice president of engineeringat Cox Cable.  "The optimal conditional access device has not yetbeen invented," he said.  But trials by cable equipmentmanufacturers continue.     Alternatives include: 1) cigarette pack-sized Multiportaddressable decoders which connect directly into a Multiport plugin the back of TVs and VCRs; 2) off-premise equipment on atelephone pole or tap that serves a number of subscribers; 3) on-premise equipment placed on the side of a home that serves onesubscriber; and 4) "universal" remotes that can control a varietyof consumer products.     At best, Multiport decoders are only expected to penetrate5-15% of the 98.7 million addressable subscribers forecast for1997, says Claude Baggett, director of systems engineering atCableLabs.  (That is if the Multiport ever gets off the ground atall, since TV and VCR manufacturers are reluctant to go to theexpense of putting the plug in their products.)  A market for theMultiport will only develop if VCR manufacturers get into theact, says Baggett, since TVs have longer lives and will thereforetake longer to be replaced by consumers.  At the Western Show,Jerrold was showing its EIA Multiport Unit to gauge marketreaction.     On and off-premise devices offer numerous advantages overthe Multiport, most notably the ability to connect and disconnectwithout service calls and the transmission of "clean"(unscrambled) signals from the headend, which reduces signaldegradation.     At the Western show, Scientific-Atlanta introduced itsAddressable Interdiction system, which delivers broadband signalsto as many outlets (TVs or VCRs) as required in four subscriberhomes.  Signals for pay services are scrambled using a "jamming"technique that can encrypt up to 32 channels.  Testing of theAddressable Interdiction system is now underway at Warner CableCommunications' Williamsburg, VA system.  A total of 250 homeswill be passed by late this month, with testing lasting over ayear.  Scientific-Atlanta says the system can also be configuredin an on-premise format.     The advantage of on-premise over off-premise is that thecosts per subscriber always equals the cost per port.  (WithScientific-Atlanta's 4-port system, if one home is a non-subscriber, the port goes unused--though non-subscribers can besold pay-per-view programming).  Jerrold is now trialing itsStarport on-premise device in Tele-Communications Inc. systemsand hopes to have a prototype in production later this month.     Zenith, which is "still looking into on and off-premisetechnology," is pushing the "universal" remote concept with theintroduction of the PCC-IQ "learning" multibrand remote control,which can be programmed to operate 41 brands of TV sets, 40brands of VCRs and 50 brands of cable converters.  It can alsolearn up to 120 separate functions to control any other deviceoperated by infrared commands, such as stereos and compact disc.Shipments are expected first quarter 1990 at about $30 to cableoperators.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990FCC ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL SEE ANOTHER EXTENSION, SIMULCASTSYSTEMS GAIN FAVOR     The consensus at the Western show was that the FCC'sAdvisory Committee on Advanced Television Services, whose lifewas already extended by two years beyond its November 1989expiration date (VTN, May 15, 1989, p. 3), will need another one-to two-year extension to complete its task of recommending anadvanced television standard for the U.S.     Craig Tanner, vice president of advanced television projectsat CableLabs, says that despite the lengthy process of bringingHDTV to consumers, it's unlikely that the U.S. will follow Tele-Communication, Inc.'s recommended course of "leapfrogging" analogHDTV technology by directly implementing digital HDTV as thetechnology develops (VTN, April 3, 1989, p. 1).  "It's anattractive idea but it exists only in concept at this point," hesays.     Tanner notes that advanced TV experts are leaning toward theselection of a simulcast system that concurrently transmits oneNTSC signal and one non NTSC-compatible HDTV signal through twoseparate 6 MHz channels.  Such a system would leave the HDTVchannel free from the technological constraints of NTSC, and,eventually, spectrum devoted to original NTSC channels could beused for other applications (including more advanced versions ofHDTV).     HDTV transmission proponent North American Philips hasalready announced that it is developing a simulcast system ithopes to submit late in the testing cycle (VTN, Sept. 25, 1989,p. 3).  Also, the David Sarnoff Research Center is reportedlyworking on a simulcast system based on its two-phase augmentationACTV system.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990CICIORA: CABLE SHOULD WORK ON NTSC IMPROVEMENTS WHILE WAITING FORHDTV     Given the likelihood of delays in testing and standardsetting by the FCC, we won't see HDTV receivers in stores untilChristmas 1994.  Meanwhile, cable should concentrate onimprovements in NTSC delivery, says Walt Ciciora, vice presidentof technology for ATC and chairman of CableLabs TechnicalAdvisory Committee.  "For a long time, NTSC was so much betterthan consumer electronics could deliver, and it didn't make senseto make transmission better than what could be displayed.  Nowthe reverse is true," he said.  NTSC enhancements need to be madenot only in the receiver (such as those developed by FaroudjaLaboratories), but in the headend as well through new fiber andamplifier technologies (see page 1).     Improving NTSC technology will also prepare the industry foradvanced television.  "HDTV needs more channels, less noise, lessdistortion and reduced microreflection--the same requirements forimproved NTSC," said Ciciora.  If the cable industry takesappropriate steps to improve NTSC, "we'll be in an excellentposition to deliver HDTV long before anyone is willing to spendmoney on it".IMMINENT INVASION OF HDTV VCRs A BOGEYMAN, LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTSARE THE THREAT     Some industry observers, including CableLabs' Tanner,suspect HDTV may achieve significant penetration of homes soonerthan many predict.  A set of HDTV technologies, includingcompression, display, transmission and production, are in "astate of near readiness," and only need refinement, packaging andcost reduction for consumer acceptance, says Tanner.  "We shouldnever underestimate the ability of the Japanese to manufacture athigh volume and low cost," he says.     But an imminent invasion of Japanese HDTV VCRs will bestaved off by the "consumer electronics constraint," morecommonly known as the chicken-and-the-egg problem, contendsCiciora.  The long-term development of large screen televisionsand VCRs (or TV/VCR combinations) are the real threat to cable,since they don't confront the same signal processing problemsthat the cable industry faces.  "Over the next 10-15 years, theTV and VCR baseband path will go from four to nine to 15 to over20 MHz.  There is no need to compress, so they won't need tocompromise," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990CABLE REREGULATION--INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR TELCO ENTRY--LESSTHAN CERTAIN IN '90     Even if some type of reregulation of the cable industry isimplemented this year, any bill from Congress is unlikely toinclude provisions for telco entry into the video business, saidCongressional staffers speaking at the Western show.  FCCChairman Al Sikes has already put in motion the Commission'sreview of cable that was originally scheduled to start nextOctober.  A report providing guidelines for possible reregulationis expected to be submitted to Congress by the end of July.     "There is a consensus building that telcos will be in thecable business, though only as a gateway and not allowed to ownprogramming," says Toni Cook, Majority Counsel of the SenateCommerce Committee.  "But there is no consensus as to when thatshould happen."  Though cable legislation is "inevitable," theseverity of the bill "is anything but certain," adds MinorityCounsel Terry Haines of the House Commerce Committee.  Hainessays "telco entry is an issue whose time has not come," and saysthe FCC's report--if it redefines competition or takes othersignificant moves that assuage the concerns of Congress members--could "take a lot of air out of the legislative balloon."     Ira Goldman, legislative assistant to Sen. Pete Wilson (R-CA) says if cable rate regulation does occur, it will take awayone of telco's main contentions for entering the video business--lower rates through increased competition.  "It may be a greatpolitical move by the cable industry to acquiesce tolegislation," he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS URGE CABLERS TO "TURN SYNDEX INTOPROFITS"     Hampering prospects for happier cable customers is theimplementation of syndication exclusivity ("syndex") regulationsbegun January 1, which requires cable operators offeringprogramming duplicated by broadcasters to replace those slotswith alternative material.  At the Western show, manufacturers ofcommercial ad insertion equipment, routing switchers andcharacter generators took the opportunity to peddle their gear asa way to "turn syndex into profits" by substituting localinformation and advertising.     No cable show would be complete without a few potshotsthrown between cable operators and telcos. In a panel session ontelco entry into cable, Tele-Communications, Inc. Senior VicePresident John Sie said the unwillingness of telcos to drop basictelephone rates was evidence of their intent to use"institutional cross subsidy" for widespread fiber installation."If [the telcos] can offer the cable industry a video dial toneon a open architecture basis, then we should be able to leasethat channel, repackage it and sell phone services at a muchcheaper price," he said.     Pioneer Communications announced the compatibility of itslaserdisc format with the Eidak system for copy-protected pay-per-view.  Pioneer was at the show pushing its pay-per-view eventlibrary system, the Pioneer LaserDisc Universal System (VTN, Dec.18, 1989, p. 8).  Though the technology "is in the works," Eidakofficials say they're not yet ready to announce the availabilityof "Eidakizing" a laserdisc as yet.  Eidak was at the show layingthe groundwork for introduction of its satellite-delivered anti-copy technology for cable systems.  The company also announcedthat CableLabs will join major MSOs TCI and Continental asminority investors in Eidak Corp.     CableLabs approved a $3.5 million 1990 operating budget atits annual meeting in Anaheim, with almost $2 million to be spenton research and development.  Scheduled R&D joint venturesinclude an effort with Jerrold's Applied Media Lab to investigateNTSC picture quality parameters, including five basic forms ofsignal degradation (noise, intermodulation, microreflections,envelope delay and phase noise) and an agreement with Scientific-Atlanta to research future headend systems.  Anixter Cable TV(Skokie, IL) introduced a dual laser version of its Laser Linkthat allows cable operators to improve system performance by 3dB.  The dual fiber system can carry 40, 60 or 80 channels, andoperators using a single Laser Link can upgrade to the dualconfiguration with a simple plug-in module.Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990MANUFACTURERS: SHORT TERM PROSPECTS FOR VIDEO BLANK TAPESTANDARDS NOT GOOD     It's highly unlikely that we'll see quality standards setfor blank video tape similar to the Type I, II or IV gradeformats used in the audio cassette business--at least untiladvanced video technologies raise consumers' qualityexpectations.  Blank tape manufacturers surveyed by our sisterpublication Video Marketing Newsletter said that 1) consumersoften can't appreciate higher tape quality given the imagequality limitations of existing TVs; 2) VCRs don't have switchesallowing the user to change the bias; and 3) even if they did,few consumers would use them, since "most consumers aren't evensure where the tracking control is on their VCR."  Consumers aregenerally indifferent to quality now, but that may be changingwith the introduction of new technologies, says Peter Dyke,national sales manager at TDK.  "As TV improves with high-definition and S-VHS, people will begin to care about grade.We've already seen an increase in high-grade tapes being sold."Back to Headline List CopyrightVIDEO TECHNOLOGY NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990KODAK DROPPING VIDEO PRESENTATION PRODUCTS, EPSON TO TAKE OVERLCD PROJECTOR     Eastman Kodak's decision to shed several subsidiaries willinclude selling off its presentation technology division anddiscontinuing the LCD-based LC500 Video Projector, a 70,400 lineresolution, full color portable projector for professionalmarkets.

The $200 system, compatible with all videocassette formatsand most television  and computer brands, consists of a pair of$50 LCD glasses and a $150 cigarette-package-sized Stereo GlassesDriver.  When the LCD glasses and VCR are plugged into theglasses driver, the TV screen emits alternating images--first forthe left eye and then for the right.  The glasses, in sequencewith the emitted images, cover the appropriate eye of the viewerat a rate of 60 times per second so the picture appears incontinual 3D.     Following its introduction this month at the ConsumerElectronics Show, 3D TV Corp. will begin marketing the systemwith distribution through video specialty stores and mail orderfirms.  Company President Michael Starks, who hopes to ship20,000 units in the first six months of 1990, believes consumeracceptance hinges on 3D software availability and development andhas therefore stockpiled a 20-title 3D library of feature films,shorts and documentaries.  The 3D cassettes will retail at about$50, but "could easily be dropped to $19.95 or sell at $79.95.It's the same pricing strategy as standard videocassettes,"Starks tells VTN.    Based on interest expressed by numerus producers who haverecently filmed in 3D or are interested in tackling 3Dproductions, Starks hopes to add about six new films to thelibrary within the next six months.  "There have been about fouror five unreleased 3D feature films made within the last year ortwo, and there's always some old 3D `Bs' being discovered insomebody's basement," he says.

According to Stanford Resources President Joseph Castellano,flat panel displays have begun to replace cathode ray tubes inportable computers, aircraft instruments and portable/table modelcolor TVs.  For example, FPDs were used in 1.46 million consumerTVs in 1989, and that number will grow to 9.9 million units in1996.  However, manufacturers must bring down the productioncosts of FPD, as well as provide full color and higher pixelcounts if they are to replace CRTs in the very large TV andcomputer segments, he says.     Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) will continue to account forthe lion's share of FPD revenues (about 57% in 1989, growing to62% in 1996).  Active matrix LCDs--which have performance levelssimilar to that of today's standard cathode ray tube (CRT)--arecurrently the focus of heavy investment in Japan.  The complexityand cost of manufacturing have hampered the production of large-screen active matrix LCDs though certain manufacturers have madeprogress (such as Sharp's 14" LCD screen, VTN, June 12, 1989, p.5).     Will flat panel displays provide the missing link--a low-cost large screen display--for the commercialization of HDTV?Television manufacturers appear to have little confidence inlarge screen FPDs, given the expansion plans for the manufactureof large size CRTs by Thomson, Matsushita, Toshiba and Sony,according to David Lachenbruch, editorial director of TV Digest.Lachenbruch says one promising large screen technology may be LCDprojection systems like the 100" model recently introduced bySharp.     Consultant Dr. Elliot Schlam, however, says flat paneldisplays are the ultimate solution for HDTV displays.

Although Senate Republicans late in day started process ofcollecting signatures of conferees, there was no such action withSenate Democrats or in House, as Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) didn'trelease report for examination and signatures.     By afternoon of Dec. 22, Senate Republicans and Democrats saidfinal arrangements had been worked out.  House Democrats weresatisfied with language, pending final examination.  But HouseRepublicans were split, with at least 3 elements in play.  One wasCommerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), who urged members to signconference report.  One was Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields(R-Tex.), who from his Houston home called lawmakers to urge themnot to sign conference report.  He had left Washington Dec. 21 tobe with his wife, who is in final stage of pregnancy.  Atleadership meeting morning of Dec. 21, Fields listed his objectionsto bill following Bliley's status report, and differencescontinued.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and ofCommerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their ownminds" about which side to take.  Industry sources said Fieldsreluctantly had decided to sign conference report.  Sources alsosaid Judiciary Committee Chmn. Hyde (R-Ill.) was asking members notto sign report.     Third and final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns(R-Fla.) pointed out.  Despite differences between Fields andBliley, no bill will be closed out without leadership approving it,Stearns said.  At time House adjourned Dec. 22, several Republicanstold us that they still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White(R-Wash.) said on leaving House chamber:  "We're still working onit."  Included on list were familiar issues of foreign ownershipand broadcast ownership.  But Reps. Oxley (R-O.) and Goodlatte(R-Va.) mentioned Internet regulation as point that should berevisited.  They told us in interviews that there was no reasonthat language preventing FCC from regulating content or prices onInternet should be removed, noting that House had passed it bylarge margin.     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, waslittle changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resultedin removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC jointmarketing of local and long distance services.  Other than that,FCC freeze on attribution rules still was out, as were provisionspreventing Commission from regulating Internet, references toforeign ownership and language to preempt states on priceregulation.  Broadcast ownership language also remained unchanged,with 35% national audience cap still in place, although FCC coulduse its residual waiver authority.  New phrase was added to clarifyJustice Department's role in determining whether RHCs should enterlong distance, saying FCC should give DoJ's opinion "substantialweight," but "such evaluation shall not have any preclusive effecton any Commission decision..."     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question inmy mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreedupon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospherespoisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [HouseRepublicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the VicePresident to announce he opposes it."  Meanwhile, Bradley Stillman,legislative dir. for Consumer Federation of America, wanted tocorrect impression from Oxley, who had said that if CFA supportedbill, it would be victory for regulators.  CFA doesn't supportbill, Stillman said.     On Dec. 21, House had offered new broadcast diversitylanguage, which brought immediate response from one networkaffiliates group -- letters to President Clinton and SenateCommerce Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) protesting proposals asanticompetitive.     House broadcast proposal would keep in place 35% national capon audience share that could be owned by one owner, but at sametime would give FCC ability to grant waiver to lift cap oncase-by-case basis if action wouldn't harm diversity orcompetition.  Factors that Commission could consider in makingdecision include:  (1) Effect of acquisition on concentration atnational level.  (2) "Actual aggregate" national audience reach inwhich one person or company would own or have "cognizableinterest."  (3) Effect on diversity in local market.  (4) Effect onpublic interest, convenience, necessity.  Language on "actualaggregate" audience is one of 2 parts of proposal put in for Fox,which argues that it should have higher than 35% ownership becauseits ratings aren't as high as networks.  Other Fox-backed provisionwould prohibit FCC from establishing or modifying any policy orrule on attribution or calculation of media ownership.  Broadcastindustry source said provision was inconsistent with rest of billbecause it would bar Commission from acting while other parts ofbill would direct FCC to take action.     Other elements of bill would allow one owner to have 2 VHFstations in single market with Commission approval under"extraordinary and compelling circumstances," while settingstandards for diversity that would call for 10 separately ownedstations in top 25 markets, 6 stations in next 75 and 3 in allother markets.  Consumer representatives criticized bill asinsufficient in protecting public interest.                      *    *    *    *    *     Wireless Cable Assn.'s contention that loophole in bill, whichit blamed on Rep. Schaefer (R-Colo.), could hurt that industry (CMDec 18 p6) is inaccurate, Schaefer's office said, saying languageon uniform pricing as applied to buildings was Senate offer, notSchaefer's.  In any case, staffer said, proposal would put burdenon competitor to make case to FCC in complaint, but if Commissionthen accepts case, cable operator would have to prove that there'sno predatory pricing by disclosing its costs of service.  Inaddition, current proposals deregulate SMATV operators by leavingthem out of definition of cable operator if system doesn't crosspublic rights-of-way.  Provisions weren't drawn up with LibertyCable situation in mind, Schaefer staffer said.  Liberty hasprotested that language could hurt it in competitive battle withTime Warner.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996JUSTICE DEPT., BROADCASTERS OPPOSE QUICK MUST-CARRY DECISION; CABLE DISAGREES     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule formust-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have beendecided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid forquick action.

Brief also saidmajority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at allbecause one judge backed full hearing on merits.     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in thiscase," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by SupremeCourt in earlier decision (CM July 4/94 p1).  Now, Court mustevaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence submitted to lowercourt to determine whether Congress had enough evidence to back itsdecision to impose must-carry.     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, said jointbrief by NAB, INTV, APTS, PBS, CPB.  However, they said it took 5months for lower court to consider evidence and upholdcongressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would berequired before this Court could reverse that judgment and strikedown a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how muchthis appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Courtto decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staffemployees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply withexpedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows thatmust-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth inchannel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry onchannel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers havemore, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry began,so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable argumentthat quick decision is needed because next date for selectingbetween must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct., said anyburden of that deadline is on broadcasters, who are willing toaccept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on must-carryfor advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because no advancedTV will enter service before Court's next term.     Cable had hoped to know by end of last week whether SupremeCourt will expedite appeal of must-carry.  NCTA, Turner Bcstg.,Time Warner, Discovery and Atlanta Interfaith Bcstrs. had filedappeal of U.S. Dist. Court decision and request for expeditedtreatment on Dec. 21.     Dist. Court used wrong definition of broadcasting in itsnarrow decision upholding must-carry, original cable brief said. Lower court said must-carry is needed to protect individualbroadcasters, rather than broadcasting industry as whole, accordingto brief, and industry as whole is healthy:  "The governmenteffectively concedes that the broadcasting system as a whole is notin economic jeopardy."  Individual stations that might not becarried without must-carry usually are little watched and incommunities with unusually high number of stations, cable said.     Must-carry is too restrictive in protecting broadcasting,cable said.  If goal is to prevent cable's anticompetitivebehavior, there are less restrictive ways than imposing must-carryon every cable operator, original brief said.  Other cablearguments:  (1) Must-carry limits speech of cable programmersbecause of channel capacity limits.  (2) Many benefits could berealized through A/B switches and leased access channels.  (3) Costof must-carry on freedom of speech is too high.  (4) "SubstantialFirst Amendment challenge" shouldn't be decided because one judgewas reluctant to require full trial.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FCC PLANS TO HOMOGENIZE CABLE AND TELCO WIRING REGULATION     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in homewiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is neededbecause of convergence of industries.  Rulemaking will deal withdemarcation between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signalleakage and quality, technical standards, customer-premisesequipment (CPE), division of state and federal responsibilities. In separate decision, FCC significantly eased limits on amount ofcable costs that can be included in cost-of-service rateproceedings.     Regulation of cable and telcos should be comparable "whereappropriate," FCC Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate"where it makes sense."  Comr. Chong said rulemaking launched Dec.15 is significant improvement over previous drafts, which she saiddidn't recognize impact of convergence of industries.  She said shewould have preferred to move demarcation point immediately, butwent along with rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly." Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitiveadvantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE marketas competitive as telephone equipment market.  Comr. Quelloexpressed concern about burden of new rules on incumbents and saidbenefits are "difficult to quantify."     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point wouldbe appropriate, acknowledging it might be different forsingle-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage andsignal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should haveto standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcoshave for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatorydistinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring astelcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-homebroadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divideregulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation oftelephony and video programming.     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should havesame rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customershave.  It also said it believes that it may be appropriate toderegulate cable equipment rates after market becomes competitiveand after transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whetherCommission has authority to deregulate equipment rates.     As result of wiring rulemaking, FCC rejected petitions forreconsideration filed by Nynex and others asking that demarcationpoint between customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multipledwelling units be moved.  Chong said demarcation point, currently12" outside subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to rivals,so it reduces likelihood of competition.  Commission did setrulemaking to determine whether persons other than individualsubscribers should be able to buy wiring in some circumstances.     In response to separate petition, Commission also amendedrules on wiring procedures when customer terminates service.  Newrules shorten period operator has to remove wiring to 7 days from30, set specific procedures for notifying ex-customer and amountcustomer should pay for wiring, and say customer automatically ownsit if operator doesn't comply.     New cost-of-service (COS) rules sharply increase amount ofintangible assets that cable operators can include in cost base tojustify rate of return.  Operators now can include only suchintangible assets as organizational costs, franchise costs,customer lists.  Impact of action was somewhat limited, however,because of volume of negotiated rate settlements that FCC hasapproved, which limits MSOs' COS filings.  Commissioners said easedrules are justified by agency's increasing knowledge ofcomplexities of cable industry.  "With age comes wisdom," Quellosaid.  Ness said first rules were set "in an incredibly tight timeframe" and FCC now can tailor them better to specific needs ofcable industry.  Fact that Congress appears likely to retain cablerate regulation "has to be read as a testament to" Cable Bureau'ssuccessful implementation, Hundt said.     Commission's earlier rules had said that cable operators couldinclude in cost base virtually none of cost of buying systemsbeyond that of tangible assets.  That decision was based onassumption that system sales prices were inflated based onexpectation of monopoly profits.  New COS rules assume that 66% ofpurchase price of systems bought before May 15, 1994, can beincluded in base.  New rules also allow operators to includevirtually all of their startup losses in cost base, rather thanjust those accumulated in first 2 years.     FCC will continue to assume current 11.25% rate of return isappropriate, but started rulemaking to determine whether operatorsshould be allowed to try to justify higher return based on debtcost and capital structure.  In other decisions, Commissiondeclared that:  (1) Systems can include cost of unused channels incost base as long as they will be used for regulated service within12 months.  (2) Assets must be depreciated over useful life, notover remaining term of franchise, because of presumption thatfranchise will be renewed.  (3) Operators can put nonregulatedcosts into single "all other" category instead of several.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SOME CABLE LEGAL WORK SLOWING AS REGULATION PASSES PEAK     End of first round of cable rate cases and industryconsolidation is causing some dislocations among cable attorneys,but most big law firms we surveyed said work merely was shiftingand some were busier than ever.  Big mergers and cable system salesare definitely affecting some lawyers.  "There has been a bigconsolidation within the industry, which means fewer entities torepresent," said Richard Wiley of Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  "Theimpact is significant."  Most top lawyers predicted that telecomreform legislation would mean even bigger wave of work.     Despite rumors that some top cable firms were laying offassociates, none we talked with said they were cutting staff, andmost said they were adding personnel.  Cole, Raywid & Braverman,which devotes 80-90% of its time to cable and has been subject ofrumors since releasing several associates, has added more staffmembers than have departed, John Cole said:  "We've been relativelybusy and we've been hiring.  We've been very busy on franchiserenewals and things like that, and the rate work continues."     Regardless, raft of cable rulemakings, rate cases, must-carryand program access complaints and other Cable Act-related issuesthat caused cable law boom starting in 1993 has tapered off.  AsFCC rationalizes rate rules and moves toward annual, instead ofquarterly, cable rate-setting, and cases become more routine,there's less legal work to be done.  There has been trend towardmoving such routine cable legal work to in-house lawyers fromoutside law firms, several attorneys said, and they indicated thatthey have been encouraging trend because of its heavy reliance onnumber-crunchers rather than legal expertise.  However, one lawyersaid reliance on in-house counsel doesn't always result in net lossof legal business because corporate lawyers often seek backup ofoutside law firms.     Some new legal staffers have different skills because ofchanging environment.  Frank Lloyd of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,Glovsky & Popeo, said his firm's last 5-6 hires have been lawyerswith common carrier backgrounds.  "The nature of cable legal workis different," he said.  "A huge proportion of the FCC work ismoving to the Common Carrier Bureau because so many of our clientswant to move into telephony."  Lloyd said cable clients also arebecoming involved in such typical common carrier cases as universalservice, interoperability, number portability, access.  "Hopefully,most cable lawyers have already been trying to learn [commoncarrier] for a few years," he said.  "We started with VDT and builton that."     First wave of cable rate cases has crested, said Seth Davidsonof Fleischman & Walsh, but that's just normal "ebb and flow" ofcable law.  He said cable lawyers remain busy with other issues,including recent cable wiring and rate rulemakings issued by FCC: "We've been busy as all get-out.  I am just swamped."  Lloyd saidrate cases are "a very narrow subset" of cable law, and manylawyers are happy to have fewer of such cases, which have becomerelatively routine:  "I like to deal with the bigger issues ofgetting my clients into new businesses."     Most other cable regulatory issues, notably must-carry andrelated points, still remain "very active," Lloyd said.  Wiley saidhis firm remains busy with programmer issues, and that's likely toget even more active as channel capacity crunch eases.     Consolidation of industry has affected some lawyers.  JohnDavis of Wiley, Rein, for example, decided to retire at leasttemporarily when clients such as Providence Journal and Sammonschose to leave cable business.  Davis, who also cited other reasonsfor retiring, said result is "same number of lawyers chasing fewerclients."     Municipal attorneys report similar industry and regulatorychanges that have forced some repositioning.  Washington lawyerPatrick Grant of Arnold & Porter said workload hasn't decreased,but most rate-setting work is over.  He said calculating annualincreases -- now allowed for inflation and external costs -- is farless complex than initial task of deciphering first and 2nd FCCrate orders.  One change among cities, Grant said, is that "there'sbeginning to develop a bit of a shift from traditional regulationto a more broad-based focus on [telecom] infrastructuredevelopment," which requires both video and telephony expertise. Aside from that, he said, there's still "slew of renewals" thatrequire legal guidance.     Eileen Huggard, exec. dir. of National Assn. ofTelecommunications Officers & Advisers (NATOA), said infrastructurework is "pretty large undertaking" that more cities are studying --often with help of legal consultants and Washington lawyers.  Inmost states, she said, cities still have greater jurisdiction overvideo than telephony side of any telecom network, so lawyers withcable expertise still are in demand.     Municipal lawyer Joe Van Eaton of Miller, Canfield, Paddock &Stone said his firm remains busy on cable matters but work directlyrelated to rate setting has slowed, partly because of perceptioncreated by FCC social contracts and mass rate settlements: "Everyone realizes that it doesn't matter [how much cabler charges]-- the FCC is going to find a way to give it back to the operator." He said industry consolidations had spurred work on franchisetransfers.     Telecom legislation could mean "a boom time for communicationslawyers for a while," Wiley said:  "There will be a tremendous netgain [in work] for the short term, though I don't know what itmeans downstream.  For the short term, the FCC will be very busy[with rulemakings], and that means lawyers will be very busy." Telecom bill "will mean another 3 years of rate regulation," Lloydagreed.  Davis said "it will be a whole new world" if legislationpasses:  "Any time there's uncertainty it breeds caution, and thatmeans work for lawyers.  The government always seems to find a wayto pick up the slack."Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DENVER LAWYER FILES CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST TCI'S LATE FEES     Denver lawyer Steven Zapiler has filed class action suitagainst TCI-owned Mile Hi Cable, alleging that company's $5"administrative fee" for late payments is "capricious,unreasonable, unconscionable, arbitrary" and has "no rationalrelationship to the presumed and/or actual damages to TCI."  Atsame time, Louisville lawyer Mark Fischer took out ad in LexingtonHerald-Leader, complete with 800 number, for prospective plaintiffsin attempt to build class action case against TCI's Telecable onlate fee issue.  Telecable also charges $5.     Cases are among those resurrecting late fee issue, which hasbeen relatively dormant in recent years because of scurrying over1992 Cable Act, as deregulatory focus of federal telecom billthreatens local control over cable rates.  One municipal attorneysaid issue has "arisen time and again over the years" and may seenew life as other regulatory issues subside.  Others said similarcases may be on horizon in Cal. and elsewhere.     Denver suit claims that plaintiffs were "financially injured"by late fee, which is attempt to "blatantly and illegally extractadditional revenue and profits from its subscribers, bysidestepping federal, state and local laws and regulations."  Amongquestions cited by Zapiler were whether TCI:  (1) Made clear orintended that fees cover liquidated damages and, if so, that itshould be $5.  (2) Made any attempt to determine or estimate actuallosses from late payments and whether they had "reasonablerelationship" to fees.  (3) Had difficulty determining relationshipbetween fees and damages.  (4) Imposed fees that were "penal innature."  However, suit contends that language of late feeagreement was "created and drafted unilaterally" by operator on"take-it-or-leave-it basis," leaving subscribers "withoutsufficient bargaining power to compel [TCI] to negotiate, bargainfor, and/or obtain terms other than those imposed by [TCI]."     Fischer said he expects to file similar class action suitagainst Telecable in early Jan. after he finishes nailing down "acouple of loose ends.  He said newspaper ad prompted "a lot ofresponse" but he hasn't decided which subscribers will becomeprincipal complainants, or whether suit will focus on state orfederal statutes.  He said both are relevant but he won't disclosespecific details until he completes filing.  However, he said statelaw is clearer than "murkier" federal statutes -- some involving1992 Cable Act that, according to Fischer, may contain languagethat could help case.     Late fees weren't addressed directly in 1992 Cable Act, partlybecause they're largely matter of state and local law.  Washingtonattorney Joe Van Eaton said most states set parameters for latefees based on administrative costs associated with delayed payment,including whether operator could have earned interest on money hadit been paid on time.  In most states, he said, "if it exceedsthat, then it's a problem."Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FCC VOTES TO PROCEED WITH DBS AUCTION THIS MONTH, SOME PARTIESRESTRICTED     FCC voted 5-0 on circulation to auction DBS slots andfrequencies reclaimed from Advanced Communications after companyfailed to meet due diligence requirements.  Comrs. Quello andBarrett voted for item but dissented in part.  Auction is scheduledfor Jan. 18 and MCI has said it intends to open bidding at $175million.  Advanced attorney Robert Corn-Revere said decision toproceed with auction was no surprise:  "It was a foregoneconclusion.  The auction was the point of cancelling Advanced'spermit."  Company has appealed decision to revoke its permit, andoral argument is set for March 19 in U.S. Appeals Court, D.C.     Rules approved by FCC include restrictions on ability ofexisting DBS operators from participating.  "Single spectrum cap"would limit companies' ability to control more that onefull-continental U.S. slot, meaning that DirecTV, EchoStar andother DBS permittees are precluded from entering auction unlessthey divest other holdings.  Similarly, if TCI-controlled Primestarwins auction for Advanced's slot at 110 degrees W, TCI-controlledTempo would have to divest interest in 119 degrees W slot.     FCC didn't preclude cable companies from participating inauction.  International Bureau Chief Scott Harris said rules weredesigned to provide balance between various concerns and to fostercompetition.  He said certain anticompetitive restrictions thatwere in notice of proposed rulemaking were removed as unnecessarybecause of limit on number of slots one company can control.  "Wefound the right balance with these rules," he said.     Electronic auctions will consist of sequential multiple roundsthat will award 2 permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degrees W andanother for 24 channels at 148 degrees W.  FCC Wireless Bureau wasgiven authority to implement and modify DBS auctions procedures. Commission said that prior method of redistributing reclaimed DBSresources (they were made available to other DBS permittees that inessence formed line) "no longer serves the public interest, andthat the use of competitive bidding would promote the rapiddeployment of DBS service and the efficient use of DBS spectrummore effectively than any other assignment method."     Critics of proceeding say best way to promote rapid deploymentof DBS would be to allow Primestar to continue with plans to deploy2 high-power satellites in 1996.  Those birds are underconstruction at Space/Systems Loral plant in Cal.  Winner ofauction has 4 years to construct and launch single satellite or 6years to construct and launch multiple satellite system.  Criticsalso said that winner of auction could delay construction for up to6 months pending decision of Appeals Court, which could voidauction results.  Industry source said reason FCC proceeded withauction and didn't wait for court was because "they want to provethat they can do it [approve auction rules] quickly."  However,Harris has said that Bureau's decision to cancel Advanced's permitwill withstand judicial scrutiny because company clearly didn'tmeet its due diligence requirements.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996DAVIC AGREES ON WORLDWIDE INTERACTIVE TV STANDARDS     Standards for interactive TV and digital set-top boxes wereapproved on Dec. 16 by Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) atmeeting in Berlin.  DAVIC also moved high-speed cable modems to toppriority for next step of process, and even agreed to specialmeeting in May to increase likelihood that modem standard will beset in June.  Approval of DAVIC 1.0 standard is "historic moment"and moves industry "much closer to a world that is betterconnected," said DAVIC council member Robert Luff,Scientific-Atlanta chief technical officer-broadband.     DAVIC 1.0 sets worldwide standard for wide range of digitalinteractive services, including video, voice and data, as well asfor set-top boxes to be used by cable, telcos, satellites.  Luffdescribed 1.0 as "core" standard that will be added to, probably asoften as every 6 months, as new technologies develop.  He said corestandards probably won't change for foreseeable future, with lateradditions to be compatible with and build upon 1.0:  "This is agiant step toward interconnectivity.  We will have this as a basefor other applications to build from, and it will create stabilityfor content developers."     DAVIC's 205 member companies should receive text of 1.0standard by 2nd week of Jan., Luff said, and it will be availableon-line soon after.  Standard then will go to ITU for what's likelyto be relatively automatic approval, which Luff said typicallywould occur in about 3 months.     "Phenomenal rise" of Internet and World Wide Web were majorissues at Berlin meeting, Luff said, causing DAVIC board to moveon-line standards to "highest priority" for next 6 months.  Goal isto have on-line connection standards approved as part of DAVIC 1.1by June, he said, in part because of fear that if there's nostandard by then, equipment makers will launch their modems anyway,which Luff said could cause "some chaos."  DAVIC meeting in May(date and location not set) was added because there wouldn't beenough meetings before June in N.Y.C. to approve on-line standardby June.     DAVIC group is working closely with CableLabs, Luff said. Cablelabs is developing cable modem standard, and he expressedconfidence that any differences between standards would beminimized.  He said goal is to allow PC users to access cable mediaservers, at least to browse if not to receive full movies, andDAVIC users to be able to access Internet:  "This is a veryimportant, do-able goal."     In addition to modem standard, DAVIC hopes 1.1 will includestandards for digital wireless cable.  It also issued call forstandards proposals for return channels for satellite, modulationschemes for LMDS, application software portability, securitysystems.  Later call for proposals includes 3-D animation andsynthetic sound, higher quality video and audio, modulation plansfor terrestrial VHF/UHF, distributed servers, high bandwidth 2-wayaudiovisual, content acquisition and production, multimedia mobilewireless.     DAVIC 1.0 includes QAM modulation for hybrid fiber/coaxialsystems, as expected (CM June 26 p3), QPSK modulation forout-of-bandwidth downstream data, upstream data and satellites,interfaces for set-tops, harmonized GeneralInstrument/Scientific-Atlanta media access control protocol,server-to-network protocol.  Immediate consensus wasn't reached onstandards for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, but Luff saidthat's expected to be distributed as annex to 1.0.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31ENTRANTS     Cal. PUC on Dec. 20 approved rules to open local telephoneloop Jan. 1 and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope tobecome local exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broadcross-section of telecom industry and at least one electricutility.  PUC said rules are "largely the same" as proposedregulations released in July (CM July 31 p8) that set broaderoutline for opening markets.  Meanwhile, PUC adopted 3-year freezeon price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and loweredproductivity factor to rate of inflation because "underlyingassumptions and data" that created current 5% factor are"obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 smalltelcos.     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, CenturyTelecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, ElectricLightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST PacificLightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG AccessServices, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI MetroAccess Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, SanFrancisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim numberportability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabledresidents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote callforwarding in separate proceeding early in 1996.  All telecomproviders will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergencyservices even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiringwritten confirmation of each sale, with description of services andprice breakdowns.     One of biggest cable players is Continental, which said itscertificate covers counties of Fresno, Kings, L.A., Madera, Orange,Riverside, San Joaquin, Sutter, Tulare, Yuba.  Company said itplans telephony tests in 3rd quarter of 1996, with full deploymentin 1997, and will use AT&T Network Systems' switches, SynchronousOptical Network (SONET) digital technology.     PUC also released its report to state legislature on howcompetition may affect universal service and proposed that basicservice include 911 access, free customer service, directoryassistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund tosubsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobbylegislature to change existing law to make change possible. Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make surethey received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, andwould base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential withincentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitivebidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schoolsto new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale oftelecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also shouldmeet same service quality standards, PUC said.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996RUMORED BELL ATLANTIC-NYNEX MERGER SEEN AS FIRST OF MANY UNDER ANEW LAW     Reported Bell Atlantic (BA)-Nynex merger discussions could befirst of several megamergers triggered by new law, leaving fewerthan half-dozen national providers, financial analysts said. Goldman, Sachs, PaineWebber, Smith Barney, UBS Securities andPrudential Securities said they expect some level of consolidationin 1996 as companies seek quick access into newly competitivemarkets.  BA and Nynex already:  (1) Have merged cellular operationinto Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile.  (2) Have joint $100-millioninvestment in CAI wireless cable operator.  (3) Own 50% of PCSPrimeco partnership with U S West and AirTouch, which apparentlyfueled speculation if not actual discussions, observers said. Others said Ameritech could be 3rd merger partner.     Companies declined comment on report in Wall St. Journal thatthey're discussing merger to create nearly $30-billion behemoth --No. 2 telecom company to AT&T -- to gain entry into long distance. "We don't comment on speculation," Nynex spokeswoman James DePeausaid.  "I can neither confirm nor deny" reports, BA spokesman EricRabe said.  Companies had $13 billion each in revenue in 1995 andproject $28 billion combined for 1996.  BA stock has climbed $8 pershare in recent weeks.  However, merger requires passage of telecomreform bill now in conference in Congress.      Industry observers said merger talks would make most sense foreast coast companies, considering traffic volume between BA region,which includes Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia, and Nynexregion, which covers N.Y. and Boston.  By merging, companies easilycould convert local network to provide long distance services incorridor without paying access charges now paid by IXCs.  Analystsestimate 40-60% of U.S. long distance calls originate or terminatein BA-Nynex region, which would give companies additional clout innegotiating access agreements with out-of-region LECs.     Rush to find partners is likely to create no more than 6behemoths providing full-service offerings, with AT&T and possiblySprint cable venture among finishers, with others less certain,said Michael Elling, senior analyst, Prudential Securities, N.Y. Paging companies already are rushing to consolidate operations,seeking national presence.  "These companies know they have to gettogether," Elling told us.  "There can't be 20 largefacilities-based companies competing for business."  He citeddevelopment of cable modems and PCS networks as technologies thatwill destabilize local loop competition in 1996.     Combined company would have revenues close to $28 billion,given $27.1 billion generated separately in 1994 and $20 billiontotal through 3rd quarter 1995.  Companies currently have imbalancein efficiency, with BA at 30 employees per 10,000 lines, comparedwith 37 at Nynex, with both aiming for 20 per 10,000, UBSSecurities said.  Companies cover 13 states from Me. to Va. andwest to W.Va., regions with more than 65 million residents, withphone penetration exceeding 95% in New England, Pa., Del. and Va. Vt. and Va. exceed 98%;  D.C. has least at 92.8%.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CABLE CONSORTIUM COMES UP SHORT AS CANADA ISSUES 2 DBS LICENSES     Canadian DBS providers ExpressVu and Power DirecTV havereceived licenses from Canadian Radio, TV & Telecom Commission(CRTC) to begin service in June.  CRTC denied license to jointventure of Shaw Communications and consortium of cable operatorsthat had applied to launch Homestar service, Canadian equivalent ofPrimestar, citing what it called "significant concerns" overwhether Homestar could implement its application.  CRTC alsoapproved 5 applications for direct-to-home (DTH) ventures.     Homestar had planned to use Primestar signal when that companyswitched to DBS, but now it's uncertain how Primestar will fare inU.S. DBS auctions by FCC Jan. 24.  As result, it's unclear whereHomestar would get its U.S. programs.  Company said it was"disappointed," had planned more than 70 video and 35 digital musicservices.  Homestar, like Primestar, would have offered rentaldishes to subscribers and would have been 80% Canadian-owned.  CRTCsaid it recognized need for DBS to be alternative to cable in ruralareas as well as competitor elsewhere, and it will open anotherround of DBS applications to cable providers no sooner than 6months after ExpressVu and Power DirecTV begin.  Shaw Pres.-COOJames Shaw said company would "actively pursue this opportunity."     Power DirecTV, owned by Power Bcstg. (80.01%) and DirecTV,plans to broadcast U.S. and Canadian programming via DirecTV andTelesat Anik E-2, respectively.  License, to expire in Aug. 2002,will be issued as soon as Power DirecTV is incorporated in Canada. Power DirecTV had wanted CRTC to levy fee on cable subscribers tohelp pay for its communications costs, but agency denied request.     CRTC approved following U.S.-based services for distributionby Power DirecTv:  A&E, BET, Comedy Central, CNBC/Financial NewsNetwork, CNN, CNN Headline News, C-SPAN, Kaleidoscope, KRMA-TV(PBS) Denver,  KTLA (Ind.)

CRTC Chmn. Keith Spicer said Commission's decision introducescompetition and provides alternative to cable.  Licenses requireuse of Canadian rather than U.S programming when similar servicesare available and would minimize ratio of U.S.-to-Canadian servicesproviders can offer.  Commission decided not to regulate DBS rates,as it does cable, saying that it believes competition between 2services would keep prices low.     CRTC also licensed 4 English-language and one French-languageDTH, pay-per-view services.  Sports/Specials and Power DirecTicketwill be distributed nationally, Home Theatre will serve WesternCanada, Viewer's Choice Eastern Canada.  Canal Premiere, Frenchservice, will be offered nationally.  CRTC licensed 4 digital payaudio services for carriage by all distribution systems, includingDTH, cable and DBS:  Allegro, DMX Canada, Galaxie, Power MusicChoice.  Commission rejected application by Power DirecTV tooperate French-language DTH pay-per-view because of concerns itwouldn't meet Bcstg. Act terms.  CRTC projected in its ruling thatservice would lose $3.7 million over 7 years and probably wouldn'tbe able to offer as many Canadian-based programs as Act mandates.Back to Headline List CopyrightWARREN'S CABLE REGULATION MONITOR via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996     Peter Cowley, FCC branch chief for multilateral & development     Peter Cowley, FCC branch chief for multilateral & developmentaffairs, also appointed senior counselor-economic & competitionpolicy, International Bureau...

It also urged PUC to scrap proposed rules'current service area definition that it said "reflect[s] aone-provider, one-technology world" and instead allow technologyand markets to define it, and exempt facilities-based entrants fromhaving to resell services "before they have an opportunity to getinto the business."  Ameritech charged that proposed rules would"violate the public interest test" by allowing entrants to bundleservice offerings and escape universal service obligations whiledenying same benefits to Ameritech, which would be forced to charge"uneconomic" wholesale interconnection rates.

Suchcomments reflect the fact that much of the informationavailable on the Net is not yet organized for access usingwell-established information retrieval techniques.Now that will change, with the introduction by LosAngeles-based Cuadra Associates of STAR/Web, an option to thecompany's powerful STAR information management and retrievalsoftware. STAR/Web is a common gateway interface (cgi-bin)program that connects STAR software to any standard orcommercial World Wide Web server (http daemon). With STAR/Web,database administrators can let users of their Web hosts orhosts on their in-house networks use common web browsers, suchas Mosaic or Netscape Navigator, to search with ease forinformation organized and structured into online databases.Provides lightning fast in-depth searchesSTAR/Web offers database administrators a simple way to set upfully interactive, fast data retrieval for users of Webbrowsers for complex searches by users who may know little ornothing about the structure and content of the data. STAR/Webis ideal for searching databases significant in size and inthe types of information catalogued. STAR sites includelibraries, museums, archives, government agencies, and otherinstitutions with catalogs of unique print and non-printcollections. When any of these organizations make their STARdatabases available on the Internet through a STAR/Web host,users will be able to find hidden treasures of photographicand film collections, as well as literature in many differentdisciplines.STAR/Web customizable assisted-search capabilities giveend-users heightened information retrieval power withouthaving to become experts in formulating good searches or toinvest in extensive training for many different databases.System administrators can design web pages for full-text orindex searches that include multiple input boxes. Indexdisplays on the assisted search screens help end-users selectapplicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriateinput boxes-with copy and paste done automatically.Administrators may pre- define applicable Boolean, proximity,and ranging operators for the assisted searches.STAR/Web sites can commercialize their online services withordering facilities (e.g., for full-text document delivery;reproductions of photographs or slides). If STAR/Web is usedin-house, "service" centers can fulfill requestsenterprise-wide for library books, journal articles, filefolders, and other materials found through searching withSTAR/Web. Web pages and input boxes used with STAR/Webmaintain their state while the user views the initial resultsof the search. When users select a hypertext link,conventional search engines immediately forget what the userentered as search text. As STAR/Web users move from searchingto displaying results, displaying linked files, or selectingterms from an index display for automatic pasting, STAR/Webtracks and remembers what the user has entered and selected-toprovide a true interactive retrieval model.Eliminates HTML programing staff and timeSTAR/Web minimizes the overhead in becoming a Web host byusing information already organized in the maindatabase-whether it is descriptions of items in a collection,or the full text of documents. And, STAR/Web takes the hassleout of designing and managing many Web pages for largecollections because it does the translation into HTMLspecifications."The system administrator uses STAR to set up one or manyassisted searches.

With fast, reliable andcost-effective communication being essential to maintaining acompetitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inabilityto communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and otheremployees can hinder growth and stifle profits.with increasing frequency, companies are finding that theyhave a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with eachother installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations andlegacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate witheach other, savings gained by effective communications cannotbe realized.At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that inthe "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporateInformation Systems (IS) group who are faced with thechallenge of integrating the various existing departmentalE-mail systems.This is a complicated task that involves making systemsinteroperate, share directory information and documents acrossdifferent platforms.This does not mean, however, that a standardized,corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mailintegration technology is widely used to connect disparatesystems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systemsmake the concept a sensible alternative.First, businesses preserve their initial investment. Thisinvestment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mailsystem packages, but includes the cost of servers needed torun the system and the training of users.These users often have limited computer experience and arereluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system afterspending hours getting accustomed to its features andcapabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort tostandardize, users are taken out of their friendly computerenvironment and placed into an unknown one.Mail integration software solves this problem by allowingusers to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mailsystems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is'switched" to make it appear as if users are communicatingwith a computer on their very same E-mail system!Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implementan enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off olderlegacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for astandard-based information system. Additional benefits dependon the particular features offered by the mail integrationsoftware they select.The technological demands of integration are extensive.Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination offeatures, benefits and reputation. Integration vendorsapproach the issue differently and the results differ. AlisaSystems has long been an industry leader in mail systemsintegration. They have a reputation for being the best in thebusiness according to high tech computer publications andother independent sources whose job it was to compareintegration systems.Alisa offers a complete mail integration package calledAlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch thatinterconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mailsystems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange ofelectronic messages, fully editable documents and binary filesbetween WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, wordprocessing documents, graphic and binary files. Mostimportantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The reallystrong point of the system is it's easy to customize howinformation is presented." said Don Cole, president of AlisaSystems.The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization andMessage Switch are the strengths of the system and separateAlisaMail from the competition.The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relationaldatabase and can be used as a corporate directory service.OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminatescomplicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common addressbook synchronized with each mail system.This "master" directory can include an address book ofcustomers, employees and vendors that contains informationsuch as their title, organization, department name, E-mail andpostal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as aphotograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized addressbook for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessedby either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/serverapplication called PeopleFinder.PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of theAlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields inthe database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinderallows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents todisplay information not accessable in the user's address book.Existing desktop client/server development tools andapplications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect toother corporate databases.Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with theOpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directorywould be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains amaster directory of all E-mail users in by requestingdirectory updates from each separate mail system. When changesare made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying ordeleting an E-mail address, the information is thentransferred to the master directory and then used to updateall the other directories.In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronizationis made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "Inessence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory anaggregate of all the users. It represents the entirepopulation and there is no distinction in where these peoplelive." said Cole.AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects thedifferent E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forwardmessage hub and also handle the conversion of message formatsas required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switchpreserves the functionality of each mail system because itstores the message in its unaltered format. The format of themessage is then converted only if the recipient mail systemrequires conversion. If the receiving mail system does notsupport all the functionality of the sender's, the MessageSwitch will preserve as much functionality as possible.Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success ofyour E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-sitesurveys to determine your specific mail integration needs andprovide a customized solution. They will even installAlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tunethe system to maximize performance in your environment."There's lots of bits and places for information to be storedin a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,"There is a technology out there that can help you run yourbusiness and save money."For more information, call Alisa Systems at (800)628-3274.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-9IA087-000629-B027-265http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/rd30.html 205.156.212.5 19970122042704 text/html 65822HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:25:04 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:13 GMTContent-length: 65635Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/rd30.html Sample Issue Copyright BATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNet JANUARY 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FUEL CELLS Aspen Developing New Electrocatalysts (267 words) Grant Funds a Catalyst/Collector (221 words) Improved Molten Carbonate Matrix (732 words) Grant for Modeling Molten Carbonate (185 words) LITHIUM-CONTAINING BATTERIES Alliant's Product First on Jupiter (239 words) Oak Ridge Design Is Licensed to Teledyne (552 words) LEAD-CONTAINING BATTERIES Chrysler, Post Office Placing Horizon Orders (412 words) INDUSTRY NEWS ERC Revenues Up on Fuel-Cell Activity (487 words) BTI Picks Malasian Licensee for RAM (385 words) Official Opening of Duracell's New HQ (331 words) Briefly Noted: (318 words) ELECTRIC VEHICLES CARB Mandate Changes to ZEV (856 words) Chrysler Introduces Epic Electric Minivan (608 words) GM Readies Market Introduction Plan (133 words) Conductive Charging Prototypes Displayed (400 words) HYBRID VEHICLES SatCon Develops Award- Winning Technology (724 words) Flywheel Powers Ford Concept Car (214 words) ZINC-CONTAINING BATTERIES Duracell and Eveready Include Charge Testers (751 words) BATTERY CHARGERS Benchmarq Files Chip Patent Suit (231 words) Dueling Charging Standards Created (517 words) CALENDAR (191 words) CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Aspen DevelopingNew ElectrocatalystsAspen Systems Inc. (184 Cedar Hill St., Marlborough, MA 01752-3017;Tel: 508/481-5058) has been awarded a $74,998 Small BusinessInnovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the Department ofEnergy (DOE) for the development of low-cost, contamination-tolerant electrocatalysts for low-temperature fuel cells.  AspensKang P. Lee says that power generation from fuel cells via reformedgaseous fuel or direct methanol oxidation is a very attractiveoption for fuel-cell vehicles or other mobile systems.  One of themajor problems with the technology, though, is the high cost andlimited supply of noble metal-based catalysts.  Such catalysts areprone to carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide poisoning.Metal carbides, such as molybdenum carbide and tungsten carbide,exhibit high catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation ofmethanol.  Such catalysts are also tolerant of carbon monoxidecontamination in the reaction zone.  The problem is that it is verydifficult to manufacture these materials with high surface areas.Expensive high-temperature reduction and carbonization techniquesor high-energy processes such as ion implantation are used toprepare high surface area metal carbides.The Aspen approach is to manufacture Group VI metal carbides usingnonconventional, proprietary surfactants in a chemical reductionprocess.  Methods for controlling the composition, morphology, andparticle size of the materials will be developed with the Phase 1SBIR grant.  The products will then be evaluated with respect tosurface area, particle size, particle morphology, sizedistribution, composition, crystallinity, the presence of impurityphases, and localized electronic energy levels at the surface.Their electrocatalytic activity of these nanoscale metal carbideswill be investigated for their effect on hydrogen and methanoloxidation.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Grant Funds aCatalyst/CollectorAn integrated catalyst/collector structure for regenerative proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is the subject of a $75,000Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from theDepartment of Energy (DOE) to Giner Inc. (14 Spring St., Waltham,MA 02154-4497; Tel: 617/899-7270).Tony LaConti says that dedicated PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, andregenerative fuel cells offer benefits to the electric vehicle (EV)industry and energy-storage programs.  The Giner researchers willconstruct a new gas-diffusion electrode/current collectioninterface (GCI) structure that they believe will yield superiorperformance, stability, and simplicity at the positive electrode ofPEM electrochemical cells.The Giner structure is based on a stabilized, proprietary metalsinter that provides PEM fuel cell catalytic activity andfacilitates bulk fluid distribution.  LaConti anticipates improvedbifunctional performance at the positive electrode and similarconstruction of both the GCI and bipolar plate, leading to reducedcomplexity of the system and increased feasibility of single-unitPEM regenerative fuel cells.The GCI structure should be applicable to dedicated fuel cells andelectrolyzers, providing improved performance, simplicity, andreliability.  Electrolyzers could supply high-pressure hydrogen tohydrogen-air PEM fuel cells.  PEM regenerative fuel-cellapplications could be particularly important in the futuredevelopment of energy storage or load leveling based on solarenergy photovoltaic conversion systems and other advanced low-costenergy concepts, e.g. wind power.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Improved MoltenCarbonate MatrixA process discovered by Katsumi Suzuki and a team of scientists atIshikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (Research Institute,Fuel Cell Development Dept., 301-15 Toyosu, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135,Japan) is used to fabricate a porous matrix. The matrix consists ofa thin-plate of lithium aluminate impregnated with alkalicarbonate.  It supports the liquid electrolyte in molten carbonatefuel cells (MCFC), which need high efficiency and minimalenvironmental pollution for in-city electric power generation.Since mechanical integrity and chemical stability of the porouselectrolyte plate (matrix) affect the reliability and life of theMCFC, Suzuki and his colleagues have applied the concept of fiberreinforcements to the plate.  The application comes in the form oflithium aluminate fibers composed of single rather thanpolycrystals.  The single crystals yield more thermally stablefibers with a high degree of chemical compatibility with moltencarbonate.  Adding the fibers to the electrolyte plate improvesthermal cycle resistance.  All of these characteristics make thefibers more effective under MCFC operating conditions.After considering various starting materials and synthesis methodsfor the lithium aluminate fibers, the scientists settled on lithiumhydroxide and alumina hydroxide.  Since the effect of a thirdcomponent, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, wasunclear, it was eliminated. Additionally, they decided to developa new fabrication method based on the low-temperature chemicalreactions in aqueous solutions rather than the reactiontemperatures higher than 400oC commonly used.In the Materials Research Society's Advances in Porous Materials[371, 297-302, 1995], Suzuki's team described how it prepared anaqueous slurry that contained 0.6% mole of lithium hydroxide and0.6% mole of alumina hydroxide.  The slurry was heated at 50oC forone hour, and then the temperature was raised to 95oC-99oC undercontrolled conditions for about 200 hours, in order to evaporatewater from the slurry.  This process yielded a straight beta-lithium aluminate fiber with a diameter of one micron and a lengthof 10 to 15 microns.   An intermediate phase (about 25 hours intothe evaporation process) produces a complex hydroxide[LiOH2Al(OH)3nH2)].Sukuzi believes that the dehydration reaction proceeds between thecomplex hydroxide the lithium hydroxide.  They found the formationof the beta-lithium aluminate to be dependent on the water-evaporation condition.  Additionally, by varying the molar ratio ofthe starting materials, at low water evaporation rates, theresearch team found varying levels of the complex hydroxidepresent, even though the morphology of the fiber stayed basicallythe same.It was discovered that using a two-stage water-evaporation processcontrolled crystal growth and changed the fiber's morphology.  Thesecond stage involved cooling the slurry to room temperature andholding it for 24 hours, once half of the residual water in it wasevaporated.  This reaction produced a beta-lithium aluminate witha larger diameter (3 microns) and longer length (30 microns) thanthe original fiber.  The researchers surmised that the reactionbetween the lithium hydroxide and the complex hydroxide caused theoriginal fiber to form the nucleus of the larger fiber.Based on the knowledge that high temperatures (above 700oC) causesbeta-lithium aluminate to transform to gamma-lithium aluminate,Suzuki et al experimented with temperatures ranging from 650oC to950oC, in order to promote transformation.  They observed atransformation at 800oC in 30 minutes and at 900oC in two minutes.At both these temperatures, the gamma-lithium aluminate kept thesame fiber geometry as the beta-lithium aluminate.To evaluate the effect that the gamma-lithium aluminate fiberreinforcements had on the MCFC electrolyte plate's performance,Suzuki et al added 10% of the fiber to an ordinary gamma-lithiumaluminate powder and dispersed the mixture in an organic solvent.This solution formed the basis of a slurry for tape casting andfabricating the electrolyte plate via the doctor blade method.They tested 20 heat and cooling cycles, at temperatures rangingfrom 350oC to 650oC, on a 10 cm square single cell that containedthe fiber-reinforced electrolyte plate.  Test conditions includedan average cell voltage of 0.75 V and a current density of 150mA/cm2, levels that matched a comparable cell without the fiber-reinforced electrolyte plate. The research team noted nosignificant gas cross-leakage during the cell testing for thegamma-lithium aluminate-reinforced plate, while the ordinary plateexhibit a 5% gas cross-leakage half way through the test cycles.The fibers retained their original form and remained stable withalkali carbonates and under MCFC test conditions.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Grant for ModelingMolten CarbonateJoseph D Fehribach, a researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute(100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2247; Tel: 617/793-5000)has received a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant tocreate mathematical models of molten carbonate fuel cells.Fehribach says that the models used to describe molten carbonatefuel cells are generally deficient in certain aspects. The aim ofthe research is to develop and study improved mathematical modelsfor electrochemical fuel cells, particularly molten carbonate fuelcells.Fehribach added that these microscale potential models will beanalyzed numerically and analytically to determine what results canbe achieved on this small scale. The equations will be used toderive consistent models in terms of species concentration. Bothtypes of models will be averaged to obtain macroscale models thatcan be fit to experimental data.A number of different averaging techniques will be considered informulating three-phase homogenized models to obtain a broadprospective on the relationship between the microscale and themacroscale. An important part of the work will be addressingquestions of interest to the fuel-cell research community andcomparing the models to experimental results.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Alliant's ProductFirst on JupiterHigh-power D-size lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries designed andproduced by Alliant Techsystems (5901 Lincoln Drive, Edina, MN5536; Tel: 612/931-5413, Fax: 612/931-5423) recently provided powerfor NASA's Galileo entry probe during its dramatic and apparentlysuccessful descent into Jupiter's atmosphere.  The probe relayeddata and digitally stored photographs prior to its on-scheduledestruction deep in Jupiter's high-pressure atmosphere.The probe was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere ofan outer planet and although they were eventually destroyed alongwith the probe, the Alliant batteries were the first batteries onJupiter.  The probe was designed and built by Hughes Space andCommunications Co., and was launched six years ago aboard the SpaceShuttle Atlantis.According to Rod Bitz, director of corporate communications, thespecially space-qualified D-sized batteries are durable enough towithstand the severe acceleration, vibration, and G forces theGalileo probe encountered as it enters the Jovian atmosphere.  Thebatteries underwent thorough pre-launch shelf-life andqualification programs, special engineering tests, and have beentested regularly throughout the six-year journey to Jupiter.In 1997, Alliant's lithium batteries again will provide power fora deep-space probe when the Cassini Saturn mission is launched onan 11-year journey.  The spacecraft will release the Huygens probeto inspect Titan, a satellite of Saturn and the only moon in thesolar system known to have an atmosphere.  Additional missions tothe outer planets, including Neptune and Pluto, are underconsideration.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Oak Ridge Design IsLicensed to TeledyneDoctors who rely on tests that monitor the brain activity of theirpatients could benefit from a new battery developed at Oak RidgeNational Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN 37830-6030) and licensed toTeledyne Electronic Technologies (TET).  The thin-film, solid-state, rechargeable lithium battery may be used to amplify brainimpulses recorded during an electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure.At present,  EEGs rely on sensors to detect the extremely low-levelelectric signals coming from the body.  The signals are thenrelayed through wires to an amplification device.  ORNL reportsthat the new batteries may be used in performing electrocardiogram(EKG) procedures and in other medical diagnostic tools.  Otherlikely applications include portable communications devices, wherethe devices could be integrated into the circuits; power sourcesfor personal hazardous gas sensors and micromachines; and backuppower sources for SRAM and DRAM memory.The new battery, says John Bates (Tel: 423/574-6280, Fax: 423/574-4143, E-mail: job@ornl.gov) of ORNL, offers many useful features,particularly in applications requiring small size.  The ORNL deviceis only 10 micrometers thick, can be manufactured in a variety ofshapes, and may be applied to virtually any solid substrate, suchas silicon, alumina, glass, and plastics.  When mounted on plasticsubstrates, the batteries are quite flexible.Experimental cells typically have areas of 0.5-2.0 cm2, but Batessays that there is no fundamental limit the on areal dimensions.The batteries have high energy densities, can be charged thousandsof times, and have a long shelf life with no measurable changeafter one year of storage.  A wide operating temperature range isanother advantage of the devices; cycle testing at ORNL has beenperformed between -20oC and +100oC.The components of the new thin-film battery, including vanadium,platinum, or nickel current collectors; a cathode; an electrolyte;a lithium anode; and a multilayer parylene/metal protectivecoating, are deposited on a substrate using standard sputtering orevaporation techniques.  The performance characteristics of thebattery are determined by the type of cathode material, its areaand thickness, and the operating temperature.  The cathodematerial, such as crystalline LiCoO2 or amorphous or crystallineLiMn2O4 or V2O5, and the deposition and processing methods used toprepare the cathode film determine the operating voltage range,capacity, specific power, and specific energy.Batteries with crystalline LiCoO2 cathodes, deposited by sputteringand then annealed in oxygen at 600oC-700oC, have high dischargerates with good cathode utilization and small capacity loss withcycling.  Their disadvantage is the high annealing temperaturerequired to form the crystalline phase.  Crystalline LiMn2O4cathodes are deposited by electron-beam evaporation or sputteringand then annealed at 700oC-800oC.  They feature high discharge ratesof up to several milliamps per square centimeter (mA/cm2) at 25oC,but also must be annealed to achieve the crystalline form.Because the batteries are rechargeable, it is not necessary tosupply the power and energy required by a single duty cycle, i.e.the conditions of current and operating time required by a devicebefore recharge can occur.  This means that the applications forwhich recharging is an option, the batteries can be much smallerthan primary, or nonrechargable, cells designed for the sameapplication.  The device, which contains fewer toxic materials thanmost other batteries, is the focus of a cooperative research anddevelopment agreement (CRADA) involving ORNL and TET.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Chrysler, Post OfficePlacing Horizon OrdersElectrosource Inc.

Michael G.  Semmens, chairman,president, and CEO of Electrosource, says the order could result inadditional orders exceeding $80 million cumulatively over the nextthree years.  The order provides cost and delivery terms forbattery packs that Chrysler will use in its new EPIC electricminivan.Semmens added, "The production purchase order provides the basisfor us to ramp up our manufacturing capacity to meet Chrysler'sproduction schedules." The order was announced at the EV andInfrastructure Conference sponsored by the Electric VehicleAssociation of the Americas and co-sponsored by The Electric PowerResearch Institute (EPRI), an Electrosource strategic partner.Chrysler plans to issue build orders to Electrosource againstproduction and delivery terms described in the PPO."Electrosource has met all of the technical requirements to qualifythe advanced Horizon battery for use in our electric minivans,"said Robert Feldmaier, Chrysler executive engineer in charge of theelectric minivan program.  "We are on schedule with our program todevelop and produce the electric minivan."Electrosource has received notice that Horizon batteries will beused in 10 U.S.  Postal Service (USPS) vehicles in two U.S.  citiesslated for evaluation of electric postal vehicles.  BatteryAutomated Transportation, International, and U.S.  Electricar eachselected Horizon batteries for use in five vehicles.Responding to the U.S.  Energy Policy Act requiring an increasingnumber of new fleet vehicles to use alternative fuels and theCalifornia mandate for zero-emission vehicles, USPS Vice Presidentfor Engineering William J.  Dowling says, "With our fleet of morethan 200,000 vehicles, it is imperative that we take a leadershiprole in demonstrating our commitment to the goals of loweremissions and energy independence.  Since postal delivery vansoperate with fixed, low-mileage daily routes that are usuallybetween 12-20 miles, they are excellent candidates for electricpropulsion."With a majority of funding for the postal vehicle conversionprogram coming from the U.S.  Department of Energy, the USPS plansto convert a total of 25 postal service vehicles in five cities toelectric propulsion systems.  After one year of field testing inthe first phase, the USPS will evaluate the data on all 25 vehiclesto determine the best system.  The second phase of the USPSconversion program could include conversions of many more mailcarrier vehicles across the nation.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996ERC Revenues Upon Fuel-Cell ActivityFuel cell and nickel-zinc battery design company Energy ResearchCorp.

BernardS.  Baker, president and CEO, says the increase in revenues was dueto fuel-cell power-plant construction and test activities andincreased work under the company's various government contracts.Net income doubled to $442,000 ($0.11 per share) compared with$220,000 ($0.06 per share) for fiscal 1994.  Net income in thefourth-quarter fiscal 1995 increased to $90,000 ($0.02 per share)compared with $37,000 ($0.01 per share).  For the fourth quarter,revenues decreased 25% to $7.8 million, compared with $10.3 millionin same quarter in the previous year.  Revenues during the quarterwere lower than last year due primarily to completion ofconstruction of the world's largest carbonate fuel-cell plant inSanta Clara, CA.  Battery activity also advanced.Baker told BET, "During 1995, we improved our patent position onour proprietary nickel-zinc battery that we are developing forvarious OEM applications such as laptop computers and otherportable devices.  We are continuing discussions with potentialpartners relative to battery opportunities."Baker also noted that the company was engaged in extensive pre-testing of its project in Santa Clara, CA, during the fourthquarter of 1995.  This activity is continuing into the firstquarter of 1996 in anticipation of plant start-up in the secondquarter.  First-quarter revenues this year are likely to be lowerbecause government contracts are operating under a continuingresolution from Congress until there is a final budget agreement.ERC has established a new Internet homepage available athttp://www.ercc.com.

The staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2%requirement in the early years of the program and to ramp up to 10%ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than 3,000vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.Manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit though 2003 for EVssold before 1998 and those equipped with advanced battery typesthat have the range and lifespan that many experts believe isneeded to make them competitive with gasoline-powered models.Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based designs,are expected to be commercially available by 2001.John Dunlap, CARB chairman, told BET, "This plan provides for asuccessful launch of commercially viable electric cars thatprotects public health and will provide new high-tech jobs inCalifornia.   This plan promotes a market-based introduction ofZEV's and will unleash the engineering and the marketing prowess ofautomakers.  We have directed our staff to develop that plan andpresent it to this board for our consideration at a public hearingno later than March 1996."The plan calls for development partnership through a Memorandum ofAgreement that meets the following criteria:ZEVs should be placed in the Los Angeles and Sacramento basins inthe following volumes: 750 in 1998, 1500 in 1999, and 1500 in 2000(without credits applied);Manufacturers would commit to continued ZEV R&D, including thepurchase and evaluation of advanced battery prototypes prior to1998;A market incentive (extra ZEV credits) would be provided forlonger-range vehicles and early (pre-1998) vehicles.   Creditsretain full value through 2003;State of California would purchase some advanced battery vehicleseach year;Manufacturers would provide adequate materials for trainingemergency-response personnel;All vehicle manufacturer-supported media, publicity, andlegislative initiatives against the ZEV program would be convertedto media, publicity, and legislative initiatives in support of thepartnership and ZEVs;Ongoing review process with annual reports by a committee ofsignatories to include battery technology, market acceptance,infrastructure, and incentives.  CARB biennial reviews continue(i.e. 1998, 2000);Review process to include discussion of product introduction planswith CARB.Ford Motor Co.  and Chrysler Corp.  told BET they still plan tobring EVs to market in California by the 1998 model year despitethe state's decision to delay its electric car mandate by fiveyears.  Both companies said they were pleased that CARB wants toease the 1998 mandate, but they added that CARB's alternativeproposal has some shortcomings, namely that it moves up by a year,to 2003, the deadline for 10% of vehicles sales being electric."We're happy because it's officially on record that the 1998 zeroemission mandate is unworkable,'' said Ford spokesman HowardHampton.  ``But there are still a lot of questions as to what theyactually said and did yesterday.  Nothing is set in stone." EricRidenour, Chrysler's director for environmental and energyplanning, said a 10% mandate in 2003 will jeopardize thedevelopment of advanced battery technologies.  "By moving therequired start date forward, we may preclude a fair chance atgetting some of these technologies into the mix. ''EV advocates are predictably displeased with California's decision.According to Tim Carmichael of the Coalition for Clean Air (Tel:415/546-6656), the change in policy is believed to have beendirected by California Gov. Wilson.  He told BET, "We have seen noscientific or technical reason to delay.  The agency responsiblefor world-wide adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline,and reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to politicalpressure."Melissa Kaznitz of CALPIRG (Tel: 805/564-1207) was displeased andsaid, "This proposal represents the next step in the governor'sattempt to dismantle California's clean air plan.  He is sellingout the environment, high-tech business, and consumers to supporthis generous patrons in the oil industry." The bottom line is thatthe new plan would require only 3,750 ZEVs available between 1998and 2000 versus 60,000 under the original proposal.  Roland Hwangof the Union of Concerned Scientists (Tel: 510/543-1872) said theplan was "inconsistent with the conclusions of the independentbattery panel that called for strong requirements beginning withthe year 2000 in order to maintain research and investment."It is too soon to say for sure whether other states considering EVmandates will follow suit, but EV advocates in New York andMassachusetts are concerned.  Sonia Hamel, the director of airpolicy for the state of Massachusetts, says Massachusetts Gov.William Weld is "very disappointed." She fears that Massachusettsand New York both are bound to follow California's ZEV program.Hamel went on to point out that the abrupt 10% requirement in 2003is not a "smart market launch." Jamie Phillips of the Planning andConservation League (Tel: 916/444-8726) added, "From zero to 10% isa giant leap.  It requires a leap of faith in the car companies --in whom we have little faith."Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Chrysler IntroducesEpic Electric MinivanChrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland Park, MI 48288-1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) introduced the "Epic" electric minivan atthe Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas EV andInfrastructure Conference in Atlanta, GA.  Robert Feldmaier,executive engineer for Chrysler's electric minivan program told theconference, "We see the Epic as the next logical step in thedevelopment of electric vehicles."The Epic, acronym for "Electric Powered Interurban Commuter," wasdeveloped with Westinghouse and, as described in this issue of BET,will initially offer the Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acidbattery.  Chrysler has the ability to build the vehicle on-line atits Windsor, Ontario, Assembly Plant as part of regular production.No conversion is necessary.  The Epic model designation will beapplied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager models that areoptioned with electric power.Due to development and competitive reasons, the launch date for thevehicle will not be released at this time.  Feldmaier explained,"There are several final supplier issues that need to be workedthrough, so we're not ready to give an exact launch date.  However,we've made it clear that this vehicle would be available by the1998 model year, and that has not changed." Feldmaier added thatdemand for the vehicle will also be a factor in establishing alaunch target date.  Cost and range are the two critical marketissues that will shape fleet customer demand."Because the minivan is by far our most successful vehicle, andbecause it has the unique ability to work as either a commutervehicle or a utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense tous for electric power," he said.  "The large flat floor also givesus plenty of room to store batteries, and more importantly, tochange battery types as new technologies are developed.  Right nowwe're able to get 27 modules at about 1,600 pounds on board of theadvanced lead-acid battery.  We anticipate a range of about 60miles under ideal conditions with that amount and type of battery."Cost and price of the vehicle have not been finalized.  Feldmaiersaid the low-volume componentry and the cost of batteries will makethe vehicle "significantly more costly than a comparable gasolineminivan." However, as is the case with all Chrysler productionvehicle launches, pricing will not be announced until the releasedate of the vehicle has been established.The Epic will incorporate several unique customer features,including a powermeter that gives the amount of power being drawnby the driver to help optimize driving style to extend range.  Thevehicle will also feature anti-lock regenerative brakes and dualairbags and will meet all federal safety regulations.Chrysler will target many of the fleet and utility customers thathave previously purchased its electric and compressed natural gas(CNG) vehicles.  "At this stage of development, EVs will obviouslyhave a very limited customer base," said Mike Clement, manager ofalternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing.  "We'll first targetthose fuel providers that are required to buy alternative fuelvehicles under the Energy Policy Act."The Epic will feature an AC Induction Motor with 100 peak hp and 75hp continuous, along with a single-speed, front-wheel-drivetransaxle.  The EV weighs 5900 lbs.  and can carry a payload of 800lbs.  The wheelbase is 113 inches in length by 186.3 inches wide by75.6 inches high, resulting in 68.5 inches in cargo space and 146.2cubic feet capacity with the seats removed.  The Epic acceleratesfrom 0 to 60 mph in 16 seconds, has a top speed of 80 mph, and arange of 60 miles (SAE J1634 cycle - no accessories).Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996GM Readies MarketIntroduction PlanGeneral Motors (432 N.

(The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:313/322-3000) and Chrysler Corp. (12000 Chrysler Drive, HighlandPark, MI 48288; Tel: 313/956-5741) have unveiled a prototype of aconductive charging system that the two automakers will use fortheir production model electric vehicles (EVs).Working models of the prototypes will be built so that utilitiescan begin planning for their installation.  By choosing conductivecharging, Ford and Chrysler have taken a step toward standardizinga crucial part of the infrastructure necessary to support theeventual commercialization of EVs.With EV structure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Betaproblems we saw with early video tape technology, says JohnWallace, director - Electric Vehicle Programs at Ford.  Bychoosing one standard system of charging, automakers will assistutility companies responsible for the installation of the EV-charging network.The prototype charging system was built by SCI Systems Inc. (Box1000, Huntsville, AL 35807; Tel: 205/882-4601), a contractmanufacturer of electronic assemblies and products.  The conductivesystem includes a home connecting device, which controls andmanages power, and a plug said to be safe and easy to use in allweather conditions.We chose a conductive charging system for our production EVs fornumerous reasons, says Bob Davis, executive engineer - ChryslerElectric Vehicles.  We believe conductive charging is safe and themost efficient and cost effective method of charging available.Also, it is well understood by professional electricians andrequires no special tools, expensive diagnostic equipment, orspecialized training for widespread installation.Conductive charging, the traditional method of connectingelectrical equipment to power sources, uses mating contacts totransfer the electricity.  Home electric clothes dryers, with theirspecially designed mating plugs, use conductive connections.  Likethem, EVs will use a unique--yet standardized--plug.  SCIengineered the prototype system to the specifications of Chrysler,Ford, five other automobile manufacturers, electric utilities, andthe California Air Resources Board (CARB).The parties have been working together as part of theInfrastructure Working Council (IWC) sponsored by the ElectricPower Research Institute (EPRI).  The IWC was formed in 1991 tohelp develop an infrastructure that will allow EV owners to safelyand conveniently plug into charging stations at their homes andother locations.  These infrastructure products will serve as thebasis for standards under development by the Society of AutomotiveEngineers (SAE) and will be proposed as international standards.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996SatCon Develops Award-Winning TechnologySatCon Technology Corp. (161 First St., Cambridge, MA 02142-1221;Tel: 617/661-0540, Fax: 617/661-3373) is applying its award-winningflywheel technology to the development of a drivetrain forChrysler's innovative, high-speed, hybrid electric race car, thePatriot.  The car will serve as a "laboratory on wheels" foradvanced developments that could be part of future commercialvehicles.  Now undergoing testing, the Patriot race car could top200 miles per hour.Winner of the Discover Award, SatCon's advanced hybrid electricrace car drivetrain consists of the following components:  a gasturbine engine, a compact turboalternator unit (TAU), a carbon-fiber flywheel, an electric traction motor/generator, and acontroller.  An efficient onboard fuel-burning (liquified naturalgas) turbine with a high power-to-weight ratio generates one-halfof a megawatt of electricity.  Power storage and load-levelingtakes place in a high-speed flywheel, which spins at 58,300 rpm.The wheels are driven by the world's most powerful electric motorfor its size.  The one-foot in diameter motor produces more than500 horsepower and allows regenerative braking.The flywheel provides energy to power the traction motor andaugments the reduced-sized (about the size of a shoebox) TAU. TheTAU integrates a high-speed gas turbine with an efficient, high-frequency AC induction and alternator in a two-spool arrangement oneach shaft.  Each spool generates 185 kW.  The power controllerweighs less than 100 pounds and handles enough current to power 200homes.Patriot's flywheel readily accepts regenerated braking energyduring deceleration and quickly charges, cycles, and releases thatenergy as the car accelerates.  Custom-designed magnetic bearingsand a vacuum seal eliminate friction and drag losses, enabling theflywheel to release nearly 90% of the energy it absorbs duringdeceleration.During races, technicians will rev the Patriot's flywheel up to60,000 rpm, thereby providing enough energy for fast accelerationas the race begins. The flywheel provides engine optimization byenabling the combustion engine to run at a constant rate, therebysaving energy.  In an all-electric vehicle, the flywheel can doublethe range of the vehicle and extend the life of the battery pack.SatCon will soon apply versions of the primary components of thePatriot drivetrain to the following applications:The advanced flywheel will serve as a source of "bridging power"and power conditioning for commercial utility and residentialapplications.The compact turboalternator will provide a very high output,portable power supply for heavy construction and military use, aswell as prime power for heavy equipment.The ultra-high-output electric motor will be used to create quiet,compact, but powerful air conditioning and chilling systems thatare 25% more energy efficient than those in use today.The compact high-density controller is a key component for a newgeneration of intelligent electromechanical products.These SatCon components make use of advanced technologiesoriginally developed for defense and aerospace purposes.  SatCon'sflywheels started as energy storage and positioning systems fororbiting satellites.  The turboalternator that converts the outputof the turbine engine into electric current was developed as astationary power source for the Army.  The steel in the ultra-highoutput electric motor was developed for a weapons system.SatCon's Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) system consists of a high-speed flywheel, a motor/generator, a bearing support system, and acontainment/vacuum housing.  Power and control electronicsefficiently shuttle electrical energy in and out of the flywheel.Whether in a vehicle or in stationary applications, the firm's FESsystems offer a variety of benefits, including low losses andefficient operation, long life, safe operation and easy disposal,braking energy recovery, and electric or hybrid vehicleimprovements.For space applications, SatCon supplies the FES systems to NASA formomentum recovery and spacecraft attitude control.  The firm'sinnovative integrated Power and Attitude Control System combinesenergy storage and spacecraft-control functions in a single FESsystem.For utility applications, SatCon's FES systems provide continuouselectrical power to critical machines and operations duringlighting strikes and other utility line faults.  FES systems cansolve quality problems caused by modern, high-frequency switchingpower supplies.  Also, FES systems provide off-peak storage optionsfor reducing power-generation requirements to meet peak powerdemands.The company is developing a lightweight flywheel, uninterruptedpower supply for the Marine Corps.  This system will preventirregularities in voltage and frequency that could result in powerfailure or the interruption of critical processes.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Flywheel PowersFord Concept CarThe new Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI48203; Tel: 800/258-3835) Synergy 2010 is a hybrid EV developed asa concept car to explore futuristic alternatives that couldtheoretically triple the fuel efficiency of a typical family sedan.At the vehicle's recent roll-out, Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman andchief executive officer, disclosed that the Synergy 2010 is poweredby a small, 1.0-liter direct-injection, compression-ignited enginemounted in the rear that would power a generator that produceselectricity for motors located in each wheel.  Up front, a flywheelcollects excess engine and braking energy, which in turn would bereleased to augment the engine when, for example, the car needed toaccelerate quickly or climb hills.Bob Mull, director of Ford's New Generation Vehicle program, saysthat in a direct-injection, compression-ignited engine, highpressure or heat is used instead of spark plugs to ignite the fuel,resulting in higher efficiency.  Theoretically, the Synergy 2010'sperformance with this smaller engine would be comparable to today'smid-sized family sedan because of its decreased weight, improvedaerodynamics and lower rolling resistance.Although not mass buildable at this time, Trotman says, "Synergy2010 is a good example of the kind of quantum leap, breakthroughthinking we're encouraging in our new global alignment."Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Duracell and EvereadyInclude Charge TestersBoth Eveready (Checkerboard Square, St. Louis, MO 63164; Tel:800/323-8177) and Duracell International Inc.  (BerkshireIndustrial Park, Bethel, CT 06801; Tel: 203/796-4000 or 800/422-9001, Fax: 203/791-3273)  have announced plans to introduceproprietary manganese-zinc alkaline batteries that incorporatereal-time charge testers.In an interesting legal situation that will keep patent attorneysoccupied until the matter is definitively settled, both companiesclaim to control valid patents for the same technology.Spokespeople for both companies are claiming to be the "first" tointroduce these testers, with roll-out dates scheduled for first-quarter 1996.Eveready made the first announcement when Vice President ofMarketing David Hatfield proclaimed that the company wouldintroduce "the first on-battery tester," which he promises will"jolt the consumer electronics industry by enabling users to testthe power of their Energizer brand batteries at any time forunprecedented confidence in battery-operated products andappliances." He added that the new Energizer on-battery tester willbe rolled out worldwide beginning with a U.S.  introduction in thespring of 1996.  The tester was originally developed and patentedby Strategic Electronics (Reno, NV).The Energizer on-battery tester will be available on AA, C, and Dcell sizes.  Like the Duracell tester, it utilizes thermochromictechnology that measures the amount of power in a battery based onthe amount of heat generated in the tester.  A consumer simplypresses both green dots firmly for 10 seconds.  At full power, theword "GOOD" appears in the tester window.  When the tester stayscompletely black, less than 25 percent of the power is remaining.According to Hatfield, research indicates that 95% of consumersprefer the convenience of the Energizer on-battery tester overtesters incorporated into the packaging.  With the on-batterytester, consumers can check the power on the spot anytime, anywhere-- without having to store or carry anything.  The new Energizerway eliminates the clutter and hassle of having to store on-packagetesters.  Moreover, 94% of consumers liked the idea after theytried it, and nearly all (97%) said they'd recommend it to friends."Our research indicates consumers want to be able to determinewhether or not their batteries are good without the hassle ofhaving to save the packaging," said Hatfield.  "With the Energizeron-battery tester, they'll never be caught off-guard in guessingthe state of batteries in their cameras, toys, portable cassetteplayers, or other frequently used electronic devices."Energizer says that the U.S.  launch of the new Energizer on-battery tester will be supported with an aggressive television andprint advertising campaign, as well as in-store promotion andmerchandising.  The convenience of the new product will be toutedthrough a national television campaign.After Eveready's announcement, Duracell immediately responded withits own declaration claiming what the company calls "the world'sfirst alkaline battery with a fuel-gauge-like power tester."According to Duracell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer CharlesR.  Perrin, the new trademarked line of PowerCheck Batteries allowconsumers to determine a battery's power anytime, anywhere.Specifically, PowerCheck Batteries will be rolled out worldwide,beginning with a launch of AA-sizes in the U.S. in the late springof 1996.  Availability in Canada and Europe will follow in thesummer of 1996, and PowerCheck Batteries will be sold in AAA, C,and D sizes in early 1997.Like the Eveready system, PowerCheck Batteries feature a fuel-gauge-like tester located directly on the battery.  To activate thetester, consumers press the dots on the side and bottom edge of thebattery.  A yellow thermochromic indicator measures heat resistancein the cell and provides an easy-to-read indication of remainingbattery power.  When remaining battery power is sufficient, thedisplay rises into the "Good" zone on the indicator.  Whenremaining battery power is insufficient, the display remains in the"Replace" zone.  Perrin says that the launch of the PowerCheckBatteries will be supported with new advertising and strong in-store promotional activities.The tester is the result of a joint venture between Duracell andAvery Dennison Corp.  Charles D.  Miller, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Avery Dennison, says this strategic alliancewas established two years ago.  Duracell licensed the originaltechnology from Eastman Kodak Co..  Kodak was awarded at patent forthe technology in 1991 (about the same time as Strategic Alliance)in what was probably an error by the patent office.In fiscal 1995, Eveready shipped almost 1.5 billion alkalinebatteries in North America alone and sold more than 6 billionbatteries in 160 countries.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Benchmarq FilesChip Patent SuitSemiconductor manufacturer Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc.

(14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI 48203; Tel:313/390-2310) and Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, HighlandPark, MI 48288-1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) has selected conductivecharging for their "standard" EV refueling technique.  Forddirector of Vehicle Programs John Wallace told said that,  "With EVinfrastructure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta problemswe saw with early videotape technology.  By choosing one standardsystem of charging, automakers will assist utility companiesresponsible for the installation of the EV charging network."Unfortunately, this decision is actually a step backwards for EVinfrastructure standardization and creates precisely the kind ofVHS/Beta situation Wallace says he is trying to avoid.This is because GM and its subsidiary Hughes (432 N. Saginaw St.,Suite 801, Flint, MI 48502; Tel: 800-253-5328), with the support ofthe Department of Energy and the public utilities' researchconsortium Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), have alreadypicked inductive charging as an EV "standard." Conductive charging,which is currently used by most EVs, depends on a direct conductor-to-conductor contact between the electrical power source, thecharger's rectifier(s), and the EV's battery.  GM's charging usesa non-conductive inductive connection between the power source andthe battery.Which system is "better?" Conductive charging is less expensive (onthe order of $1,000 for a single vehicle system, versus on theorder of $2,000 for an inductive system).  Inductive charging isfaster (at least twice as fast, and if properly configured, muchfaster).  Inductive charging is theoretically not as efficient asconductive charging.  However, in practice, both systems are aboutequally efficient.  Inductive systems (which use plastic, asopposed to metal parts) weigh less.  Inductive systems may be saferthan conductive systems, especially if charging takes place outsidein the rain.  GM and EPRI cite this as a pivotal advantage.  Fordsays conductive systems can be made just as safe as inductivesystems.The real answer to the Ford/Chrysler decision may be due tomarketing considerations.  The system they selected is available inprototype form as the "home connecting device" from SCI Systems(2101 Clinton Ave., Huntsville, AL 35805; Tel: 205/882-4800), anestablished electronics and avionics design and manufacturingcompany and a rival of GM's Hughes subsidiary in the aerospace andother electronics markets.SCI, like Hughes, is a member of the Department of Energy's EVInfrastructure Working Council (IWC), but it was a relativelatecomer to the EV infrastructure business.  The Department ofEnergy, via EPRI, has been promoting inductive charging as the bestbet for EV applications since the late 80s.  This attitude had allbut assured that GM and Hughes, which control key inductive-charging technology, would come to dominate the EV charginginfrastructure.It was only recently, and with a considerable amount of reluctance,that EPRI has expanded its view to encompass the possibility ofwidespread conductive EV charging.  Even if the wide use of EVs isdelayed, the decision is of more than academic interest.  Whetherit happens in five years or 20 years, the creation of an EV-charging infrastructure will require billions of dollars ofcapital.Back to Headline List CopyrightBATTERY & EV TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJANUARY 1996CALENDARFebruary 2, 1996, Fleets at the Crossroads: Alternative Fuels &Vehicle Efficiency.

The selections, whose announcement had been delayed until Congress andthe Clinton administration agreed on an appropriations bill for theDepartment of Defense in FY-96, were the last for TRP as it has been knownsince 1993.   (A list of the projects is on pages 7-8.)The program is being overhauled by Defense to respond to congressionaldemands that the Pentagon pay stricter attention to military needs inproviding support for technologies with both defense and commercialapplications.   When FY-97 begins in October, the Pentagon plans to have in place a newname and a new office for dual-use technology (FTR, 21 Dec, 3).   A $195 million allocation for TRP in the Pentagon's FY-96 appropriationis sufficient only to support the program's 131 current projects, includingthe most recent ones. It does not allow for any solicitations.   DOD plans to request $300 million for the program in FY-97, when the newJoint Dual-Use Program Office opens. The new office will be operated for ayear by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has managed TRP sinceits inception, and then by the Pentagon's defense research and engineeringoffice.   The latest projects, whose selections were announced Dec. 22, were among140 proposals received last summer by ARPA and fell into six ``focusareas,'' including affordable advanced controls, biological sensing,digital wireless communications, microelectromechanical systems andnon-warfare technologies.   The $137.4 million in government funding that will support the newprojects for a year is less than half the estimated total cost of theprojects, the Pentagon said.   The largest project -- in the affordable advanced controls category --is a $48 million effort led by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, St. Louis, tobuild a vehicle-management system.   A number of federal laboratories are participants in the projects,including the Naval Surface Warfare Centers in Bethesda, Md., and Dahlgren,Va.; the Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; the AirForce's Rome Laboratory, Rome, N.Y., and Wright Laboratory, Dayton, Ohio;the Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Fort Belvoir,Va.; the Army Weapons Sciences Directorate RD&E Center, Redstone Arsenal,Ala.; and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   With the latest TRP awards, about $686 million in Pentagon funds havebeen committed to the 131 projects.   Meanwhile, Lee Buchanan, the TRP director, said this week that theDepartment of Defense's plan to move the dual-use technology program fromARPA to the Pentagon's defense research and engineering office (DDR&E)responds to congressional perceptions that TRP has sometimes played downmilitary needs in choosing projects. The Joint Dual-Use Program Office willalso assure the Air Force, Army and Navy of involvement in projectselections and encourage them to integrate dual-use technologies in theirprocurement decisions, he said in response to questions from FederalTechnology Report.   ``The fact that the office is ultimately headed for DDR&E -- out of ARPA-- reflects the complete emphasis on injecting the notion of dual use intoservice procurement,'' he said. ``If this doesn't eventually end upchanging the way the services do business, it will not have beensuccessful.''   Buchanan said it was ``not clear'' whether other federal agencies willparticipate in future selections of dual-use technology projects, as theyhave in the past.   ``The emphasis is on DOD expenditures benefiting the military,'' hesaid. ``Where that involves other agencies, and I imagine it can more thannot, we want them at the table. But there is no room for projects thateffectively transfer DOD money to civilian agencies.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   INEL PROPOSES FACILITY TO MIMIC EARTHQUAKES, OTHER DISASTERSBy:David Kramer   Idaho National Engineering Laboratory is proposing a new ``userfacility'' that would test the effects of earthquakes and other naturaldisasters on new structural materials.   The planned facility, which has already been dubbed the ``AdvancedCombined Effects Test Station,'' would exploit the peculiar geology at theINEL site in southeast Idaho to enable scientists to generate earthquakescomparable in intensity to the tremors that occurred in Kobe, Japan, andNorth Ridge, Calif., in recent years.   According to INEL Director Barton Krawetz, the region's fractured basaltslope plain makes it seismically quiescent, and shock waves from themanmade quakes would not propagate beyond the INEL site.   In a recent interview, Krawetz said the ``Astrodome''-like facility isexpected to cost about $1 billion -- not much, he maintained, when measuredagainst the $180 billion in damage caused by the Kobe quake alone.   Most of the funding would be derived not from INEL's parent, theDepartment of Energy, but rather from other federal jurisdictions,including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that respond to naturaldisasters. Krawetz said he hoped that the facility can become a``presidential initiative'' -- an elevated status that would vault it overother projects competing for scarce federal funding.   ``New structural materials other than iron and concrete can be advancedonly after full-scale testing. We think a user facility can appear here,''Krawetz said.   As with other user facilities located at DOE laboratories, ACETS'customers would include both industry and university researchers. Krawetzsaid he imagined it being used by the secondary insurance industry as wellas a company like Bechtel National Inc., which ``might want to bid onbuilding a new city in Saudi Arabia.''   ACETS would also have a broad international appeal, and other nations,including Japan, could be expected to contribute to its construction, hesaid.   The facility would be big enough to test structures hundreds of squarefeet in size, Krawetz said. Apart from earthquakes, it would be capable ofproducing winds as high as 200 miles per hour, as well as torrential rains.While the area is arid, plenty of water is available from the Snake Riveraquifer, he said.   The facility would also help to re-establish INEL in the minds of theresearch community, he noted.   ``Some people think of us as a dump,'' Krawetz said, referring to INEL'srole as storage site for virtually all the types of radioactive wastesroduced by DOE. ``We want to change the word on the street about thisplace.''Fees generated by ACETS also could help defray some of the fixed costs formaintaining INEL from DOE's Environmental Management division, which is thelab's landlord, he noted.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   ATP, OTHER NIST PROGRAMS GET HIGH GRADES IN NEUTRAL REVIEWBy:Bill Loveless   An independent report card on the National Institute of Standards andTechnology released last week concludes that the Advanced TechnologyProgram and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership have enhanced NIST'straditional work in standards and measures and not detracted from them, assome critics of ATP and MEP have maintained.   The annual assessment of NIST by a National Research Council boardsuggests that eliminating ATP or MEP, which Congress established when itbroadened the institute's mandate in 1988, or tampering with NIST'slong-established programs, would result in more harm than good.   ``Given the current political debate on the fate of the Department ofCommerce, and proposed legislation that would significantly reorganize NISTand its functions, the board makes two observations,'' the report said.``First, it is not possible for the nation to maintain government-certifiedstandards, weights and measures without the technical activities of theNIST laboratories.''   The report praised the ``cadre of highly qualified scientists andengineers at NIST'' and described their work as ``absolutely essential'' tomaintaining the leading role of the U.S. standards and measurement system.   ``Second,'' the report added, ``rather than detracting from thetraditional functions of NIST, the expanded role and new programs NIST hasassumed since 1988 have augmented that function in a positive manner. Inparticular, the board has noted a synergy between the NIST laboratories andthe Advanced Technology Program, which has stimulated appropriate newresearch directions in the laboratories and helped identify emerging needsfor standards and measurement services.''   Although NIST contracts annually with NRC for the assessment, theinstitute has no control over NRC's selection of board members nor over theconclusions, a spokesman said this week. The latest review, which coversFY-95, was conducted by 144 U.S. scientists and engineers from academic,industrial and other research organizations.   The board was chaired by Wilmer Bottoms of Patricof & Co.   Although it credited NIST with assisting in the formation of high-techindustries, the report acknowledged that specifically assessing theinstitute's industrial impact is often difficult.   ``Merely totaling the number of [cooperative r&d agreements] or industryfellows is not an adequate measure of the impact the laboratories have onU.S. industries,'' the report observed. ``Those counts do representvaluable industrial cooperation on a case-by-case basis, but such numberscould clearly be driven to excess if used as the only measure.''   The report urged NIST to ``identify additional ways of measuring'' thecosts and benefits to the economy of the institute's programs.   ``This effort is especially important as NIST's basic mission -- and thefunding provided by Congress to support it -- are under review,'' thereport said.   NIST officials have admitted that their defense of ATP in the face ofattacks from the Republican-led Congress has been hampered because most ofthe projects have not been completed yet and there is no generally acceptedway to measure their impact on the economy.   Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have vowed to kill ATP this year,although they relented in their opposition to MEP and agreed to legislationproviding funds for the program in FY-96 (FTR, 7 Dec, 1).   Whether the NRC report will have any impact on NIST's critics inCongress was uncertain, although the spokesman for the institute said NISTconsiders the findings ``very useful'' in managing its labs and programs.``It certainly doesn't hurt'' to have the NRC assessment, he added.   The report followed by several weeks a broader review of federal scienceand technology policy by the National Academy of Sciences that questionedwhether ATP would fulfill its goal of advancing technologies that theprivate sector considers too risky to invest in (FTR, 7 Dec, 4). NRC is theprincipal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences.   Participants in the earlier report, led by former NAS president FrankPress, ``to our knowledge made no inquiries'' at NIST regarding ATP, theinstitute's spokesman said. Those involved in the latest report, he added,spent a considerable amount of time at NIST.

Up to $20 million is expected to be available from ARPA for projects,with selection taking place during the second quarter of FY-96. Theproposals must be cost-shared, with ARPA only investing a maximum of 50% ofthe total project cost.   Despite its long tradition of innovation, in recent years the U.S.commercial shipbuilding sector has languished, tending to license designsfor new ship types from foreign yards rather than develop them itself.Little dual-use technology transfer has been evident in the past betweenAmerica's naval ship construction programs and the commercial sector.   MARITECH could change all of that, according to ARPA. Advanced hullforms and innovative designs, such as high-speed catamarans, hybridsurface-effect ships, and low-wash multihulls, often developed byAustralian and European shipyards, have been particularly evident in theU.S. passenger ferry scene.   Otherwise, the only real bright spots in the picture have come fromyards building vessels for riverboat casino use.   Two technology-related thrusts embodied in the latest MARITECHsolicitation are aimed at remedying some of these woes by improvingshipyard practices in fundamental ways. For example, applying various newtechnologies and processes to make their business tasks such as marketanalysis, supplier relations, materiel procurement, cost estimating andfinancial systems more efficient.   ARPA sees a range of communication and electronic commerce technologiesallowing some of these tasks to be better executed and integrated.   In addition, total process systems could be used to address thedevelopment and demonstration of system-wide, integrated, design andproduction technologies.   ARPA is not interested in ``individual technologies for specificprocesses, rather its emphasis is on ``revolutionary, enterprise-widesystems for the shipbuilding industry that would help dramatically reducethe total time and cost of the design and construction process in U.S.yards.''   Possible technologies include total process simulation/modeling,product-to-process decomposition, material tracking, advanced CAD/CAM/CIM,yard layout, and the integration of these with management systemstechnologies.   MARITECH proposals are expected to come from teams featuring, typically,a technology developer(s), shipyard, supplier, and shipowner or operator,and to include a commercialization plan for the technology.   By the project's conclusion, the technology is required to be capable ofdemonstration. The closing date for proposals is Feb. 23.

Just before Christmas, both the Senate and House voted to overrideClinton's veto of legislation designed to curb so-called meritlesssecurity-fraud lawsuits (FTR, 7 Dec, 6). It was the first time that aClinton veto had been rejected by Congress.   ``From a Silicon Valley perspective, we are delighted that the House andthe Senate rectified an outrageous decision to veto this legislation,''George Sollman, vice president of the American Electronics Assn. and chiefexecutive of Centigram Communications Corp., said in a statement issued byAEA Dec. 22.   ``As people have said about Silicon Valley -- there are two types ofCEOs -- those who have been sued and those who are about to be. We hopethis legislation will put an end to this type of legalized extortion.''According to AEA, about 53% of Silicon Valley's high-tech companies havebeen sued for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the nation'ssecurities laws.   The new law attempts to thwart frivolous lawsuits by giving judges powerto sanction attorneys who make such filings and by having defendants paysettlements according to their share of guilt.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CENTER OFFERS MINORITY TRAINING   Minority students will learn how to move technology from the laboratoryto the marketplace under a new program at the National Technology TransferCenter.   The Entrepreneurial Technology Apprentice Program (ETAP) will offerstudents from historically black colleges and universities hands-ontraining, mentoring and other assistance through a one-year courseaddressing technology management, manufacturing assistance and industrialr&d apprenticeships, NTTC said.   The curriculum for the program, which is scheduled to begin in June, isbeing developed by Wheeling Jesuit College, the home to NTTC, and thecenter's staff.   NTTC, a federally supported organization in Wheeling, W.Va., appointedFaye Lyons-Gary as an associate director for ETAP.   Lyons-Gary is one of two new officials at NTTC. The center alsoannounced recently its appointment of Chuck Millick as director of itsWheeling operations.   Lyons-Gary was the director of industrial relations at Clark AtlantaUniversity and The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) andMinority Institutions Environmental Technology Consortium before going toNTTC.   Among her other previous positions, Lyons-Gary was an intern withLockheed Martin Energy Systems' Office of Technology Transfer at Oak RidgeNational Laboratory.   Currently three of the nation's 117 HBCUs are involved with ETAP:Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio; the University of Arkansas atPine Bluff; and West Virginia State College in Institute, W.Va. Otherinstitutions have expressed interest in the program, NTTC said.   ETAP will emphasize fund-raising so that it can expand to all HBCUs,Lyons-Gary said.   Although supported by the Department of Commerce's Minority BusinessDevelopment Agency, the NTTC program is also ``looking into contributionsfrom private industry, federal grants and foundations,'' she said.   For more information on ETAP, call Lyons-Gary at (304) 243-4347.   Millick, who was previously with General Electric, Kimberly Clark andBDM, will help improve NTTC's information, training and other programs.   ``These are very challenging times because our clients are changing asthe world is changing,'' Millick said. ``We need to work with ourcustomers, see what they require and provide them with valuableresources.''Millick said he also intends to strengthen NTTC's relationships with NASA,which supplies the center's federal funding, and other governmentagencies.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   BUDGET IMPASSE STYMIES RULES ON FOREIGN LICENSES, INVENTIONSBy:Neil MacDonald   Two Department of Commerce proposals for modifying and streamliningregulations for acquiring and protecting foreign rights to U.S. governmentinventions, and for licensing of foreign patents acquired by the federalgovernment, remained in regulatory limbo at the end of the year due to thefederal budget crisis.   They are just two of several regulatory changes proposed by DOC forpromulgation during FY-96. Most of the department has remained closed sinceDec. 16 as a result of the budget impasse, but an agency official familiarwith the proposals told Federal Technology Report last week that thetimetable for introducing the changes was now essentially up in the air.   He said that when they were being planned last year, final action onthem by October had seemed a reasonable target. In retrospect, the presentbudget situation and congressional attempts to dismantle Commerce made thistime frame look ``optimistic,'' he said.   Although their wording has yet to be published, it is understood thatone of DOC's proposals by the Technology Administration advocates changesto provide equal treatment of domestic and foreign rights to inventionsmade by federal employees.   Most federal inventions are the subject of only U.S. patent filingsunless there is an obvious or overwhelming need to also seek foreign patentcoverage.   The process by which such decisions are currently made is believed to befairly arbitrary with some agencies seeking and often securing foreignpatent rights but failing to exploit them through foreign licenseagreements. In addition, obtaining foreign patent rights is both anexpensive and time-consuming task.   According to a DOC official, the second proposed change is ``motivatedby a desire for clarification'' of existing language regarding thelicensing of foreign patents owned by the federal government, and alsoreflects some recommendations made by the Clinton administration as aresult of its campaign to ``reinvent'' government as a more efficiententerprise.   Both proposals -- known as Rule Identification Numbers 0692-AA15 and0692-1116 -- are characterized as having ``substantive, nonsignificant''priority levels with no legal deadlines and having no effect on smallentities.   Another proposal -- 0692-AA14 -- by the Technology Administration dealswith an interim rule published in August that would allow certain federalgovernment contractors, mostly nonprofit organizations, small businessesand grant recipients, to file notifications of their inventions andelection of title to funding agencies using approved forms of electronicmedia.   That rule would also update some earlier patent definitions. Finalaction on the rule is expected in April.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   PAPER REVIEWS FEDERAL IMPACT ON SMALL, HIGH-TECH COMPANIES   A new report from the National Academy of Engineering suggests that oneof the best ways for Washington to help small high-tech companies is tomake sure that regulations and other traditional government functionsinterfere as little as possible with their operations.   The report, ``Risk and Innovation,'' says the government shouldroutinely assess the impact of its regulations on innovation among smallhigh-tech businesses and minimize them when possible, particularly in lightof the disfavor with which the Republican Congress looks on direct federalfunding for commercial technologies.   Given that view on Capitol Hill, the report also urged the government togo easy on university projects in deciding where to cut federal funding forr&d. Campus r&d, it said, offers ``rich'' potential for new start-upcompanies.   The ``extreme budget consciousness'' in Congress means that federalinitiatives on behalf of small high-tech businesses should ``focus first onestablishing mechanisms within government -- many of them off-budget --that can improve the general environment for innovative enterprises,'' thereport, prepared by the NAE Committee on Technology, Management, andCapital in Small High-Tech Companies, said.   ``Because the structure and implementation of regulations affect thecharacter and speed of innovation (through the risks they can create orremove for companies), regulatory approaches across a wide variety ofgovernment functions need to be carefully considered with regard to theirimpact on small high-tech companies,'' the report said.   The committee was chaired by Henry Kressel, managing director, Warburg,Pincus & Co.   ``Private investment is likely to be much greater than any imaginablelevel of public investment in fragmented, technically dynamic industrieswith low barriers to entry and a history (or widely perceived prospect of)successful entrepreneurship,'' the panel said.   ``In such industries the important question is, how can governmentresearch, development, and demonstration complement the huge privateinvestment (risk-taking) to the benefit of the national economy?'' thereport said. ``The challenge in program design and implementation is toarticulate and adhere to an industry-specific rationale for governmentsupport in light of substantial private sector activity ... .''   The NAE committee also concluded that state and local governments shouldhave more say in the development of federal r&d programs, technicalassistance and other national mechanisms that promote economic growth.``Local and regional programs may have an advantage in that they are closerto the resources that small companies need and are potentially more able toadapt to the needs of small high-tech companies,'' the report said.   Although the report was not intended to comment specifically on federalprograms, it noted some concerns raised by the public regarding theAdvanced Technology Program, the Technology Reinvestment Project and theSmall Business Innovative Research program during meetings conducted by theNAE panel.   ``Participants in several of the industry-specific workshops, softwareand medical devices in particular, noted that programs such as TRP, ATP andSBIR that could provide financing for small high-tech companies were lessuseful because of the long review cycles and time delays inherent in highlybureaucratic programs,'' the report said.   The NAE committee also came across criticism that SBIR spawned too manycompanies, called ``SBIR houses,'' whose only income was funding from theprogram, and that it adhered ``too rigidly'' to the missions of theagencies providing its cash.   The reaction, the report said, reflected the findings of a recentGeneral Accounting Office report, which concluded that while the quality ofproposals submitted to SBIR ``remains high,'' multiple awards to the samecompanies ``has become a problem.''Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   NTIA REVISES POLICY ON GRANTS WITH `SECTARIAN' IMPLICATIONS   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration recentlymodified a policy that had prohibited it from awarding grants toorganizations involved in sectarian activities.   Under the change, the Department of Commerce unit will no longer rejecta grant application simply on the basis that an award ``might result insome attenuated or incidental benefit to sectarian interests,'' NTIA saidin a Dec. 20 statement.   The revised policy affects three NTIA activities: the Telecommunicationsand Information Infrastructure Assistant Program, the PublicTelecommunications Facilities Program, and the National Endowment forChildrens's Educational Television.   As a result of the change, the government also entered into a settlementwith Fordham University under which Fordham will receive a PublicTelecommunications Facilities Program grant to install radio broadcastservices, NTIA said.   Fordham was previously ruled ineligible for such a grant because itsradio station broadcasts a Catholic Mass each week, NTIA said.

Once fine-tuned, the Molecular Measuring Machine -- or M3 -- will becapable of locating molecule-sized features in vast expanses and of gauging``with unprecedented accuracy'' the distances between them, according toNIST, which held a press conference recently to report on the machine'sprogress.   The new machine's range is 250,000 times greater than that of mostscanning tunneling microscopes, which are generally used now to performsuch measurements, NIST said.   ``For perspective,'' NIST said, ``M3's anticipated capabilities are akinto being able to locate two widely separated grains of sand in a ...960-square mile patch of desert and then to measure the distance betweenthem to within 1 millimeter.''   In tests so far, the machine measured specimens encompassing only asmall part of its planned 50-millimeter span, NIST said. In subsequenttests, it will measure specimens over its entire range.   The machine is considered especially important to the semiconductorindustry, NIST noted.   ``For the semiconductor industry to continue its decades-long trend ofcrowding ever more and ever smaller devices on slivers of silicon, it willsoon require measurement methods that are accurate to within 0.0024micrometer, or 2.5 nanometers,'' the institute said.   M3 will be used to calibrate various measurement references thatsemiconductor manufacturers can use to check the accuracy of their ownmeasurement equipment, NIST said.   A number of organizations have collaborated with NIST on the machine,including Hewlett-Packard Corp., Zygo Corp., Intelligent Automation, Inc.,and Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge national laboratories.

The decision, announced Dec. 20, followed a lengthy public examinationof claims by environmental groups that NIF, which is designed to mimic on alaboratory scale the fusion stage of nuclear weapons, would presentproliferation problems.   A report prepared by the Department of Energy's arms control andnonproliferation office concluded instead that NIF would advance U.S.nonproliferation objectives because it would allow the nation to sign on toa treaty outlawing nuclear testing.   The unprecedented study was requested by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif.,former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who had questionedwhether the facility would aid or hinder the spread of nuclear weapons.O'Leary ordered the examination in September 1994. The report, which wasreviewed by outside experts, concluded that the technical proliferationconcerns posed by NIF would be ``manageable'' (FTR, 28 Sept, 12).   ``I am pleased that we can now move forward to meet our goals instockpile stewardship,'' O'Leary said in a statement. ``The NationalIgnition Facility will contribute to the ability of the United States tomaintain its nuclear stockpile without underground testing. We arecommitted to operating the facility in the most open manner possible whilesupporting our objective of reducing the global nuclear danger.''   DOE considers NIF a key element of its ``science-based stockpilestewardship program''-- its plan for ensuring the continuing reliabilityand safety of remaining nuclear weapons without the need for undergroundtests.   Jackie Cabasso, executive director of the Western States LegalFoundation, and a leading NIF opponent, said the report's ``conclusions arenot supported by its findings.'' The study, she said, ``does not change thefact that NIF is a very serious threat to nonproliferation policy, boththrough the development of innovative technologies for nuclear weaponsdevelopment and by example for a renewed commitment to nuclear weapons asan instrument of national policy.''   Cabasso called ``contradictory'' the U.S. position of supporting acomprehensive test ban treaty while at the same time building newfacilities to substitute for testing. She also expressed dismay that thefinal version of the report had not been made available publicly prior toO'Leary's announcement, saying the omission ``belies DOE's real seriouscommitment to public participation.''   But Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., who represents the Livermore area,commented that ``NIF will play a vital role not only in keeping America'snational defense second to none, but also in developing renewable energyresources for our future.''   NIF construction will bring 2,500 jobs to Livermore, while 1,000permanent staff positions are expected to be created. The facility isexpected to be completed in 2002.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   GAO QUESTIONS DOE PLAN TO MOVE SUPERCOMPUTER UNIT TO BERKELEYBy:David Kramer   The General Accounting Office has concluded that a Department of Energyplan to relocate a supercomputing center from one national lab to anotherwill not be cost-effective, according to Rep. Bill Baker, R-Calif., whorequested the evaluation from the congressional watchdog.   But DOE's number-two official insisted that the GAO findings were``consistent with'' the agency's decision to move the center from LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis told Baker Dec. 21 that cost was only oneof six criteria considered in the relocation.   ``We continue to believe that our decision to relocate the center toLBNL is in the best interest of the public ... ,'' Curtis said in a letterto Baker. The decision, he added, ``was based on a peer review processaimed at securing the highest level of long-term performance in [DOE]mission areas.''Baker, who represents the Livermore area, had cited the findings of the GAOreport, which was released Dec. 19, in asking DOE to take another look atits plan to move the National Energy Research Supercomputer Center.   `` ... [T]his new NERSC proposal is a costly effort that would achieveno clear scientific benefit,'' Baker said in releasing the GAO report. ``Iam very concerned by this ill-conceived and unjustified proposal, and planto urge the Energy Department to carefully reevaluate it.''   The GAO report, which examined only the costs of the NERSC move, saidthat relocating the facility to LBNL could cost more than the $4.4 millionestimated by LBNL. In addition, GAO calculated that maintenance of thefacility at LBNL would cost about $617,000 more annually than it would tokeep NERSC at LLNL.   In what DOE officials had earlier acknowledged was largely abudget-driven exercise, DOE's Office of Energy Research sought competingbids from LLNL and LBNL last year for operation of NERSC, and instructedthe labs to assume a 15% to 20% reduction in funding from FY-95 levels. Thelabs' proposals were evaluated by an outside panel of specialists, themajority of whom recommended that the center be relocated to LBNL.   While the two bids were nearly identical in cost terms, LBNL offered torun the center with essentially its existing 100 staff, while LLNL proposedto cut 14 positions. GAO noted that LBNL was able to maintain staff levelsin part by drafting nine graduate students from the adjacent University ofCalifornia at Berkeley.   Despite its location at LLNL, NERSC is used solely for unclassifiedresearch, mainly by programs supported by DOE's Office of Energy Research(ER). The decision to relocate the facility to LBNL, an ER-administeredlab, raised suspicions that DOE was motivated by a wish to consolidate ERprograms in ER facilities, and possibly ``prop up'' LBNL. Both motives weredenied by DOE officials.   In its review, GAO warned that LBNL may have underestimated therelocation expenses. It said that while Berkeley had included the cost tomove about 220 people within the lab to accommodate the move, additionalrelocations could be required. And DOE may need to incur additional coststo convert the vacated NERSC facility at Livermore to a new use, it said.   A DOE official said this week that LBNL has since ``scrubbed'' themoving estimates and stands by the $4.4 million figure.   GAO said David Nelson, the ER associate director for computational andtechnology research, told its auditors that cost was only one of sixcriteria that his office used in evaluating the proposals. Others includedbenefits to ER; impact on ER missions through interdisciplinary internaland external collaborations; lab management's support; and demonstratedcapability to integrate future technological advances to support ER'scomputing and communications needs.   Baker complained that many LLNL employees will experience considerableinconvenience because of the ``unsound'' move.   ``I am very concerned that for the sake of bureaucratic reshuffling, asignificant number of hard-working men and women are going to have to beginprolonged commutes from Livermore to Berkeley,'' he said. ``SatisfyingWashington bureaucrats is not a good enough reason to disrupt the lives ofLLNL employees.''   Baker also termed unsatisfactory the explanation he had received fromCurtis for the relocation, which was announced Nov. 3.   ``Mr. Curtis said in his [Nov. 3] letter that LBNL offered `superiorlong-range vision' and `improved opportunities for internal and externalcollaboration.' This is obscure, bureaucratic nonsense that fails toexplain any sound basis for the proposed move,'' he said.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   LIVERMORE CONFERENCE EXPLORES NEW LINKS WITH SMALL BUSINESS   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hosted a one-day conference lastmonth to explore new ways for large organizations, including national labs,to forge links with small- and medium-sized manufacturers and suppliers.The conference was co-sponsored by the CommerceNet ``Commerce at LightSpeed'' project, an effort by the Department of Defense's Advanced ResearchProjects Agency to promote business over the Internet, and by LLNL, insupport of the Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing-NationalInformation Infrastructure program.   According to the LLNL Newsline, Roger Flanagan, AM-NII projectcoordinator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said the $24 million effortwas initiated in 1994 in recognition that DOE was still doing many things``the old way.'' He said project founders realized that DOE needed toemploy new manufacturing strategies used by private industry as well as newinformation technologies to streamline and strengthen relationships withcommercial suppliers.   The program's current emphasis, Flanagan said, is on filling needsaffecting several sites managed by DOE's Defense Programs division,outsourcing more services and completing pilot projects in key technicalareas. These areas include distributed simulation (Y-12 Plant), technicaldata exchange (Kansas City Plant), security and intelligence agents (SandiaNational Laboratories), enterprise information modeling (Los AlamosNational Laboratory) and electronic commerce (LLNL).   Mike Snow, the DP representative for AM-NII, told Newsline that DOE'sweapons complex used to have a high volume of design and production taskswith competition between sites for assignments and plenty of time andresources to get the job done.   Today DOE is fielding no new nuclear weapons designs and is dedicated tomaintaining the nuclear stockpile and components. In fulfilling its newresponsibilities, he said, the department is facing a scarcity ofresources, uncertain production needs, limited testing opportunities,declining funding, an aging work force and a shrinking knowledge base.   To overcome these challenges, Snow told Newsline, DOE must initiategreater teamwork among its many departments and labs and with itsindustrial suppliers, limit and expedite prototypes, do more modeling andsimulation work and move to more flexible manufacturing. It must alsoimprove information handling to connect workers with data instead of``moving bodies around'' from site to site.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   LAB RESURRECTS CLOSED FACILITY FOR ION-IMPLANTATION RESEARCH   With help from a shuttered fusion experiment at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory, a new process for surface treating materials to improve theirwear resistance will soon go commercial.   Scientists at Los Alamos and the University of Wisconsin have begunworking under an Advanced Technology Program-backed cooperative r&dagreement with an 11-company consortium that includes General Motors Corp.Harley-Davidson Inc. and A.O. Smith Corp., to further scale up thetechnique of implanting ions on the surfaces of materials. The implantationprocess alters the structure of the material in such a way as to hardenit.   According to Don Rej, a LANL technical staff member who was the firstprincipal investigator on the project, the CRADA partners are using aUW-developed process known as Plasma Surface Ion Implantation andequipment, facilities and computer modeling capabilities at LANL. The firsttwo commercial systems for PSII are being built by North Star ResearchCorp., Albuquerque, N.M.   One of the North Star-built units is to be placed in commercialwear-hardening service at Empire Hard Chrome Inc., Chicago. It is expectedto be used for large-scale automotive and other industrial applications.The other unit will be shipped to a research facility in Finland.   Prior to perfecting the plasma technique of implantation, the PSIIprocess was considered too expensive, slow and complicated for widespreadcommercial use. But, according to the fall issue of ``USCAR Dateline2000,'' a comprehensive cost analysis, including amortized capitalequipment, personnel and consumables, predict large-scale treatment costsof less than half a penny per square centimeter.   According to Rej, the primary advantage to the PSII process over thebetter-known beamline ion implantation method, is the former's ability toharden material faces which are not in the ``line of sight'' of a beam. InPSII, the part is immersed in the plasma in which the ions are produced.Beamlines are produced by accelerators, and if more than one surface areais to be treated, the part must be manipulated to expose the particularsurfaces.   GM and LANL recently completed work in PSSI under a CRADA that began in1991. According to Rej, the lab is now proposing to continue that workunder auspices of the threatened Partnership for a New Generation ofVehicles, the consortium of several government agencies and the Big Threeautomakers.   According to a summary of the three-year, $15.5 million ATP project,automakers are interested in the process because it could be used to treatthe surfaces of lightweight aluminum or magnesium alloys so they canwithstand the high wear and other demanding environmental conditionscharacteristic of engines. Substituting these materials for steel and ironcould result in a 10% decrease in the cost of making automobilepowertrains.   ATP is administered by the National Institute of Standards andTechnology.   PSII also could be used to treat the surfaces of dies and tools,resulting in an expected 10-fold increase in performance life.   The ATP project will aim to develop and demonstrate prototypetechnologies for high-volume applications of PSII. The technology has neverbeen applied in treatment chambers larger than 1 cubic meter. Unknownsinclude the behavior of plasmas in large systems and the uniformity oftreatment achieved on irregularly shaped parts.   Rej said LANL's primary contribution has been scaling up the technology,which was developed by UW with support from the National ScienceFoundation. The university had only a small table-top unit, while LosAlamos had a much larger device left over when DOE canceled its alternativeconcepts fusion program. The lab also had high voltage technology from itsnuclear physics and Strategic Defense Initiative programs, and computermodeling capabilities from its nuclear weapons program.   Other members of the ATP consortium are ABB High Power Semiconductors,Pittsburgh; Diversified Technologies Inc., Bedford, Mass.; Empire HardChrome; IONEX, Bellaire, Mich.; Kwikset Corp., Anaheim, Calif.; LittonElectronic Devices, San Carlos, Calif.; NANO Instruments Inc., Oak Ridge,Tenn.; and PVI, Oxnard, Calif.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   DOE'S BARTLESVILLE LAB EXTENDS $100,000 FOR OIL-RECOVERY R&D   The Department of Energy's National Institute for Petroleum and EnergyResearch, Bartlesville, Okla., will provide $100,000 to James E. RussellPetroleum Inc. to improve a new process to clean water used in oil fieldoperations.   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsoredproject with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. RussellPetroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continueresearch on the project.   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into thereservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. Butimpurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to cleancoal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. Itwas unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective foronshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independentproducers, DOE said.   According to DOE, the original Russell Petroleum project showed that theair flotation device may make economic sense for many independentproducers. The company credits the technology with contributing to therecovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have been leftin the ground.   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producersdetermine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum designand operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost ofimplementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correctmethod of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class FieldDemonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oilproducers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells.   The Russell Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitationDOE issued to the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of theprogram. The department has recently requested proposals for follow-onprojects from participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of theprogram.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightFEDERAL TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 4, 1996   ENVIRONMENTAL EXPORT GROUP NAMES 2 LAB OFFICIALS TO BOARD   Representatives of two Department of Energy laboratories were recentlyappointed directors of the Environmental Export Council, a Washington-basedtrade association.

The system may also greatly reduce the volume of inorganic mixedwastes in storage at Department of Energy facilities like Los Alamos.   The electrochemical process works at room temperature and low pressureand runs on familiar direct-current electricity, the lab said. It does notproduce toxic fumes or secondary waste.   Heavy metals are removed and recovered. Cyanides and toxic organiccompounds are broken into harmless carbon dioxide and nitrogen. And all thework is done by electrons flowing through the solution.   The system may prove to be a boon to hospitals and industries thatproduce small volumes of hazardous waste, the lab said. Developing separatetreatment methods for each kind of waste is prohibitively expensive. Theelectrochemical process, in contrast, can treat many substances cheaply andsafely.   In December, Los Alamos began expanding the treatment system from abench-top experiment that handled less than 2 gallons per day to a pilotproject capable of treating the contents of a 55-gallon drum per day. JacekDziewinski, who leads the project, estimated about 90% of the inorganicmixed wastes at Los Alamos could be treated using this method.   Los Alamos is developing the treatment system in partnership withFaraday Technology Inc., Dayton, Ohio. The company is optimizing theprocess for industrial waste streams, especially those with heavy metals,while Los Alamos is working on mixed waste containing radioactivematerials.   The original work that led to the concepts developed by FaradayTechnology Inc. was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of theDepartment of Defense.

Described by NREL as an``important step in an overall process for producing ethanol andpotentially other commodity chemicals from cellulose biomass,'' thetechnology is part of a major project within a biofuels program that NRELmanages for the Department of Energy.   The project involves the conversion of a wide range of cellulosicbiomass items, such as agricultural and forestry residues, wastepaper,municipal solid waste, underutilized wood, waste from paper and pulpproduction, herbaceous energy crops, and woody energy crops, into ethanolas a transportation fuel.   Currently NREL is operating a process development unit (PDU) from whichit is gathering essential data for scaling up the pilot plant to a sizeable to commercialize the conversion of biomass to ethanol. Potentialcorporate partners would be encouraged to use the PDU infrastructure toevaluate pilot-scale or prototype equipment designs, the lab said.   With ethanol production from corn already providing over 1 billiongallons a year for fuel blending purposes, NREL feels that ``significantopportunities to further penetrate'' the oxygenate market in the shortterm, as well as supply of large amounts of near-pure ethanol for use as agasoline substitute, could exist if the costs of ethanol production fromcellulosic biomass could be lowered.   At this stage, NREL is only seeking ``expressions of interest'' frompotential partners and sees several possible collaborative mechanisms,including cooperative r&d agreements, cost-shared subcontracts, andresearcher exchanges.

Walton W. Welna reports that theproduct includes an intumescent material, a stabilizing agent andan elastomeric organic binder throughout which the intumescentmaterial and stabilizing agent are dispersed.Fire, smoke and fumes in confined spaces, such as multifloorbuildings, can be life threatening.  Frequently fire originating inthe space between a floor and ceiling of such a structure willspread, along with the resultant smoke and fumes, to other openspaces in the building, especially to open spaces above the pointof origin of the fire.  The spaces between conduits and piping andthe floors and ceilings through which they pass, or throughpenetrations, must be protected by fire resistant materials.  Athrough penetration offers an area of low resistance to fire, smokeand fumes and may serve as a chimney for heat, flame and fumes.Through penetrations may be filled with commercially available fireretardant and intumescent putties, caulks, wraps, sheets or mats,or firestops.Many commercially available firestop products can reduce oreliminate the chimney effect for through penetrations and pass therigorous ASTM E-814 fire endurance test.  After intumescing andcharring, the material is not easily blown out of penetrations whensubjected to water hose pressure typical of fire fightingconditions.  Essential characteristics of a firestop materialinclude the ability to expand and to char, and the charred materialmust have enough strength to withstand the test conditions.Although adequate firestops exist, the goal of 3M researchers wasto formulate a product which retains its expansion, low compressionset, and flexibility after long-term exposure to oxidativeenvironments.3M says that the new firestops are an improvement over existingproducts because they have superior aging properties, i.e., theyare more resistant to degradation due to ozone and/or oxygen.  Theyalso have low compression set in the unexpanded state, and superiorchar strength in the expanded state.  Finally, the firestops useingredients which are believed to be less toxic than those inconventional compositions.The intumescent material in the 3M product is a granular hydratedalkali metal silicate with an average particle size of 0.2-2.0millimeters (mm).  About 95% by weight of the particles are greaterthan 0.2 mm in size.  The alkali metal silicates which work bestare granulated sodium silicates with a moisture content of 5-30% byweight and a silicon dioxide (SiO2) to sodium oxide (Na2O) ratio inthe 2.0:1.0 to about 3.75:1.0 range.  The elastomeric binder is atleast partially crosslinked, and the stabilizing agent has amelting point of 105-125(C.  Enough of the stabilizing agent mustbe used to keep the composite expansion and compression setproperties stable, even after prolonged exposure to oxidativeconditions.  The 3M product is described in U.S. Patent 5,476,891.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Additives Can FurtherImprove PropertiesIt may be possible to find effective intumescent flame retardantadditives to further reduce the ignitability, heat release rate andsmoke generation of even the best flame retardant plastics,composites, adhesives, and fabrics, says a scientist at PolytechnicUniversity (Six Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201; Tel: 718/260-3715).  Edward D. Weil reports that in some cases there areempirical guidelines, and in other cases theory points ourpromising directions.Shifting the degradation pathway away from volatile fuel release tocrosslinking and/or the generation of vapors with low fuel valuesmay represent the likely basis for the highly effective phosphorus-based flame retardant systems in cellulose.  The degradation isshifted from volatile levoglucosan to the formation of crosslinkedchar.  Enhanced water release is undoubtedly another importantfactor.  A quantitative study of the thermal effects of flameretarding cellulose by alkali showed that the reduction of the fuelcontent of the volatiles counteracted the enhanced rate ofdegradation and enhanced volatile generation.Crosslinking, char enhancement and water release are probably themain modes of action of phosphorus flame retardants in certainother systems, i.e., in rigid urethane systems, reports Weil.Phosphorus flame retardants have several other distinct modes ofaction, including endothermic, radical scavenging and coatingeffects.Work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)has provided quantum chemical support for the concept thatcrosslinking should help flame retardancy.  The initial formationof thermally stable crosslinks begins the process of char formationand retards the formation of volatile fuels.  For instance, thedechloranes, together with certain metal oxides, are hightemperature vulcanizing agents for polyolefin elastomers.  Whenthey are used as flame retardants, the result is greatly increasedchar yield.This concept also works with a fairly wide range of thermoplasticswhere there is a functional group that can be exploited forpurposes of crosslinking.  Acid catalysts flame retard polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), apparently by causing anhydride links to form.In some cases, they cause crosslinks to form.Various other polymer-specific catalytic systems have been found.One is the action of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) as a catalyst for thetrimerization of the nitrile group in styrene-acrylonitrilecopolymers, with resultant char enhancement.  Sulfonate salt flameretardants, which work at very low levels in polycarbonates, arecatalysts for the formation of an intumescent char, althoughincreased carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution may also have an effect.Another polymer-specific additive that is almost surely catalyticis platinum used at low levels in peroxide-cured silica-filledsilicone rubbers.  The details of the catalytic effect of platinumare not clear, although it may somehow inhibit depolymerizaton ofthe siloxane structure.  This is one of the most effective flameretardants known, and it has a detectable effect at parts permillion (ppm) levels.  It provides reason to hope that other suchhighly efficient catalyst systems may be found.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Dow Corning's NewResin ModifiersA new family of resin modifiers in solid silicone powder form isbeing marketed by Dow Corning Corp. (Midland, MI 48686).  Marketedunder the somewhat confusing name "Si Powder Resin Modifiers," theproduct is a free flowing, 100% active silicone powder intended toenhance the physical properties of highly filled flame retardantthermoplastics, modify thermoplastic burning characteristics, andimprove processing efficiency.Dow Corning developed the additives to meet the needs ofcompounders and injection molders, who want the benefits of asilicone additive.  The second goal was to improve some of the fireperformance characteristics of plastics without negativelyaffecting processing and molding properties.  The Dow Corningcontact is Thomas Vassallo (Tel: 517/496-6289), Additives IndustryManager.Si Powder additives are believed to be compatible with halogenated,halogen-free and phosphorus-based flame retardant additives in awide variety of thermoplastic powders.  They are easy to compoundand can be premixed with thermoplastic pellets or powders.  Theadditives significantly reduce the rate of heat release and theevolution of smoke and carbon monoxide of burning plastics such aspolystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene and polycarbonate.Loading levels of 0.1-1.0% permit the resin modifiers to reduceextruder torque and power consumption and improve the surface glossof the final product, but loadings of 1.0-8.0% are required tomodify the burning characteristics of thermoplastics.Loadings of 3.0-5.0% can restore the impact resistance that flameretardant additives tend to produce, and levels in the 15% rangemay actually improve impact strength.  Such loadings can alsoreduce the required loadings of the primary flame retardantadditives.  The new modifiers are available in several grades withdifferent organic reactivity.The type of organic reactivity determines compatibility andperformance in particular applications.  The powders are availablein 5-pound samples, 100-pound fiber packs or in bulk.  Dow Corningis testing Si Powder additives for use in polyolefins, styrenics,vinyl resins, engineering thermoplastics, and thermoplasticelastomers.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Phosphorus-BasedMasterbatches DebutAlbright & Wilson Americas (Box 26229, Richmond, VA 23260) hasintroduced its trademarked Amgard CPC 400 Series of red phosphorus-based flame retardant masterbatches.  Mark Huggard says that theAmgard CPC 400 products include 50% red phosphorus in variouscarriers.  The nonhalogenated products do not require synergists toachieve maximum flame retardant performance.  All of the newproducts are solid pellets and are intended for use in nylon 6,nylon 6,6, polyamide and glass-filled polyamide resins.  End useapplications include wire and cable jacketing, extruded products,and injection molding resins.Advantages of the Amgard CPC 400 products include minimum loss ofphysical properties in compounded products, excellent thermalstability and chemical inertness.  They facilitate nonblooming infinal products and have minimal impact on the electrical propertiesof base polymers.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Composite WallsKeep Prisons SecureA composite security wall system with high impact performance andcompliant with certain fire codes has been built by engineers at GEPlastics (One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201; 800/845-0600 or413/448-7110).  Bruce M. Torrey reports that the security wall canbe employed in wall systems in institutions such as minimumsecurity prisons, detention areas, hospitals, asylums andpsychiatric facilities.The GE composite, more fully described in U.S. Patent 5,477,652,includes a thermoplastic polycarbonate sheet and a gypsum board drywall product laminated together with an adhesive.  The easy toinstall composite is then fastened to wall studs with thethermoplastic sheet on the inside, i.e., in contact with the wallstuds.Providing the building and construction industry with an easy toinstall, high impact and penetration resistant security wall systemhas proven difficult.  Current designs call for the installation ofmetal mesh with gypsum board or concrete or masonry wall products,which are heavy and costly to install.  Other gypsum type productsthat are double walled would add considerably to overallconstruction costs.  Since such security wall products requiredouble installation or expensive masonry or concrete products, asingle composite security wall system would significantly reduceoverall costs by being easy to install.One product on the market today that has been successfully used insecurity wall systems is a material with a gypsum core anddensified gypsum outer layers.  While this product provides higherimpact than standard gypsum, it must be double walled to provideenough security for institutional use.  Its impact resistance, 100foot pounds (ft. lbs.) or less, is not sufficient to meet therequirements of many applications.Other systems that have been used to provide impact performance andto meet building code requirements for fire resistance consist ofmasonry products or several (more than two) layers of gypsum board.Still other approaches call for the use of metal mesh welded tometal studs with gypsum board fastened over the metal mesh.  Thegypsum board in this system would actually be fastened to the metalwall studs.The polycarbonate sheet used in the GE system is normally about0.080 inch thick and does not exceed 0.125 inch.  Such a system canwithstand an impact of well in excess of 650 ft. lbs. on the drywall side.  In fact, the impact could not actually be measured,since the metal studs collapsed without the composite cracking orbreaking.  Other materials tested for impact failed at 100-200 ft.lbs. of impact.In addition to impact resistance, the composite also meets therequirement of the National Fire Protection Assn. (NFPA) LifeSafety Code 101 as "Limited Combustible" under NFPA Standard 295.This standard also requires the product to meet strict flame spread(ASTM E84) and BTU per lb. limits not exceeding 3500 BTU per lb. ofsample, as outlined in NFPA Standard 259.  A test sample of the newcomposite that included a 0.81 inch thick polycarbonate sheet,contact adhesive and gypsum wallboard 0.75 inch thick, whensubjected to the NFPA 259 and NFPA 101 Limited Combustibles tests,had a total BTU content of 1746 BTU's per lb. of content.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Foam Fills Holes inStructural ComponentsEngineers at BASF Corp. (3000 Continental Dr., Mt. Olive, NJ 07828-1234; Tel: 201/426-2600) have formulated flame retardant rigidpolyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams containing paraffinic basedoils intended for use in filling water-containing cavities instructural components.  Agus Sampara reports that BASF formulateda rigid polyurethane foam to which a base stock lubricating oilmade of at least 55% by weight of paraffinic carbons and less than10% by weight aromatic carbons was added.The hydrophobic agent protects the polyurethane foam from reactingwith environmental moisture.  The foam is intended for deposit inrailroad spike holes or any structural member with a cavity inwhich moisture would otherwise react with the isocyanate to producean uncontrollable foaming mass.Considerable attention is being directed toward repairing ratherthan replacing structural components, such as railroad ties, as amore efficient and cost effective means for extending the use ofthe whole structure.  When a section of rail must be replaced, orduring routine railroad maintenance, the rail is detached from theties by removing the spikes and tie plates, leaving behind railroadties having spike holes.  Before these railroad ties can be reused,the spike holes must be plugged to provide the tie with structuralintegrity and prevent water from accumulating within the hole androtting the wood.Various methods to plug spike holes have been proposed, includingdriving wooden dowels or metal inserts through the hole.  Thesemethods  are labor intensive and often leave gaps between theinsert and tie through. The gaps can be a place for water toaccumulate.An alternative approach is to plug the spike holes with a highdensity rigid polyurethane foam.  The problem is that environmentalwater or moisture in the holes causes the injected polyurethanecomposition to foam uncontrollably, resulting in an undesirable lowdensity foamed mass with low strength.  A proposed solution is ahydrophobic urethane employing a coal tar or a coal tar pitchadditive.The coal tar repels environmental water present and prevents waterfrom reacting with the foam ingredients.  Unfortunately, coal tarpitch is predominately composed of polynuclear aromatic compoundsincluding volatile components carcinogenic to humans such asanthracene, phenanthrene, and acridine.  Coal tar is also a knowncarcinogen and contains numerous aromatic volatiles toxic byinhalation.Consequently, the BASF engineers set out to find an alternative tocoal tar based rigid polyurethane foam products which would preventthe urethane composition from reacting with environmental water ormoisture, while reducing the carcinogenic health risks associatedwith the aromatic compounds in coal tar.The BASF rigid polyurethane/polyisocyanurate is produced byreacting an organic polyisocyanate with a polyol compound having atleast two isocyanate reaction hydrogens, a lubricating oil with abase stock having at least 55% by weight carbon atoms in paraffinicform and no more than 10% by weight carbon atoms in aromatic form,a foaming agent and a urethane promoting catalyst.  Crosslinkers,surfactants, emulsifiers and/or a trimerization catalyst to promotethe formation of the isocyanurate structure may also be used.  Theparaffinic based oil is a mixture of paraffinic and naphthenichydrocarbons and contains only trace amounts of aromatichydrocarbons.Among the flame retardants which may be used are pentabromodiphenyloxide, dibromopropanol, tris(b-chloropropyl)phosphate, 2,2-bis(-bromoethyl) 1,3-propanediol, tetrakis(2-chloroethyl) ethyldiphosphate, bis-(2-chloroethyl) 2-chloroethylphosphonate,molybdenum trioxide, ammonium molybdate, ammonium phosphate,pentabromodiphenyl oxide, tricresylphosphate,hexabromocyclododecane and dibromoethyl dibromocyclohexane.  Theseflame retardant additives are used in concentrations of 1-25 partsper 100 parts of polyol mixture.

(HerculesDr., Colchester, VT 05446; Tel: 802/655-2121, Fax: 802/655-2025).Howard F. McRae reports that the new product features a synergisticcombination of chemistry and irradiation for fabricating wire andcable insulation and heat shrinkable tubing.  Other advantages arebelieved to include improved tensile strength and elongation.Superior insulating construction materials such as tiles and wallboards can be produced by a polycondensation process in whichcarboxyl groups of an olefinic base are linked with the silanolgroups of a silicone material.  The silanol groups are linked withhydroxyl groups contained in a hydrated fire retardant filler toprovide an insulation that tolerates high loadings of the flameretardant.  Although crosslinking in these formulations allow theinclusion of large amounts of fire retardant filler materials inthe insulation, they cannot be processed into wire insulation ofcommercial quality.One of the drawbacks is that they cannot be easily extruded.Another difficulty is their characteristically substandard tensilestrength, elongation and flexibility.  The increased crosslinkingof these formulations, while improving the fire retardancy throughhigher flame retardant loadings, binds the polymer chains to theextent that flexibility and elongation are impaired.  Suchoverbinding, while useful in tiles and wall construction materialswhich are not commercially affected by the reduced flexibility andelongation, hinders performance in wire and cable insulation.The Champlain Cable product reflects the discovery that commercialgrade insulation for wire and cable, particularly plenum wire andcable and heat shrinkable tubing, can be fabricated by reducing thecrosslinking of the components of the polycondensation process.Conventional insulation chemistry utilizes olefinic base materialscontaining 6% carboxyl groups by weight, too high a percentage forfabricating commercial grades of wire insulation.  Champlainreduced the range of carboxyl groups to about 1% by weight of thebase material.Champlain subjected the new formulations to electron beamirradiation to improve the tensile strength, and to allow generallyhigher loadings of the flame retardant additive.  Normally, whengreater amounts of filler materials are employed, the tensilestrength and elongation decrease.  Irradiation often improvestensile strength, but had never been found to increase theelongation.It was shown that without the silanol groupings, the resultantformulation does not demonstrate an increase in elongation afterirradiation. On the other hand, there is a synergy between thechemistry of the Champlain product and the irradiation, in whichthe combination of the two processes provides an increase in bothtensile strength, to 1,000-2,000 psi, and elongation, to 370-450%.The hydroxyl-containing fire retardant filler used in theinsulation is normally magnesium hydroxide, but alumina trihydratemay also be employed.  The formulation, which permits flameretardant additive loadings three times as high as those inconventional insulation, has greatly improved flame retardancy.Oxygen indices of 42-72 have been achieved.  U.S. Patent RE35127,a reissue of U.S. Patent 5,063,266, details the new Champlain Cablework.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Ceramic CompositeShaped for FurnacesA new shaped ceramic composite material produced at 3M (St. Paul,MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110) is intended for use inapplications requiring good heat resistance and mechanicalproperties, such as gas fired radiant burner tubes, gas burnernozzle liners, heat exchangers, thermowells, core busters or flamedispersers and other gas fired furnace components.  Robert G. Smithreports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coatingof a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,and a silicon carbide coating.Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosiveenvironments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnacesand aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types ofcommercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers andceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper usetemperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with anupper use a temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, theyare generally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problemof conventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible toselect a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare aradiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use inhigh temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is onlypossible by taking great care in the selection of materials and bymaking some compromises in properties.The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon and has athickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.  The 3Mproduct includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-20.0%by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boron nitride,and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.  U.S. Patent 5,476,684 wasassigned for this invention.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Zirconium LowersSmoke GenerationFlame retarded wool fibers with a zirconium-based finish are thechoice of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group (Pacific Highway S.,Seattle, WA 98188; Tel: 206/394-3111) for use in decorativeapplications in commercial aircraft, says the company's Sally A.Hasselbrack.  Although the company is continuing to perfect thesematerials, the zirconium materials have shown an outstandingacceptance of dyestuffs, inherent resistance to burning, ease offlame retardance, and great capacity to tolerate the wear and tearof service in aircraft.Hasselbrack credits the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)Regulation (FAR) 25, Appendix F, Part II with facilitating the newflammability testing that will save many lives in post-crash fires.The regulation uses a more realistic ignition source to initiatecombustion during simulations of post-crash fires.  It alsomandates retroactive coverage for the entire U.S. commercial airfleet.  The Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft were the first to includedesign guidelines stipulating the incorporation of materials withlimited smoke and toxic gas emission whenever possible.Early technology for decorative fibers in aircraft interiorsincorporated the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fibers in the warpand a phosphorus-based flame retardant finish on the wool fillingyarns.  Research performed at the Ilkley, West Yorkshire, U.K.-based International Wool Secretariat (IWC) then led to a zirconiumand titanium compound-based Zirpro flame retarding finish for woolfibers.Requirements for textile products applied to vertical surfaces,e.g., wall tapestries, are covered by FAR 25 amendments.  To meetthese requirements, tetrabromophthalic acid (TBPA) is used incombination with the Zirpro treatment.  The success of this systemis due to the synergism between the zirconium finish, which worksin the solid phase, and the organobromine acid, which works in thevapor phase.  The IWC, newly renamed Wools of New Zealand (WNZ),recommends two forms of the TBPA compound: an emulsified paste witha 40% bromine content, and a liquid form of disodium salt oftetrabromophthalic anhydride with a 15% bromine content.The utilization of TBPA is an essential part of Boeing's washablewool program, the company's latest area of interest for flameretarded wool.  When flame retardant washable wool first becameavailable, about 10 years ago, shrinkage after the first launderingwas 5-7%.  Shrinkage with subsequent launderings was minimal.Since a strong correlation exists between dimensional stability andabrasion, or wear resistance, Boeing did not initially use theproduct.  As more Boeing 737s were sold to developing nations, thecompany received an increasing number of requests for a washableflame retardant product that would meet the shrinkage andappearance requirements of the airline industry.  A new effort wasinitiated to reduce shrinkage to 2% over 15 launderings.The WNZ says that any type of shrink resistant process must becompatible with the Zirpro process, because the Zirpro process isthe only existing flame retardant process for wool durable towashing.  The organization's suggested techniques for the shrinktreatment of wool include a chlorine-based treatment applied to thefiber in its worsted tops form, and to the woven, dyed fabric by apadding process.  WNZ recommends that the weight of the fabricshould not fall below 11 ounces per square yard (oz/yd2) and thatonly 100% wool fabrics should be used.  Both shrinkage andappearance retention are improved by using a tightly woven fabric.At 14 oz/yd2 the materials can withstand 19-20 launderings.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Lowering the Rateof Heat ReleaseHelping furniture manufacturers produce upholstered furniture withlow rates of heat release is the intent of researchers at theNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  ThomasOhlemiller (Tel: 301/975-6481) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. findsthat the flammability of upholstered furniture continues to be asubstantial problem in both residential and public occupancies.Both smoldering and flaming ignition problems exist.  Thesmoldering problem, existing primarily in residences, is beingaddressed through a voluntary industry program and by theconsideration of regulations covering cigarette ignitionpropensity.  The flaming ignition problem and its consequences interms of heat release are being addressed in differing manners,depending on the type of occupancy in the building in which thefurniture is used.  California Technical Bulletin 133 requires thatpublic occupancy furniture respond to an arson-like 18 kilowatt(kW) igniter with a peak heat release rate of 80 kW.This severe test has encouraged the development of barriertechnology, which involves a protective fabric layer in upholsterybetween the foam and the outer layer of fabric.  Such technology isbelieved to be cost effective since it is not meeting strongindustry resistance.  On the other hand, there are so manyvariables in furniture design that only very large companies areable to perform the large number of empirical tests needed toensure compliance across their product line.  This, coupled withthe technical attractiveness of barriers for controlling heatrelease in any upholstered furniture, has prompted BFRL's ongoingefforts to develop a quantitative understanding of the variousfactors that control the heat release curve using mockupscontaining various barrier fabrics.In the study, BFRL will characterize the relationships betweensmall scale test data and full scale mockup behavior.  The focus ison mockups containing a barrier fabric.  The results of relatedwork by the Association for Contract Textiles and the EuropeanCommunity will also be considered.  After completing the barriereffects of several fabrics in  a fixed mockup geometry, BFRL willsystematically vary the geometry.  This calls for a series ofmockups involving a very limited material selection, but widevariations in seat, seatback and arm cushion dimensions.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Curable PrintedCircuit BoardsCurable flame retardant resins intended for use as the basicmaterial in printed circuit boards has been prepared by Gurit-Essex(Papiermuhlestrasse 155, CH 3063 Ittigen-Bern, Switzerland; Tel: 31580388) scientists.  Herbert Schriber, Gunter Burkart, and BrunoKnaus report that the new formulation includes a thermally curable1-oxa-3-aza tetraline group-containing compound, a curable epoxycompound, and a flame retardant.  The flame retardant additive maybe aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, elemental redphosphorus, oxygen acids of phosphorus, inorganic salts of oxygenacids of phosphorus, polyphosphates, boric acid, or salts of boricacid.Although bromine-based flame retardant additives impart therequired flame retardance to resins used in the manufacture ofprinted circuit boards, they can generate poisonous and/orcorrosive gases when exposed to fire.  As a result the Gurit-Essexresearchers sought a nonhalogenated alternative to flame retard theresins.  U.S. Patent 5,443,911 explains the Gurit-Essex work indetail.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Formulation Doesn'tCorrode MachineryA new transparent, flame retardant, aromatic, polycarbonate resinformulated by scientists at Teijin, Ltd. (1-11 Minamihonmachi,Higashi-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/268 2132, Fax: 6/266 1481)does not corrode the molding machinery used to process the resininto plastic components.  Masahiro Miyouga and Shinichi Soudareport that the new resin is highly transparent and includes 100parts by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, 0.01-1.00 partby weight of a perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt and 0.02-2.00 parts by weight of a halogenated triaryl phosphate flameretardant in which at least one halogen atom is substituted on thering-forming carbon of each aromatic hydrocarbon group.Aromatic polycarbonate resins have many excellent properties whichfacilitate their widespread use, but they are also quitecombustible and require high loadings of flame retardant additiveswhen used in applications where flame retardancy is required.Several conventional methods for imparting this flame retardancyare used.One is the incorporation of an organic halogen compound.  Forexample, a polycarbonate oligomer obtained from tetrabromobisphenolA as a dihydroxy component is often used in amounts that make thebromine concentration in the final resin 5-15% by weight.  Inanother instance, a carbonate copolymer obtained fromtetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol A as dihydroxy components isused in amounts to make the bromine concentration 5-9% by weight.The problem is that when an aromatic polycarbonate resin containingsuch a bromine-based flame retardant is molded or processed, themachinery will most likely corrode.Increasing the bromine concentration increases the corrosion.  Thegoal of the Teijin researchers was to develop an aromaticpolycarbonate resin that would reduce corrosive tendencies, whilemaintaining excellent flame retardancy.One approach is the use of formulations that include 100 parts byweight of a halogen-free conventional polycarbonate resin with amolecular weight of 10,000-30,000, 5-60 parts by weight of ahalogen-free ultrahigh molecular-weight polycarbonate resin with amolecular weight of 100,000-250,000 and 5-20% by weight of a flameretardant.  The use of ultrahigh molecular weight resins isexpensive, though, and handling such materials is difficult.  Inaddition, the resulting compositions have low transparency, andtheir molding and processing characteristics are only mediocre.Bromine-free flame retardants may also be used in conventionalmolecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resins.  For example,potassium perfluoroalkanesulfonate decreases the production ofcorrosive gas, but, when used in high enough loadings to impartsufficient flame retardancy, it decreases the heat stability of theresin.The Teijin breakthrough was the discovery that when potassiumperfluoroalkanesulfonate is combined with a small amount ofhalogenated triaryl phosphate and incorporated into an aromaticpolycarbonate resin, the resin maintains its flame retardancy andtransparency can be retained, but corrosive tendencies aredecreased.  The perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt containsan alkyl group with 1-8 carbon atoms, and the hydrogen atoms of thealkyl group are replaced by fluorine atoms.  The alkali metal inthe salt is potassium or sodium.Other examples of usable salts include potassiumperfluorobutanesulfonate and sodium perfluorooctanesulfonate. Thehalogenated triaryl phosphate flame retardant must be free ofimpurities such as salts and phosphate ester halides.  Theseimpurities cause turbidity and decreased transparency in the finalresin.  The Teijin work is more fully described in U.S. Patent5,478,874.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996New Encapsulant forSemiconductor DevicesA new flame retardant epoxy molding compound, formulated byresearchers at Dexter Corp. (Franklin St., Olean, NY 14760; Tel:716/372-6300, Fax: 716/372-6864), is intended for use in theencapsulation of semiconductor devices.  Anthony A. Gallo reportsthat epoxy resin compounds have often been used for encapsulationof semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits (IC), largescale integrated circuits (LSI), transistors, and diodes and otherelectronic components.  Such encapsulants generally comprise anepoxy, a hardener, a catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, acolorant, a coupling agent and a flame retardant system.Conventional flame retardant epoxy molding compounds use systemsthat can include halogenated compounds, transition metal oxides andhydrated alumina.  The problem is that at high temperatures, theseflame retardant additives detract from the compatibility of theencapsulant with semiconductor devices.  Other applicable flameretardant systems include an organic phosphine compound andantimony oxide; and antimony trioxide or antimony tetraoxide andhalogenated compounds.Although these conventional flame retardant combinations providereasonable flame retardance and satisfactory compatibility onelectronic devices, the Dexter researchers believed that there wasa need for products with improved high temperature compatibilityand performance, and lower cost and toxicity.The new Dexter formulation, detailed in U.S. Patent 5,476,716,includes an epoxy, a novolac or anhydride type hardener, acatalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a colorant and a couplingagent.  The flame retardant system includes a halogen-containingorganic compound, and either antimony pentoxide or magnesium oxide.The halogen-containing organic compound may include either chlorineor bromine.  Examples include polyglycidyl ether ofbromophenolformaldehyde novolac, halogenated bisphenol A and itsderivatives such as tetrabromobisphenol A, and glycidyl ethers ofhalogenated resins such as the diglycidyl ether oftetrabromobisphenol A.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 19963M Continues Questof Halon AlternativesOmega-hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds can be used as chemical fireextinguishing agents in streaming applications, total flooding andexplosion suppression and inertion, report scientists at 3M (St.Paul, MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  These chemicals are underconsideration as replacements in fire extinguishing applicationswherein applications where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or halons have been used.Because of a steady flow of bad news about the damagedstratospheric ozone layer, the deadlines for the end toindustrialized countries' production of CFCs and other ozonedepleting chemicals were accelerated by countries who are partiesto the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the OzoneLayer.  Research has been initiated to replace all CFCs and halons,such as CCl2F2, CCl3F, CF3Br and CCl2FCClF2, with substitute oralternative compounds and technologies.A number of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), e.g., CH2FCF3, or HFC-134a,are being used or have been proposed as CFC substitutes.  HFC-134ais more ozone friendly.  HCFCs, such as CH3CCl2F, or HCFC-141b, areCFC substitutes, but although they are not nearly as damaging,these substitutes do carry ozone depleting chlorine into thestratosphere.  Another proposed substitute is the simple omega-hydrodifluoromethyl perfluoromethyl ether (CF3OCF2H).Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers formulated by 3M are hydrophobic andless oleophobic than the perfluoroalkyl ether analogs, chemicallyinert, thermally stable, water insoluble and normally liquid at20(C.  They can be produced in high yield and high purity and witha wide range of molecular weights.  The covalent bond between theomega-hydrogen and terminal carbon, i.e., the carbon-hydrogen bond,is generally degradable by atmospheric photooxidation, making theomega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers environmentally acceptable.3M's George G.I. Moore discloses that these normally liquid, omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds (and some their mixtures) have asaturated perfluoroaliphatic chain of carbon atoms interrupted byone or more ether oxygen atoms.  The compounds can be prepared bythe decarboxylation of the corresponding fluoroalkyl ethercarboxylic acids.  U.S. Patent 5,476,974 details the 3M omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Testing the Limitsof ReplacementsThe lean flammability limit of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacementrefrigerants will be ascertained by a team of researchers at theNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  CaroleWomeldorf (Tel: 301/975-4415) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. reportsthat hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-32 and a mixture of HFC-32 and HFC-125are the refrigerants under study.  These materials are beingconsidered as replacements for ozone depleting CFCs.A critical element in the risk analysis of alternative refrigerantsis the lean flammability limit.  Variations in the flammabilitylimit can occur, depending on the initial conditions chosen forconducting the test.  There is a need to eliminate these variationsand to establish invariant, fundamental lean flammability limitswhich can be attributed to refrigerant mixtures in a manner similarto fundamental thermodynamic properties like enthalpy of formationand adiabatic flame temperature.BFRL will modify an existing burner facility to operate in asymmetrical, adiabatic mode with independent control of the gaseousrefrigerant and air flows.  The burner will be calibrated usingmethane to ensure that the facility is capable of reproducing thepublished values of the lean flammability limit.  Stoichiometricflames of HFC-32 and air will be examined.  The flow velocity willbe varied to establish the extinction strain rate and to identifythe dynamic range of the burner using a less flammable fuel.  Thefuel/air equivalence ratio will be varied about the stoichiometricpoint, and the strain rate will be adjusted to identify the mostrobust mixture (normally slightly rich for hydrocarbon flames).The lean flammability limit of HFC-32 can be found using the zerostrain rate extrapolation method.  The critical flammability ratiocan be found by slowly increasing the fraction of HFC-125 in theHFC/air mixture while maintaining the overall equivalence ratio andstrain rate, or by fixing the concentrations of all constituentsand slowly increasing the strain rate by reducing the spacingbetween the upper and lower burners.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996M.A. Hanna toAcquire CIMCOM.A. Hanna Co.

The Life Safety code, which provides basicrequirements for safety in buildings during emergencies, includesprovisions for building design, construction, operation andmaintenance to protect occupants from fire, smoke and toxic gases.The latest edition of the code ensures that public safetyrequirements are current and continue to be met.  NFPA works withlocal authorities to help them implement code requirements andencourages officials to adopt updated versions of its codes andstandards.In the U.S., all health care facilities that receive Medicare orMedicaid funding must comply with the Life Safety Code, accordingto federal requirements.  To date, 33 states have adopted andenforce the code, which requires that new and existing buildingsallow for "prompt escape" or that a means to provide people with areasonable degree of safety is considered.  Key provisions includerequirements that locks and hardware on doors must be installed topermit free escape, exits must be marked by readily visible signs,any door in a means of egress must be capable of swinging to theopen position to allow for the full use of the opening, andevacuation signals must be audible and visible."Adoption and enforcement of state-of-the-art codes and standardsis a proven method for reducing fire loss," says NFPA presidentGeorge D.

McAvoy reports that incorporating intelligence into afire detector so that it can recognize signature patterns isintended to permit prompt fire detection, while allowing thedetector to discriminate between signatures from fire and nonfiresources.  The primary purpose of this initial University ofMaryland work was to investigate the patterns of signaturesassociated fire and environmental sources using small scaleexperiments.The scientists generated products from a wide range of conditions,from flaming or pyrolyzing samples to heated samples and thoseobtained with an atomizer.  They also measured gas concentrations,light obscuration and temperature to characterize the products.  Inanalyzing the data, they were able to identify trends from which anelementary expert system can be built to identify the source ofairborne products.McAvoy, writing in Fire and Technology, 31(2), reports that severalpatterns were evident.  The maximum carbon dioxide (CO2)concentrations achieved during experiments with flaming fires aresignificantly greater than the maximum CO2 concentrations achievedduring experiments with nonflaming fires (pyrolyzing fires, heatedliquids and environmental odors).  The nonflaming sources can beidentified based on the carbon monoxide (CO) and metal oxide sensorpeak measurements.  Except for three experiments using pyrolyzingsolids, the peak CO concentration is greater--though the detectorresponse is less--for nonflaming fires than for environmentalsources.The researchers built and tested an elementary neural network whichproperly classified all fires except for one pyrolyzing event.Based on this preliminary work, commercial fire detection systemsbased on the analysis of airborne products appears feasible.Additional research is needed to identify the optimum types andnumber of sensors that should be coupled to provide promptdetection between various sources.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Smoke and DustParticles SensedA smoke detector capable of sensing both smoke and fine particlessuch as dust has been constructed by engineers at Hochiki Corp. (2-10-43 Kamiosaki, Shinagawa-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/444 4111, Fax:3/447 1388).  Conventional  photoelectric analog smoke sensorsinclude a light emitting chamber and a light receiving chamber.The light receiving chamber is placed in a position where it doesnot directly receive light from the light emitting chamber.Diffused light caused by smoke is detected in the light receivingchamber, and a signal corresponding to the smoke density isobtained.  A drive circuit for light emitting elements such aslight emitting diodes (LEDs) is located in the light emittingchamber, and a light receiving signal amplifying circuit with anelement, such as a photodiode, is located in the light receivingchamber.  When diffused light caused by smoke is detected by thelight receiving element, a signal at a level corresponding to thesmoke density is photoelectrically converted by the photodiode andthen amplified.  In this way, a conventional smoke detector obtainsthe analog signal having output characteristics required by anautomatic fire notification system.The problem is that in such an analog sensor, the integrated amountof diffused light is detected.  As a result, only a small amount oflight is present in the area where the volume of fine particlescaused by a fire is small.  It is, therefore, not possible todetect a very small amount of smoke generated in the initial periodof a fire.  Since fine particles such as dust cannot be detected bythe these sensors, it is not possible to distinguish dust and watervapor from smoke, nor to distinguish environmental abnormalitiessuch as the contamination of the inside of the chamber at the sametime smoke is detected.Atsushi Manmoto and Yukio Yamauchi report that the Hochiki detectormakes use of a light emitting device that projects a light beamonto a monitor area.  A light receiving device is arranged so thatinstead of receiving the light beam directly, it receives diffusedlight caused by fine particles, i.e., dust or smoke, entering themonitor area.  The output from the light receiving device isamplified and counted and its average value per unit of time iscomputed.  The result is that the signals caused by environmentaldust and smoke from fires can be differentiated, leading to a morereliable instrument.

Their intent, reports Michael M. Kostreva, professor ofMathematical Sciences, was to analyze the approach of the existingHAZARD I fire model and to evaluate and demonstrate newly obtainedresults on the mathematical foundations of fire models.While HAZARD I is an established computer tool for modeling firesin residential buildings, it lacks sensitivity analysiscapabilities.  Such a feature would allow users to betterunderstand the influence of certain input data on the computationalresults.  This understanding could be translated into better use ofresources for gathering data and generally enhanced credibility ofthe modeling results.  HAZARD I has successfully incorporated asuccession of increasingly complex fire models, including FAST,CFAST and CONRAD 2.  A corresponding set of models equipped withsensitivity analysis capabilities are needed.Earlier approaches to fire model sensitivity analysis made use ofthe simple ASET model.  The Clemson approach involved the ASET,FAST, CFAST and CONRAD 2 models.  These include local methods offinite difference type, along with the direct methods which usesome additional differential equations.  Global methods, whichinvolve averaging over a collection of preselected scenarios, werenot considered.The results, relevant sets of input parameters and model outputs,were accumulated in tabular form.  Examples of presently availablezone fire models have been assembled, along with the relevantparameters for fires involving up to four rooms.  Kostreva foundthat a limited sensitivity analysis, considering a carefullyselected subset of input parameters, is feasible, even for the morecomplex models.  The graphical presentation of the resultsfacilitate a good quantitative understanding of the underlyingrelationships.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996MIT SimulatesFire PlumesMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Dept. of MechanicalEngineering, Cambridge, MA 02139) scientists are building acomputationally-based large fire plume model in which buoyant fluidmechanics, combustion, radiative transport and their mutualinteractions are all fundamentally represented using physicallysound approximations.  Ahmed F. Ghoniem (Tel: 617/253-2295) reportsthat the approximations will be well resolved, both spatially andtemporally.  The model's computational efficiency, achieved bysimulating each of the processes, will allow the performance ofpractical simulations on an advanced engineering workstation.The simulation of fire plumes yielding burning rates, pollutantformation rates and the radiation field is necessary as a tool forthe assessment of the environmental impact of large fires.Computational modeling of these fires is complicated by thepresence of several complex physical processes, includingturbulence, transport and chemistry.  The wide range of physicalscales in these processes complicates their numerical modeling evenfurther.  The overall dynamics of the process is essentiallyunsteady, and conventional numerical approaches could be veryexpensive, since the domains of these fires are often extremelylarge.To overcome these difficulties, the MIT investigators are preparinga computational model of fire plumes based on a simulation of allof the significant physical processes involved.  They are employingthe vortex method to obtain solutions of some of the equationsinvolved, including the buoyancy and baroclinic terms, usingcomputational elements distributed along the layer separating theplume (fuel and products) and the surrounding air and products inthe turbulent regime.Mixing and combustion processes are simulated using the transportelement method in which only species concentration and temperaturegradients are computed, and only where vortex elements exist.  Fastchemistry assumption is used in the computation of the burningrate, temperature and major species distribution.  Theconcentration of the computational elements within the narrow zoneof plume boundaries provides this approach with the necessaryefficiency.An extensive validation study of both the isothermal plume and thereacting plume models has been performed.  For the isothermalplume, the relationship between the puffing frequency and the pooldiameter has been established and the results compared withexperimental data.  For the reacting case, they repeated the samestudy and obtained good agreement with experimental data.In both cases, they concluded that puffing is a buoyancyinstability formed at the base of the plume near the pool due tothe tendency of the rising plume to accelerate upward, therebyreducing the plume diameter below that of the pool.  The conicalinterface is subject to gravitational instability which leads tothe roll-up of the material interface and the concomitant puffing.This puffing is responsible for the strong entrainment field intothe fire plume and the high upward penetration of the flames.Ghoniem's team will next incorporate a soot formation model and aliquid-gas interface boundary condition at the pool surface.  Thesoot formation model is necessary for the computation of theradiative transport fluxes, which contribute significantly to thefuel evaporation and pyrolysis.  The liquid-gas interface conditionis intended to establish a physical basis for determining thevaporization rate of the fuel.  A radiative-based transportalgorithm will also be constructed and incorporated.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Occupant and FuelLoad DeterminedA project at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742;Tel: 301/405-1000) is intended to provide a method for determiningthe occupant load in a wide variety of both open plan andcompartmented office buildings for use in fire safety planning.James A. Milke reports that the work will also determine how tocollect fuel load data for office spaces.  The problem is thatquestions have been raised concerning the accuracy of currentlyaccepted occupant and fuel loads.  The subject arose afterpreliminary studies were conducted in open plan and compartmentedoffice buildings.The researchers first reviewed current occupant load surveyprocedures and data collection forms.  In an occupant loadanalysis, two parameters are needed: the number of buildingoccupants at any given time and the area of floor space.  Theapproach is to count building occupants present during a surveyalong with unoccupied workstations which appear to be occupiedunder normal conditions.  Counting individuals not actually attheir workstations is an obvious source of inaccuracy.  Inaddition, an improved methodology would account for guests orvisitors in a given building, along with people involved withmaintenance and custodial work and building contractors.  Most ofthese individuals may be readily identified due to their differentworking attire.A preliminary version of a revised data collection form andprocedure was then prepared which reduces the obvious inaccuraciesin the conventional approach.  The new approach was thensuccessfully used to conduct occupant load surveys in public andprivate sector office spaces in the metropolitan Washington, DC,area.  The research team is now preparing their approach forevaluating the fuel load evaluation which involves surveying officespaces prepared for moving.  It is said to significantly simplifythe current procedure which includes weighing or estimating theweight of the materials in office spaces.Back to Headline List CopyrightFLAME RETARDANCY NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 1996Characterizing PolymerFlammability at NISTCharacterizing polymer flammability is the objective of a newproject at the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab(BFRL).  Jeffrey Gilman (Tel: 301/975-6573) and Takashi Kashiwagi(Tel: 301/975-6699), both of BFRL's Fire Science Div., willdetermine the chemical structure of polymer residues generatedunder well defined fire conditions for the purpose of determiningthe links between original polymer structure, nonhalogenatedadditives, char characteristics and flammability properties ofpolymeric materials.Two trends starting to significantly affect the U.S. plasticsindustry are polymer recycling and a demand for nonhalogenatedflame retardant treatments.  The degradation products of polymersflame retarded with halogenated additives are corrosive, and somemay be toxic.  One alternative approach to flame retarding polymersis to form a char during burning.  This approach is ideal in thatcarbon atoms retained in the condensed phase, as char, lessen theavailable fuel for flaming combustion even as they help to insulatethe polymer from the heat of the flame.  Presently, though, thereis very little quantitative information about the relationshipbetween polymer structure, char properties, the effect ofnonhalogenated additives and realistic flammability properties.BFRL will evaluate polymer/additive systems using its conecalorimeter to find those with improved flammability behavior.Preceramic polymer/organic polymer blends will be prepared andevaluated.  The solid state decomposition chemistry of thepromising candidates will then be characterized, and samples atintermediate stages of composition will be generated from thepreceramic/organic polymer blends in an inert flow pyrolysisapparatus at many different temperatures.  Char yield,aromatic/aliphatic ratio and crosslink density will be measured.For higher heating rate conditions, the samples will be evaluatedunder fire-like, nonoxidizing conditions in a gasificationapparatus which exposes large compression molded 100 gram disksamples to a radiant heat source of 25-40 kilowatts per squaremeter in a gaseous nitrogen atmosphere.

The blending ofpolymers offers attractive opportunities for achievingunique property combinations and for improvingmechanical toughness, but it requires knowing how tocontrol interactions to achieve miscibility or phase-separated blends with proper interfacial coupling.Without controlled interactions, blends do not performas desired and some strategy for compatibilization isnecessary.  In order to obtain useful mechanicalproperties, preformed block or graft copolymers may beadded to act as interfacial agents, or they may beformed in situ by reaction of suitably chosenfunctionalized polymeric components for control ofphase morphology and the interface between the phases.(This 1991 conference paper was recently made availableas a reprint.)(Order this INNOVATOR'S DIGEST reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

The first phase of the research isconcerned with the generation of in situ compositeswhere the LCP fibrils are directly generated duringprocessing.  Because the formation of in situcomposites requires extensional deformation, thefibrils are highly oriented in one direction, leadingto materials having highly anisotropic mechanicalproperties.  Methods for reducing the mechanicalanisotropy of in situ composites are also studied.  Thedesire to reduce the mechanical anisotropy leads topregeneration of LCP fibrils using a novel dualextrusion technique.  The materials containing thepregenerated microfibrils, referred to asmicrocomposites, are then processed at temperatureswhere the LCP fibrils are not melted, and themechanical   anisotropy of injection-moldedmicrocomposites is reduced.  The report covers researchconcerned with the in situ composites, the process forgenerating the microcomposites, and the results of theprocessing studies.(Order this INNOVATOR'S DIGEST reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

Themonomers are prepared by reactingN, N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide and theappropriate amine in refluxing water.  A variety ofsubstituted aniline compounds have been synthesized todemonstrate that polymer film formation most likelyoccurs by a head-to-tail coupling of the anilinemoieties.  The electrochemistry of thepolymer-film-coated electrode in supporting electrolyteonly displays well-defined responses for the ferroceneportion of the polymer, and is not complicated byvoltammetric responses of the supposed polyanilinebackbone.  These films are stable, with continuouspotential cycling showing less than 5% diminution inthe oxidative and reductive currents over 50 repetitivescans.

Theteam met with representatives of 31 universities,government ministries and institutes, companies, andassociations.  Japan's national program onbiodegradable polymers and plastics evaluates newtechnologies, testing methods, and potential marketsfor biodegradables.  The program is coordinated by theBiodegradable Plastics Society of Japan, which seeks toachieve world leadership in biodegradable polymertechnology and identify commercial opportunities forexploiting this technology.The team saw no major new technology breakthroughs.Japanese scientists and engineers are focusing on:natural polymers from renewable resources; syntheticpolymers; and bacterially-produced polymers such aspolyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(amino acids), andpolysaccharides.  The major polymers receivingattention are: the Zeneca PHBV copolymers; Biopol(tm);poly(lactic acid) from several sources;polycaprolactone; and the new synthetic polyester,Bionolle(tm) from Showa High Polymer.

Sol-gel ceramic synthesis hasdrawn much interest in recent years.  In production,1-5 organometallic molecules, usually metal alkoxides,are polymerized in an alcohol/water solution withdissolved acids or bases to form a ceramic or glassmaterial having exquisite chemical and microstructuralcontrol.  Since the chemistry and microstructure of thesolid determine its properties, this technology can beused to design materials having specified mechanical,optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties.These  materials  may  be monoliths, films, fibers, orpowders.  Sol-gel synthesis offers a degree of controlof composition and structure at the molecular levelthat is unachievable with traditional sintering orprecipitation methods.  It also offers an economicalalternative to layered vapor deposition manufacture ofcoatings and fibers.  Owing to their controlledchemistry and microstructure, sol-gel ceramics can bedensified at much lower temperatures than conventionalsintering temperatures, thereby saving energy andprotecting delicate structures in the material itselfor in its substrates.  The microstructure can also becontrolled to produce optical films, catalyst supports,monolithic ceramic bodies, etc.  Since the precursormolecules are pure and dissolved, atomic placement andbonding can be controlled in order to `tune' themechanical/optical properties.(Order this INNOVATOR'S DIGEST reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

Compacts are formed fromidentical powder mixtures by both gelcasting andpressing, and are nitrided and sintered to produceSRBSN ceramics.  The characterization of the samplesinclude measurement of: green density; green andnitrided pore structure; weight gain duringnitridation; final density; microstructure; toughness;and flexural strength.  It is found that a more uniformpore structure exists in the green gelcast samples, andit is believed that this pore configuration aids innitridation and manifests itself in a more uniformfinal microstructure.  In addition, improved mechanicalproperties are achieved in the gelcast samples.  Theseimprovements are attributed to green microstructurehomogeneity.(Order this INNOVATOR'S DIGEST reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

The workshopfocused on both fundamental and applied aspects of theself-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS)process.  The goal was to identify and suggestapproaches to remedy the generally acknowledged gapsthat exist in our detailed quantitative understandingof the essential chemistry and physics of the SHSprocess.  The applied topics focussed on the rathermore practical aspects of the SHS process, in order tohelp prioritize the fundamental studies in such a waythat our enhanced understanding leads to improvedSHS-based advanced materials fabrication methods.  Thetwo topic areas are, of course, interrelated:fundamental studies can enhance commercializationpotential, and technological market-driven needs cansuggest important fundamental  science-driven studies.The workshop allowed many of the world's key, presentlyactive, SHS researchers to discuss the state-of-the-artand remaining work of SHS research, and to initiatemeaningful collaborative research projects between U.S.and Russian scientists.(Order this INNOVATOR'S DIGEST reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

A typical,and important reaction of this type is the acid- orbase-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate(TEOS): Si(OC2H5)4 + 2H2O ---> SiO2 + 4C2H5OH.  Theformed gel is dried to remove unreacted TEOS, ethanol,water, and catalyst (which is generally chosen to bevolatile).  It is then fired into a porous ceramic,which may then be densified into the final ceramicobject.There are numerous advantages for generating ceramicsin this way, including: increased purity; lowerprocessing temperatures (permitting survival of organicguest molecules); control of ultrastructure (at thenanometer level); the possibility of adding a newmaterial to the pores prior to densification; and therelative ease in preparing ceramic alloys.  This(University of Cincinnati) paper present a review oforganic-inorganic composites, consisting in large partof descriptions of how some of these ideas can beextended using concepts from the area of polymerchemistry.  The modifications are generally carried outby having the polymer chains terminated with functionalgroups that can participate in the ceramic-generatingreaction.  This permits intimate bonding between theinorganic (ceramic) phase and the organic (polymer)phase, in a way that is most likely to give novelmechanical properties.(Order this INNOVATOR'S DIGEST reviewed report fromInfoTeam Inc., P.O.

The proposed new approach isinvestigated using both laboratory and synchrotronx-ray sources.   Investigations center around the useof two different types of monochromators and a CCDdetector, to allow the imaging of characteristicexcited x-radiation in two dimensions, one element at atime.  The goal of this approach is to be able toobtain three-dimensional images in a similar way as isnow possible using x-ray tomographic microscopymethods.  Unfortunately, after considerable research itwas not possible to obtain sufficient signal usingeither x-ray source, and the project was terminated.However, it is possible that the advent of more intensesynchrotron x-ray sources could allow this technique tobe used for certain restricted applications.

This leadsto a cellular efficiency that contains a minimum in theefficiency as a function of the particle size, and thisallows identification of the most penetrating particlesize.  Comparison of the theory with results fromBrownian dynamics indicates that the first correctionto the Smoluchowski equation gives reasonable resultsin terms of both the cellular efficiency and the mostpenetrating particle size.  However, the results forlarger particles clearly indicate the need to extendthe Smoluchowski equation to include higher ordercorrections.

Innovations in physical vapor depositiontechnologies, in particular magnetron sputtering, haveenabled the synthesis of metallic-based structureshaving nanoscaled layer dimensions as small asone-to-two monolayers.  The parameters used in thedeposition process are paramount to the formation ofthese small layer dimensions and the stability of thestructure.  Therefore, optimization of the desiredmaterial properties must be related to assessment ofthe actual microstructure.  Characterization techniquessuch as x-ray diffraction and high resolutionmicroscopy are useful to reveal the interface and layerstructure, whether ordered or disordered, crystalline,amorphous, compostionally abrupt or graded, and/orlattice strained.

We believe you will find INSIDE NIST an indispensable tool and animportant resource as you do business with this exciting agency. WhileNIST is undergoing some budget challenges, its core programs remain asvital as ever.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), a major budget player whooversees NIST funds in the House of Representatives, has made acommitment to the continued growth of the core programs.  While it isstill too early to tell definitively, it also looks as though theManufacturing Extension Partnership and Malcolm Baldrige Award willmove forward and grow.  Questions still remain about the fate of theAdvanced Technology Program, however, and INSIDE NIST will keep youposted on all new developments.     Our mission with INSIDE NIST is to provide you with the insidetrack on how to win more contracts from NIST's programs, and on how toprofit from its ongoing standards development.  We want you to useINSIDE NIST as your "inside source" for the activities of this dynamicagency.       Now, here's the news:     Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE NIST via NewsNetJULY 7, 1995ATP FUNDS ZEROED OUT OF FISCAL 1996 HOUSE MONEY BILL     NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP) will not receive federalfunding beginning Oct. 1, according to legislation approved by theHouse Appropriations Commerce Subcommittee.  ATP funding had ramped upto $340 million in the current fiscal year.  In attempting to kill theprogram, the subcommittee said such funds should more appropriatelycome from private industry.      Zeroing out ATP accounted for most of the reduction in funds NISTwill suffer in fiscal 1996 if the House bill is approved.  Funds wouldbe slashed from $763.8 million to $404 million.  Every other NISTinitiative, including the core programs (known as the Scientific andTechnical Research Services or STRS), the Manufacturing ExtensionPartnership (MEP) and the Malcolm Baldrige Award, apparently willadvance.                                                                   NIST continues to promote ATP to industry, even though NISTofficials know that ATP funding could be eliminated.  (See relatedstory, p. 5.)  A revised ATP competition has a solicitation deadlineof Sept. 12, less than three weeks before all ATP funds are set toexpire.  A NIST official told us the Congres-sional budget process isof long duration and that ATP funds could yet be reinstated.      ATP funds amounting to $187 million that were not used in fiscal1994 may be used to help close out ATP initiatives begun before Oct.1, 1994.  ATP programs begun after that date may not receive anyadditional funds.       Commerce Secretary Ron Brown reacted angrily to the news of ATP'sdemise in the bill by noting that the elimination of ATP "isunacceptable."  Brown also expressed unhappiness about "deepreductions" in NIST funding, although a House AppropriationsSubcommittee staff member said funding would be about the same infiscal 1996 as in fiscal 1995.  A NIST official said his understandingwas that the mark would be reduced from $90.6 million to about $81million.     There was no mention of Baldrige Award funding in theappropriations bill but NIST officials are confident it will beincluded as part of STRS.  If that is the case, the NIST breakout infiscal 1996 is as follows: $263 million (NIST Labs includingBaldrige), $81 million for MEP and $60.1 million for construc-tion/renovation of NIST research facilities.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE NIST via NewsNetJULY 7, 1995CRIPPLING RESCISSION BILL NOW EXPECTED TO BECOME LAW        A rescission bill that knocks back NIST funds in a variety ofareas in the current fiscal year now is expected to be signed into lawby President Clinton in the near future.  Clinton earlier had vetoedthe measure for reasons unrelated to NIST program funding.     The cutbacks include $17 million for NIST's Scientific andTechnical Research Services (STRS), $15.7 million for theManufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and $30 million for theconstruction/renovation program.     The cutbacks would detrimentally impact a NIST solicitationissued June 8 for non-profit agencies to submit proposals for new MEPcenters.  NIST had promised $41 million for such proposals.  Thenumber of centers and funding will now be cut back as the result ofthe rescission, according to NIST spokesman Mike Newman.          "[This legislation] hurts our move to make the labs self-funded,not to be as dependent on outside funding," according to Newman.  Inthe past, a good portion of funding has come from other federalagencies.      "We want to take the lead in technical emphasis on activities atour lab," concurred NIST spokesman Mat Heyman.  Such outside emphasis"skews your operation," continued Heyman.  "The [other funding agency]does what it wants with [the results]."     Funding for the construction program would almost be halved, from$64 million to $34 million.  "Priorities are going to have to beshifted quite a bit," the spokesman said.  "It's pretty drastic."     The House already has passed the revised rescission measure butthe Senate has yet to act.  However, the Senate is expected to approvethe bill after it returns from the July 4 congressional recess.     The Appropriations Subcommittee markup actually represents areprieve for MEP.  The House Science Committee approved legislationthat does not include ATP or MEP.  An amendment to that legislation,which was approved by the full committee last week, would not precludefunds for ATP and MEP.  (While actual funds come through theappropriations process, the new Republican Congress is attempting toaddress authorizing bill concerns in that process.)  ...Morella Guards Core Programs at Expense of ATP and MEP     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.), whose district includes NIST-Gaithersburg, authorized legislation June 15 that would allow $273million to go to STRS and Baldrige.  She rightly indicated at thattime that the appropriators may add funds for MEP.  It is interestingto note that the programs Morella did not include funding for werethose that would have the least impact on jobs in her own district.     In fact, the agency thinks it can make the cuts without loss ofjobs, according to Newman, although he acknowledged that staffcutbacks do constitute "one possibility."  One unwanted but necessaryremedy may be furloughs to keep costs down and jobs intact.           Morella claimed that her hands were tied as the result of abudget resolution.  In order for the authorizing committee to have anyimpact on the appropriations committee mark-up, it would have to fallwithin those caps, she told the subcommittee.      "If it were possible, I think you all know that my preferencewould be to fully fund every NIST function," Morella said.  "However,given our commitment to balance the budget, that simply cannot be thereality."     "We do not have the budget to fund ATP and MEP, in addition tothe core scientific work being done at the NIST laboratories," Morellaintoned.  "NIST core programs must be a priority."      Associated with saving STRS is continuation of a strong labconstruction and renovation program, according to Morella.  "Withoutthe necessary renovation and construction of facilities, NIST willsimply not be able to adequately fulfill its basic mission in thefuture," she said.      Democrats on the Science Subcommittee bitterly fought thelegislation.  Rep. John Tanner (D-Tenn.), ranking minority member,offered an amendment that would have increased funds to $754.2million.  That was defeated by a vote breaking down along party lines. Tanner's amendment would have approved $330 million for ATP andbolstered funding for MEP to $130.6 million.      The Appropriations Subcommittee did not have specific breakoutsby NIST labs, according to a staffer there.  Morella's authorizingsubcommittee included the following figures:      *  Electronics and Electrical Engineering Lab ($39.6 million);      *  Manufacturing Engineering ($19.6 million);      *  Chemical Science and Technology ($28.1 million);      *  Physics ($28.1 million);      *  Material Science and Engineering ($54.3 million);      *  Building and Fire Research ($13.5 million);      *  Computer Systems ($30.7 million);      *  Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing ($11 million);      *  Technical Assistance ($19.1 million); and      *  Research Support ($28.2 million).          The Morella legislation also would allow for the expansion ofNIST's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) from 9 to 15members; authorize a NIST metro shuttle; increase the cap on the NISTpostdoctoral fellows program; give excess scientific equipment tosecondary schools; raise the cap on the number of winners of the Baldrige quality awards from two to four; andallow NIST to extend its Personnel Demonstration Project.     The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to meet July11, followed by a full House vote.  The process then begins in theSenate, followed by conferencing the two bills.     NIST officials believe there will be more of a fight in theSenate to restore some funds for ATP.  Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.)has said he will fight for both ATP and MEP.  No Republican senator isyet on record as supporting either program, however, a NIST officialacknowledged.     ATP was originally slated for elimination in the RepublicanParty's Contract with America.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), chairmanof the House Science Committee and vice-chairman of the House BudgetCommittee, has threatened to kill ATP from the beginning of thecongressional term.  ...Unfavorable GAO Report Further Hurts ATP's Efforts     These efforts were further boosted by a General Accounting Office(GAO) report originally commissioned and released June 15 by formerHouse Science Committee Chairman Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.) whichsays that attempts to measure the success of ATP are not accuratelystated.  NIST officials have attempted to show that ATP is alreadypaying dividends for the American taxpayer as an argument to continuethe program.        GAO charged that NIST incorrectly overstated the results.  Infour instances, it found, results were overstated or lacked adequatesupport.  Walker charged that "one can open up nearly any page of theGAO report and find evidence that Advanced Technology Program isexactly the wrong way to advance U.S. competitiveness."      The action on ATP comes following efforts to rally support forthe program among involved industries.  Brown has actively called forbusiness--particularly the small business community--to lobby for theprogram.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE NIST via NewsNetJULY 7, 1995BOULDER GIVEN BACK-OF-THE-BUS STATUS ON CONSTRUCTION/RENOVATION PLANS     The original construction and renovation plans for NIST talked ofequally helping the Gaithersburg, Md., and Boulder, Colo., campuses,but as money becomes more of an issue it is clear that theGaithersburg headquarters, which is in Rep. Connie Morella's (D-Md.)home district, is first among equals.     "One hundred percent of our efforts are going to Gaithersburg infiscal years 1995 and 1996," NIST Associate Director Samuel Kramersaid at a recent briefing on the plans, which falls under the rubricCapital Improvements Facilities Program (CIFP).       That is despite the fact that Boulder labs are as old or in somecases older than the Gaithersburg facilities.  Like Gaithersburg,Boulder is slated to have a state-of-the-art Advanced Technology Lab(ATL) built on its campus.     Despite the similarity of the ATL name to NIST's AdvancedTechnology Program (ATP), Kramer attempted to distance the new labfrom the technology program, whose funding is now being threatened.      "They are two different things," Kramer said.  "The ATL is anintramural research program which will address the core activities ofthe Lab."  In contrast, the ATP "is an extramural program which has aseparate mission."     The Gaithersburg ATL, costing from $115 million-$130 million,will be "the world's most advanced technology lab," Kramer said.  "Wehave looked at labs throughout the world, and this facility will bethe best," he told the briefing.     The new Gaithersburg ATL will be over 31,000 gross square meters. The facility will be only one story high.  The metrology labs willexist underground.  Due to budget considerations, NIST had to adjustits original estimate for the program downward from more than $1billion to $540 million.  "We had to cut the budget request to addressearly technical obsolescence," Kramer said.  ...Disruption To Be a Key Concern     There will be disruption as the result of the construction at theNIST Gaithersburg campus, and the agency already has made plans torent nearby space, known as "NIST North," to accommodate displacedemployees.  Jorge Urrutia, NIST director of administration, told usthere are plans for as many as 540 displacements, but noted that it isunclear exactly how many will be impacted.     For example, the Physics Lab, where sensitive experiments areundertaken, is located next to a major construction area.  "We areasking [the construction crew] not to do certain things at certaintimes--such as drive piles or use earth-moving equipment--but there isno doubt there will be a loss of productivity in these areas," Urrutiasaid.     At a facility where subatomic particles are measured, it isunclear how well clean rooms will be able to operate duringconstruction.  Vibration will also no doubt constitute a majorproblem.     An Advanced Chemical Sciences Lab (ACSL) also is beingconstructed as part of the program.  Construction is set to begin inJune 1996, with occupancy expected in May 1998.  With regard to ATL,construction also is expected to begin next June, with occupancy byOctober 1999.  Both schedules may be impacted by budget reductions.     The existing chemistry lab, which Kramer said has deterioratedfaster than other campus facilities, will be renovated at some point,although Kramer said it is not a priority item.     NIST now is building a materials processing lab, largely torecycle material, at a cost of approximately $1 million.   Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE NIST via NewsNetJULY 7, 1995FAILING ATP CIME PROGRAM REEMERGES AS TIMA   A former NIST ATP focus program that yielded only one award inresponse to its first solicitation has been recast and rebid. Technologies for the Integration of Manufacturing Applications (TIMA)has replaced Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics (CIME).     A Proposer's Conference on TIMA held June 20 at NIST-Gaithersburg's Green Auditorium stated the new technical goal is"creating a cost-effective, plug-&-play real-time manufacturingexecution software environment for discrete manufacturing."  Sought-after characteristics include integratability, configurability,adaptability, extensibility and reliability.     NIST officials say that a particular emphasis will be onManufacturing Execution Systems (MES), which bridge the gap betweenhigh-level management systems and factory-floor-control systems.  MESapplications link business and manufacturing systems, tracking a jobon the shop floor in near-real time.     A total of $18 million in current-year funding is available tofund the first TIMA awards, according to NIST officials.  Full projectproposals are due Sept. 12.     A variety of flaws were cited among the proposals that originallywere submitted to receive CIME funding, according to a paper releasedlast month by NIST's Amy Knutilla (knutilla+cme.nist.gov).  Of theoriginal 15 proposals, representatives from six proposals were invitedto NIST for oral review.  Those boiled down to only one award.     "There were no major trends in strengths or weaknesses of theproposals," said Knutilla.  Were the results consistent with other ATPproposals, the failure would have come in the originalconceptualization of the idea or in the too-harsh evaluation of theproposals, one source observed.     However, Knutilla also found that "most of the proposals madeonly a high-level, cursory attempt to address some of the ATPcriteria, with some proposals completely neglecting some criteria." Other damning features included "excessive use of industry buzzwords,""low technical risk," the naming of partners without commitments fromthose partners, providing "an unclear discussion on the potentialtechnical leverage of [the] proposal," lack of a management plan, and little experience with CIME.

There is almost nothing being done in the classified area,according to NIST Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.     "There are probably a few, but there are probably only a very few[classified activities]," qualified NIST spokesman Mike Newman.  Hewould not go further.     Both reacted with some anger to a report that linked NIST DeputyDirector Ray Kammer to a large classified program undertaken with theNational Security Agency (NSA).  While Heyman acknowledged that NISTwas involved with classified parts of Clipper Chip, an NSA program, hesaid the overall impact when compared to other NIST activities is"very tiny."     When asked if "a fair amount" of activities at NIST areclassified, Newman responded, "That's garbage.  There may be someprojects that we are doing with the military that may have someclassified elements, but most of the research area is unclassified."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE NIST via NewsNetJULY 7, 1995UNDERSTANDING METALLIC DENDRITES STIMULATES NIST RESEARCHERS   NIST metallurgists housed on the first floor of the MaterialsBuilding in Gaithersburg are gaining insight into dendrites, literally"tree-like" forms created when metals become solidified.      Dr. William Boettinger showed INSIDE NIST editor C. David Chaffeesome of the metallic formations under microscope at his lab recently. Such studies are serving as the building blocks of metallic alloysthat can have any number of extreme properties.  One is an engineturbine that only will melt at about 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.     Boettinger observes that dendrites also are common in snowflakesand in ceramics.  They have a freezing or solidification point wellabove that of water and often do not have a liquid phase.  Thus, theycan remain in "frozen" form to thousands of degrees Fahrenheit.  "Whenpeople think of something in freezing terms, they think of water,"Boettinger tells us.  "The metallurgist does not think of freezing inthose terms."     When asked what eventual practical applications the understandingof these patterns will have, Boettinger notes, "At this point, it'slike trying to tell a skier that patterns on each of the snowflakes onhis lift are important." However, skiers do understand that snow cancome in different forms, such as light powders and heavy, wet snow.      Boettinger has joined with James Warren, a NIST physicist, tostudy the transition of these metals from vapor or liquid to solid. Controlling this solidification is a fundamental goal of themetallurgist.  The two men are working to further describe thissimulation using computer equipment.     The alloy that Boettinger demonstrated under the microscope hadwhite spots that he said are regions of high concentration ofimpurities.  These white spots are brittle particles that can lead topremature failure of the casting.     Specifically, Warren and Boettinger developed a comprehensivephase-field model for solving heat and solute diffusion equationsduring solidification that avoids tracking the liquid-solid interface. Their work has been written up in Nature and Computational Science &Engineering.        More Inside The Corridors items:     Appropriate for the Fourth of July, NIST's Gaithersburg librarywas displaying how NIST scientists helped to preserve and restore theDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution.

Much of last month's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology(VCAT) meeting in Boulder had to do with the recently completedDelivering Results, a testimonial from industry on NIST programs.  Ameeting discussion point was how NIST is tracking the effectiveness ofits programs.  Now chaired by Bob Hermann of United Technologies, VCATrepresented a "routine review of what we are doing," according to NISTPublic Affairs Director Mat Heyman.  Most of NIST Director AratiPrabhakar's presentation dealt with the budget situation.

"People are competing for [the state] awards firstbefore they go to Baldrige," he added.     Companies are also more likely now to be preoccupied with otherthings--such as satisfying International Standards Organizationstandards and competing abroad.  "They are still interested inimproving their quality, but they are not specifically looking toapply for the Baldrige Award," Newman said.     The spokesman observed that the agency continues to mail hundredsof thousands of criteria for the Baldrige Award.     Approximately 30 states have established state quality awardsprograms, most of which are modeled after the Baldrige Award.  ...Program May Be Expanded to Include Four Categories     NIST proponents are pushing to increase the number of categoriesin which NIST awards are made annually from two to four.  The newcategories would include health care and education.     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.) has included such a provision inlegislation approved by the House Science Committee.  NIST hasreceived applications from 65 health care and educationalorganizations supporting such a move.     Curt Reimann, director of the Baldrige Award program at NIST,said the new programs could help the organizations improveperformance, facilitate communication and foster partnerships.  Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE NIST via NewsNetJULY 7, 1995NIST SEES ITSELF PLAYING KEY ROLE IN INFOBAHN        NIST officials see the agency as playing a two-part role in thedevelopment of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  In onerole, it is a "facilitator, keeper and conformance tester" for theNII, according to information NIST has released.      This is buoyed by "funding high-risk industrial ventures,performing laboratory research, helping smaller manufacturers applynew technologies, and participating in policy and standards formationto be sure the technologies are available for real-life applicationsof the NII."

What remains unclear is what posture theClinton administration's Justice Department, the Federal TradeCommission (FTC) or the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) will take with regard to the vertical integration ofnetwork and programming interests represented by the mergerof the telephone and cable giants.The merger, which ranks among the largest in U.S. history,presents a potential dilemma for the administration, which hasmade a point of emphasizing the private sector's leading role inthe development and financing of a national informationinfrastructure.  The reliance on the private sector to hastenbringing the benefits of an interactive infrastructure to thenation may run smack into the long-standing Democraticdedication to tough enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws.Vice President Al Gore, the administration's point man on the"information superhighway", issued a cautious statement.  "TheAdministration believes that rapid deployment of theinformation infrastructure will create jobs, increase our standardof living, and provide a wide range of services in areas such aseducation, health care, and entertainment," he said.The merger "demonstrates the intense private-sector interest inthe information infrastructure.  The Administration supports anydevelopment in the communications marketplace that is pro-competitive and fosters the development of an open, interactiveinformation infrastructure.  Subsequent formal reviews willdetermine whether this proposal meets those goals," Gore said.Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) said the proposed merger will speedup the information superhighway, but at the same time, thechairman of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee saidhe was concerned that access to that kind of technology wouldonly be available to the rich.  The merger proposal leaves manyquestions unanswered and "raises all kinds of bells and whistles,"Markey told ITP in an interview.  "Will it (access to theinformation superhighway) happen for everyone, or only thewell-to-do?" he asked.  Markey added that he did not want thenation to become divided into "the information rich and theinformation poor."It is the government's role to set the policy for the nationalcommunications infrastructure with the private sector taking thelead in building that system, he said.  "But in setting that policywe must make certain that everyone participates in the future,"Markey added.  The real challenge will be to see "who gets whatand when," he said. Those questions were not answered in theOct. 13 press conference announcing the proposed merger,Markey said.Markey said his panel will hold a series of hearings to examinethe many issues surrounding the merger, including the antitrustimplications.  At the same time, he asked the FCC to start aformal inquiry to "assess the potential technological and marketbottlenecks created by mergers, acquisitions, and alliancesamong cable, telephone, and computer companies."In an Oct. 13 letter to acting FCC Chairman James Quello,Markey said the Bell Atlantic-TCI announcement is "just thelatest tremor signalling the shifting nature of thecommunications marketplace."  Specifically, Markey said theFCC inquiry should address:whether any recently proposed industry mergers, acquisitions, oralliances creates an organization or alliance that controlssufficient market dominance to "choke competition and stuntinnovation" in any area of the new video marketplace.how the merging of regional Bell Operating Companies andcable companies affects the competition in the current videomarket and in the future broad communications market.whether there should be continued restrictions on telephonecompanies owning or operating cable systems within their serviceterritory.whether the government should take additional steps to ensureopen systems in the communications marketplace, payingparticular attention to potential bottlenecks in video softwareand set-top boxes and in encryption and compressiontechnologies for satellite distribution of video programming, and,whether the recently adopted vertical and horizontal limits onconcentration in the cable industry are adequate to protectconsumers and/or competitors.Markey told ITP there is "no question" more mergers andalliances between telecommunications companies would beannounced in the future. This is not necessarily good or bad, headded, but urged quick completion of the inquiry, which he toldQuello was needed "to ensure that the emerging marketplaceremains open and accessible to all and that some of the dealsnow being made or contemplated do not result in either closedsystems or anti-competitive practices."House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) said"the question for consumers and competitors is whether such acombination will open up new markets or technologies or simplyforeclose markets to current and potential entrants." Reservingjudgement on the competitive implication of the merger, Brookssaid that responsibility now rests with Assistant AttorneyGeneral Anne Bingaman and her antitrust division.  Brooks saidhe will monitor development "very closely" and consider theimplication of such mergers as he proceeds with his owntelecommunications legislation."Perhaps such integration is now a fact of life needed to deliverthe most innovative products to consumers.  But if that alsoresults in driving out creative small and mid-sized competitors,we may all be the ultimate losers," Brooks said.Reaction from Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-OH), chairmanof the Senate antitrust subcommittee, was not so measured.  He"condemned" the proposed merger and called for hearings andsaid he will urge Justice and the FTC to intervene.  "The TCI-Bell Atlantic merger is a double whammy for consumers--theycould face overcharges for both cable TV and local phoneservice," the statement said.  "Instead of lower prices from fiercehead-to-head competition between the phone and cablecompanies, consumers are facing a mega-monster."He warned of grave consequences if the merger is allowed tocontinue.  "The more you concentrate programming andeconomic power, the more you hurt consumers.  TCI, already agiant in cable and programming, set its sights on expanding itsempire to the Home Shopping Network and now Paramount," hesaid.  "Other industry giants like Viacom are also rejectingcompetition in favor of combination.  The phone companiespromised us robust competition, but instead of trying to beat thecable giants, they want to join them and consumers will be thelosers," Metzenbaum said.Don Elder, a Federal Trade Commission spokesman, wouldneither confirm nor deny the FTC is investigating the merger,but noted that neither company is on its "early termination" listof mergers and acquisitions given de facto approval.  The "earlytermination" list is a daily report of business agreements theFTC believes raise no antitrust issues.By ITP's news deadline, neither Justice nor the FCC had areaction to the merger.  But some state regulators did.In BellAtlantic's home state of Pennsylvania, Vice Chairman of thePublic Utility Commission Joseph Rhodes Jr. viewed theproposed merger with skepticism.  "In my opinion, Bell Atlanticmust prove to this commission that they can accomplish thismerger without divesting themselves of Bell of Pennsylvania," hesaid."We have fought for years to determine if Bell of Pennsylvaniacustomers are unfairly subsidizing, for example, Bell Atlantic'sefforts at diversification such as its recently announced plans toinvest $1 billion in Mexico," he said.  "Bell Atlantic has foughtthis audit at every juncture.  Imagine the difficulty we wouldhave to audit a merged Bell Atlantic-TCI.  Bell Atlanticshareholders, not Bell of Pennsylvania ratepayers, should bearthe risk of this merger."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993NIST SEEKS INDUSTRY VIEWS ON REVAMPINGATP PROJECT-SELECTION PROCESSThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) willhost a meeting Oct. 19 to solicit industry views on selectingprojects and establishing major program areas under theAdvance Technology Program (ATP). NIST Director AratiPrabahkar and ATP Director George Uriano will be thefeatured speakers at the meeting, which will be held at NISTheadquarters in Gaithersburg, Md.With increased funding proposed in fiscal 1994 and the yearsfollowing, ATP will move from a pilot program to a full-fledgedcivilian technology program.  The government is asking allinterested parties for their ideas for new program areas thatshould be included in the ATP.  Since 1990, 60 projects havebeen funded through ATP.  This does not include the projectsthat will be funded this year with remaining monies for fiscal1993, which ended Sept. 30.  That announcement, which couldinclude up to 30 projects, is likely before the end of the month,a NIST official said.  ATP funding for FY-93 was $67.9 million.At ITP's news deadline, House and Senate negotiators wereclose to approving a budget for FY-94 that aides say willprobably reflect the $199.5 million proposed by the Clintonadministration.  The House earlier had cut the president'srequest to $129 million (ITP, June 28, p. 1).  Theadministration's intention is to ramp up the program by 275percent until it reaches $750 million by FY-97.The meeting with industry is the best avenue on getting ideas forthe best return on tax dollars, said a NIST spokesman.  "Theidea is to explain our intention to establish areas for more tightlyfocused research and what the criteria shall be for selecting whatthose program areas are," the spokesman said.  Program areaswould encompass a group of projects with a common featurethat works toward a specific technology or a business goal, heexplained.  Project proposals would still have to compete underpreviously determined criteria published in the Federal Registeras part of the ATP project solicitation.  Ideas for program areaswill be accepted at any time, while proposals for specific projectsunder the ATP could only be accepted in response to an ATPsolicitation, which last occurred in February.Selection criteria for the program areas will also be discussed atthe meeting. In a notice for the meeting, NIST said it intendsthe program areas to have "well-defined technology andeconomic goals, and generally will require development of anensemble of complementary technologies."  The shift to focusedcompetitions centered around specific programs "will allow theATP to achieve greater benefits for the nation by concentratingsupport on suites of interrelated technologies and reaping thebenefits of scale and synergism," according to the agency.To register for the meeting, or to receive documents distributedat the meeting after Oct. 19, contact the ATP office at 1-800-micf.nist.gov, or byfacsimile at (301) 926-9524.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993HOUSE SCIENCE PANEL READYING NEW MEASURETO SPUR DEVELOPMENT OF `GREEN' TECHNOLOGIESThe House Science Committee's proposed legislation on "green"technology should be finalized and ready for introduction withinthe next few weeks, according to committee sources.  And whilea previously circulated one-page outline of the proposal has beenrendered "obsolete," many key initiatives still remain on thedrawing board as the committee aims to craft legislation thatwould encourage the development and adoption of greentechnologies by the government and private sector.Environmental, or "green" technologies include both thetraditional technologies for "pollution control and clean-up, aswell as `other' products and processes that provide significantenvironmental and economic benefits," said Rep. Tim Valentine(D-NC) chairman of the subcommittee on technology,environment and aviation at an Oct. 5 hearing.  "It is this lattergroup of technologies that has the potential for widespreadimpact across many industries," Valentine said.But now, with a renewed emphasis on the environment led bytop officials in the Clinton administration including VicePresident Al Gore, both government officials and representativesof the private sector are calling for incentives for government-public partnerships, financial incentives to develop newtechnologies and relief from too stringent regulatoryrequirements.  "Flexible, performance-based regulation thatstimulates innovation for both environmental and economicbenefits will have to be a collaborative exercise," said PeteHoward, vice president of environmental affairs for Georgia-Pacific Corp.DETAILS OF PROPOSED LEGISLATIONAt ITP's news deadline, committee members were still reviewingeach section of the proposed legislation, suggesting additions andfine tuning other areas.  The "framework is still being cleanedup," said one committee aide involved in drafting the legislation.Also, the legislative language is being modified for consistency.For example, this would eliminate any confusion over the terms"green technology" and "environmental technology," the aidesaid.The proposed legislation is originating in the panel'ssubcommittee on technology, environment and aviation.  Thelegislation is expected to address:Greater coordination among government agencies involved inthe development and adoption of green technologies;establishing an Environment and Technology Clearinghouse; andenhancing the capability for life cycle assessments of materialflows.Greater emphasis on green technologies in existing programs;establishing an Innovative Environmental Technologies AwardsProgram; promoting the development of EnvironmentalRemediation and Monitoring Technology; establishing anIndustrial Integration Demonstration Project; and creating aPresident's Total Environmental Quality Award.Encouraging green technology projects in Small BusinessInnovation Research grants; promoting the government as amarket to accelerate the development of green technologies;evaluating the impact of regulatory practices on the contributionof innovation to pollution prevention, control and remediation.Promoting industry education and outreach; integratingenvironmental sustainability issues into engineering education;enhancing public knowledge of sustainable development throughthe National Science Foundation.Improving technical standards of environmental performanceand efficacy; providing guidelines for consumer claims.Improving international assistance promoting green technologies;establishing an International Environmental Technology Center;enhancing export financing (steps the Clinton administration hasalready begun); improving benchmarking; and clarifying thepotential for international green markets.Partnerships between government and the private sector thatinclude risk sharing should be encouraged, said government andprivate sector representatives at another recent congressionalhearing.  Representatives from both sides also called forfinancial incentives and regulatory relief."We have started a dialogue with American companies who wantto collaborate to share the risks of technology development with(the Environmental Protection Agency) and other federalagencies," senior EPA official Walter Kovalick said in testimonySept. 30 before a Senate environment subcommittee.As far as specific provisions in the proposed House legislation,financial incentives remain under consideration, but committeesources say the proposal most likely will call for a study todetermine what incentives would be the most viable. There areso many tax incentives now available to companies that it doesn'tmake sense to impose a specific standard, said one source.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993HOUSE JUDICIARY PANEL HEARS SOFTWAREINDUSTRY LEADERS DISCUSS COMPETITION, TRADEPRACTICESAgainst the background of a possible Justice Departmentinvestigation into alleged anticompetitive trade practices byindustry leader Microsoft Corp., executives from some of thenation's leading computer software firms went before a HouseJudiciary subcommittee last week to discuss competition in thecomputer industry.  Chief among the concerns of the industryofficials was competition from overseas computer firms, softwarepiracy and trade restrictions that hamper the ability of U.S. firmsto effectively compete with their foreign counterparts.Outdated, "unrealistic, unilateral controls that effectively prohibitexports of software with encryption capabilities" imposed by theUnited States must be lifted, said William Neukom, vicepresident of law and corporate affairs for Microsoft.  Neukomargued that these trade barriers threaten the industry's futureinternational sales.  The Clinton administration has proposedliberalizing export restrictions on computers but not encryptionsoftware.  That position has been criticized by the SoftwarePublishers' Association (ITP, Sept. 6, p. 12).  He also said thatsoftware piracy, which is rampant in many areas, costs U.S.companies approximately $10 billion annually in foreignrevenues.Innovation must continue to be encouraged, Neukom said.  "Thebenefits of continuous software innovation permeate theeconomy" as software innovation improves the competitivenessof other U.S. industries that utilize software products, he said.Neukom also noted that the competitiveness of the computerindustry means that "not all companies that exist today will be assuccessful or even in existence five years from now."Competition will increase overall, he said, as firms vie "todevelop more advanced operating systems that take advantage ofthe explosive technological growth in hardware."David Bradford, general counsel of Novell, Inc. told thelawmakers that congressional efforts to clarify the treatment ofjoint ventures under the antitrust laws and to eliminate anyunnecessary obstacles to their formation was a boost to theindustry's ability to compete internationally.But one area that still needs improvement is the patent system,according to Jerry Rogers, president and chief executive officerof Cyrix Corp.  "America must address its antiquated patentsystem so that it may encourage innovation rather than hinderit," Rogers said.  The Cyrix official claims that "under thepresent system patents are issued that reflect marginal advancesin technology or a similar implementation of existingmanufacturing process or product" which in turn advances largecorporations while intimidating smaller companies.In general, the witnesses side-stepped discussing the allegedtrade practice violations by Microsoft. However, Paul Johnson, avice president of First Boston, testified that the government must"make sure that the current dominant market leaders do notabuse their natural economies of scale."Johnson said, "In other words, Microsoft clearly dominates themarket for PC operating systems and applications.  No one candeny it, and I doubt anything could be done to change it.However, Microsoft should not be allowed to abuse this marketposition in terms of pricing leverage or `anti-competitive'activities," he said.  Justice is reviewing files compiled by theFederal Trade Commission to determine if Microsoft hasengaged in anticompetitive practices (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 12).While noting that the computer industry is "fast-moving andcomplex," Subcommittee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Texas) saidthat does not mean "it is immune from antitrust and othercompetition-related problems."At the same time, Brooks pointed out that such characteristicsdo not mean "that the market would necessarily be served by thereplacement of one dominant industry monolith with a numberof smaller companies able to unfairly exert control overparticular key segments of the computer industry."  Brooks alsostressed that as long as federal agencies are investigating chargesof unfair competitive practices within the industry, his committeedid not intend "to invade upon that process."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993HOUSE PANEL APPROVES PILOT PROGRAMFOR NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTUREThe House Telecommunications Subcommittee approvedlegislation Oct. 14 to fund pilot projects that promote thedevelopment of a national information superhighway.  TheTelecommunications Infrastructure and Facilities Assistance Actof 1993, H.R. 2639, authorizes grant money for communities ororganizations that develop innovative uses for nationwidecomputer networks.Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee andkey sponsor of the proposal, said the measure "reflects thecommitment of the government to make certain that health careinstitutions, schools, libraries and local governments share in thecommunications future."To fund the pilot projects, the bill will have the NationalTelecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)establish and maintain a Telecommunications and InformationInfrastructure Development Program that will promote thewidespread availability of advanced telecommunications to healthcare providers, educational institutions and state and localgovernments.Markey said the program "is designed to support the formationof a nationwide, high-speed, interactive infrastructure made upof a variety of technologies through the interconnection andimprovement of existing facilities and the deployment of newfacilities."  The bill authorizes an additional $151 million inFiscal Years 1995 and 1996 for NTIA to award grants for 50percent of construction costs.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993SPACE STATION BECOMES FOREIGN POLICY VEHICLE;JOINT VENTURE WITH RUSSIA PROPOSEDDr. John H. Gibbons, director of the White House Office ofScience and Technology Policy (OSTP), announced Oct. 6 thatthe United States will incorporate the Russian Mir space stationinto the newly redesigned and recently renamed space stationAlpha project, formerly called space station Freedom.The new space station option grew out of a meeting held Sept. 1and 2 between Vice President Al Gore and Russian PrimeMinister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.  Under the terms of theagreement reached between Gore and Chernomyrdin, theUnited States will pay $400 million over four years for the use ofMir and the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  In return,the U.S. will receive assurances from Russia that it will abide byMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the agreement tolimit the spread of rockets and related technologies.  China andBrazil have been accused of breaking the MTCR, and many fearthat cash-strapped Russia might find it unable to resist sellingbanned technology.Marcia S. Smith, a specialist in science and technology policy forthe Congressional Research Service, emphasized that the Miroption is only one of three choices emerging from the confusionof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA)efforts to redesign and trim costs for the space station.  Thethree designs are the "American option"; using a Lockheed Corp."bus" for guidance navigation and control; the"American/Russian" option, using a Salyut tug for the samefunctions; and the "Russian/American" option developed duringthe Gore/Chernomyrdin discussions.The latest announcement comes on the heels of a rocky year forthe project, which is criticized for being over budget and a wasteof precious federal science funds at a time of record budgetshortfalls.  In a packed hearing room before the subcommitteeon space of the House Committee of Science, Space andTechnology, Gibbons defended the option to employ Mir as ameans of cutting both deployment time and expenses.  Membersof the panel voiced skepticism about the uncertainty raised byissues such as the attempted coup quashed by Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin, sovereignity and control, and technical difficultiesin linking the two programs.The new modular design, a composite of two out of three planssubmitted by NASA in June after the Clinton administrationdemanded a less expensive station, would include Mir as acomponent of a larger station.  Gibbons stated that Mir wouldprovide the U.S. with a quick boost in knowledge whileproviding Russians with needed capital to help that country'seconomic development.  "We now have the historic opportunityto combine our efforts in space across a spectrum of programs,"Gibbons testified.  "Not in the context of an adversarialrelationship, but rather, one that is based on cooperation andpartnership.  We believe that the steps taken during theGore/Chernomyrdin meeting will set us on a course that willallow us to work together on space activities to minimize costs,maximize research potential and reduce the time needed to doprojects."COLLABORATION WOULD OCCUR IN THREE PHASESThe Russian/American collaboration would occur in three-phases.  The first phase would give the U.S. the right to fly long-term missions on Mir to develop skills needed for future spacestation operations.  Phase two would begin shuttle service to aMir module as an "interim human-tended science facility."  Thethird phase would be full-scale integration of the Russian spaceprogram into the international space-station consortium currentlyled by the U.S.  Other members of the consortium includeCanada, European countries and Japan.  Gibbons said detailswill be made available Nov. 1.Gibbons fended off a series of questions, on the one handassuring Rep. Jim Bacchus (D-FL) that the space stationprogram would continue to be based at Cape Canaveral (inBacchus' district), while assuring others on the committee thatneither extra money would be appropriated for the proposedjoint venture nor any American jobs put at risk."No one should confuse the course we are charting asrelinquishing control of the Space Station or exporting jobs outof the U.S.," Gibbons said.  "In developing this cooperativeprogram, we are focusing on areas that will not negatively impactthe U.S. aerospace sector.  In some areas, such as dynamic solarpower and closed life support systems, we believe that the netgain of new technologies from the Russians could stimulate jobsin the U.S."The most contentious issues, however, were the most technical.Integration of the two space station projects reveals fundamentaltechnical differences between the programs that may makejoining them difficult.  The Russian/American space stationprogram would use a 51.6 degrees orbit, as opposed to the spaceshuttle, which has always used a 28 degrees orbit.  Adopting tothe new orbit would reduce the launch window from Florida tosix minutes every day while simultaneously increasing the needfor thrust or reducing the size of payloads.Responding to a question from Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner(R-WI), Gibbons said the orbital degrees can range from 42 to52 degrees, but that Russia could not lower itself to our orbitwithout risking dropping its spent rockets on China.Increasing the thrust of the space shuttle probably would requirethe continuation of another controversial NASA project, theadvanced solid rocket motor (ASRM).  Ironically, on themorning of the hearing, the House voted not to consider a rulechange that would have allowed appropriations for ASRM tocontinue despite being voted down.  Other options, according toGibbons, are to let the Europeans or Russians "do the heavylifting."All of this could become moot, according to Gibbons.  "What wehave is a space station called Alpha that is destined to goforward with or without Russia," he said.  The proposed $400million investment will buy "access to the great reservoir ofexperience from the Mir," he said.At a subsequent hearing Oct. 14, NASA Administrator DanielGoldin dismissed concerns by some panel members that Russiantechnology might be uniformly inferior.  Goldin noted that inrecent years, Russia has made more launches and had fewerfailures than the U.S. space program.  Collaborating with theRussians will allow the launch of the laboratory module by July1997, with completion of a new space station by April 2001 at asavings of $3.5 billion over what it wold cost the U.S. tocomplete the project without Russian assistance.  If collaborationdoes not occur, Goldin said the laboratory module launch wouldbe delayed until April 1998 and the space station until Sept.2003.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993OMB OFFICIAL CALLS FOR NEW GOVERNMENTEFFORT TO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYThe state of information technology within the government whenthe Clinton administration took office was "appalling," accordingto Sally Katzen, administrator of the Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.Testifying Oct. 7 before the House Space, Science andTechnology Committee, Katzen said an essential component ofthe National Performance Review (NPR) will requireoverhauling the way the government uses, manages anddisseminates its vast store of information.  Noting that thegovernment has spent staggering sums yearly on informationsystems without providing decent service or significantlyimproving information infrastructure, Katzen said the twoprograms must be integrated to ensure that the goals of eitherprogram are achievable.According to the NPR report "From Red Tape to Results"released Sept. 7, more efficient use of information technology isone of the administration's highest priorities both for improvinggovernment services and reducing costs. The review projects asavings of up to $5.4 billion over five years by bringing the waygovernment distributes data into the information age, while atthe same time improving citizen- access to information.  Effortsto improve information technologies in the past have beenhampered by bad management and programs lacking centralgoals or leadership, according to Katzen."The federal government's track record in integrating[information technology] into systems supporting its operationshas produced some successes--and some costly failures," Katzentestified.  "Despite spending $25 billion in fiscal year 1993 oninformation technology, the federal government lacked thestrong and effective leadership required to assure that it makesthe most of these resources."  Without leadership, Katzencontinued, systems developed to deal with small and specificproblems actually aggravate dissemination problems becauseseparate departments create information fiefdoms--databasesthat duplicate those of other agencies and departments.  This,Katzen said, exacerbates the perception of government as a poorservice-provider and drives up government costs in general."In the past, the oversight community--OMB, the GeneralServices Administration, Congressional committees and theInspectors General--has often aggravated the situation byoveremphasizing specific costs such as the acquisition cost ofindividual information technology projects, rather than assessingtheir effect on program delivery," she said.THREE STEPS TO INTEGRATIONKatzen proposed a three-step process to integrate the goals ofthe National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the NationalPerformance Review.  Beginning immediately, her office willevaluate and publicize successful government informationtechnology ventures across departments and agencies.  This willaid other departments in determining what programs areavailable and effective.The second phase, which will cover the next 12 to 18 months, isto "achieve measurable performance gains through fundamentalchanges in information management practices."  Katzendescribed a possible program, allowing the Department ofVeteran Affairs access to Department of Defense personnel dataon the assumption that there is significant overlap between thedepartments.  This would not only save the departments the costof having to input the same information twice, but would savemilitary personnel the aggravation of having to supply it severaltimes.The third step would be "to tie the short- and long-term effortstogether" by determining what laws and regulations should beestablished, changed or abolished to make the best use ofinformation gained during the first two steps.More efficient use of information will also make it easier for thegovernment to encourage the development of a nationalinformation infrastructure.  The federal government, being thelargest information provider in the country, will providesignificant traffic on any "information highway" that develops.Moving public information to the network, as outlined in thereinventing government report, will provide a flood of traffic onthe network.  This will encourage public use and, in turn, willbuild the network.Katzen testified that among the services likely to be moreefficient using NII would be an "integrated electronic benefittransfer" (EBT) system.  This system would move entitlementpayments from the check- and paper-based systems used todayto an automated teller machine, bank-wire network and plasticaccess system.  "In the Food Stamp program alone, there areover 26 million monthly recipients and the government spends$400 million annually just to print, distribute and ultimatelydestroy stamps," Katzen said.  "EBT adopts commercialelectronic payment practices for the delivery of governmentassistance services, enabling benefits to be transferredautomatically."Other links between the NII and NPR would include heighteningpublic access to government services through the creation ofinformation kiosks for retirees so they can access social securityor other information; a national network to link federal stateand local law enforcement and public safety agencies to increasecoordination and reaction times; a national environmentaldatabase that would combine the information gathered by theDepartment of the Interior, the Environmental ProtectionAgency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of theDepartment of Commerce and others; and a government-wide e-mail system.Katzen said that, as part of NPR, agencies should be encouragedto work more closely with the information industry and beprovided with incentives to innovate.  Among her suggestionwere:permit agencies to retain a portion of any savings that theirinnovations create, instead of the current system in whichagencies that do not expend their full appropriations find theirbudgets reduced the following fiscal year;promote performance-based contracting, instead of narrowlydefined, low-risk procurement, allowing agencies to leverage theexpertise of the contractor with award fees, performanceincentives and value engineering;use multi-year funding, which would free information managersfrom year-to-year appropriations battles; andestablish a government-wide venture capital fund to promotepartnership between government and industry to develop newtechnologies.Finally, Katzen said the most important aspect of making theNII and NPR work together would be rigorous and constantretraining of government workers to keep abreast of newtechnologies.  "Many members of the federal workforce lacksufficient training and background to use new technologieseffectively, and many managers fail to realize the importanceof...training,"  she said.  "Even though the government spendsbillions of dollars each year on information technology, contractsand acquisitions do not include training provisions in the initialdesign stages."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICEIS AT THE CENTER OF ECONOMYUnder Bruce A. Lehman, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Officewill be on a "quest for quality and customer service" during thenext several years.  Lehman was sworn in as assistant secretaryof commerce and commissioner of the Patent Office on Sept. 15.He intends to continue a multi-year automation plan for systemsserving the agency's main activities--patent and trademarkprocessing, information dissemination and administration.  Theslow pace of patent processing in the past has promptedcongressional criticism, but Lehman believes that "automationmay open the way for truly international patent searching--maybe even to a world patent."Many still regard patents and other intellectual property rights asesoteric subjects.  But this view is not held by corporations,universities, government research centers and others whoincreasingly seek patents here and overseas for their newproducts or processes.  Governments have also realized theimportance patents play in the technology competitiveness race,and many have begun to modernize their national patent officesto meet demand and to benefit from new information-handlingand storage technologies.  In addition, patent office directors arebeing urged to charge "user fees" that reflect the real costs ofproviding services to inventors and patent attorneys.Automation may offer an economic solution that serves wellboth government agencies and patent applicants.In existence since 1790, the Patent and Trademark Officeexpects to deal with about 188,000 patents and 142,000trademark applications this year, and estimates that it will collectfees of about $486 million.  From its offices in Arlington, Va., astaff of 4,893 receive, examine and process America'stechnological hopes for the future.  As a link to the health oftechnology-based industries, Lehman said his office "stands atthe very [center] of a technology-based economy."  It issurprising that the Patent Office does not come under the aegisof the Commerce Department's newly empowered TechnologyAdministration, as do the National Institute of Standards andTechnology and the National Technical Information Service.Nevertheless, Lehman sees new opportunities for his agency.For example, through the recently announced InformationInfrastructure Task Force, he will lead an Intellectual PropertyWorking Group looking into policies that will encourage use ofthe new infrastructure.  His group will investigate ways ofensuring "copyright integrity" for creators of information andentertainment products, as well as investigate the relationship of"standards" and "open systems" to copyright law and "fair use"principles in the context of electronic superhighways.As part of the new U.S.-Japan trade-framework agreement, thePatent Office will be leading the U.S. government side on allintellectual property issues in these negotiations.  "Fewassignments given to the Commissioner of the Patent Officehave been more important that this one," Lehman said.NO LONGER A DICKENSIAN BACKWATEROnce a Dickensian backwater of information-handling with dustyshelves of dog-eared papers, shoe-box filing systems, primitivecopying machines and constant vulnerability to fire and rodentdamage, today's Patent Office is being equipped with automationsystems so its operations can run with fewer staff yet achievefaster response times.  These computerized systems includeworkstations with state-of-the-art graphic interfaces forexaminers and networks of databases with foreign patentorganizations.  Increasingly, CD-ROM formats are used forstoring and searching current and past patent records.Lehman recognizes that automation alone doesn't immediatelyimprove the quality or efficiency of its services.  "I believe that[quality] is closely linked in any organization with morale," hesaid.  To increase morale, Lehman will review the PatentOffice's structure and in particular the patent examining corpsand its support functions.  Lehman hopes to identify changeswhich will give improved support for examiners and create abetter sense of teamwork and customer service in all employees.Furthermore, examiners may be offered new career developmentopportunities--such as being detailed to other federal agencies--to broaden their experience and perspective.Concern has been voiced by Patent Office insiders andintellectual property lawyers about efforts to reduce patentpendency (the time it takes for a patent to be issued or anapplication to be rejected), and whether this is being achievedpartly at the expense of the quality of examination.  Lehmansaid the basis for this concern is that the patent examining corps'performance criteria emphasize production rather than "quality"in the examination process.  Ongoing quality audits by theagency's in-house patent quality review unit suggests that qualityis improving; however, Lehman said the criteria used to judgeexaminers needs a closer look to see if changes could provideincentives for quality equal to those encouraging production.In a new mission statement for the Patent Office, CommerceSecretary Ronald H. Brown recently defined its role as:Administering the laws relating to patents and trademarks so asto promote U.S. industrial and technological progress andstrengthen the national economy;Developing and advising the secretary and the administration onintellectual property policy, including copyright matters; and Advising the secretary and other U.S. government agencies,such as the U.S. trade representative, on trade-related aspects ofintellectual property in cooperation with the International TradeAdministration.One of Lehman's urgent tasks will be to consider the possibleadoption of the first-to-file patent system as a prelude to thePatent Harmonization Treaty.  Presently the United States usesa first-to-invent approach but is the only developed country usingit.  First-to-file and other changes recommended by an AdvisoryCommission on Patent Law Reform in September 1992, wouldpermit integration of the United States into an internationalpatent system.  A consensus initially appeared to supportadopting them but has since deteriorated and Lehman will holdpublic hearings and solicit new comments on the matter.  Arecent General Accounting Office report found that 66 percentof the companies it surveyed were in favor of the change.Despite his background in intellectual property, Lehman seemsunlikely to be a prisoner of the system.  Addressing AmericanBar Association members in New York recently, he said "It's mydesire to develop a better mechanism for making and exercisingthe office's obligation to make policy in a variety of areasinvolving patent, trademark and copyright systems.  All too often[the Patent Office] had been a passive bystander as technology,the courts or Congress have forced it into reacting to a limitednumber of policy choices.  Many historic decisions as topatentability of a new art have been made in a `Star Chamber'proceeding in the commissioner's office with only a few insiderspresent and nothing more to go on than the informationsupplied by one patent applicant.  I intend to reverse thisprocess."  Lehman is drawing up a list of areas of "turmoil" andwill hold public hearings on the policy options involved.  Topicslikely to be examined are computer-related inventions,particularly software, and biotechnology inventions.  Perhaps in afew more years, Lehman speculated, the ability to examinepatents using a desk-top personal computer may lead us toquestion whether we even need a centralized patent office anylonger.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY ENLISTEDIN WAR AGAINST BREAST CANCERThe Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory and Fischer Imaging Corp. of Denver signed acooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) lastweek to create a new mammography system that will allowearlier detection of breast cancer.The three-year, $3.28 million agreement will utilize an imagingtechnology previously developed for weapons applications.Fischer is funding 73 percent of the project.  While both DOEand Fischer will contribute "nearly equally" in the initial r&dphase, according to DOE, Fischer will support the clinical trialsand the approval process before the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA).After devoting three years to solving technical problems, it isexpected to take another two years to prove the system works inclinical tests and to obtain FDA approval.  The research phase isestimated to cost less that $2 million, with the clinical trials andapproval process costing another $1.5 million.Specifically, the CRADA is aimed at "developing a new imagingsystem that will produce clearer images using less radiation, thusenabling earlier and more accurate detection of breast cancerand the saving of lives," according to DOE.  The CRADApartners will develop a device that eliminates the use of X-rayfilm, and instead uses sophisticated detectors to directly recordthe X-ray image in digital form.  The detector array employscharge coupled devices (CCDs) to record 20 million individualpixels, each 30 times smaller than the period at the end of asentence.  Since the image is digital, a computer can be used toenhance the image.At the signing ceremony held in Washington on Oct. 6, EnergySecretary Hazel O'Leary said "Health care is technologyintensive and the battle for better, safer and cheaper health caredemands that we use every weapon at our disposal.  Thenational laboratories are a vital element in our technologyarsenal, and this agreement shows that we are using thelaboratories to help wage the battle for improved health care."Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said the agreement "is abreakthrough in the area of defense conversion and abreakthrough in the fight against an epidemic."Also, the technology commercialized under this agreement isexpected to hasten the widespread use of "telemedicine" insofaras it will allow transmission of images over informationhighways, facilitating communication between radiologists.  Dr.Faina Shtern, head of the Diagnostic Imaging Research Branchof the National Cancer Institute, praised the project and said,"While digital mammography is still under development, itspotential to improve breast cancer management warrants furtherresearch."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993CANADIAN BELL SCIENTIST CLAIMS TO CRACKDES ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM; NIST CONSIDERINGREVIEWA Canadian computer scientist claims to have designed amachine to crack the federal government's Data EncryptionStandard (DES), merely by searching random numbers at high-speeds for a few hours.  Michael J. Wiener, a scientist with Bell-Northern Research in Ottawa, presented the paper at aconference in August.  A spokeswoman for the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology, whose scientists originallydesigned the DES algorithm in 1981, said they first saw thedocument Oct. 13 and have not yet evaluated Weiner's blueprint.DES is used widely in computer communications.The heart of the machine is a special chip that Weiner said cantest the keys "at the impressive rate of 50 million per second," byeliminating the need to feed data in and out of the chip while itis running. Wiener undertook designing the chip and explaininghow it works in a 47-page document "for the purpose ofassessing the resistance of DES to an exhaustive attack," he said.By using this attack, "DES keys can be found one to two ordersof magnitude faster than other recently proposed designs."Wiener said his design shows how to build a machine for $1million that will break DES in about 3.5 hours."The chip can be comfortably clocked at 50 MHz," slower thanthe chips which run a 486 computer, "and would cost $10.50 tomanufacture," Wiener said.  In the machine, ten key search chipsare controlled by a "microcontroller" which searches for codes.The machine uses 12 groups of 10 chips, controlled by a mastermicrocontroller to form a "shelf."  "Four shelves are contained toform a frame which is controlled by a PC.  A frame costs$100,000 and contains 5760 key search chips," the document said.DES CRACKED `ALARMINGLY QUICKLY'"USING the design described here, DES keys can be foundalarmingly quickly," Weiner wrote.  Given that a key search chiptests 50 million keys per second and a frame costs $100,000 andcontains 5760 chips, he computed the following approximatesearch-time-to-cost ratios:  A $100,000 machine would take 35hours to crack the code; a $1 million machine would take 3.5hours; and a $10 million machine would take only 21 minutes.He said a machine could be built in ten months by three people.With labor, support and manufacturing, Weiner estimated asimple machine would cost a total of $500,000 to build.DES may be replaced by the new Clipper Chip data encryptionalgorithm called "skipjack," an allegedly impenetrable encryptionalgorithm introduced by the Clinton administration in April.  Inan independent review of the Clipper Chip, GeorgetownUniversity Computer Science Professor Dorothy Denning said itwould be 36 years before the cost of breaking skipjack byexhaustive search will be equal to the cost of breaking the DataEncryption Standard today.  "Thus, there is no significant riskthat Skipjack will be broken by exhaustive search in the next 30to 40 years," Denning said (ITP, Aug. 9, p. 13).Wiener told ITP that his research was intended as an exercise tohelp DES users asses the strength of the encryption.  Heemphasized that he has not built a machine, but only providedthe blueprints for a chip, and that NIST has not commented onhis work.  He added that cracking DES did not imply that thesame key search techniques could be used to crack the ClipperChip "skipjack" algorithm.  "Certainly all encryption systems aremore or less vulnerable.  It depends on the size of the keys."Noting that skipjack used very large keys, he said it would not bepractical to attack with random key searches.David Banisar, a policy analyst for Computer Professionals forSocial Responsibility, a public interest organization that monitorsencryption policy, said the code-breaking chip is significantbecause it creates in practice what has previously been proposedonly in theory.  "He's actually gone through with a computer-aided design program and designed the chip, which nobody haddone before," Banisar said.  Weiner noted that DES could stillremain foolproof if its algorithm was tripled in each use.  If usedin this way, the encryption code in effect becomes numerically"larger than the national debt spread around the earth and moonin orbit," Banisar added.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993MEMBER STATES' WORRIES SLOWEC PROGRESS ON R&D FRAMEWORK PLANBRUSSELS--Work is proceeding slowly on the EuropeanCommission's proposal for a new EC framework program forr&d.  EC research ministers discussed this proposal, which is thefourth in a series of four-year programs, for EC funding lastJune and they were scheduled to do so again Oct. 11.All 12 member states have expressed serious reservations aboutthe commission's proposal.  The difficulties mainly concern theproposed budget of 13 billion ECUs (1 ECU = $1.17) from 1994to 1998.  But selection criteria for r&d program support also arecontroversial.  The budget figures put forward by EC memberstates vary from 6.5 billion to 14 billion ECUs.  Generally, it isexpected that member states will try to narrow this range tosome figure below 13 billion ECUs.  That sentiment concernsthe commission, whose staff believes a budget of 13 billionECUs is the minimum necessary for the EC to support r&d.Most member states still disagree with the commission'sdistribution of funds within research categories, but it seemsclear that they agree on reducing funding for communicationsand information technology.  The commission and memberstates want to give their final approval to this frameworkprogram in December.  This goal is ambitious.  The problemscited above are substantial.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993INTELSAT GROUP TO STUDY PRIVATIZATIONIN RESPONSE TO REQUEST BY U.S. OFFICIALSA special Intelsat working party has agreed to a U.S. proposal toinclude the privatization of the global satellite consortium on thegroup's agenda of strategic issues for further study.Representatives of the U.S. government and the U.S. signatory,Comsat Corp., proposed that the working party include on itsagenda a study of the implications of converting Intelsat from"an international, intergovernmental organization into a privatemultinational corporation," an informed source told ITP.  Theworking party met in Washington last month following theconclusion of the Intelsat Board of Governors meeting Sept. 9 to15.  The meeting was convened to establish an agenda of keyissues for Intelsat's future that need near-term study.An Intelsat spokesman confirmed that "the issue of privatizationis on the agenda" of the working group but noted that the groupwas charged by Intelsat's Assembly of Parties last Novemberwith studying a host of strategic issues.  "It would almost beremiss if they didn't consider privatization," he said, "but it is nota foregone conclusion.  We're not looking at it to happentomorrow or two years from now, but there's obviously apossibility it could happen over the long term."The working group originally had been formed to considerresponses to calls by the United States and some other membernations for a loosening of requirements under Article XIV(d) ofthe Intelsat Agreement for consultations with Intelsat beforemember nations permit the use of separate satellite systems forinternational services.The U.S. proposal to look at a privatization of Intelsat reflecteda view by U.S. government policy-makers that Intelsat needs thegreatest possible flexibility to meet growing international satelliteservice competition, sources said.  "Increasingly, it's a strain forthe U.S. government to try and mediate battles between Intelsatand its competitors, when we believe Intelsat needs greaterflexibility, and its competitors say it shouldn't have that flexibilitywhile it retains the treaty privileges and immunities," one U.S.government source said.  "So, it seems to make sense to considerthis--the option of privatization and the pros and cons."In their presentations to the Intelsat working party, U.S.government and Comsat representatives reportedly made it clearthat the United States is committed to Intelsat remainingeconomically competitive and that it recognizes "the universalservice principles inherent in the Intelsat agreements" and thefact that Intelsat remains the only provider of satellite serviceswith global reach.Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993TOUGH CHOICES FACE U.S. MANUFACTURINGJOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE TOLDThe U.S. government should adopt an "industrial developmentpolicy" to provide guidance to small and medium-sizedmanufacturing companies, said Philip Braverman, senior vicepresident and chief economist of DKB Securities Corp, Oct. 5 ata Joint Economic Committee hearing chaired by Rep. LeeHamilton (D-IN).Braverman said such businesses were "likely to benefit mostfrom a stream of information and suggestions on where theirinvestment dollars might be most expeditiously placed and whichare the most likely avenues for productive research."  He alsosuggested holding regional, industry-wide meetings attended bytop people in various fields to "plan collectively" for the future."Recognized experts in various high-technology disciplines couldbe invited to take `dollar-a-year' government positions to fosterprogress in their fields," Braverman said.  Pilot projects, modeledafter the recently announced government and industrypartnership to develop an environmentally correct car, should beencouraged.Braverman was one of three witnesses before the committee--allof whom agreed that difficult choices confront U.S.manufacturing in its efforts to deal with declining jobs,intensified foreign competition and sluggish adoption of newtechnologies.  The hearing examined recent statistics ofmanufacturing job losses and the prospects for halting or slowingthis trend through stimulating U.S. manufacturing growth,possibly using new technologies.Hamilton expressed concern over the latest unemploymentfigures, saying they showed that each month the equivalent ofone-and-a-half Fortune 500 company's employees lost their jobsin the nation's manufacturing sector and this posed seriousquestions about the future of America's manufacturingcapabilities for domestic as well as export markets.Hamilton's remarks were put into national perspective by JulieFox Gorte, senior associate at the congressional Office ofTechnology Assessment (OTA).  She said that more than 18million Americans, or 15 percent of the U.S. workforce, wereemployed in manufacturing.Generally these were "jobs with better pay and superior benefitsthan the average for production and nonsupervisory workers,"Gorte said "[so] people who lose manufacturing jobs typicallyfind replacements only with either lower pay, fewer benefits orboth.  For that reason alone, dwindling manufacturingemployment is a concern."Gorte referred to several OTA studies which identified possiblepolicy options to reduce the impact of foreign competitivenesson U.S. industry.  But she said "An issue [currently] facing manysmaller manufacturers in particular is lack of access to bankfinancing; even though the recession is officially over, many(especially smaller enterprises) are having a tough time gettingloans.  This situation developed after OTA's work oncompetitiveness was delivered, so our reports suggest no optionsto remedy it; however, the issue needs addressing."TECHNOLOGY MOVES TOO FAST FOR SMALLCOMPANIESCommenting on possible measures to increase technologydiffusion, Gorte said the pace of technological change was "oftenfaster than enterprise managers can cope with" at small- andmedium-sized companies who also have trouble "learning aboutand understanding new production machinery and techniques, orsoft production technologies such as continuous improvementand statistical process controls."She observed that Japan and Germany both have "well-developed networks to inform small manufacturers of whattechnological improvements (both hard and soft) they couldmake," and noted that extensive public subsidies for loans toenable small enterprises to adopt new technologies existed inJapan, Korea and several other nations.In the United States, Gorte characterized such systems oftechnological extension and information service as "much morerudimentary, particularly at the federal level."  Although a fewstates have well-developed manufacturing extension services,they are "typically much smaller than the potential demand fortheir services," Gorte noted.  Learning from and expanding onthe most promising of the new technology extension efforts,including parts of the recently authorized TechnologyReinvestment Program, over the next several years wasrecommended.Gorte singled out as an example of a small yet meritoriouspublic cost-sharing program in civilian technology development,the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  "In the few yearsof its operation [ATP] has gained a reputation for sensiblemanagement and promising investment," Gorte said.  "Earlyevaluations show that it continues to look promising."Back to Headline List CopyrightINSIDE TECHNOLOGY POLICY via NewsNetOctober 18, 1993BRIEFSThe Commerce Department this week will announce the winneror winners of the 1993 Malcolm Baldrige National QualityAward.

The officials said the ministry has ordered an overhaul of thedata bank which was set up in April this year.     The network collects information on a national scale aboutpatients and matches them with an organ when one becomes availableto ensure a fair and equitable system for the transplants.     The irregularities apparently originated when inaccurate dataunder the old system, collected mainly by a national hospital inSakura in Chiba Prefecture, were fed into the new network, theofficials said.     One male patient in Niigata Prefecture on the central Sea ofJapan coast was denied a request for a transplant after he wasclassified as dead.  He is still undergoing artificial dialysis.     Another patient in the same prefecture, who had received atransplant, was also classified as dead.     Faulty computer software also caused one patient in the Kinkiregion around Osaka and Kobe to be removed from the priority list fortransplant.     The error was discovered when the patient's doctor madeinquiries about the change, and the patient's chances for atransplant were not affected.     Some 20,000 people are listed on the system and till lateNovember, 112 transplant operations had been carried out under it.Back to Headline List CopyrightJAPAN SCIENCE SCAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996Child born after sperm cultivated from sterile father+NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo     A Japanese woman succeeded in delivering a child this monthusing a method in which sperm cultivated directly from testiculartissue of the sterile father was injected into her egg cells,doctors at Nagoya University's medical department said Monday.

Suganuma's team cultivated a tiny bit of tissue taken from theman's testicles until they yielded four mature sperm cells, whichthey injected into four of the wife's ova in a microscopicfertilization technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection(ICSI).     One fertilized egg cell was returned to the woman's womb, andshe was confirmed pregnant two weeks later, the doctors said.

Pending formal approval by thepanel's subcommittee on liver transplants, the surgery might beconducted in early January, they said.     According to the university, it would be the first time in Japanthat a live liver transplantation has been conducted on a patient whohas received a liver from a brain-dead donor in an earlier operation.     The boy received his first liver transplant in an operation inAustralia in December 1988, when live liver transplants were still ataboo in Japan.     However, the boy continued to suffer from bleeding after thefirst operation, prompting doctors to advocate another try with alive transplant from his mother.

The ministry cites an epidemiological study of more than 20,000women in the United States, which showed that women whose dailyvitamin A intake was more than 15,000 international units (IU) were3.5 times more likely to give birth to a deformed child than womenwho had less than 5,000 IU a day.     ''There is no reason to be overly concerned as long as one keepsto a normal diet, but in the initial stages of pregnancy women mustavoid supplementing their dietary intake with massive doses ofvitamin A preparations or vitamin cocktails containing it,'' theministry said.     Among those women who supplemented their dietary vitamin Aintake with 10,000 IU from vitamin pills or vitamin mixtures, one in57 women delivered a child with a deformity such as hare lip orhydrocephalus.     In addition to refraining from taking vitamin pills and otherfood supplements containing vitamin A, pregnant women should alsoavoid vitamin A rich foods.     Such foods are, for instance, dried lamprey eel which containssome 150,000 IU of the vitamin per 100 grams, chicken liver with47,000 IU and pork liver with 43,000 IU, according to the ministry.     Some medications also contain the potentially harmful vitamin.Depending on age and other physical parameters doctors recommend adaily dietary allowance of at least 1,800 IU.     The average daily intake in Japan stands at 2,600 IU, far belowa dosage that could be harmful, ministry officials said.     In a bid to prevent people from taking an overdosage theministry is, nonetheless, considering issuing special nutritionalguidelines, ministry officials said.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-16IA087-000629-B028-180http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/rd52.html 205.156.212.5 19970122042948 text/html 37564HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:27:52 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:11 GMTContent-length: 37377Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/rd52.html Sample Issue Copyright NDT UPDATE via NewsNet January 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES *FEATURES* UTILITY WORKS TO CHANGE NDE CRITERIA FOR GENERATOR TUBES (686 words) IOWA STATE DEVELOPS NDT TECHNIQUE FOR GLOBAL INSPECTIONS (566 words) NRC AUDITS WESTINGHOUSE FOR MISSED INSPECTIONS (368 words) *INDUSTRY OBSERVER* PARTNERS SCORE SUCCESS WITH ULTRASONIC SENSOR (175 words) NAVAL CENTER MARKETS ITS NDE EXPERTISE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR (242 words) NDT FINDS CRACKING AT TWO REACTORS (239 words) IN BRIEF (420 words) *WASHINGTON NEWS* FAA TIGHTENS WING INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS (455 words) AFTER NDT DISCOVERS PROBLEMS, NRC BOOSTS OVERSIGHT AT MILLSTONE REACTOR (291 words) *TECHNOLOGY WATCH* AGEMA DEVELOPS NEW THERMOGRAPHY SYSTEM TO SEE BELOW THE SURFACE (494 words) NASA EVALUATES NDT TECHNIQUES FOR COMPOSITES (208 words) RECENT CONTRACT AWARDS (158 words) AVAILABLE CONTRACTS (697 words) CopyrightNDT UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996UTILITY WORKS TO CHANGE NDE CRITERIA FORGENERATOR TUBESIn the coming months, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)plans to spend $3-4 million to help develop newnondestructive examination criteria for cracked steamgenerator tubing in nuclear reactors.  If approved by theNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the new criteriawould, for the first time, allow some circumferentiallycracked tubes to remain in service.ComEd's action is prompted by the discovery in Novemberof about 2,000 indications of circumferential cracking in thesteam generator tubes of the utility's Byron-1 nuclear reactor.Because of the extensive cracking, the utility has proposed topull 10 tubes from Byron-1 -- one of the largest tube pulls inthe U.S. to date.  The tubes will be used to validate NDEcrack detection and sizing techniques as well as estimate leakrate and burst data.ComEd will be working with the Electric Power ResearchInstitute (EPRI), which is leading the nuclear industry'sefforts to develop new plugging criteria for cracked steamgenerator tubes.  Circumferentially cracked tubes traditionallyhave been plugged upon discovery.  However, withextensive cracking being found in several plants around thecountry, large-scale plugging is threatening the economicviability of some reactors.EPRI's project to develop alternate plugging criteria is beingcarried out by three contractors -- Westinghouse, Zetec, andAptech -- which are developing NDE techniques and stresscorrosion cracking samples for inspector qualification testing.EPRI recently ironed out an agreement among all majornuclear vendors on the NDE parameters for sizingcircumferential cracking in non-sleeved tubes.  The agreementshould help to yield a consistent set of inspection data whenreactors around the country undergo their next outages.The inspection data collected during the outages, and fromlaboratory testing, will be used to develop approximate flawgrowth rates for cracking tubes.  Being able to accuratelypredict how fast cracks will grow is essential for reducing thechance of a tube rupture.The means to assess crack growth rates took on even moreimportance in November when EPRI submitted a proposal tothe NRC to allow known circumferential cracks to remain inservice so that their growth rates can be tracked.  EPRIproposed that a cracked tube could be boxed in by pluggingall the surrounding tubes so that, if a rupture occurred,damage to nearby tubes would be minimized.  The NRC hasaccepted the proposal with some reservations, but has not yetmade a final decision.ComEd technicians hope that by pulling tubes from Byron-1,they can gather data about crack growth rates and NDEdetection capabilities that could be applied to Braidwood-1,another ComEd reactor.  Commonwealth is seeking to makeBraidwood a lead plant for implementation of alternateplugging criteria for top of the tube sheet circumferentialcracking.ComEd technicians recently found 25 indications ofcircumferential cracking at Braidwood, which has a similardesign to Byron.  The utility is preparing itself in case theextensive cracking that occurred at Byron happens atBraidwood as well.  Braidwood-1 has two cycles and Byron-1 has two and a half cycles remaining before their steamgenerators are scheduled to be replaced.Commonwealth has already been able to obtain an alternateplugging criterion for another problem at Byron andBraidwood: outer diameter stress corrosion cracking at thetube support plates.  In November, the NRC approved a 3-volt eddy current criterion, which is the highest to date.NRC's traditional criteria is more stringent, requiring utilitiesto plug reactor steam generator tubes when an eddy currentreading of one volt or greater is detected.NRC's approval of the higher voltage standard included arequirement to lock in a number of tubes into the tube supportplates.  ComEd estimates that using the higher voltagethreshold could save it from plugging 1,020 tubes at Byron-1and 913 tubes at Braidwood-1.  This would result in acombined savings of at least $5.7 million.The agency's decision is an important indication that a 3-voltthreshold may come into wider use by the NRC.  Althoughthe criterion applied only to ComEd, Westinghouse, whichdesigned Byron and Braidwood, is expected to seek a genericapproval of the new threshold.Back to Headline List CopyrightNDT UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996IOWA STATE DEVELOPS NDT TECHNIQUE FORGLOBAL INSPECTIONSResearchers at Iowa State University have developed a newNDT technique called GlobalView that achieves the globalinspection of objects of all sizes using ultrasound.  Itsinventors say the technique has a variety of applicationsranging from inspections of civil structures and airframes toearth crust monitoring.The GlobalView technique, also known as spread spectrumnondestructive testing, combines ultrasonic testing withtechnology from the NAVSTAR Global Positioning Systemand radar signature analysis.  GlobalView transmits a verywide bandwidth ultrasonic signal that floods the test object orstructure with acoustic energy.  As with traditional pulse-echoultrasonic systems, this signal propagates in the material andis reflected by inhomogeneities which may be flaws.However, unlike pulse-echo systems, which rely on thetransit time of the ultrasonic wave to locate flaws, theGlobalView system measures the composite characteristic ofthe entire acoustic system including the structure and thetransducers.  By measuring the cross-correlation functionsbetween the various input and output transducers, the systemcan form an aggregate acoustic signature of an object orstructure.The GlobalView unit compares the original, or reference,acoustic signature with one taken at a later date to indicate thepresence of flaws or to determine if changes in the objecthave occurred.  By taking an object's acoustic signature, thesystem can detect changes in the object's characteristics suchas volume, shape, dimension, composition, density,homogeneity, and acoustic velocity.The signal processing used with this wideband signal iscapable of increasing the sensitivity of the measurement bymany orders of magnitude beyond what is possible withconventional ultrasonic testing.  Thus, the instrument canpenetrate highly-attenuative materials.Iowa State researchers, led by principal investigators SteveRussell, Samuel Wormley, and Emmanuel Papadakis, havebuilt and tested two prototype systems.  The first systemmainly consists of software that is used in conjunction withcommercially-available ultrasonic instrumentation.  Thesecond prototype is mainly hardware, using analog methodsfor most of the signal processing.While the software approach provides maximum flexibility,researchers say the hardware approach would be lessexpensive to manufacture and would have faster processingtimes.The technique is particularly useful for inspecting objectswith "blind spots" or other geometries that prevent the use ofpulse-echo or pitch catch ultrasonic techniques.  Parts orstructures composed of high attenuation materials or withrestricted access are also good candidates for GlobalView.Researchers have found that the technique can distinguishbetween flaws because different types of changes or identicalchanges in different locations show up uniquely in thecorrelation signature.  GlobalView has been successful inlocating small flaws in copper blocks, small steel assemblyline parts, and large sections of bridge structure.The developers say GlobalView will make it possible toperform continuous, low-cost, monitoring of bridges andairframes and other critical structures.  For example,airframes could be automatically monitored before eachtakeoff to insure structural integrity while avoiding expensivedown time for detailed inspections.However, the technique also has applications beyondtraditional NDT tasks.  Earthquake fault zones could bemonitored for changes below the surface of the earth to helppredict earthquakes.  GlobalView could also be used for oilexploration by creating an acoustic signal that penetrates deepinto the earth's crust.Contact: Steve F.

NRC auditors are also seekinginformation on why Westinghouse used an eddy currentprobe that had not been fully qualified to inspect 4,000 tubesupport intersections during the reactor's current outage.According to Ted Sullivan, a section chief in NRC's Office ofNuclear Reactor Regulations, the agency has prepared a draftaudit report that is due to be finalized and released to thepublic in January.  Sullivan said that the site visit to theWestinghouse facility near Pittsburgh lasted from Oct. 23rdto Oct. 27th.The NRC began the audit after finding out that Westinghousetechnicians had used an 0.080-inch-diameter motorizedrotating pancake coil eddy current probe to inspect dentedintersections at Salem-1.  The Electric Power ResearchInstitute (EPRI) has approved the 0.080-inch-diameter probeto detect cracks for tube support plates without dents, but notat dented intersections.  EPRI has qualified an 0.115-inchdiameter probe for inspections of dented intersections.While using EPRI-qualified probes is the industry norm,inspection vendors and utilities can also approveindependently the use of other probes for specific tasks suchas inspecting dented tube support plate intersections.However, there is the danger that flaws may be missed unlessthe proper probe and instrumentation is used.Westinghouse is trying to get the 0.080-inch-diameter probequalified by EPRI, but the company will most likely have tore-inspect Salem-1's steam generators before the qualificationprocess is completed.The NRC also wants to find out why Westinghouseinspectors failed to detect a number of tubes with greater than40% throughwall cracks during a 1993 outage at Salem-1.These tubes had remained in service during the reactor'soperating cycle, although they should have been pluggedprior to restart.The NRC has had to inspect the Salem-1 plant several timesover the last few years because of numerous operationalviolations.  The agency has fined Public Service Electric &Gas Co., Salem's operator, more than $2.3 million since1980.Back to Headline List CopyrightNDT UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996PARTNERS SCORE SUCCESS WITH ULTRASONICSENSORMorton International's Automotive Safety Products Division,based in Utah, has adapted an ultrasonic system developed bythe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) toinspect airbag inflators for welder verification and processcontrol.Morton-ASP is the leading supplier of airbag inflators to theautomotive industry.  Under a cooperative research anddevelopment agreement, NIST's Materials ReliabilityDivision in Boulder, Colo., worked with Morton engineers todevelop, test and install a prototype nondestructive testingsystem for verifying that there are no anomalies associatedwith the weld joint process of the mass-produced inflators.A unique feature of this inspection system was the use ofelectromagnetic acoustic transducers, or EMATs, which canperform the necessary ultrasonic tests at high speed withoutcontaminating the part or the environment with couplantfluids.Off-line trials involved examining up to 100,000 inflators andwere so successful that Morton contracted Sonic Sensors ofSan Luis Obispo, Calif., to build three commercial units.These units are now installed on the production lines andprovide process control information on the weldingoperations.Back to Headline List CopyrightNDT UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996NAVAL CENTER MARKETS ITS NDE EXPERTISE TOTHE PRIVATE SECTORAs defense budgets shrink, an increasing number of militarybases and research centers are marketing their R&D efforts tothe private sector.

The FAA's actionwas prompted by reports that cracks have been found in therear spar web of the wings of an in-service airplane andduring fatigue testing on a test wing.The cracking, which could result in reduced structuralintegrity of the wing, occurred due to fatigue-related highshear stress.  The directive affects 89 airplanes of U.S.registry.A second AD applies to McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, -30,and -40 series airplanes, and KC-10A military airplanes.This action requires repetitive visual inspections to detectcorrosion or cracking of the lower front spar cap and the skinpanel of the horizontal stabilizer, and repair of corroded orcracked parts.The spar cap must be modified according to a McDonnellDouglas service bulletin before the accumulation of 42,000total landings for DC-10-10 airplanes and before 30,000landings for DC-10-30, -40, and KC-10A aircraft.  The ADwas prompted by reports indicating that corrosion, caused bywater entrapment, was found on the horizontal stabilizer inthese types of aircraft.The FAA's new requirements affect approximately 286 DC-10 and KC-10A aircraft worldwide, 142 of which areregistered in the U.S.  The FAA estimates it will costoperators $20 million to comply with the AD.The FAA also added extra inspection requirements for DC-10-10 series planes.  In a separate AD, the agency isrequiring visual and eddy current inspections of the wings todetect cracks in the aft spar lower cap, in certain stringerbutterfly clips on the bulkheads, and in certain fastener holes.The FAA has found that, during fatigue testing of the wingstructure, cracks developed in these areas due to fatigue-related stress.The inspections must be performed before 15,000 landingshave accumulated and modifications to the affected parts mustbe completed within five years of the AD.  The FAAestimates that 53 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected bythis AD, costing a total of $7.5 million for compliance.Another AD requires eddy current inspections to detectcracking of the upper spar angles on the left and right sides ofthe wing pylons on McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplanes.This inspection must be repeated if an aircraft experiences anexcessive maneuver, turbulence overload, or hard landing.The upper spar angles must be replaced by Dec. 27, 2000.Approximately 123 MD-11 aircraft worldwide are affected bythis action.Back to Headline List CopyrightNDT UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996AFTER NDT DISCOVERS PROBLEMS, NRC BOOSTSOVERSIGHT AT MILLSTONE REACTORThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is addinginspectors at the Millstone Station nuclear power plant inWaterford, Connecticut after intensive nondestructive testingturned up several faulty welds in piping systems that need tobe repaired.In December, the NRC decided to place both a senior residentinspector and resident inspector at each of the three Millstoneunits.  Currently, one senior resident and four residentinspectors are assigned to the site.The NRC's action was prompted when the Millstone 3 unitwas taken offline in late November so workers could removeinsulation in the reactor coolant system and evaluate a leakingvalve that prevents water from backflowing in a 10-inch pipe.During the inspection, workers discovered a defective weldon one of four 3/4-inch pipes in the instrumentation for thereactor coolant system.  Northeast Utilities, the reactor'soperator, decided to shut down the plant to repair the faultyweld and to replace an additional 15 welds in theinstrumentation system as a precaution.At the same time, an intensive ultrasonic inspection was madeof 154 welds in piping systems around the Millstone 1reactor.  Inspectors discovered 11 welds that needed repair.The utility is now using a robotic welding process to lay newweld material over the old weld.In addition to increasing its oversight of Millstone, the NRCalso sent Northeast Utilities a letter requesting information onwhat actions the utility has taken to ensure that futureoperation of Millstone 1 will be conducted in accordance withits operating license and NRC regulations.

Itsdevelopers say the new technique is faster and more accuratethan active thermographic inspection techniques.Lock-in thermography is unlike either passive or activethermographic techniques.  Passive thermography convertsinfrared radiation emanating from an object into a thermalpicture of the object's surface.In active thermography, an energy source such as a flashlampis aimed at the test object and the heat flow through thespecimen is measured.  Flaws in the specimen cause changesin the heat flow which are detected by a thermal imagingsystem.While active thermography has the advantage of being anoncontact technique, it also has certain drawbacks.  Thetechnique requires several lengthy tests to eliminate the effectsof different emissivities across the surface of a material.Active techniques such as pulse thermography must take intoconsideration the effects of ambient radiation and oftenrequire high energy levels that can lead to unacceptableheating of materials.Lock-in thermography was developed to overcome thelimitations of both active and passive techniques.  In lock-inthermography, a harmonically modulated source, usually in asinusoidal waveform, is used to energize the test material.Defects in the material produce reflections that interfere withthe incoming waves and create a pattern that is detected by athermal imager.  The imager measures the signal amplitude offour phase-correlated points on this wave and the results areaveraged.A computer is used to interpret the measurements picked upby the imager and to create amplitude and phase images of thetest object that are independent of ambient radiation andvariations in emissivity.  According to Agema, amplitude andphase images of an object can be produced in a couple ofminutes using a high-speed computer.The lock-in system is based on Agema's Thermovision 900thermal imaging system which produces real-timemeasurements and has 12-bit digital image processing.  Theunit also includes a dedicated system controller for high-speed data processing and specially adapted software thatcoverts thermographic measurements into amplitude andphase images.  The system produces a pure sine wave that issynchronized with the frequency of the Thermovision 900scanner.Lock-in thermography is being developed in partnership withStuttgart University and MTU Munich, a leading Germanmanufacturer of turbine blades.  The technique has been usedto inspect objects like an electronic resistor and a honeycombstructure, but the researchers are now examining a widervariety of materials.To date, most of the tests have been carried out at frequenciesbetween 3.75 Hz and 0.03 Hz, giving depth rages of 3 mmfor non-metals and 10 mm for metals.  The next stage ofdevelopment will involve adapting the lock-in thermographysystem for a range research environments.Contact: Agema Infrared Systems, Arden House, WestStreet, Leighton Buzzard, Beds LU7 7DD, England.

The study foundthat certain ultrasonic methods can provide quantitative dataon microstructural anomalies and that time-resolvedthermography can be a useful noncontact method fordetecting delaminations.The researchers evaluated a method for obtaining preciseultrasonic measurements and mapping which provides dataon sound velocities, coefficients of attenuation, and peakfrequencies of echoes.  Also evaluated was an acousto-ultrasonic technique that generates data on velocities and ratesof decay of waves in plates.Among the study's finding were that speeds of sound varywith fractions of volume occupied by pores and fibers.Researchers also determined that coefficients of attenuationincrease with degrees of inhomogeneity of volume fractionsof pores and fibers.The researchers' results also confirmed the efficacy of usingtime-resolved thermography as a noncontact, nonionizingmethod for detecting anomalies such as delaminations.  Themethod is particularly valuable because it requires access toonly one side of a specimen.  This allows the technique to beused at more stages of fabrication and processing than otherNDT techniques that require access to both sides. .DEPARTMENT***********************BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES***********************Back to Headline List CopyrightNDT UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996RECENT CONTRACT AWARDS%  Agema Infrared Systems (Secaucus, NJ) recently won a $5million contract from the Department of Defense to supplyinfrared imaging systems.

The committee blasted statements fromthe Bell holding companies that other nations are surpassing theUnited States in network modernization programs because ofregulatory and structural impediments in the United States."These arguments are nothing more than an attempt by the RBHCs tobuild a case for expansion of their present monopolisticpositions to include services from which they are now restrictedand to use their positions to reap even greater financial rewardsthan they have to date," the committee told NTIA."In short, far from being second rate, the United Statestelecommunications infrastructure is unsurpassed by any other inthe world," the committee's report states. "There is absolutelyno basis for believing that existing regulatory policies andpractices have impeded maintenance and improvement of thedomestic telecommunications infrastructure. The United States isinvesting in its telecommunication's infrastructure at rates of23 to 92 percent higher than in Japan and the major Europeannations."The committee includes Aetna Life and Casualty Co., AmericanAirlines Inc., American Express Co., Boeing Computer Services,Electric Data Systems Corp., Ford Motor Co., General ElectricCo., Honeywell Corp., IBM Corp. Monsanto Co., Online ComputerLibrary Center, J.C. Penney Co., Procter & Gamble Co., and SearsRoebuck & Co.The Ad Hoc Committee submitted its claims along with 120 othergroups this spring in response to a notice of inquiry publishedby NTIA regarding a comprehensive study on the domestictelecommunications infrastructure.The majority of respondents want to revise the nation'stelecommunications policy. In particular, an abundance of stategovernments and small companies filed wish lists for introducingand improving the use of fiber-optic networks to rural areas.States that filed extensive plans for comprehensive networksinclude Minnesota, Tennessee and Washington.Many submissions proposed plans for improving technological gapsor enhancing local medical and educational programs. However,comments by the nation's large corporations focused more oncontroversial federal policies which regulate the industry.Such policies "are burdens and critical liabilities to the U.S.position in the global economy," wrote the National Center forTelecommunications and Information Policy, the research andpolitical analysis division of the Public Service SatelliteConsortium."Until U.S. policymakers come to terms with these facts, both thefuture of the U.S. industrial base and critical constitutionalprotections embedded in our political culture will be placed incontinuing jeopardy," the division's report states.Contrasting the Ad Hoc Committee's comments, the strongest pleato loosen existing regulations was filed in a joint submission bythe Regional Bell Holding Cos., Southern New England TelephoneCo. and Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.Other nations "are leapfrogging us by focusing on their ownfuture telecommunications needs and adopting policies to meetthese needs, whether the United States remains in the game ornot," the joint report states.The phone companies argue that the use of private networks canhave unfair advantages for corporations using them. Privatenetworks can be designed to have excess circuitry. Operators ofthese networks would then be in a position to resell switching orline capacity to outside clients. Sears, Westinghouse, MerrillLynch, Northwest Airlines and Federal Express have spun offtelecommunication subsidiaries to do just that, the phonecompanies's report notes.The joint report urges NTIA to favor abandonment of the AT&TConsent Decree and several other regulations in favor of"forward-looking public policies," including: *  the establishment of depreciation rates that reflect the    reality of technological change; *  the adoption of incentive regulations; and *  the elimination of cable cross-ownership restrictions, which    ban local exchange carriers from offering video programs in    their own territories.AT&T agreed that policy changes are needed to end regulation ofthe industry. Moreover, AT&T's comments to NTIA stated that theU.S. government should foster competition abroad, promotestandard setting for interconnection and interoperation ofnetworks, adopt price-caps similar to what British Telecom didseveral years ago and foster domestic research and development.However, "the assertions that the nation's telecommunicationindustry is `second best' and `falling behind' other nations arenonsense," AT&T's report states. "This system has been plannedand built by private enterprise, not by the government, andnational telecommunications policy has been to place maximumreliance on competition and market forces for three decades."Indeed, since the competitiveness policy was fully implementedwith the [divestiture of the Bell system in 1982], thetelecommunications industry has experienced economic growth,technological innovation, and benefitted...users [whichis]...virtually unprecedented in American economic history,"AT&T's report continues. "The decision was thus a necessary andlogical step and, indeed, the watershed event in implementing thelongstanding national competitiveness policy."The National Cable Television Association expressed its concernthat the NTIA announcement suggested the adoption of mandatoryinvestment in a network to be funded by higher monthly telephonerates levied on all citizens."Such a policy would create serious inefficiencies in thedelivery of telecommunications services and end up costingaverage consumers billions of dollars for plant and equipmentdesigned to deliver services that they neither want nor need,"the cable association wrote.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW TECHNOLOGY WEEK via NewsNetApril 23, 1990CONGRESS LEVITATES OVER MAGLEVby Kimberly DozierAnother magnetic levitation bill has been launched in Congress,this one by Rep. Robert Mrazek (D-N.Y.), a member of the HouseAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.At a news conference last Wednesday, Mrazek said that if theUnited States does not have its own maglev system designed andready to be put in place in the next three years, foreigncompetitors will fill the void.Mrazek's bill calls for $50 million in the 1991 transportationbudget for a national design competition to set the standard fordomestic maglev systems. The program would be managed by a maglevadministration set up within the Department of Transportation.This group would establish minimum health, safety andenvironmental standards for the industry, and establish safetyrules and regulations.The $50 million would be the preliminary portion of $350 millionto be awarded to no more than six finalists in the designcompetition, with an additional $600 million to be given out tobuild a prototype system. The second-phase funding would beavailable to any state or local government, public-privateconsortium or any combination of government or private entities.The prototype, at least 40 miles long, must comply with thefederally selected design standard and demonstrate the commercialviability of the technology.The funds are not meant to be the bread and butter of maglev R&D,but a way to entice the domestic defense and aerospace industryinto joining the program. Maglev is seen by many as one of thefinancial saving graces for defense contractors as they face adecline in large military projects. Few industries, however, arewilling to risk R&D on what would be a radical departure fromtoday's transportation system without government leadership andat least token financial support.Should the program be successful, and contracts abound forvarious new maglev routes around the country, industry investmentis expected to exceed the original $950 million from the federalgovernment. Mrazek predicts that maglev could become a $30-billion to $60-billion industry.Mrazek said that though he and others were disappointed by the$6.1 million for maglev R&D in Transportation Secretary Skinner'sbudget request for fiscal year 1991, he does not anticipateadministration roadblocks to the proposed legislation. He addedthat he doesn't expect maglev to be a hard sell in Congress,since many congressmen represent areas with companies that wouldbenefit from the program.A growing number of bills are floating around on Capitol Hillthat favor maglev, including Sen. Ernest Hollings' (D-S.C.)S.2236 which would require the Department of Transportation tosupport more maglev research and foster a maglev system, and Sen.Daniel Moynihan's (D-N.Y.) bill that would initiate maglev R&Dunder the Federal Highway Administration's jurisdiction. Mrazek'sbill is the first to call for a federal maglev agency, and createa competitive program both for prototype design and corridorlocation.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW TECHNOLOGY WEEK via NewsNetApril 23, 1990FIRST CLEAN COAL RESULTS INThe first test results are coming in for the $5-billiongovernment-industry Clean Coal Technology program, Department ofEnergy officials say. An advanced pollution control process thatworks inside the ductwork of existing coal-burning power plantshas met its design objectives, removing up to 70 percent of theacid rain-causing sulfur pollutants from the exhaust gases of ahigh-sulfur coal-burning plant in Ohio.The $19.4-million project could lead to commercial use of the"Coolside" technology, developed by Consolidation Coal Co. ofPittsburgh. Coolside, an alternative to the more costly scrubbertechnology, is the first of two processes to be demonstrated byBabcock and Wilcox Co. of Alliance, Ohio, to control pollutionfrom older utility generating stations."The key advantage of the Coolside process is that by using theplant's existing equipment to capture pollutants, it avoids theneed to build large, costly add-on scrubbing vessels," saysRobert Gentile, the Energy Department's Assistant Secretary forFossil Energy. "This is especially important in smaller or olderplants that are tightly spaced or have short remaining operatinglives. And, because the process operates downstream of theboiler, it does not affect boiler performance and can be used ona wide range of boiler types and sizes.The Coolside process works by injecting sulfur-absorbing hydratedlime powder into the combustion gases after they leave the coalboiler. A mist of water droplets, along with sodium-basedadditives, are sprayed into the gases as they move through theplant's ductwork. The lime particles absorb the sulfur pollutantswhich are then captured by existing particulate collectiondevices. The water mist improves both the level of sulfur removaland the performance of the particulate collection equipment. Theprocess produces a dry, disposable waste product, rather than thewet sludge typical of today's scrubbers.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW TECHNOLOGY WEEK via NewsNetApril 23, 1990PHILLIPS LICENSES FUEL TECHNOLOGYRepsol Petroleo of Spain has licensed technology from PhillipsPetroleum Co. to produce high-octane unleaded motor fuels forsale in Europe.

The plancalls for more liberal rules for Eastern Europe than for theSoviet Union.The Bush administration's aim is to introduce new rules at a"historic" meeting of the 17-nation Coordinating Committee onMultilateral Export Controls (Cocom) in Paris on June 7 and 8.The proposed two-tier structure will be the subject of talks nextmonth between the U.S. and its Western allies.U.S. Commerce Department Undersecretary for Export AdministrationDennis Kloske, the point man for U.S. export control policy, tolda business conference last week that there is "an emergingconsensus" in the administration favoring the two-tier approach.His remarks followed disclosure, two weeks earlier, that theDefense Department had decided not to block exports of many U.S.computers to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, therebyallowing the Commerce Department control over the sales. The movewas seen as a victory for the Commerce Department, which haspushed for sole authority to monitor high technology sales.In his remarks last week, Kloske stressed that the proposed two-tier export regime means that Eastern European governments willhave to introduce controls to prevent re-export of Westerntechnologies to  the Soviet Union.Kloske also said that West Germany, in particular, should paymore attention to ensuring that its high technology exports toEast Germany do not end up in Soviet hands.The reason for retaining controls on high technology exports tothe USSR is fear that they will be used for military purposes.The U.S. is not opposed to relaxing the rules on sales ofcivilian non-strategic technologies to the Soviet Union, Kloskesaid.But trade experts quoted by Reuters say that Soviet officials areunlikely to stand by idly while the rest of the Warsaw Pactcountries catch up with Western technology.The Soviet Union "has been able to get its hands on much of thistechnology for years, even when it was restricted," said RandyBregman, director of Soviet and East European services for ApcoAssociates, a Washington-based consulting group.Many of the export controls have more political than practicalvalue, he added. If Hungary or Poland acquires certain newtechnologies, it won't take long for the know-how to show up inthe Soviet Union, in spite of formal controls, he said.Western manufacturers have much to gain from relaxing controls onexports to the Soviet Union because of that nation's largemarket potential compared with Eastern Europe, Bregman added. Hesaid that keeping formal controls in place would cause the SovietUnion short-term difficulties, particularly as it tries tomodernize its backward telecommunications system.The Soviets use a phone system that is more than 30 years old. Ithas only about 10 phone lines per 100 people, a ratio lower thanthat in Hungary, East Germany or Czechoslovakia. This compareswith 90 phones per 100 people in the U.S., and 60 lines per 100in Western Europe.U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said recently that theUnited States would agree to exports of 10-year-old telephonetechnology, which he said would help the Soviet economy. However,the older technology would force the Soviets to use an analogdial-up system rather than the digital push-button technology nowcommon in the West.Mosbacher, speaking in West Germany, explained that UnitedStates policy is to support perestroika, "but the reality is that[the Soviets] have the potential to be a great military threat."The use of 10-year old technology is not likely to be acceptablein the Soviet Union, argued Stepan Pachikov, a Soviet computerscientist who heads ParaGraph, a joint venture with a U.S. firmthat publishes Moscow's first computer newspaper."If we wanted to just upgrade 30 or 40 percent of our phonesystem, then the answer would be `yes,' 10-year-old technologyis good enough," Pachikov said.But he pointed out that Western nations had a tough time of itwhen they tried to adapt their analog phone systems to digitalcomputer transmissions. "If we want to communicate adequatelywith the West, then the equipment on both sides of the line mustbe equal."The head of ParaGraph's U.S. partner, IDG, agreed that exportbarriers are increasingly unenforceable. On a recent trip toHungary, IDG president Patrick McGovern learned from governmentofficials that returning Hungarian tourists had brought with themat least 70,000 computers of the sort that appear on CoCom'srestricted list.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW TECHNOLOGY WEEK via NewsNetApril 23, 1990CORNELL, SARNOFF SUPERCOMPUTER JVThe Cornell Theory Center and the David Sarnoff Research Centerin Princeton, N.J., have joined together to launch asupercomputing project whose goal is to solve industrialproblems.

Ideally, DOE(and its contractors) would prefer direct financial contributionsfrom foreigners, but foreign governments "would prefer toparticipate in the hardware as opposed to simply outright grantof cash," says Russ Wylie, director of external affairs at theSSC site headquarters in Dallas.U.S. industry executives are concerned that if the SSC contractsare opened up, they won't be able to compete against foreigncompanies who often are bankrolled by their own governments."Foreign companies operate under a subsidized umbrella and willbe able to underbid U.S. industry and run away with the wholeball of wax," says Carl Rosner, president of IntermagneticsGeneral Corp. of Guilderland, N.Y.The companies that are thought to have the best chances oflanding contracts to make the magnets for the SSC include GeneralDynamics, Westinghouse, Grumman and Italian-based Ansaldo.Ansaldo has hooked up with Grumman in pursuit of an SSC contract.The request for proposals for the magnet portion of the SSC areexpected to be released in the next few weeks. A total of 10,000magnets, worth an estimated $1 billion, will be used in thecollider.The exclusion of foreign firms could generate further conflictfor the United States, which recently began negotiations with theEuropean Community to conduct joint research in several areas oftechnology. In addition, closing the process to foreigners maynot bode well for U.S. officials, who have been pushing for othernations to open access to their consortia and industrialcontracts."I think there are other ways [the government] can get sufficientfunding" without having to open bidding to foreign firms, saidone industry source. "It's unlikely in the initial stages of theproject that DOE will open the floodgates.

The institutes, which receive backing frommajor computer companies, will carry out research in physics, theenvironment and computer sciences.The effort is designed to bring supercomputer-based research inTennessee to the same level as other high-tech oriented states,especially neighboring North Carolina and Alabama.Use of the Intel iPSC/860 machine instead of the more common Craynon-parallel supercomputers should also give the state a lead inparallel processing techniques, says Jack Dongarra, who isdirecting the new computer studies program.Dongarra, who left the Argonne National Laboratory last Septemberto take a joint Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee position, saysuse of the lower cost parallel processors appears to be a moreefficient way to produce supercomputing power than the Crayapproach which uses more expensive single components. The newIntel machine costs $3 million compared to at least $20 millionfor a Cray."We take the long-term view that parallel processing is not a fadbut is here to stay," says Dongarra. "We believe that what we arestarting to do here is the way supercomputing will be done in thefuture."Intel unveiled the iPSC/860 in January saying it provided high-speed processing at one-tenth the cost of industry leader Cray.Besides Oak Ridge, NASA's Ames Research Center in California hasreceived one, and some large corporations including Ford MotorCo. and Prudential-Bache Co. have placed orders.The new Oak Ridge machine, delivered in January, has 128processors or separate nodes arranged to work together. Workingat full capacity, using a "hypercube" networking principle, itcan perform 5.2-billion operations per second (5.2 gigaflops).It replaces an Intel-PSC/2 machine which has 64 processors and isnot classified as a supercomputer. The Oak Ridge lab "traded in"the older computer when it bought the new one, but Intel hasdecided to donate the older machine, worth about $500,000, backto the University of Tennessee.Thus, says Dongarra, the new Computational Sciences Institutewill be able to use the smaller machine to do preparatoryresearch for projects involving the larger supercomputer. OakRidge itself has had a parallel processing research program since1984 based on the smaller machine.The new institute, with a start-up budget of $500,000, willconcentrate on developing new algorithms for parallel processing.It also will develop graphics applications for use with parallelprocessors.At the same time, it will work with the other joint institutes totackle several "grand challenges," including world climatemodelling andd superconductivity theory, says Dongarra. In thesecases, the computer group will lend special expertise to theother research groups when they get stuck on problems.The Computational Sciences Institute has recently held talks withboth IBM and Digital Corp. which could lead to corporate fundingfor some of the research.The Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee project that is farthestalong is the Institute for Heavy Ion Research, created in 1988.This group has focused on the behavior of atomic nuclei understress using supercomputer techniques.As a side effect of the heavy ion research, the institute hasproposed a new gamma-ray detection device, the "gammasphere," andhas been selected by DOE as the preferred site for building the$16-million machine.A second joint physics research unit, the Institute for High-Energy Research, is being started by Oak Ridge and the Universityof Tennessee. This institute will focus on building detectorequipment for the Superconducting Super Collider and developingSSC experiments.Oak Ridge officials have recently started efforts to bring workon the proposed L-Star SSC detector to the lab using the newinstitute as a means of attraction.Another joint institute, still in the planning stages, wouldperform research in both the energy and environment fields,complementing work on greenhouse effect problems underway at OakRidge. The supercomputer would be used particularly foratmospheric modeling.University of Tennessee officials say that the two Intel machinesgive them direct access to a level of supercomputer power that israre for most universities. They hope this will give theirresearchers an advantage in winning research funding.At the same time, the new computational sciences institute islooking forward to the purchase of an improved supercomputer with1,024 parallel processors and a capacity of one-quadrillionoperations per second (1 teraflop). The $15-million unit will beavailable in two to three years.According to Dongarra, securing a one-teraflop machine would putthe institute in a world leadership position for parallelcomputing and attract additional research work from severalindustrial and government sources.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW TECHNOLOGY WEEK via NewsNetApril 23, 1990FLORIDA CENTER COOLS WITH SOLARResearchers at the Florida Solar Energy Center have developed asystem capable of cooling and dehumidifying interior air whileconsuming less energy than traditional air conditioners.

It would certainly be welcomed byour military allies in Britain and the United States.It would also be seen as a clear promotion for Dr McIntosh- from running CSIRO and answering to a junior Minister(Mr Peter McGauran) to supervising a $10 billion Defenceoperation which has a Minister (Mr Ian McLachlan) insidethe Howard Cabinet.The sources said Dr McIntosh, whose start at CSIROcoincidentally occurred as the Coalition Government tookoffice, had been disappointed with the comparativelyjunior status given to science by the new administration.His feelings had not been dispelled by the Federal Budget'sbogus 'increase' in CSIRO funding (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9),they said.Dr McIntosh was recently announced as the head of aspecial committee appointed to conduct a thorough reviewof the Defence Department. It is expected that this rolewill be used as the lever to subsequently appoint him ashead of the Defence Department, thereby utilising thespecific knowledge he would have gained through theinquiry to significantly improve its vast and complexadministration.(The review coincides with separate plans to revamp theoperational capabilities of the Army, including the transferof 1000 non-combat personnel to combat units).He is expected to officially remain as chief of the CSIRO atleast until the Defence inquiry is completed. (The currenttarget date for the review report - and an implementationplan - is March 10 next year).The Government is placing great store in the results of theinquiry, having indicated it wants to find annual efficiencysavings worth around $500 million from the Defenceoperating budget. Ironically, the Government hadannounced at the time of the Federal Budget that Defencewas the only portfolio which would not face some level offunding cuts.Mr McLachlan said the review was intended to "examinespecific management activities in Defence with a view toeliminating needless duplication, making appropriate useof commercialisation options, and reflect, whereappropriate, modern business practices".He said about $5 billion of the Department's annual budgetwas spent on areas other than designated combat forcesand related equipment. The emphasis of the review wouldbe "efficiency gains" in these areas, ranging from logisticalsupport "down to postage stamps and stationery".The review committee will include: Vice Admiral RobertWalls, Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force; DrRichard Brabin Smith, Chief Defence Scientist; Mr IanBurgess, Chairman of AMP; Mr John Stone, formerSecretary of the Treasury; and Mr Andrew Michaelmore,Executive General Manager, Business Development,Planning and Technology, of Western Mining Corporation.Dr McIntosh, 53, graduated in science (honours) from theANU and later obtained a PhD in physics there. Hisworking career started with the Weapons ResearchEstablishment, at Salisbury, South Australia. After servingtwo years' national service (having attained the rank ofMajor) he became a lecturer in mathematics and computerscience at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology(RMIT).He joined the Defence Department in 1974 and after aseries of promotions through the Australian Public Servicebecame Chief of Capital Procurement in the DefenceDepartment in 1988, then Secretary of the Department ofIndustry, Technology and Commerce in 1990.During 1991 he became the UK's Chief of DefenceProcurement, responsible for spending $20 billion a year,and played a major part in introducing the latest Tridentmissiles to Britain's armed services. His work there washighly praised and led to a knighthood, personallybestowed earlier this year by the Queen. (He uses the titleonly in Britain). The US Government also gave him itshighest possible civilian defence honour for foreigners, theMedal for Distinguished Public Service, (Scitech, Vol 16, No7) for his work in coordinating and strengthening thedefence efforts of Britain and America.Dr McIntosh returned to Australia to takeup hisappointment as Chief Executive of the CSIRO. A Fellow ofthe Royal Aeronautical Society, UK, his list of achievementsincludes numerous prizes in fields including military artsand accountancy.Clearly, his background indicates his level of professionalinterest in all areas of Defence and his level ofachievement in Australia and overseas is such that he iseminently qualified for the post of Secretary of theDefence Department.It is understood that the Government has not yetconsidered his replacement at CSIRO.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: SENATE QUESTIONS ON SCITECH STORYfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Last month's Scitech front page story (Natural HeritageTrust a fraud) led to questions being asked of theGovernment in the Senate.The Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, SenatorMeg Lees, sought responses to a number of matters raisedin Scitech from the Leader of the Government, SenatorRobert Hill (see next story for full transcript).These included statements from Scitech's source - a seniorCoalition advisor - that the trust is "a cynical politicalinvention and a blackmail device" and that it "is a giganticand disgusting sham".Senator Lees also raised the comments of the source thatthe Trust concept had been "a blatant blackmail devicecreated by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, MrAndrew Robb; that the plan had been imposed uponSenator Rod Kemp (the former shadow Minister forEnvironment); and is now being imposed upon you(Senator Hill)"Other questions related to the claim by our source that"senior Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doorsabout the policy" and that "the deceit had sickened thisparticular advisor and a number of other Coalition stafferswho are genuinely concerned about the national environmentfor the sake of their children and for the nation'slong-term future".Senator Hill made no attempt to answer any of the specificallegations, not even the suggestion that he had been`saddled' with the Trust policy. He simply twice made briefcomments outlining the Government's usual claims aboutthe need for the partial privatisation of Telstra if moneywas to be made available to start to rectify the continent'smany serious environmental problems - land degradation,soil salinity, and rising water tables.Other Government Senators sat silent throughout thequestions and the answers. Not one attempted to rebut theallegations even by way of an interjection.Senator Lees later issued a press release, again referringto the Scitech front page article, in which she said theadvisor's admission had confirmed every criticism of theTrust concept which had come from the AustralianDemocrats.Senator Hill issued no press release on the allegations andhas apparently made no public comment on the matter.Despite the Government's public silence it started a majorinternal search for the source of our story, with a numberof people being wrongly accused by Coalition Ministers,MPs, Senators, and staffers alike.Scitech even received a call from a long-time Liberal Partyacquaintance (an advisor in a very high office) willing tovolunteer `nominees' while trying unsuccessfully to learnthe identify of the source. Again, there was absolutely noquestioning of the accuracy of the story.During the subsequent debate on the Telstra (Dilution ofPublic Ownership) Bill, some days later, Senator Lees againrepeated many of the claims published in Scitech,. Yetagain, there was no denial of the details from theGovernment.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: TRUST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10The official Hansard record (see story above) is as follows:Senator Lees: My question is to the Minister for theEnvironment. What is your reaction to the following twodirect quotes from a magazine published today? The firstone is: The linkage to the environment is just a sop,designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try toblackmail other parties and the general community intoaccepting it. The second one is: A lot of the opponents ofthe Telstra sale have long suggested the Natural HeritageTrust was a cynical political invention and a blackmaildevice. Some have also suggested it was a creation of MrRobb. They have always been correct on both counts,despite the Government's continuing denials. It is time thecommunity was told the truth - the Natural Heritage Trustis a gigantic and disgusting sham.Senator Hill: I suppose we will learn in the supplementaryquestion the source of the quote. The answer of course isthat this Government is intent on reinvesting a large sumof money in the natural capital of Australia. The time forthat is overdue. Through ignorance, in particular, we as anation have done enormous damage to our naturalenvironment. We have failed to appreciate how fragile itis. We adopted European farming practices, for example,without understanding fully how they would affect ourstreams and our soils. As a result of that, there is nowvery severe degradation, salinity, and rising water tables -a lot of major damage that is going to take a very largesum of money to remedy.The Government, of course, needs to obtain that sum ofmoney. There are only two real sources. For the formerGovernment, it would have been to borrow more. Theyborrowed literally billions more than they raised. I guessyou borrow or you tax more, or you sell an asset andreinvest part of the capital proceeds of that asset in thisparticular task. That is what we have chosen to do - a verylegitimate policy decision to sell one-third of Telstra, atelecommunications company, and to reinvest $1 billion ofthe proceeds of that sale in our natural environment. Ipersonally do not see any sham in that. It seems to me tobe a sound policy, sensibly based and something that is -certainly, the need to remedy, the need to reinvest thecapital - strongly supported by the majority ofAustralians.What is interesting is that, as the debate develops, eventhe funding source of it is becoming supported by many,many more Australians. I hope that in the next few weeksthe Senate will see fit to support the Government on itspiece of legislation to provide that capital fund, and thatwe can then go about doing something really worthwhilefor the natural environment that previous Governmentshave not been prepared or able to do.Senator Lees: I thank the Minister for his answer, butwhat we are looking for is a decisive commitment. If I canjust advise you that the magazine I quoted from is Scitechmagazine, published today, and the quote has actuallycome from a senior Coalition advisor.What is your reaction to his revelations - again, I amusing his words - that the Telstra link is a gigantic anddisgusting sham; that it's a blatant blackmail devicecreated by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party,Andrew Robb; that the plan was imposed upon Rod Kempand now is being imposed on you; that senior CoalitionMPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy;and that the deceit had sickened this particular advisorand a number of other Coalition staffers who aregenuinely concerned about the national environment forthe sake of their children and the nation's long-termfuture? This is really a question about the seriousness ofthis Government's failure to do something about theproblem.Senator Hill: The Honourable Senator gives me one moreminute to urge upon her to take an action that will reallybenefit the Australian environment and therefore accordwith the wishes of the Australian people; that is, supportthe sale of one-third of Telstra and help set-up this $1billion fund to reinvest in the natural capital of Australia.Yes, Senator, we will continue to support the environmentthrough recurrent expenditure, but what is now needed ismore - what is now needed is the reinvestment of a verylarge capital sum. If you work together with us, if we putthat $1 billion in place, we earn income on that $1 billion,and we add that to our normal recurrent expenditure, wecould provide an annual appropriation over the next fiveyears of very substantial sums of money that could makea difference to vegetation, to streams and waterways, tothe national reserve system, to coasts and seas, and thatwould be something very worthwhile for you to do.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: A MESSAGE FROM THE PUBLISHERfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Thank you to all our subscribers who responded to thesurvey published in our August edition.

And we are pursuing, throughinternational organisations, the strengthening of a world-wide intellectual property regime", Mr Fischer said."Science and technology are integral to discussions aboutimproving economic performance and strengtheningeconomic cooperation. One of this century's major lessonsis that the economic performance of a nation cannot beisolated from its performance in science and technology, orits investment in R&D. The fact is that science andtechnology are vitally important to good economicperformance."Since the turn of the century, per capita incomes in theOECD nations have increased sixfold in real terms. Most ofthis increase comes as a result of increased productivityand this, in turn, is usually generated by increases inknowledge and technical advancements. And, of course,increased knowledge and technical advancements aredriven by developments in science, technology andengineering - the link is clear and well understood", hesaid.Mr Fischer said the Coalition recognised the importance ofinternational transfers of knowledge and technology to thecompetitiveness of local industry. This was essentialbecause the majority of the world's breakthroughs in R&Doccurred in only five countries - the US, the UK, Japan,Germany and France. Smaller countries, includingAustralia, made valuable contributions to scientificknowledge, often in specialised fields. Australia hadspecialised advantages in several areas - natural resourcescience, agricultural technology, geoscience, and ecology."The Coalition Government fully understands that science,technology and engineering are central to advances inproductivity and new product development. Science andtechnology underpins Australia's economic future in anincreasingly competitive world."The Government is committed to making the most. ofAustralia's undoubted excellence in key areas of science,technology and engineering R&D. We are also committed toencouraging free and fair international access to scientificand technological developments. Australia's reputation asan innovator is well deserved - and it is due to the effortsof those here, and all your colleagues, that we can beproud to call Australia a clever country", the Deputy PMsaid.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: MCGAURAN RUNS AWARENESS PROGRAMfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10The Federal Government's $2 million Science andTechnology Awareness Program appears to have a brightfuture, at least in the short-term.This follows the decision of the Minister for Science andTechnology, Mr Peter McGauran, to take effective personalcontrol of the scheme. Informed sources in Canberrasuggest there are two elements to that decision: it willhelp to promote community awareness of the benefits ofscience and technology expenditure and it is a good wayfor the Minister to raise his current level of mediaexposure.Meanwhile, officials responsible for the day to dayadministration of the scheme have called for applicationsfor grants in 1997. They said: "We are looking for fresh,new ideas to raise the profile of science, engineering andtechnology, to change the way Australians thinks aboutthese vital areas of endeavour - and to capture theinterest of young Australians".Information/application kits are available through theDepartment of Industry, Science and Tourism, Canberra.Tel: 06 276 1714. Fax: 06 276 2002. Applications close onDecember 23.Editor's note: Mr McGauran is extremely ambitious,regarding himself as a good chance to ultimately becomeLeader of the National Party. He has quickly established areputation in relevant circles as an extremely energetic -and approachable Minister. But he is also known to besomewhat frustrated by his present junior status in theHoward Ministry.The science awareness program provides an excellentvehicle for the Minister to promote himself to thecommunity and to the media. It allows him to choose froma long list of "goods news" items (research projects andscientific breakthroughs) which are of widespread interestand which are unlikely to attract the cynical responsewhich many other political activities can engender.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: CHIEF SCIENTIST: FASTS CONCERNfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10The Coalition Government's plans to permanently changethe role of Chief Scientist to a part-time appointment (nowrumoured to be one day a week!) has raised concernswithin the science community.The Federation of Australian Scientific and TechnologicalSocieties (FASTS), which represents a total membership of40,000 across both fields, has publicly questioned themove.The President of FASTS, Dr Joe Baker, has admitted therecould be some benefits to the concept of appointing ascientist who is still actively working beside researchcolleagues in the field for much of the time. He said thiswould maintain real links with the science community andhelp to avoid the new Chief Scientist from becomingbogged-down within the structure of the bureaucracy.But there are many minuses involved in the idea, Dr Bakersaid. The most obvious was the logistical impossibility of aone-day a week Chief Scientist effectively keeping abreastof all relevant developments across "the sprawling worldof Australian science in sufficient detail to offer credibleadvice to the Government".The issue is to be discussed at the FASTS Council meetinglater this month. The Minister for Science and Technology,Mr Peter McGauran, will attend a session of the Counciland Dr Baker has indicated the Minister will be questionedon the matter.No date for an announcement of the new Chief Scientisthas yet been determined but Canberra sources believe it isimminent.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: SCIENCE FUNDING AND CSIRO 'SAFE'from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Science funding - and the existence and operations of theCSIRO - are likely to be maintained in coming years,according to the CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr MalcolmMcIntosh.He also predicted a continuation of Government-sponsoredschemes to help promote industry R&D and anevolutionary change in the existing structure ofGovernment (State and Federal) research activities.These ideas emerged when Dr McIntosh gave the Brodie-HallAddress in Perth last month.He said: "The first prediction I'll make is that Governmentsin Australia, particularly Federal Governments, but I thinkprobably also State Governments, will continue to supportscience strongly. Now you might think that's a pretty rashsort of a prediction to be making, but if you look back overthe past few years, by and large, State and FederalGovernments have given science a fairly prominent place.And in the last (Federal) Budget, when this was areforming conservative Government dedicated to massiveslashes in outlays, science was one of the few areas tosurvive relatively intact."The university system as a whole was cut, but science inuniversities was preferentially protected - not completely,but preferentially. The amount of money put through theresearch grants process for universities was increased forscience infrastructure."CSIRO was sustained at about the same level of funding -there were some interesting ups and downs (Scitech, Vol16, No 9) but it survived with about the same money andhas an opportunity to increase its funding in someinteresting constructive ways."Now all of this happened at a time when the Governmentwas taking $4 billion off in the first year and another $4billion in the second. That says that somebody in theGovernment at least felt science was worth funding and Ithink it will persist into the next century," Dr McIntoshsaid."The second thing I will predict is that the structures willchange, however slowly. State Governments are gettingout of extension services and by and large they arechanging the structures. We, among others, are findingourselves in the position of being heavily pressed formergers, take-overs, joint-ventures and other mechanismsthat would have the effect of progressively, over time,changing the research structures in Australia.He said: "There is a serious set of discussions going on inthat way with a number of the States, and I would guessthat in due course this will go for the Federal agencies aswell."The third prediction I would make is that we are by nomeans at the end of the schemes designed to encourageR&D. I think the tax schemes are dead because of therecent history regardless of whether that is a good or abad thing. I believe it will become clear that the otherschemes are not necessarily doing all the things that weredone before and it will probably take two or three roundsbefore we have schemes which by popular acclaim arelikely to generate the sorts of internationally-competitiveR&D that we need. So I suspect that is not too stable."If all of that happens - and I say that is what I believe ismost likely - then I think we are likely to have quite apositive environment for R&D in Australia," Dr McIntoshsaid."The final comment, or prediction if you like, is that CSIROwill continue in much of its present form. Now that's apretty rash prediction indeed. There are two ways thatcould be untrue. Firstly, the Government could do to CSIROwhat New Zealand did to its equivalent body (DSIR) -break it up into little pieces that mirror major activitiesand then flog them off or privatise them, or whatever."I don't see any evidence of that happening at themoment, and as long as CSIRO is actually contributingthrough large multi-disciplinary sorts of activities, I thinkthere is a compelling case not to do so. We now have thisalmost unique institution, only the French have anythinglike it. We have this almost unique capability in the worldto tackle large problems and I think we'll keep it."The other thing that could be seriously threatening to theexistence of an organisation like CSIRO is not so much thatwe would break it up or change it internally, but that wewould actually starve it to death. Again, I see very littlelikelihood of that happening," he said.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: UNION'S POST-BUDGET FEARS EASINGfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Assurances from the Howard Government and CSIROsenior management have partly allayed fears within theCSIRO staff union that widespread sackings and asset saleswould follow this year's Budget allocations.The Secretary of the CSIRO Division of the CommunityPublic Sector Union, Mr Peter O'Donoghue, told Scitech hewas "never 100 percent certain" that CSIRO would managethe loan of $60 million in a way that would not adverselyimpact of its staff. Now he feels less concerned about theimmediate future of his members than he did at the timeof the Budget announcement.He had been pessimistic about the likely impact of theBudget because of the Government's announcement that itwas increasing funding when it was actually taking backthe 'extra' money (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9)."I was fearful that the organisation might spend the so-called extra money without making adequate provision forrepaying it down the track. If that happened I could notsee that asset sales would recoup the money and I fearedthere would have to be widespread sackings as a result,"Mr O'Donoghue said."Since that time I have had discussions with the CSIROChief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. Following thosetalks I feel less apprehensive than before, but we alwayshave to remain wary to protect the interests of ourmembers."Apart from our concerns about the Budget arrangements,we have been anxious for our members and jobs due toproposals by the Government to considerably reduceCSIRO's cash reserves. In the meeting with Dr McIntosh hesaid discussions with the Government on this matter hadbeen positive but a final decision had not yet beenreached."The union is seeking a meeting with the Minister forScience and Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, in order toobtain assurances on this."

(There are sometheories that outbreaks of the virus in isolated ruraldistricts in NSW were the result of anxious farmerstrading in the carcasses of diseased rabbits to overcomedelays in the official approval for its release).Meanwhile, the Minister for Primary Industries andEnergy, Mr John Anderson, has officially approved therelease of the disease at 280 locations throughoutAustralia (NSW, 50 sites; Queensland, 50; South Australia,50; Victoria, 50; WA, 40; NT, 30; ACT, 5; and Tasmania, 5).Officials in Tasmania have refused to participate in theprogram - at this stage - pending the results of furthertesting on its wildlife species because of fears the viruscould produce unexpected results.Farmers and wildlife officers working in regions where thevirus has now been established for up to 12 months havereported a staggering reduction in rabbit numbers and therelatively fast re-establishment of many native shrubs,trees, and grasses - some of which had not been commonlyseen for many years.The release program is seen as a major boost to thenational environment by cutting rabbit numbers, therebyreducing erosion and related problems caused by over-grazing and the spread of underground warrens. Similarly,native animals will face less competition for food andshelter, and farmers will have more grazing capacity fortheir livestock.It has been officially estimated that direct environmentaldamage and lost farm production due to rabbits (pre-virus)totals in excess of $650 million a year.Opinions are divided about the effects of the anti-rabbitscheme on populations of feral animals, such as foxes andcats. Some experts feel their numbers may be reduced bythe reduction in rabbits as a food source but othersbelieve this will lead to an increase in feral animalshunting small native species.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: BOSS OF FORMER EPA QUITSfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10The Executive Director of the former EnvironmentProtection Agency (EPA), Mr Barry Carbon, has decided toretire from the Australian Public Service.This news has emerged in the midst of sweeping HowardGovernment changes to the structure of Federal agenciesresponsible for environmental and heritage issues (Scitech,Vol 16, No 10).

Many firms expressed concern thatthe reduced concession, combined with a significantincrease in related compliance costs, would adverselyaffect the economics of undertaking the work in Australia.Some would seek to take advantage of the more-generousrange of concessions available in countries such asSingapore and Malaysia, while others would simply seekto import technology already developed overseas.The studies were undertaken by Price WaterhouseTechnology, through the Australian Industry ResearchGroup, and by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.The Price Waterhouse survey was sent to 250 strategicallyselected companies which were likely to be affected bythe range of Budget changes to the R&D concessions. Thesecovered such industry sectors as mining and resources,high technology, telecommunications, building, food,chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. Responseswere received from a number of leading Australiancompanies as well as many SMEs.The executive summary of the survey found:* Two-thirds of respondents said the (former) concessionhad been a major factor in their investment in R&D.* Following the changes (lower benefit, higher compliancecosts) more than half would reduce their R&D effort by 20percent or more, or switch to offshore R&D, orsubcontracting.* More than 65 percent of respondents say they will needto change or improve their systems to take advantage ofthe new concessions within the new six-month lodgementdeadline.* Overall, the cost of compliance as a percentage of theavailable tax benefits, is expected to rise by 114 percent.* At the same time the level of R&D benefits will fall by anaverage of 45 percent.* Almost half of the respondents had serious concernsabout the level of service provided by AusIndustry.* The results suggest that R&D in Australia may again"decline to the inadequate levels of the early 1980s,indicating a clear need for a reconsideration ofGovernment policy in this area".The second study involved 125 responses to surveys sentby Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to 395 large to mediumcompanies across Australia.It found:* 40 percent of respondents believed the concessionchanges would have a negative impact on their future R&Dactivities.* 56.8 percent of companies currently claiming theconcessions would think again concerning future R&Dbecause of the reduced concessions.* 24 percent of respondents said they would now seriouslyconsider moving their R&D offshore to locations such asSingapore and Malaysia. (It described this as "the mostconcerning implication of the survey" because only 46.4percent of respondents had been aware of the R&Dconcession schemes in Malaysia and Singapore. Thenumber of companies aware of the offshore possibilitieswas steadily increasing as a result of the controversysurrounding the Budget changes and this appeared likelyto ultimately increase the number of Australian companieswhich would seek to relocate their R&D efforts overseas).* 34.1 percent of companies which had claimed local R&Dbenefits over the past five years would now considermoving those operations offshore.* 29 percent of respondents said they would continue toundertake local R&D but would no longer find itworthwhile to claim the reduced concessions because ofthe effects of the higher compliance costs and the reducedbenefits available.The survey states: "There is no question that reducing theconcessional rate of the R&D concession to 125 percent willhave an immeasurably detrimental impact upon theamount of R&D being carried out by Australian companies.It is certain that the reduction in the amount of R&Dconducted in Australia could lead both to an increase inunemployment and a decrease in taxation revenuecollected by the Government, Further, the reduction willaffect both the amount of the Government's taxationrevenue and the Australian economy on many otherlevels."The most obvious and detrimental of these will be thesteady movement of corporate R&D operations offshore,particularly in high technology growth industries. It willinhibit growth in Australian business and render the'clever country' significantly less progressive andtechnologically second-rate. Further, the reduction in theconcessional rate will encourage more companies topurchase technology from foreign countries, sending moreand more potentially taxable Australian dollars and capitaloffshore. The effects of this sort of flow will have seriousand potentially irreversible consequences for theAustralian economy."The reduction in the concession rate is actively dissuadingAustralian companies from undertaking R&D activities. Indoing so the Government is sending a clear message tocompanies that, despite its rhetoric, the Government is notwilling to properly support R&D activities conducted inthis country. The proposed 125 percent R&D taxconcession cannot compete with other OECD countriesdespite the Budget's claims to the contrary. This simplefact will ensure irreversible damage to Australia's futurewhilst assisting our neighbour countries in their economicand technological growth".[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: CSIRO CHIEF ENDORSES CUTSfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10The general thrust of the Howard Government's cuts toR&D tax concessions have been supported by the CSIROChief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. This emergedduring a major speech in Perth in which he expressedconfidence in the future funding of science and the CSIRO.Dr McIntosh said some Budget measures (such as theabolition of R&D syndication) had been necessary becauseof their very high cost to overall revenue.He said: "It's a fascinating reflection that when theGovernment abolished the syndication R&D tax schemeand lowered the level of assistance through the ordinarytax scheme from 150 percent to 125 percent, one of thefundamental issues was whether 125 percent was enoughto retain the serious R&D in Australia."Another was whether we would now be out-competed,particularly by the Asian enthusiasts for R&D, even ofAustralian firms. The judgement was made by theGovernment that 125 percent was sufficient."The case of syndicated R&D was a more complex set ofdiscussions. The overwhelming impression, as theTreasurer so colourfully put it, was that the taxationsyndication system had been heavily rorted. Heavilyrorted is not a term that a taxation syndicate R&D userlike CSIRO would use; it's not something you would sayabout your customers, "Dr McIntosh said."But clearly it was, at the very least, an economicallyinefficient scheme - I mean that in the sense that theamount of tax revenue forgone to generate a given amountof R&D was very high. There is no doubt the taxsyndication scheme did generate extra R&D (CSIRO was apositive beneficiary of that), but it was also true that itcost an awful lot of forgone revenue."My own memory is that when the scheme was firstintroduced I met a senior businessman in Australia at thetime and I said the scheme would lead to a major increasein R&D in companies. He replied that there would actuallybe a major increase in accounting activities to redefine alloperations that could possibly be deemed to be eligible toobtain the benefits which would flow from such actions -and that is what happened."There was an apparent major surge in R&D with no extraR&D being done, at least initially. Over time that changedquite significantly and we reached the point where themost difficult decision was how to change the schemewithout throwing the baby out with the bath water. Whatthe Government decided to do was create a scheme whichwas no longer tax-based but which retained most of theingredients of the syndication R&D scheme," he said.Dr McIntosh said the importance of the syndicationscheme was that it had attracted a number of majorplayers into the area of R&D, including a finance housewhich had learned that the risks in such investments(with the taxation benefits) were commensurate withthose in housing, construction or the stock market. It hadalso attracted major overseas players who could supplyenabling technology to help local firms leapfrog overexisting technology and develop worthwhile new ideas.The scheme had also involved local companies whichintended to exploit the products and processes developedunder the scheme and a local "do-er", such as CSIRO, whichwould undertake the actual R&D."It was, in many cases, the combining of those players thatwas more important than the mere fact that the R&D wasbeing subsidised in some way."What we and others are now trying to do is to convincethe Government that the new Start program needs to havethe combination of characteristics needed to attract thesame group of players, rather than providing a singlegrant which would attract the Australian player alone, butwhich would not attract the enabling technology andwhich would be most unlikely to attract the financialinstitution. We really need a mechanism out of the grant,loan, and interest rate subsidy scheme which puts all thatback together," Dr McIntosh said.He predicted that no administration would be likely toreturn to a tax-based R&D scheme "for another generation"because of the Government's complaints that thesyndication scheme had been "rorted so heavily"."Those of you who remember the Whitlam Governmentwill remember that the administration of its variousprograms poisoned the well for that sort of scheme for ageneration and I think the same would be true this time.But we do have an opportunity in the replacementschemes to get many of the same characteristics and thosein the field might like to think about how they wouldargue their design to the Government so these sorts ofschemes can survive," Dr McIntosh said.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: R&D CONFERENCE COVERAGEfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Scitech will present an extended coverage of a major R&Dconference in next month's issue.

Current levels of oil exploration arequite high even with existing incentives. And the industrywould be expected to have a vested commercial interest inmaintaining - or expanding - those programs to ensurecontinuity of supply in the years ahead.But some officials fear the industry may try to takeadvantage of the looming domestic oil drought by delayingsome programs in the hope that community and businesspressure would force the Government to open itschequebook and offer much more generous explorationincentives.According to the Canberra sources the Government is mostlikely to `hasten slowly' - working hard in the backgroundto develop a range of appropriate measures, but delayingany formal announcement or implementation until at leastthe time of the next Federal Election campaign. This is notdue for another 2-1/2 years.The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator WarwickParer, recently received a draft green paper on asustainable energy policy. The final document is expectedto be made public within a few weeks.Senator Parer said in a subsequent speech: "Of the figuresI have so far, the one that really set the red light flashingwith me was the situation with our existing oil reserves.With current production rates, and assuming there are nonew discoveries, we've got only 14 years of oil in thiscountry."We have to accept these are accurate figures, put them onthe table, throw them open to discussion, and we have towork out a policy for how we handle this over the next 20years," he said.The Minister said he believed Australia was still "under-explored", including the continental landmass itself. It wasprobably true that most of our prospective new fieldswere offshore but there was still ample scope for drylandexploration across Australia.The Deputy Director of the Australian PetroleumProduction and Exploration Association, Mr PeterCochrane, said putting a figure on existing oil reserves was"extremely difficult". He agreed that Australia was stillunder-explored. Bass Strait production was beginning towind-back as the known reserves were being depleted but"it's not a worry as long as the Australian explorationregime remains competitive - and we continue to explorethaose areas the industry believes are prospective", MrCochrane said.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: $10M WIND-POWER PLANT FOR NSWfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Australia's first grid-connected wind-powered electricitygenerating plant is to be built in NSW over the next 12months at a cost of $10 million.It will generate about five megawatts of power, estimatedto meet the normal needs of some 3500 homes.The NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister, Mr Michael Egan,said the project had resulted from five years' research ofwind patterns at the chosen site, Crookwell (nearGoulburn) in the southern tablelands region.

The problem seems to have affected mainly thesmaller institutions -the Universities of Sydney and NSWrecorded drops of around two percent.But the reduction in applications elsewhere in NSW hasgenerally been substantial. Examples include: AustralianCatholic University (30 percent), Macquarie (around 20percent), Wollongong (16 percent), Western Sydney (14percent), New England (10 to 15 percent), Charles Sturt(11 percent) Newcastle (10 percent), and Southern Cross(six to 12 percent).The ACT figures are also down substantially - ANU (17percent) and University of Canberra (14 percent).Collation of these figures has been made difficult becauseof a series of administrative problems which have besetthe Universities Admissions Centre which processesapplications for most NSW and ACT universities.Preliminary 1997 application figures from other Statesvary widely, with Queensland's institutions expected torecord (final) increases of up to eight percent. A smallerrise - around two percent across the board - seems likelyin Victoria. There is no significant change in enrolmenttrends in WA, and a very mixed result in SA (FlindersUniversity has seen a 17 percent increase but theUniversities of Adelaide and South Australia have fallenslightly).Observers have blamed the combination of Federal Budgetcuts to some areas of higher education, the big increase inHECS charges for students starting next year and beyond,the crackdown on eligibility for Austudy, and moves byuniversities to cut courses and staff numbers for the fall-off in applications. There is still no apparent explanationfor the variation in the trend among the States.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: NTEU: UNI CUTS UNNECESSARYfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10The significant cuts to jobs, facilities, and courses at mostNSW universities in 1997 are unnecessary and do notreflect the level of funding available to the institutions,according to the National Tertiary Education Union.The senior industrial officer with the NSW branch of theNTEU, Mr Chris Holley, said extensive research undertakenby the union had found there was no justification for therange and extent of the proposed cuts already announcedby the universities.He said half of the 10 institutions had actually receivedsmall increases in their Federal Government funding fornext year when compared with the 1996 figures, rangingfrom one percent to three percent. And those which hadbeen cut had only lost between 0.2 percent and 1.7percent, hardly requiring the extensive programs ofcampus closures, staff cuts, course reductions, and limitson student numbers which have been announced by someNSW universities.Mr Holley said the university administrators behind thecutbacks had apparently been using the adverse publicitysurrounding the Federal Government's new priorities inhigher education as an "excuse" to do more than wasactually needed to tighten their own budgets. Similarly,they were attempting to "blame" a long-delayed pay risefor academic staff for cuts which went well beyond thelevel necessary to cover that cost.The various cuts had also been determined without anyapparent regard for the potential additional income whichwas now available to universities by admitting full fee-paying local students, a source of revenue previouslydenied to them by earlier Governments, he said.According to the NTEU study, the five NSW universities tosuffer cuts in 1997 are: Sydney (Allocation $306.5M; down0.2 percent), NSW ($233.9M, 0.8 percent), UTS ($134.8M,0.2 percent), Macquarie ($102.7M, 0.2 percent), and NewEngland ($84.7M, 1.7 percent).Those which will have more Federal money are: WesternSydney ($177.4M, up 1.8 percent), Newcastle ($136M, 1percent), Charles Sturt ($91.3M, 1.1 percent), Wollongong($88.1M, 1 percent), and Southern Cross ($48.6M, 3percent).[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: STUDENTS: VANSTONE MUST GOfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Student organisations around Australia have called for theresignation of the Minister for Employment, Education,Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone,over her involvement in the "Wright family" saga.The Minister received front page publicity in nationalnewspapers when she gave a Senate Committee details ofthe "millionaire family" which she said had been abusingthe Austudy system by arranging their financial affairs sothey could receive benefits for their children.

It will even have far-ranging defenceapplications," Mr McGauran said."The level of involvement of the private sector, inparticular the high level of interests from foreigninvestors, is to be applauded and encouraged."ARIES-1 will be the first Australian built and launchedlow Earth orbit satellite and represents a major stepforward for the construction of high-technology systems inAustralia. The Howard Government has saved theAustralian space program from certain extinction - underthe direction of CSIRO it is now headed in a more-focussedand more-responsible direction than under Labor," hesaid.The Coalition Government had earlier announced (Scitech,Vol 16, No 9) plans to spend $2 million a year over fiveyears to design and build an Australian micro-satellitewhich would be put into orbit in 2001.A spokesman for Mr McGauran told Scitech the ARIES-1venture was quite separate from the earlierannouncement.The CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, said thebasic technology which would enable ARIES-1 to performits revolutionary range of tasks had been developed andenhanced over the past 20 years. Earlier versions hadbeen carried in aircraft but the time had come to utilisenew developments in micro-technology to build thesecapacities into a small satellite.He said: "Two things about this project are new and special- one is that we have been able to design such anadvanced piece of instrumentation and the other is thatwe are doing the project on a commercial basis. Thetraditional way of doing these things is to go toGovernment and try to nip into the taxpayers' pockets tothe tune of $100 million or so."The Government's pockets are closed at the moment forthose sorts of things, so the choice was either to abandon itor do it as a serious commercial venture. It is being doneas the latter and Australian companies are nowsufficiently mature and far-sighted as to handle the risksand to see what benefits it would bring for them to put upmoney, at least for the feasibility study."If all goes well we would then expect them to put upmoney for the production and implementation phase andAustralia will have its first satellite for 20 or 30 years -one which did little more than beep in the sky."

Credit limits can rangebetween $2000 and $100,000.A business must have been in operation for at least twoyears, and be deemed creditworthy, to qualify. Anestablishment fee is payable but, other than incurredinterest, there are no other account fees or charges.The initial maximum interest rate has been set at 14percent per annum for unsecured accounts. Securedaccounts may carry a lesser rate. The minimum monthlyrepayment requirement is 2.5 percent of the outstandingbalance, with a minimum repayment of $75.A spokesman for the bank said the new service had beendesigned to suit the needs of sole traders and small firms.He said a recent survey by the bank had found that 88percent of small business proprietors questionedpurchased goods by telephone and 41 percent said theypaid bills by credit card over the telephone."The survey results show that many people in smallbusiness use their personal credit cards for businesspurposes, partly for the sake of convenience.

(Senator Alston subsequentlylampooned calls for the suspension of new towerconstruction until the study findings were available).The project, to be undertaken by the National Health andMedical Research Council, will be funded through anincrease in radiocommunications license fees - to takeeffect this month. The Ministers said individual projectsunder the overall study would be contracted toappropriately qualified Government and non-Governmentagencies, such as CSIRO, universities, and major hospitals.Soon after the local investigation was announced USauthorities released details of a three year study by 16prominent scientists into more than 12,000 previousresearch projects into EMR around the world. (The grouphad reduced the original mass of studies down to a 'shortlist' of the 500 deemed to be most relevant to their study).It found that there was no conclusive evidence in any ofthe international research efforts to directly link EMR withany specific health risk.Even in the case of childhood leukemia, which has beenindirectly linked to residential proximity to high tensionpowerlines in a number of studies, the US experts foundno direct causal link. They said they had paid particularattention to childhood leukemia in the course of theirinvestigations into EMR research because of the numerouspast suggestions that its incidence rose sharply amongchildren whose homes were adjacent to overheadtransmission lines.But their review had found not only that there was nodirect link between the lines and leukemia but there wereseveral other "possible causes" of the incidence of thedisease among those children who lived near them - suchas the use of herbicides and insecticides to controlvegetation and insect pests along the powerline routes.The childhood leukemia issue required more specific studybecause none of the mass of studies done to date hadproduced conclusive results which could explain theconnection.The mass of EMR studies undertaken around the world is aclear reflection of the level of scientific and communityinterest and concern about the rapid spread of radiation-emitting devices. Governments, power authorities, andrelevant manufacturers and transmission agencies are inthe invidious position of facing massive pressure tointroduce more and better technology while some criticsallege this (radiation emissions) poses enormous healthhazards to every section of the community.Should researchers ever find conclusive proof of a majorEMR health hazard from the spread of modern technology,the social, economic and legal ramifications are too vastand too complex to contemplate.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: LOCAL COMPANY LEADS WORLD GIANTSfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10A small Australian company, with only 16 staff, hasdeveloped world-leading PC technology which it claimshas left competing multi-nationals at least two yearsbehind.Amlab International, based in the Sydney suburb of LaneCove, has produced a virtual instrument - a multi-usehardware and software package which can replace a widerange of scientific measuring devices across a broad rangeof activities (eg vibration, speed, temperature,respiration).The system won the inaugural Science Product InnovationAward at the recent Science 2000 exhibition.According to the company, the Amlab system, directedthrough a Windows-based PC operating system, caneffectively replace traditional measuring devices insituations ranging from training Olympic athletes totesting advanced military aircraft.

This included the direct claim that the Trustpolicy had been a "cynical political invention" of theNational Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb,and that it had been "imposed" on Senator Hill.It is traditional in Parliament for the ranks of anyGovernment to try to laugh-off any particularly difficultaccusations, with loud jeers, much shaking of heads andmock bravado. This is particularly so if they have advancewarning that trouble is looming.It was quite clear from the live television coverage on theday that the Government had no advance warning of ourstory - or the fact that it was to be raised in QuestionTime.When the matter was raised the entire Government teamin the Senate sat in stunned and squirming silence. Eventhe Minister for Education, Senator Amanda Vanstone,who regularly keeps up a running commentary throughoutQuestion Time, sat mute and stoney-faced. The Ministerfor Communications, Senator Richard Alston, initiallylooked startled by the questions, then cracked a nervoussmile and then turned and gave a very public wink (hewas centre screen at the precise moment) to some unseencolleague.Unusually for such a circumstance, the Government issuedno statement of denial or 'clarification' to try to defuse theserious charges in our story and not one word of denialhas been uttered in subsequent relevant Senate debates(Telstra {Dilution of Public Ownership} Bill/NaturalHeritage Trust Bill).Despite its public silence, the Government's ranks were inuproar behind the scenes because of a witch-hunt tryingto track-down the source of the story. Some innocentpeople were wrongly accused of having committed the'crime' of telling the public the truth about theGovernment's phoney promotion of the Trust as a meansof attempting to sell-off Telstra.Scitech has no dispute with the need for a major nationaleffort to rectify our national environmental problems.What we attack is the Government's pretence that theproposed Trust - with only $1 billion in funding over fiveyears - can substantially improve existing problems. Wealso refuse to accept that the funding of the environmentalprogram can ONLY come from the sale of Telstra.Does this mean that once Telstra has been fully sold-off(Senator Alston has already exposed that objective) thenational environment must go forever without furtherfunding?Would it not make more sense - as has already beenwidely suggested - to retain all of Telstra and allocate $1billion every year from its massive profits towards thesame national objective? This would result in five timesthe Government's planned level of expenditure whileenabling the community to retain a degree of control overthe fast-changing world of IT&T in Australia.Why not seek a range of other proposals for funding ameaningful attack on the environment problems whichSenator Hill has publicly admitted are costing the nation aminimum of $1.5 billion a year - or seven times the rate ofthe proposed Trust spending?The Government's real intention - to find some politicalmeans to try to confuse or frighten the public intoaccepting the sale of Telstra - is clearly exposed by its cutsto environment spending in the Budget.And anybody who still doubts what the Coalition is up toshould consider its flat refusal to consider any othermeans of funding national environmental rectification.They might also look at its overall record rather than itsclaims of environmental concern.The Coalition's gross deception over the Natural HeritageTrust is a disgrace, as confirmed by the shameful andashamed silence of its Senators when our story was raisedin the Parliament.[Sydney]Copyright 1996 SciTech NewsletterBack to Headline List CopyrightSCITECH NEWSLETTER via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: SCITECH WELCOMES READER FEEDBACKfrom SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10Scitech is keen to encourage reader feedback about thenewsletter or the issues it raises.

This news was announced by the company management on October 22,during the official opening of this, the second Belgian mobile telephonenetwork. In the month of September alone, the company had a list of 10,000subscribers and the advertising campaign had not even got underway, saysBernard Ghillebaert, who is hoping to have 40,000 subscribers by the endof the year. Proximus was brought into service nearly two years ago. Inorder to be able to operate the network, Mobistar had to pay the Belgianauthorities a fee of FEB 9 billion (FF1.5 billion or USD300 million). Thenetwork installation costs are put at FEB 6 billion (FF one million orUSD200 million). Mobistar is one of the few foreign companies in whichFrance Telecom has a share of more than 50%. We generally get establishedwith a local partner by taking a stake in the region of 30%, said FranceTelecom's Chairman, Michel Bon, who attended Mobistar's opening ceremonyin Brussels. France Telecom's consolidated turnover in the foreign mobiletelephone sector is put at FF 700 million. The trading figures amount to1.4 billion if minority shares are taken into account. The French businessis hoping to double its sales in this sector in 1997. When Mobistar waslaunched, last August 27, its rates were 35% cheaper than Proximus's.Three days after, the Belgian operator announced a sizeable cut in ratesto be able to compete with the newcomer. France Telecom has a 57% stake inMobistar, Telinfo of Belgium 10% and a group of Belgian investors 33%.Mobistar covers 95% of the Belgian population and 58% of the Belgianterritory.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996EUTELSAT OPEN NEW HEADQUARTERS IN PARISfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The new headquarters of the European satellite telecommunicationsorganisation, EUTELSAT, was officially opened on October 22, in Paris byJean Grenier, its Managing Director. The opening ceremony was attended byFrancois Fillon, the French Minister for Postal Services,Telecommunications and Space. Ever since the organisation was created, in1977, its headquarters have comprised four floors in the TourMontparnasse. It is now moving to a brand new building (9,000 squaremeres,) built on 2,200 m2 of land (belonging to the City of Paris) on theedge of the Andre-Citroen park. Nearly 300 people of 18 differentnationalities are now employed there to help in the task of runningEUTELSAT's fleet. Come November 13 the organisation will be launching theHot Bird-2 satellite, which is set to come into service in early December.It will be positioned 13 degrees longitude east, alongside Hot Bird-1 andEUTELSAT-II-F1. Mr Grenier says TV programmes (accounting for 70% ofEUTELSAT's turnover) transmitted by the organisation's satellites maycurrently be received (by aerial or cable) by a bit more than 60 millionhouseholds in Europe (500,000 in France). Minister Fillon hailed thesuccess of EUTELSAT, which is now handling more than 160 channels,including 40 digital ones. In reference to the requirement for all EUMember States to open up their telecommunications industries by January 1,1998, he said he could not but hail EUTELSAT's strategic options and itsaspiration to provide satellite coverage that far transcends the bordersof its member countries so as to be able to operate on a global scale indue course.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ITALY TO PRIVATISE STET IN FEBRUARY/MARCHfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120STET, Italy's Government-owned telecommunications group is set to beprivatised as planned in February/March 1997, European Commissioner Karelvan Miert for Competition announced on October 4, on the sidelines of acompetition and antitrust conference staged in Rome. If Italy loses theopportunity to privatise STETwithin the prescribed period, betweenFebruary and March next year, it might have to wait until the end of 1997for an other suitable period, according to the Commissioner. Brussels issaid to be awaiting a signal from the Italian Government about theprivatisation programme. The Commissioner also came out in favour of asix-month extension to the agreement between the Government-owned groupIRI (one of STET's shareholders) and the European Commission, rather thanthe one year period sought by the Italian authorities. Under the terms ofthe agreement, IRI has to cut its debt to L 4,500-5,000 billion (roughlyUSD2.9 to 3.3 billion) by the end of 1996. IRI has been unable to stick tothe undertaking owing to the hold up with the privatisation drive. TheCommissioner also spoke about the Commission decision to open an inquiryinto the funding of L 1,500 billion being earmarked for the IRI in 1997 tocompensate for the group's financing activities for the Alitalia airline.We have to examine this operation to see if state aid is involved, saidthe Commissioner.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996PHILIPS AND FLAT SCREENS ALLIANCEfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The Dutch electronics giant, Philips, is planning to join forces with theJapanese group Hosiden from Osaka (central Japan) in the flat screenssector using AMLCD liquid crystals technology. Philips has declined toreveal the amount of money being invested into this future joint venturein which both groups will have an equal stake. The cooperation will alsoinvolve technoloogical exchange contracts and agreements for the sales ofgoods using the AMLCD technology. Philips sees the cooperation with theJapanese group as an opportunity to take advantage of Hosiden's leadingposition in this field and to allow the Dutch group easier access to theJapanese equipment industry. Philips has a flat screens technologyfacility in Eindhoven, in the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dutchgroup is unable to say yet how the deal with Hosiden will affect the 580jobs at the Eindhoven plant. Worth USD4.6 billion in 1995, the AMLCD flatscreens market is set to almost triple by the year 2001, according toPhilips.

Total after tax turnover rose by 3.74% during thesame period, to 378.458 million FF, compared to 364.819 in 1995. For 1996,consolidated turnover is expected to increase by about 10% due to a new60/40 distribution of turnover between Paris and the other French regions,where Unilog has expanded. The group undertook two operations involvingexternal expansion: the takeover of two agencies of the Easys Informatiquecompany (part of the Sinorg group) focusing on the industrial and bankingsectors (turnover of 20 million FF) and seven computer engineeringagencies of Alcatel TITN Answare (with 138 million FF in turnover).

Less than ten days after Deutsche Telekom promiseda new lower rate to take effect on November 4, Mannesmann Mobilfunkcounterattacked, indicating that it would establish two new rates thatwould be lower than its current rates, but only to customers whosubscribed for at least 24 months. The basic subscription (D2Fun 24) costs24.95 DM, compared to 29 DM for Deutsche Telekom's Telly D1 Eco service.The old version of D2 Fun 24 cost 49.90 DM. The cost of a new subscriptionfor private customers is "equivalent to that of a subscription toconventional non mobile services", Mannesmann Mobilfunk emphasised. Forcommercial customers (whose service is known as D2 Classic 24), the priceper minute for calls between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. will fall below thepsychological threshold of one DM to 0.99 DM, from the current 1.29 DM,the group's statement said. Service on the D1 network costs 1,14 DM perminute between these times. Mannesmann is also more flexible concerningeligibility for the new low rates than Deutsche Telekom, which requiredthe subscriber to have been signed up for at least a year."Mannesmann Mobilfunk will propose the lower rates to its customers afterthey have subscribed for three months", said the statement. There will bea lump sum charge of 99 or 199 DM. Customers using D2 for more than twoyears may switch at no cost. Mannesmann Mobilfunk is controlled by theMannesmann industrial group (65,2%) and AirTouch of the United States.With more than 2.2 million subscribers in October, D2 leads the Germanmarket, ahead of D1 (with two million customers). Germany has two othermobile telephone networks, C Tel from Deutsche Telekom, a pioneeringnetwork now losing momentum due to outdated analogue technology and EPlus, which is growing slowly because it does not yet serve all ofGermany. A fourth network is scheduled to begin operating in May 1997. TheVIAG group (active in energy and packaging), which wants to diversify intotelecommunications, and British Telecom have both applied to operate thisnetwork. The German Government will announce its choice in early February1997.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996LAST LAP FOR DEUTSCHE TELEKOM PRIVATISATION SCHEMEfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The biggest privatisation drive in Germany's history entered its finalphase, on October 4, with the notification that 20% of the shares in thetelecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom were on offer to the public.Anxious to make a success of its stock exchange flotation, the group isplanning to pay out DM 1.5 billion in dividends in 1996 and 3 billion in1997. Although they will be on sale in November, the shares will beentitled to a payment in full for the year 1996. "This is the first time acompany entering the stock exchange has forecast the dividend for twofinancial years, according to Joachim Kroeske, the group's FinancialManager.Deutsche Telekom is planning to place on the stock market up to 500million new shares with a nominal value of DM 5. In the event ofoversubscription, there would also be an option for 75 million shares atDM 5 each. A further 30 million shares have been earmarked for employees.The share dividend should therefore amount to roughly DM 0.60 in 1996 and1.20 in 1997. The price bracket was to be announced on October 22. Thebookbuilding system of sales involves a kind of auction with a fixed rangeso as to favour the best offers. Deutsche Telekom is hoping to raiseroughly DM 15 billion with this partial privatisation, which leadsfinancial analysts to predict a price of between DM 25 and 30 per share.The publicly offered shares subscription programme, one of the world'sbiggest ever, is set to end on November 14. The price will be set onNovember 16 in the light of the demands. On the morrow, Deutsche Telekomshares will be quoted on stock exchanges in Germany as well as on WallStreet and the New York Stock Exchange. A quotation is also on the cardsin Tokyo, London, Toronto and Quebec. In spite of its importantpartnership with France Telecom, the German giant has not sought aquotation on Paris exchange.As well as attracting foreign investors, Deutsche Telekom is also keen onappealing to small savers in Germany. This will be a new departure inGermany, where there no more than 4.5 million shareholders in a countrywith 81 million inhabitants. In order to attract German investors, thegroup has persuaded the banks to ensure concessional commissions for smallsavers. A loyalty bonus is being offered in the form of one free share forevery 10 held by small shareholders who keep their securities for threeyears. All the major Germany banks are involved in the investmentconsortium After the publicly offered shares subscription, the State willstill own roughly 80% of the capital base, which it plans to sell of instages between now and 1999.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BIGGER BT INPUT IN ALLIANCE WITH VIAGfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120In its bid to make a breakthrough in the telecommunications sector, VIAG,the German energy and packaging group, is going to be able to count on astronger commitment from its UK partner, British Telecom (BT). In aninterview on October 15 with the Germany stock exchange daily, theBoersen-Zeitung, the Chairman of the VIAG Management Board, GeorgObermeier, said that under the terms of the two-sided plan, BT is going tocommit itself more to the operating side of the exercise. BT is set toplay a pivotal role with its technological expertise in telephoneswitchboards. This specialist knowledge is going to be the cornerstone ofVIAG's plan for the German telecommunications market, which is to be fullyderegulated early in 1998. VIAG is banking on of parts of the terrestrialnetwork being linked with mobile telephone frequencies so as to allow, forexample, just one telephone number to be used.VIAG has no experience at all of this sector so will be mainly in chargeof the marketing aspects of the plan. This is a new departure for ourgroup, as it has so far kept out of consumer goods activities. Marketingwill play a key role in this context, stressed Mr Obermeier. Last week thelatter has to resign himself to seeing the planned alliance with BT andthe Essen energy group, RWE, come to nought. According to the Germannewspaper, the VIAG official kept on hoping right to the very last minutethat RWE would stick with the cooperation plan, in spite of running into arough patch in the talks opened last February on the basis of a letter ofintention. Because of RWE, certain options have not been taken up,lamented Mr Obermeier. He claims that VIAG and BT would be taking stepbetween now and the New Year to determine the exact form their cooperationwould take so as to complement the activities of their joint offshoot inGermany, VIAG Interkom. A key component of the BT/VIAG strategy isobtaining a licence to run the fourth digital mobile telephone network inGermany. Mr Obermeier is convinced the Government will pick the BT/VIAGconsortium in early 1997.Mr Obermeier was one of those who predicted that the mobile telephoneindustry bid fair to take off in a big way, but he admits the golden ageis over. We will need more than trading figures to earn money, he told thenewspaper. He thinks that the three digital networks already in place arelikely to run into capacity problems, though, thus leaving plenty of spacefor his network.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ALCATEL/ALSTHOM: FF400 MILLION SHORTFALLfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120Alcatel/Alsthom logged a net loss of FF 400 million in the first half of1996. This compares with 1.2 billion in the same period last year,according to Serge Tchuruk the group's Chairman. Apparently, these resultsare perfectly in tune with the market programme, reflecting recent trendsand the still limited effects of the recovery plan embarked upon. Theimprovement in the group's situation is attributed in the main to areduction in taxes and the better results achieved by companies under theequity method. The group claims the recovery programme's even biggerimpact in the second half of the year points to a return to a balancedsituation for the whole of 1996. The group's turnover stands at FF 74.3billion, down 3.4% on first half of 1995. Orders are nonetheless on thewax in all sectors, reaching FF 81.5 billion in the first six months withparticularly strong growth in the telecommunications division.Alcatel/Alsthom says half of the FF 10 billion assets transfer programmehas been achieved and the programme is due to be finalised in the comingmonths, thus helping to make a substantial cut in the debt ratio. The aimof achieving 7 billion worth of savings across the board by 1998 is stillin view.

Thechange affects the 32.5 million telephone subscribers who have been usingeight-figure numbers since 1985. The new system has been introduced toenable the national network to cope with the veritable explosion inservices (fax, stationary and mobile telephones, for example) for which amillion new numbers will have to be created each year. The eight-figuresystem allows for 60 million different combinations but the 10-figurenumbers have the potential to create 470 million, and thus cater for theanticipated needs between now and the year 2050. In the countdown toEuro-wide deregulation in 1998, France Telecom is joining forces withAmerican Sprint and Deutsche Telekom of Germany to create Global One, anentity offering telephone services to businesses. It is hoped Global Onewill help FT fend off some of the competition from othertelecommunications giants when national barriers come tumbling down inEurope. The main rivals are expected to be the UK's BT, which has signedan agreement with the French group Cegetel, whilst the Bouyges group, anewcomer on the telephone scene, has formed a partnership with STET ofItaly.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996TELECOMMUNICATIONS: PROGRESS ON CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICYfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The member countries of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperationand Development) have recently made progress towards the establishment ofinternational guidelines for policy on cryptography, i.e., the encoding ofcomputerised data. Drafting of the text is expected to be completed by theend of the year. These guideliens could then be adopted by governments andapplied by enterprises, private citizens and law enforcement authoritiesto ensure protection of transactions, communications and electronicinformation storage.The OECD guidelines define issues that countries must address whendeveloping cryptography policy at national and international level. Tehycould play an important role in the development of the global informationinfrastructure (GII) and the global information society (GIS). Nationalpolicies must be harmonised at international level to meet the needs ofglobal technologies and applications. Discussions have focused on users'rights to choose methods of encryption, the freedom of the market todevelop these methods, interoperability, the consequences for protectionof privacy and personal information, freedom of access to encodedinformation and the reduction of obstacles to international trade.Non binding recommendationsThe OECD guidelines will take the form of non binding recommendations tothe government of its member countries. In other words, they will not beincorporated into international law and will not endorse any particularencryption system. At a recent meeting, more than 100 representatives ofOECD member countries participated in debates chaired by Norman Reaburn ofthe Australian Department of Justice. Officials from Ministries of Trade,Industry and Foreign Affairs, Commissioners responsible for dataprotection and other officials involved with safeguarding privacy attendedthe meeting, along with representatives of law enforcement and publicsafety bodies. Representatives of the private sector from many countrieswere also present. The BIAC (the OECD's Business and Industry AdvisoryCommittee) was involved with the entire process of drafting the guidelinesand experts on protection of privacy and personal data, as well asconsumers, were also asked to contribute to the discussions.Work on the guidelines began in March, when the OECD set up an ad hocgroup of experts composed of representatives of governments and OECDcountry experts. This group met in Washington in May and again in Paris inJune. Its third meeting took place on September 26 and 27 in Paris. Thegroup will continue its negotiations during the week of December 16, withthe goal of completing, by the end of the year, draft guidelines to besubmitted to the OECD Council for its approval in early 1997.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996TELECOMMUNICATIONS: FORUM ON FUTURE OF MOBILE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The functioning of pocket satellite telephones into the 21st century wasthe central topic of a Forum held in Geneva between October 21 and 23, andattended by a thousand delegates from 126 countries and 250 companyrepresentatives. Staged by the International Telecommunications Union(ITU), the Forum on "Global mobile personal communications by satellite"(GMPCS), was intended to goad both governments and industry to draw upunique and globally compatible standards for this new telecommunicationstechnology.This new technology extends not only to telephones but also to computers,faxes and all mobile terminals used to communicate. It will be mainlybased on rings of satellites in low and medium orbit. Such satellitesappear to move in relation to the earth, unlike geo-stationary satellitesin high orbit which, seen from the ground, appear motionless.Opening the Forum, ITU Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne, author of areport used as a basis for the discussions, emphasised the "historic"nature of the gathering. His report highlighted the Forum's "primary task"in "defining a set of non-binding principles" which will necessarily be acompromise. These principles will, according to Mr Tarjanne, need torespect the "sovereign right of States to regulate telecommunications inthe framework of national policies". However, they will also need to takeaccount of "demands form systems operators and suppliers of GMPCS servicesfor open, fair and competitive access to national markets, throughtransparent and non-discriminatory regulations".Meanwhile, fourteen companies representing the industries involved in thesector, have submitted a joint document to the World Trade Organisation(WTO), declaring their support for "a comprehensive global agreement onaccess to the satellite services market". These operators claim that asingle geo-stationary satellite costing several hundreds of millions ofdollars can replace five billion dollars-worth of terrestrialinfrastructure (cable, fibre optics etc.). While it would take more than acentury to extend terrestrial infrastructures across the entire globe,they claim that satellites offer a cheap and rapid means of extendingtelecommunications to isolated and poor regions.Given that each individual nation will have to approve the proposedservices, satellite operators insist "the multilateral approach of the WTOis the best alternative". They add that it is vital to "harmonise nationalfrequency allocations with those of other countries". For satellites to beused worldwide, they must be accessible on the same range of frequenciesin all the countries they serve". The joint document was signed by Comsat,Final Analysis, Globalstar, Hughes, ICO Global, Inmarsat, Iridium,Lockheed Martin, MCHI, Motorola, Orion, PanAmSat, Teledesic and TRW.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ITU DEBATE ON "CALL BACK" SERVICESfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva, has urged itsmembers to deliberate among themselves on one of the most controversialissues currently facing telecommunications: "call-back" services. Theseservices send international calls via private operators abroad, mostcommonly in the United States where prices are among the cheapest in theworld. Anxious that such services shouldn't be sold to countries wherethey are banned, the ITU Council insisted on October 11 that "countriesmust respect each another's national statutes". The ITU will re-examinerequests for a total ban on such practices in 1997.The system substantially reduces the cost of calls for subscribers, butpurloins revenue from national telephone companies. "Call back" servicesare expanding rapidly and currently represent a turnover of 500 milliondollars a year. The ITU believes this figure will top USD1.2 billion by1998. Some 25 countries have thus far banned such services, according tothe ITU. In these countries, telephone companies, which are for the mostpart monopolies, believe their interests are being harmed by thisopportunistic activity which continues oblivious to the cost burden ofmaintaining the public telephone network. In the United States, wheretariffs are particularly low, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)authorises call-back services, although American operators are prohibitedfrom offering them in countries where regulations don't mirror the USmodel.Japanese companies specialising in international telecommunicationsrecently called for call-back services to be banned on the grounds ofunfair competition.Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996TELECOMMUNICATIONS: MANOEUVRING IN EUROPE AS JANUARY 1 1998 DEADLINEAPPROACHESfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120European countries are preparing for the opening to competition of the EUtelecommunications market from January 1 1998, by gradually privatisingpublic operators, striking international alliances and deregulating mobiletelephony markets. Several countries have secured or requested extensionsto the deadline set down in Community Directives (notably Portugal andIreland), while others (Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) havealready installed almost entirely deregulated markets.In Germany, Deutsche Telekom is to float 20% of company capital on thestock market in mid-November, with the remainder sold-off in stages up to1999. The deregulation of the German market, the largest in Europe, hassharpened the appetite of the country's leading industrial groups: RWE(energy) and Veba (energy) have joined forces with the British companyCable and Wireless, while Viag (energy, packaging) has struck an alliancewith British Telecom (BT). Mannesmann has secured access to the Germanrailways' terrestrial telecommunications network. Digital mobile telephonyis being fought over by Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann MobilFunk, with athird licence due to granted at the beginning of 1997: Viag and BT havesubmitted a joint application.In France, the autumn has proven fertile, with two new telecommunicationspoles launched: the first, Cegetel, has been constituted by the Generaledes Eaux -allied with British Telecom, Mannesmann and the American companySBC-, the second unites the Bouygues group with the Italian operator STET.Bouygues and the Generale des Eaux already have a stake in thetelecommunications sector through their mobile networks which compete withFrance Telecom. The public operator is to start down the road toprivatisation in the spring, with the sale of a first 20% share of companycapital.The United Kingdom is among the group of trail blazing countries. BT wasprivatised in 1984, and the traditional fixed telephony market has beengradually deregulated since 1989. The two leading operators are BT andMercury (Cable and Wireless), although BT remains dominant with 80% of themarket, compared with 10% for its challenger. BT recently lowered pricesby 25%, complying with the recommendations of the industry regulatorOFTEL, which continues to frame prices.In Belgium, the public operator Belgacom was partially privatised inDecember, with an international consortium led by the Americans Ameritech,(along with Singapore Telecom and Tele Denmark) acquiring a 49.9% stake inthe company. Belgacom is not at present quoted on the stock market, butthis eventuality hasn't been ruled out. While Belgacom retains itsmonopoly over fixed telephony, the mobile market was opened to competitionin this summer: Belgacom Mobile now has a competitor in Mobistar, launchedby France Telecom and the Belgian company Telinfo.In the Netherlands, telecommunications have been privatised for a year inthe form of KPN, a holding in which the State has a 48% stake, theremainder being traded on the stock market. The competing privateoperators are mainly American owned. Consumers have a free choice ofoperator, but KPN currently remains the most competitive on local callsand communications with neighbouring countries.In Spain, Telefonica remains a semi-public group (20% in State hands, theremainder in public hands), with a hard core of shareholders made up ofbanks and savings banks. The conservative Government has scheduled totalprivatisation for 1997. Telefonica retains a monopoly on the fixed networkbut has lost its dominance over mobile communications with the arrival ofthe Airtel consortium, a partnership of the Americans Air Touch, Spanishsavings banks and banks, and BT with 5%. Telefonica hasn't struck anyalliances with other European groups and is focusing developmentactivities on Latin America.In Portugal, the State share in Portugal Telecom has been reduced to 51%,following two stages of privatisation. A date for the third and finalphase, covering the introduction of a strategic partner, has still to befixed. Telefonica in known to have expressed in its neighbour, whileFrance Telecom is "following the dossier".Copyright 1996 TECH EUROPEBack to Headline List CopyrightTECH EUROPE via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996CALL FOR PROPOSALS IN CONTEXT OF INFO 2000 PROGRAMMEfrom TECH EUROPE, 1 November 1996, No. 120The European Commission has renewed its call for proposals for theimplementation of one of the lines of action of the Community "INFO 2000"programme: it concerns the transfer of intellectual property rights in themultimedia sector (line 3.2). A multi-annual programme, INFO 2000 isintended to promote the development of a European multimedia contentindustry. One aspect covered by this programme is the negotiation ofintellectual property rights. The administration of these rights istraditionally organised by sector (text, sound, images, video, etc.). Thetime and effort employed in the identification and acquisition of rightsis rising sharply as the number of forms of data, and of countries inwhich right-holders reside increase. In this context, and on the eve ofthe multimedia era, efficient and cost-effective mechanisms fornegotiating multimedia rights have become indispensable.The call for proposals covers the selection of experts who will providetechnical support in this field to the European Commission services inLuxembourg. The deadline for submissions is December 2 1996.Further details on this call can be obtained before November 20 from DGXIII-E-1, fax (352)43 013 79.

That was the consensus among three top executives of thedefense/aerospace industry at last week's Global Air & Space 94International Business Forum and Exhibition, in Arlington, Va.        The executives who expressed these views were: Richard D.Brandes, senior vice president of GM Hughes Electrics; Sam Araki,executive vice president of Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.; andPeter Teets, president of the space group for Martin MariettaCorp.        Successful defense conversion on any scale requires time,patience and a federal government that understands the challengesdefense firms face as the industry continues to contract, theysaid.        "Our entry into commercial markets did not happenovernight," said Brandes. "It has taken about thirty years toestablish our position in what was unchartered territory for us."        Hughes Electronics' voyage into the commercial marketplacebegan shortly after the defense electronics firm launched itsfirst geosynchronous satellite for the U.S. government in 1963.Shortly thereafter, Hughes entered the commercial satellitebusiness, which today brings in about $2 billion each year forthe company.        At last week's defense business forum, Hughes made no secretof its interest in commercial markets with a massive tele-visualexhibit of its projects in satellite-based communications marketssuch as DirecTV, which will offer hundreds of channel options forhomeviewers.        "Some of these markets could develop into larger businesses,but there is no way to make up for the losses we continue to facein [defense-related] downsizing," said Brandes.        He added that successful conversion cannot happen within theconfines of existing defense industry structures. While manycommercial technologies may have spun out of defense-relatedapplications, Brandes says it is critically important to createnew business structures within parent firms that focus solely oncommercial markets.        Lockheed's Araki agreed with Brandes. Though Lockheed hasaggressively entered the commercial space markets of remotesensing and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology, so far ithas fallen far short of making up for its 50 percent decrease insize over the past decade.        Araki said that space/defense contractors must do a betterjob of marketing their technologies and making sure that space-based technologies get the same attention that defense spin-offshave. "The Clinton administration has not treated space with asmuch advocacy as it has other technology industries," hecontends.        "If we [as a country] do not address these issues, the spaceindustry will never again be as dominant in the globalmarketplace as it was during the Cold War."Back to Headline List CopyrightTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER WEEK via NewsNetMay 10, 1994NORTHERN TELECOM TO TRANSFER $330M WORTH OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY        Moving aggressively into a market that could reach $3billion by 1996. Northern Telecom Ltd. (NT) last week announced a$330 million agreement to provide digital wireless telephoneservices in Mexico.        According to Frank McNally, Washington, D.C.-based spokesmanfor NT, this marks the largest technology transfer ever for thecompany's wireless business.        David Twyver, president of NT's wireless systems group, saidsales from his division could shoot up to $1 billion next year asthe company takes advantage of the growing market for wirelesstelephone services in developing countries and the demand forcheaper mobile phone service in the U.S.        In just the last two months, NT has signed wirelessagreements with the countries of Uzbekistan, Columbia, andFinland. The Toronto-based telecom firm is currently negotiatingan agreement with Ionica of the United Kingdom.        With few telephone lines in many developing countries,digital wireless access technology offers an inexpensive way toget telephone service to remote areas. According to Twyver,copper lines cost around $1,200-$1,300 per subscriber and can runas high as $2,000. For wireless access service, the cost is under$1,000 per subscriber.Back to Headline List CopyrightTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER WEEK via NewsNetMay 10, 1994SUPER BATTERY?

The company is taking advantage of federal defenseconversion initiatives to supplement its own R&D investments incommercial and dual-use projects, while expanding itsinternational operations by opening up new, larger facilities inAsia.     As an example of the first part of its strategy, W-J is inthe process of negotiating the specifics on a TechnologyReinvestment Project (TRP) award valued at $11 million to developa Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) digital base stationfor the Personal Communication Services (PCS) wireless market.     The system will incorporate such advanced technologies asSMART antenna systems, high-performance digitizers and poweramplifiers.     The company teamed with ArrayComm, Inc. (Santa Clara,Calif.), and Spectrian (Mountainview, Calif.) to put up $5.5million matched by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).The team will employ dual-use technology in the hopes ofestablishing themselves in the PCS market.        To further offset declining demand in the U.S. defensesector, W-J has been actively expanding its overseas presence,particularly in Korea and Japan.  According to W-J documents, thecompany expanded office space and staff in Korea, and has plansto do the same in its Japanese subsidiary during the first halfof 1994.        This internationalization is designed to get the companycloser to the Pacific Rim's growing base of customers, saysmanager of production and information, Frank E. Emery.        Indeed, the company will market one third of itssemiconductor equipment production to foreign customers thisyear. This move, industry analysts say, will contributesignificantly to the estimated 50 percent growth that this facetof the business is expected to achieve in 1994.        Elliot H. Rogers, analyst for New York-based Cowen & Companysays this strategy is moving the company in the right direction.In 1991 and 1992 W-J experienced revenue contractions due toshrinking sales in the defense industry, but has--with $286million posted in 1993--begun to experience a sales rebound.        However, according to Emery, success in defense conversionhas not come easily. Changes in production focus and thecompany's infrastructure led to high restructuring charges and a20 percent work force reduction in 1991. Even so, the company hasstill not reached its 1990 sales high of $311 million.        Moreover, Rogers says that if W-J is to build on its currentsuccess, it will have to be aware of a growing base ofcompetitors chasing the same semiconductor equipment dollars.        According to Rogers, W-J's main competitor is NovellusSystems of San Jose, Calif. Novellus has increased its net salesfrom 1992 to 1993 by 63 percent. Current annual sales are peggedat $113.5 million. In the 1980s only 15 percent of W-J's saleswere commercial, while 85 percent were in defense. Today 40percent of sales come from non-defense business.Back to Headline List CopyrightTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER WEEK via NewsNetMay 10, 1994NAVY DUAL USE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON FIVE TECHNOLOGY AREAS        The Department of the Navy is putting the finishing toucheson defense conversion funding of its own for FY 95.

USIC, currently funded by the U.S. government through theDepartment of Energy (DoE) at $35 million, encourages cooperativeventures with Russian labs to engage nuclear scientists andengineers in non-weapons-related work. But it also aims toprovide Russian institutions with U.S. firms' knowledge ofproject management, market research and other aspects of businessdevelopment and management.        By gathering together experts from DoE laboratories,industry, and universities with some background in Ukrainianaffairs, the group hopes to provide a network of contacts tomatch potential U.S. contracts with FSU partners. While the U.S.partners will fund their own R&D and provide business training tothe labs, USIC's $35 million will fund the FSU research effort.        But "this is not just a give-away program," Deegan said."[U.S. partners] will get a marketable product that can be soldin Russia, the U.S. or both."        Another incentive for U.S. firms to do business with FSUlabs is that costs for research are far lower than those in theU.S. The projects will probably cost under $1 million each,Deegan said.        "The objective is to spread the wealth, and we can better dothat by funding 40 projects rather than 12," he said.        The program is good for both U.S. industry as well asUkraine, Nadia McConnell, president of the non-profit U.S.-Ukraine Foundation points out.        In addition to providing a "springboard" to transfermilitary work done in Ukrainian labs to industrial basedevelopment, "it allows U.S. industry to plug into DoE labs," shesaid, adding that the project will also boost the presence ofU.S. firms in Ukraine and Russia. ...Program Looking for Quick Turn Around        "We want to get technologies that can be produced andcommercialized in 16-18 months," Deegan said, adding, "We aretargeted to a range of firms," not just small or large, with arange of technology development interests.        If a U.S. firm is interested in developing a new product inconjunction with a Ukrainian institute, USIC says it can providethe firm with the appropriate contacts in Ukrainian labs. Oncethe cooperative project had been negotiated, they would sign aProject Letter Agreement.        "The only financial risk is the R&D, which the U.S. firmundertakes itself," Deegan said. The Russian partner is paidthrough cash transfers from government accounts set up by USIC.There is no funding limit on individual projects.        There are already around 300 collaborations between Russian,Ukrainian and DoE institutions that have been established overthe past three years under various programs, but this is thefirst government-industry partnership that is a for-profitenterprise, Deegan said.        Electronics, communications, and biomedics offer goodpotential for developing new products, Deegan said.        Despite the poor reputation of the health care system of theSoviet Union, there are some medical areas in which the Russiansare actually ahead of the West, he added.        Some of the more high-tech physics and engineering projectsinclude a venture to create a model to determine materialstrength, fracture and failure levels and an initiative todevelop system and application software for parallel computing.[Contact: Doris Dodge, N.M.

But some are complaining thatsince the funding is spread out over five years, the moneydoesn't seem like all that much.        The agency will spent $745 million over the next five years,matched by an equal amount from industry, to develop advancedtechnologies in critical areas such as DNA analysis and computerintegrated manufacturing.        "I think it's a good idea that NIST is focusing on specificareas," says Walt Finkelstein, president of Advanced LithographyGroup, of Columbia, Md. "This method allows companies in thoseareas to have a better competitive edge in winning funding."        However, he says that $745 million over five years does notseem like a lot of money considering that the budget for the 1994Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP) is nearly $650 million forjust one year.        The program will focus on five specific areas which wereselected based on industry suggestions, and evaluated againstfour criteria: potential benefit to the U.S., strength oftechnical ideas, evidence of strong industry commitment, and theopportunity for ATP funds to make a difference in movingtechnology forward. The five areas are:        *  Tools for DNA Diagnostics - A five-year, $145 million        program to develop compact, low cost, automated DNA analysis        technologies and equipment.        *  Information Infrastructure for Health Care - A five-year,        $185 million program to develop an information        infrastructure to enable integrated medical information        systems.        *  Manufacturing Composite Structures - A five year, $160        million program to reduce the high initial cost of using        advanced composite materials for commercial applications        such as bridges and automobiles.        *  Component-Based Software - A five-year, $150 million        program to develop technologies necessary to enable        systematically re-useable software components.        *  Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics - A        five-year, $105 million program to develop a flexible        software-based framework to boost manufacturing        productivity.        Interested companies may apply for up to $2 million overthree years. Joint ventures of two or more companies can applyfor five years worth of funding with no dollar limit. NIST willsponsor a series of public meetings on the program. The firstwill be held June 2-3, at the Holiday Inn, Gaithersburg, Md. Formore information call 1-800 ATP-FUND.        Because full proposals can get expensive, NIST suggests thatcompanies first submit abbreviated proposals for funding in theform of a white paper to allow NIST to determine if the projecthas the potential to meet the needs of the program.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-22IA087-000629-B029-46http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ss16.html 205.156.212.5 19970122043511 text/html 58680HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:33:07 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:10 GMTContent-length: 58493Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ss16.html Sample Issue Copyright BULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNet JULY 31, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES GERMANY: INTERVENES WITH BANGLADESH ON CASE OF TASLIMA NASREEN (743 words) BANGLADESH: ANTI-TASLIMA RALLIES IN DHAKA (370 words) PHILIPPINES: CATHOLIC CHURCH LAUNCHES CRUSADE AGAINST CAIRO U.N.

"Germany undertook a demarche to the Bangladesh government thatwe want to look after her case so that she can move freely in hercountry," Kinkel, who is also Vice Chancellor told a newsconference here in Delhi.   But he declined to elaborate on the statement, saying, "It isin the interest of Taslima Nasreen that we do not disclose all thatwe have decided on her behalf. I hope you understand."   Germany, which is the current president of the European Union,last week said European foreign ministers had agreed at a meetingin Brussels to instruct their ambassadors in Dhaka to urge theBangladesh government to protect the feminist writer.   "It was at my initiative that European Union ministers discussedher case at length and said she was welcome to all the 16 membercountries," Kinkel said here.   Nasreen is in hiding in Bangladesh where the authorities haveissued an arrest warrant against her under pressure from Muslimfundamentalists who want her hanged for blasphemy.   The Bangladesh government has said that Nasreen is free to goabroad, but must first submit herself to due process of law. Thewriter, who denies the charge, is accused of recommending arevision of the Koran in an interview to a Calcutta newspaper,where she had stopped over on her way back from a business trip toEurope concerning publication of her work in translation.   What she actually told the paper, she explained, was that whatneeded revision was the Sharia, the Islamic code of law, becauseof its repressive legislation on women, not the Koran itself, whichis the Holy Writ of Mohammedanism.   Kinkel, who arrived in India on July 27 on a bilateral trade andbusiness promotion visit, also discussed Kashmir, the reform of theUnited Nations system and nuclear non-proliferation with his hosts.   Germany supports India's case for a permanent seat on the U.N.Security Council as much as it seeks one for itself, he said,adding that both countries have agreed to cooperate to work forreforming the U.N. system.   "The U.N. Security Council does not reflect the situation inthe world as it is today," Kinkel said. As the biggest Europeancountry and leading world economic power, Germany had "obligationstowards the international community", he added.   On India's dispute over Kashmir with arch-adversary Pakistan,Germany has advised both New Delhi and Islamabad to find a solutionon the basis of U.N. resolutions and the two-decade-old bilateralShimla accord, he said.   The northern Indian state has been a bone of contention sincePakistan's creation in 1947. Islamabad accuses Indian securityforces of rights abuse in battling the four-year-old Kashmirinsurgency, which New Delhi says is being aided by Pakistan.   Rivalry in the subcontinent has stoked fears of a nuclearconfrontation. Though there is no clinching evidence, both Indiaand Pakistan are believed to possess the necessary expertise tobuild nuclear bombs.   Neither country has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty(NPT). India says it discriminates between the nuclear haves andhave-nots.   Foreign Minister Kinkel said India and Germany have agreed todiscuss nuclear non-proliferation, an issue "on which India hasits own point of view".   Bonn had raised the NPT during Indian Prime Minister P.V.Narasimha Rao's second official trip to Germany earlier this year.Chancellor Kohl who visited New Delhi a year ago had urged Indiato sign the NPT, but did not link this to future aid.   Germany is India's second largest donor after Japan and hasgiven more than 15 billion dm since 1958, making India the largestrecipient of official development assistance (ODA).   On July 28 Kinkel signed a financial cooperation agreement withFinance Minister Manmoham Singh that offers 460 million D-marks formainly poverty alleviation and the protection of natural resourcesand the environment.   India is a major partner in Germany's current efforts to expandeconomic contacts in Asia, the foreign minister said. Hisdelegation included 24 German business leaders.   "The intensification of economic relations is at the center ofmy visit and talks in New Delhi. We look at India as a futuremega-market and are looking for a real partnership in our economicrelations," Kinkel declared.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994BANGLADESH:  ANTI-TASLIMA RALLIES IN DHAKA   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Armed police were posted outside mosquesand in sensitive localities here in the Bangladesh capital July 29to maintain peace during two rallies after evening prayers to pressfor the hanging of feminist writer Taslima Nasreen.   Hundreds of people streamed into Dhaka from adjoining townshipsand villages for the twin rallies called separately by theopposition Jamaat-e-Dulami and the United Action Alliance of 13other groups.   Nasreen has been in hiding since June 4, trying to escape agovernment arrest warrant and a Muslim fatwa for blasphemy.   The Khaleda Zia government is under growing pressure from theWest to protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is beingdescribed as the female Salman Rushdie.   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who is visiting New Delhiis reported saying again on July 29 on behalf of the EuropeanUnion, of which Germany is the current chairman, that Dhaka hasbeen told it must ensure her safety or allow her to leave thecountry.   The Bangladesh government continues to insist that the country'slaws provide ample protection for the fugitive writer, but she mustfirst submit herself to the due process of the law.   The government has said that Nasreen would be allowed to leavethe country after she proves her innocence in court.   The twin rallies follow a month of protests and meetings byreligious extremists to mobilize support countrywide for theircampaign to make Bangladesh an Islamic Republic, hang Nasreen forblasphemy and ban non-governmental groups that they are accusingof anti-Islamic activities.   Dhaka was relatively quiet on July 29 as Friday is the Islamicholiday, and all offices and some markets in the city were closed.   Rival calls for nationwide strikes on June 30, had led to uglyclashes between Nasreen's supporters and opponents, causing thedeath of a 14-year-old in a northern village.   Nasreen is being hounded for calling for a revision of the Koranin an interview granted to an Indian newspaper, The Statesman. Thewriter has denied the charges, saying she was misquoted.   The government wants her arrested for "maliciously outragingthe religious feelings of Muslims", a charge the religiousextremists insist must be punished with death.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994PHILIPPINES:  CATHOLIC CHURCH LAUNCHES CRUSADE AGAINST CAIRO              U.N. CONFERENCE ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENTBy Lian Nemenzo-Hernandez   MANILA, July 31 (IPS) -- The Catholic Church in the Philippineshas gone on the offensive against the government's populationpolicy in the run-up to the big U.N. conference in Cairo nextmonth, but women's groups here are determined to fight back.   Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin this week called on thepeople of Asia's only Catholic nation to join a protest rally nextmonth to protest the government's plans to reduce population growthrate with artificial contraceptives and legalized abortion.   "We want to make known to the president and his cabinet ourindignation and outrage at the abuses being allowed by governmentagainst the family and our children," Sin said.   He said children are being bombarded with reading materials andfilms containing "pornographic, perverse and poisonous sexualpropaganda" as part of their education, and are being conditionedto adopt a "contraceptive mentality".   "The government's population program brainwashes children toaccept as normal, attractive and even glamorous certain unnatural,abnormal and perverse sexual relationships and behavior such ashomosexuality, lesbianism, incest, sodomy, oral sex, contraception,sterilization and abortion," Sin added.   Education and health officials dismissed the Cardinal'soutburst, saying he was engaging in a "baseless debate".   It was the Church's strongest criticism yet of Manila'spopulation policy, and appears to be carefully coordinated with theVatican's broadsides against some provisions in the Cairodocuments. Last month, the Vatican reportedly sent a faxed protestto the Philippine government criticizing its support for abortion.   Sin attacked the Philippine stance at the InternationalConference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo inSeptember: "Global forces, backed by the wealth of powerfulnations, are out to destroy the family by first destroying ourchildren."   The government of Fidel Ramos, the country's first Protestantpresident, is promoting both natural and artificial methods ofbirth control to help bring down an annual 2.5 percent birth rate.   Anti-abortion groups say the Philippine delegation to Cairo, ledby Health Secretary Juan Flavier, is planning to support a U.S.-backed proposal for acceptance of abortion as a birth controlmethod.   But health officials say none of the government's programsadvocate abortion.   "We have to be clear on this," said Health Under-Secretary JaimeGalvez Tan. "We provide and teach natural and artificial methods.But we leave the decision up to the woman herself, her reproductiverights and her choices."   Member of the Philippine delegate to Cairo, Marilen Danguilanagrees: "The accusation is unfounded. We rejected abortion as ameans of contraception. In fact, we have been arguing with the U.S.delegation not to be so fixated on abortion. The issue is bigger."   Manila Vice Mayor Joselito Atienza, who heads the organisationPro-Life Philippines, said the government should "reject the draft(ICPD) resolution and the way of life being imposed on us byforeign nations". He said the 83-page document contains provisionsthat are "contrary to Filipino culture, tradition and religion".   Women activists say such statements reflect the "very narrow"thinking that has placed women in a subordinate position insociety.   "The Church's thinking with regard to women's role continues torelegate them to the Middle Ages and denies women the right to makedecisions for themselves," says Ana Maria Nemenzo, nationalcoordinator of WomanHealth Philippines, a non-governmental group.   "The Catholic Church sees 'abortion' as lurking behind everyphrase and provision in the draft ICPD document," she says.   The Church is suspicious of terms like "safe motherhood",fearing it could be used to smuggle in the concept of abortion. Iteven opposes the World Health Organisation's (WHO) definition of"reproductive health".   "But the question of population and development goes far beyondthe issue of abortion," says Nemenzo. "For us women, it touches ongender equity and women's self-determination, and the appropriatedevelopment strategy that will guarantee these."   Several non-governmental groups sponsored a forum here today todiscuss the draft ICPD document and its implications on the statusof women in the Philippines and the rest of the world.   Organisers said despite lip service given to improving statusof women in the Third World, nothing will come out of these effortsunless women's self-determination is recognized and accepted.   Antonio de los Reyes, president of the Council of the Laity ofthe Philippines, criticized the country's delegation to the Cairomeeting, which he said includes "academic disciples ofunconditional artificial birth control and at least three openadvocates of the cause for legalization of abortion".   "Not one Pro-Life proponent was included in the delegation," hecomplained.   Women's groups say the Vatican should not be allowed tointervene in U.N. proceedings. The Church only has observer statusat the United Nations and should therefore not be given undueimportance and space in official U.N. sessions, they add.   Because of persistent lobbying by the Vatican, severalprovisions in the ICPD document have been "bracketed" or identifiedas areas that still have to be debated in Cairo, includingreproductive rights, reproductive health, fertility regulation andsafe motherhood.   Women activists say they will continue to push for gender equityin all these issues in Cairo and will lobby to ensure that variouscontraceptive options remain open to women.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994ALGERIA:  FRENCH GROUPS SUPPORT INTELLECTUALS, THEATRE DIRECTORS          DOCTORS AND PROFESSORS DRIVEN OUT BY ISLAMIC FANATICISMBy Barbara Borst   PARIS, July 31 (IPS) -- With political violence in Algeriaclaiming new victims daily, French organizations offer solidarityany way they can -- aid to refugees, information campaigns, runningpressure groups and supporting democrats-in-exile.   They don't expect help from the French government, which rejectsAlgerian requests for asylum, say the groups, for fear that doingso will trigger massive immigration to France. France, they add,still takes a colonialist view of a country it held for 132 years.   Hugo Colonna of the International Support Committee for AlgerianIntellectuals said his group's goals are to disseminate accurateinformation about the complex political conflict and "to permitthose intellectuals to express themselves in France."   Theatre directors, journalists, doctors and universityprofessors have been among targets of attacks that have taken atleast 4,000 lives in Algeria since January 1992.   Violence erupted after the military took power in January 1992and cancelled the second round of elections the radical IslamicSalvation Front (FIS) were poised to win. The military banned theFIS and launched a campaign to repress fundamentalist opposition.It claims that the Islamic militants have committed most killings.   The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility formany attacks, including those on foreigners, but FIS says that thesecurity forces have slaughtered thousands of people themselves intheir bid to suppress Islamic radicalism.   "It's not just a question of combat between Islamists and thestate," Colonna said. "In the middle there is a society. It wasone of the leading countries (in the region), rich with potential.   "There was democracy from 1988 until 1992. They're stillstruggling for that." However, there are deep antagonisms betweenand within opposition movements, he noted.   Sami Boumendjel of the Committee for Dialogue in Algeria saidthat to resolve the conflict the regime must return to thedemocratic process it interrupted. "No one can impose himself byforce. We must go back to the sovereignty of the people," he said.   Boumendjel's committee seeks dialogue with all factions thatfavor democracy through commitment to elections, whatever theresults, the establishment of a constitution and the rule of law,and equal access for all men and women to work, schools and othersocial benefits.   Some charge that fundamentalists would not practice suchprinciples, and Bernard Dreano of the Forum of MediterraneanCitizens, among others, warn of fundamentalists (including formerCommunists) with a Stalinist devotion to centralized power.   But Boumendjel is convinced that there are Islamic moderates whocan be an essential part of the solution. "Our strategy is toenclose Islamists in the framework of democracy," he said.   Dreano says the group tries to create "space for reflection andsolidarity" that sets the conflict in context. Algeria is not aloneamong North African states in facing serious challenges fromIslamic fundamentalists, although its methods of combatting themdiffer from those used in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.   "France has no policy except to reinforce the power in place inAlgeria," Dreano said. "They don't support the opposition."   Mouloud Aounit of the Movement Against Racism (MRAP) said mostAlgerian refugees, now arriving in France by the hundreds, don'tseek political asylum. "They don't want to cut ties with Algeria.They just want to breathe a little," he said.   Those who do seek asylum generally run afoul of the Frenchgovernment's interpretation of the Geneva Convention to cover onlythose persecuted by the state.   Ordinary people caught between the government and Islamicmilitants generally don't qualify, he said. France focuses onAlgeria when a foreigner is killed but pays little attention to themurder of thousands of ordinary Algerians.   Souad Benani of Nanas Beurs, a French group for women of NorthAfrican ancestry, said her organisation tries to inform the Frenchpeople and aid Algerians who enter France.   "Women often demand refugee status on the basis of sexism," shesaid. "They are threatened by fundamentalism. But political refugeestatus is already very difficult to acquire. We fight case bycase."   Robert Menard, president of Reporters Without Borders (RSF),said his group pressures Algerian authorities, operates a toll-freetelephone number for information on obtaining refugee status inFrance and helps immigrants find work.   But while RSF collected substantial funds to support journalistsin the former Yugoslavia, it had less luck raising funds forAlgerian journalists, who need such things as walkie-talkies toimprove their survival chances.   Perhaps that is because "90 percent of the press is propaganda"in Algeria, Menard claimed. Still, he conceded, with 15 journalistskilled in two and a half years, "there's no other country whereit's more dangerous."Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994ALGERIA:  ARMED ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OFFERS TO END ASSASSINATION          OF FOREIGNERS IF LEADER RELEASED FROM PRISONBy Cherif Cordahi   CAIRO, July 31 (IRS) -- The killing of foreigners in Algeria islikely to continue despite an offer by Islamic radicals blamed forseveral murders to end their campaign if the authorities releasea senior militant member from prison.   Local journalists and Western diplomats in the North Africanstate say the government is unlikely to cave in to the militantdemand that it release Abdelhak Layada, a senior figure in themilitant Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a sister-organisation of the MIA, demanded Layada's release after they freedtwo Arab ambassadors they kidnapped a week earlier.   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this weekthat the GIA had changed its mind about trading the twoambassadors, Kassem Asker Djebrani of Yemen and Hill Bin SalemAssiyabi of Oman, for Layada.   "There was a lot debate within the GIA about what to do if thegovernment refused to cave in to their demands," said one diplomat."In the end they decided to release the two because they were Arabsand good Muslims."   Once released, the two ambassadors handed a message from the GIAto government officials making the offer of ending their killingof foreigners in return for Layada.   Government officials refused to comment about the militantdemand. But in a statement the authorities said that "Algeriareasserts its determination to follow up its efforts to protect itshosts and visitors in accordance with the noble principles ofIslam."   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since thegovernment canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamicradicals were poised to win. The MIA is linked to the now-outlawedIslamic Salvation Front (FIS) which won most of the votes.   At least 42 foreigners have been killed since the GIA warned allforeigners to leave Algeria by December last year.   After a lull in the spring months, the number of killings hasrocketed in recent weeks. On July 6, seven Italians died whenmilitants climbed aboard their boat at night and slit their throatsas they slept.   On July 11, seven more foreigners -- four Russians, twoYugoslavs and one Romanian -- were also killed. On July 20, a localjournalist with the national news agency, the Algerian PressService (APS), was gunned down in front of his home.   One journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPSshe was very scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she saidby telephone. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA memberis a "serious development" for the military-backed government. "Itshows that the different groups are clubbing together," said one.   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the firsttime I remember one group specifically asking for the release ofa member another group." Layada, who has been in prison for almostyear, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an extraditionagreement with Algeria.   Algeria's neighbours -- Morocco and Tunisia in particular --fear the country's militant insurgency will spill over theirborders, so are helping in any way they can by cooperating closelywith the Algerian authorities.   The country has been in political turmoil since January 1992when the army intervened to prevent a victory by the FIS in thecountry's first multi-party elections.   Violence exploded across the country despite the proclamationof a state of emergency and the imposition of a curfew in the 10central districts of the country.   The unrest is fueled by the spiralling economic crisis. Caughtbetween the fall in world oil prices, a slowdown in outsideinvestments and the troubles of industry, almost 1.4 million outof Algeria's 5.3 million labour force are out of a job.   The unemployment rate has risen by 32 percent in the past threeyears. According to official statistics some 84.5 percent of theregistered jobless are aged between 16 and 29, and 68 percent ofthese have never worked. A majority have no skills.   The problem was met by a 40 percent devaluation of the dinaraccompanied by an increase in interest rates to discourageinflation in April.   In return, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promisedAlgeria a stand-by credit of one billion dollars, opening the wayfor a re-scheduling of its $26 billion foreign debt and for newcredits from other donors.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994ALGERIA:  ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT DETERMINED NOT TO MERGE          WITH OTHER MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST ORGANIZATIONS   CAIRO, July 31 (IPS) -- Indications that the Islamic radicalmovement in Algeria is in turmoil were reinforced this week bystatements by one faction resisting alliance with other groups, andreports that some armed groups are operating in support of eachother.   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) demanded thefreedom of a leader of another radical group after they releasedtwo Arab ambassadors they had kidnapped a week earlier.

But the FIS is divided intoseveral factions, some of which are ready to talk with theauthorities, some of which want to fight on.   Early in the week a leader of one of these factions deniedreports that the FIS -- the largest of the armed groups -- was tomerge with the other two Islamic groups.   "The broad-based FIS will continue to exist as the IslamicSalvation Front and will not dissolve itself into anotherorganisation for illegitimate reasons," said a faxed communique'received in Paris from FIS spokesman-in-exile Rabah Kebir.   Earlier this month a similar statement signed by FIS leaderAnouar Nasr Eddine Haddam said the FIS's armed wing was to mergewith the GIA and MIA -- under the GIA's name.   Kebir's message called on FIS "fighters in the field" to "devotethemselves to fighting and to leave larger issues to theircommanders."   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA memberis a "serious development" for the government. "It shows that thedifferent groups are clubbing together," said one.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has accused India of fanningtrouble in her home province of Sindh, of which Karachi is thecapital, has called a special meeting of her cabinet in the cityto discuss ways to end the violence.   Activists of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jaffaria were again exchangingfire with supporters of the fanatical Sunni Sipan-i- Sahaba invarious parts of Karachi, agencies report.   Karachi has been almost shut down by the gun fights, violenceand killings that broke out July 22, and has so far claimed thelives of nine people.   The violence was sparked off by a grenade attack on a coach ofSunni Muslims returning from a religious ceremony. Now it hassnowballed into a familiar pattern of revenge attacks.   Six Shi'ite worshipers were injured by unidentified gunmen asthey were leaving a mosque after morning prayers on July 24.   On the same day in another part of the city a police constablewas gunned down by masked youths, and the body of an unidentifiedman who had been shot through the head was found.   The city was only just recovering from a round of sectarianclashes between April 29 and May 5. Factional strife within thepowerful Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM) of Muslim refugees from Indiais claimed to be behind the violence.   Premier Bhutto claims the MQM has been infiltrated by Indianintelligence agents who are plotting to destabilize her governmentand the country.   Pakistani intelligence reports allege they have evidence. Secretreports of the Interior Ministry corroborate the charges.   The Bhutto government has called a cabinet meeting in Karachito discuss ways to renew contacts with the MQM in order to resolvethe ongoing crisis.   The government seems to have realized the failure of previousmeasures and now feels it must include all groups including the MQMin discussions to end the sectarian feuding in Karachi.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994BRITAIN:  HINDUS FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR TEMPLE FESTIVAL DAYSBy Susan Litherland   LONDON, July 31 (IPS) -- If ever an arranged marriage facedproblems it is the one innocently orchestrated by a former rockstar between a popular British Hindu sect and residents of aclassic leafy English village.   Letchmore Heath in Hertfordshire, home to wealthy Londoncommuters, nestles in picturesque fashion around a pub on thegreen, a duck pond and blacksmith. In its midst stands a holy Hindushrine visited some six days a year by thousands of worshippers.   The problem, according to the local Hertsmere Council's managingdirector Philip Copland, is that the Hindus only have permissionto use it as a theological college. They are contravening the law,which is made worse by the large number of devotees who visit thetemple.   Akhandadhi Das, president of the temple, argues, "Without ashrine there could be no question of training priests. We teach allaspects of the worship of Krishna which the general Hindu communityfinds fulfilling. Naturally they want to come and worship."   Twenty-one years ago Bhaktivedanta Manor, a 19th century mockTudor mansion set in 17 acres of grounds, was donated to theInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness by George Harrison,a member of The Beatles pop group.   The tussle between Krishnas and locals heated up in the mid-80swhen Hertsmere Council sought to limit the numbers of peopleattending festival days.   Before long, the numbers crept back up to about 20,000, thecouncil went to the High Court, and were told the best way tocontrol the situation was to issue an enforcement notice that wouldprevent the manor from operating as a temple.   The Krishnas appealed and were turned down. They went to theEuropean Commission in March for help but were told rights ofworship didn't necessarily overrule the planning laws of Britain.The council was deemed just and once more issued an enforcementorder.   Copland says: "These days we still get more than 12,000 peoplegathering at the temple on festival days.   "Some council members believe that despite the proposed accessroad, this is not acceptable in a village like Letchmore Heath."   To strengthen their case the Krishnas have proposed building anaccess road, at their own expense, that would take traffic awayfrom the village center.   They have already paid a deposit of 100,000 pounds ($150,000)for the option to purchase the land, and say the total cost wouldbe in the region of one million pounds ($1.5 million).   A decision on the proposal was expected last week but thecouncil failed to reach agreement and deferred it until October.   Naresh Chadha, chairman of the Temple Defence Movement, wasunsurprised at the dithering. He claims the Conservatives in thejointly-run council came with a pile of amendments determined notto allow the scheme to go ahead. "They arrived full of pre-conceptions," he points out.   Some members of the Hindu community claim it has less to do withtraffic than with racial prejudice. Sorita Bhatia, a journalist onthe London-based Asian newspaper Eastern Eye, is convincedreligious discrimination is at play.   "The offices of the racist, right-wing British National Partyare allowed to stay open despite national pressure, but our templemay have to close due to trouble stirred up by a few localvillagers," she says.   There are rows going on throughout the country over the sitingof mosques, but because Hindus are less vocal their temples don'tget public support, she adds.   Chadha claims it has more to do with snobbery. "The main issueis that property values may be affected by a lot of Hindus visitingthe village."   If the application is finally turned down the Krishnas will taketheir fight to the Department of the Environment. Theirdetermination not to be moved to a possibly less sensitive site isrooted in the manor's history.   Harrison gave the house to Srila Prabhupada, founder of thesect, who lived there periodically between 1973 and his death in1977.   "Once a Hindu temple has been established, it can never bemoved. We will defend it vigorously," warned Chadha. "We will forma housing trust and buy up every house that goes up for sale in thevillage."   It is not an idle threat. The sect is backed by the immenselywealthy Hinduja family who live in Britain. Indeed, the matter hasbeen taken as high as the Indian parliament.   Chadha has held meetings with L.K. Advani, leader of theopposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata party who has promised he willdo anything he can to help.   The Congress government has been sufficiently rattled to senda senior minister, Kamal Nath, to Britain to warn ministers thatBritish contracts could be at risk over the row.   It was reported in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that PrimeMinister John Major was sympathetic to the Krishna's case, butcould not intervene in a local government matter. That, saysChadha, hasn't changed.   A possible flashpoint could be the celebrations for Krishna'sbirthday at the end of August. A two-day affair, Copland says itwill involve "lots of noisy chanting and fireworks". He believesthe council will enforce against it.   "We have suggested to the Krishnas that they might considerholding it in a nearby country park. Devotees could come to themanor, worship before the statues, and then be bussed to the park.Their response seems to be favorable."   Whatever the outcome of the October council meeting, the rowseems set to rumble on indeterminately. The Department of theEnvironment cannot close the theological college, even if it doesprevent worshippers entering the temple.   If that happens, the villagers are likely to find devoteespracticing their religion outside the temple gates.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994SUDAN:  REBELS REJECT KHARTOUM'S UNILATERAL CEASEFIREBy Horace Awori   NAIROBI, July 31 (IPS) -- Southern Sudanese rebels have rejecteda unilateral ceasefire declared by the government that was due tocome into effect at midnight on July 30.   "The ceasefire is a sham. It has been calculated to deceive thepeople of Sudan and the international community", said Steven Wonduof the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).   He said the military government of Lt-Gen. Omar Hassan al Bashirhad launched three major offensives against the SPLA stronghold atNimule on the Uganda border in the past few days.   "As I speak now, heavy fighting is continuing. We have repulsedthree attacks which were preceded by heavy bombardments," Wonduclaimed.   He said the Sudanese government forces lost 739 troops in thebattle of Nimule when they tried to cross the Awa River to enterthe city.   Government forces had captured the adjacent towns of Pageri andAswa about three months ago, and have been pushing on to dislodgethe rebels from Nimule.   Wondu, who represents an SPLA faction led by Col. John Garang,described the ceasefire declaration, announced over state-run RadioOmdurman as "unprocedural."   He said, "President Daniel Moi (of Kenya), who is the chairmanof the (peace) talks, had appealed for a ceasefire and any responseshould have been formally presented to him and the negotiators fordiscussion."   Wondu said the SPLA had immediately given a formal response toMoi's appeal and "we are surprised that the chairman of the talkslearnt of the (government's) ceasefire through the press."   He claimed that the ceasefire only covered gunfire, leaving outaerial bombardments and troop movements. "This renders itmeaningless and insincere and we shall continue to defendourselves."   Wondu said the SPLA would only reciprocate if Khartoum acceptedan internationally monitored ceasefire within the context of thesix-nation IGADD peace initiative.   The Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Desertification(IGADD), which is brokering the ongoing peace talks between theSudanese government and the two factions of the SPLA here, groupsDjibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.   According to Wondu, the talks, which have been going on behindclosed doors center on demand for self-determination for the southand a secular arrangement for a proposed interim period that wouldprecede separate statehood for the region.   "We in the SPLA unconditionally accept these principles and willonly negotiate on their basis," said Wondu.   The SPLA has been fighting against domination of the mainlyChristian-African south by the Arab-Islamic north since 1983. Morethan a million people have been killed and another three milliondisplaced in the fighting.   Earlier mediations by Nigeria and by former U.S. President JimmyCarter failed to make any headway.   But the SPLA itself is divided. The rebel movement split intotwo groups in 1991.   Early this week the factions clashed in the Bahr-el-Ghazalregion in southern Sudan and 1,000 people were killed, accordingto a Catholic bishop in the area.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994ULSTER:  IRA'S POLITICAL WING DEFENDS REJECTION OF PEACE PLANBy Sarah O'Hara   DUBLIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Northern Irish republican leader GerryAdams this week put a positive face on the weekend rejection of aAnglo-Irish peace plan by political representatives of guerrillasfighting British rule in the disputed province.   Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein -- the political wing of theIrish Republican Army (IRA), which has waged a 25-year war againstBritish rule in Northern Ireland -- insisted that the peace processwas still alive, despite his party's rejection of the initiative.   "We have a peace process which can't be stopped," he said inreviewing the conference in Letterkenny, in the Republic ofIreland. "It may be too slow but it can't be stopped and that isa point that is missed, you see. People miss the big picture."   Sinn Fein, which represents only one in ten voters in NorthernIreland, has held center stage for most of the last eight monthssince the British and Irish prime ministers began a joint peaceinitiative with the so-called Downing Street Declaration.   The Declaration attempts to recognize the rights of both themajority Northern Irish Protestant community to remain part of theUnited Kingdom and the minority Catholic community to itsaspiration for a united Ireland.   Both Irish and British leaders hoped it would encourage the IRAto call a permanent ceasefire in return for a place at thenegotiating table alongside Irish, British and Northern Irishconstitutional parties.   But Sinn Fein again refused to either accept or reject theDeclaration, arguing instead that the British government should"join the persuaders" in trying to convince the pro-BritishProtestant majority that they could live in a united Ireland.   Meanwhile the IRA has continued its armed struggle with Britishforces, and attempted new bombing attacks against targets on theBritish mainland.   Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, was surprisingly upbeatin his response, saying this week that he could see "some positivesignals" from Sinn Fein.   He said the peace process would continue, with or without SinnFein and that his government would go on searching for agreementwith Britain on new political structures for Northern Ireland(Ulster).   In contrast, his Deputy Dick Spring, also shadow foreignminister and leader of the Irish Labour Party, described theLetterkenny conference decision as sickening. "I think we must beliving in totally different worlds if Sinn Fein sees the conferenceas a positive development," he said.   And British government Minister for Northern Ireland PatrickMayhew said the initiative for peace did not rest with Sinn Feinand that Sinn Fein were "rejecting democracy" because they couldnot achieve their aims through the ballot box.   Mayhew said the two governments were preparing a frameworkdocument, to establish new relationships between North and South,and between the Irish and British governments as well.   Of Sinn Fein, he said, "We have never waited upon them. We havenot been spending several months waiting, twiddling our thumbs, tosee what Sinn Fein were going to do. We have been pressing on, thetwo governments and the constitutional parties, with our politicalwork. We've got to go on doing that and we will."   Reynolds, who leads the populist Fianna Fail party in acoalition government with Labour, is now under pressure from Irishopposition politicians suspicious of the motivations of the IRA.   John Bruton, leader of the conservative opposition party, FineGael, said the Declaration had not progressed peace. He believedit was "ultimately futile" to expect a ceasefire from the IRA,which he described as "a classic revolutionary organisation".   "They use violence some of the time, they use artificial offersof peace at other times and they use these to break the will ofdemocratic politicians," he said.   Adams said that the peace process had been "kick-started" byhimself and the leader of the constitutional nationalist SDLP, JohnHume, "nurtured" by the Irish government,  and "helped" by"nationalist Ireland", with no assistance from the British.   "What we did yesterday was to give a considered and detailedresponse to the Downing Street Declaration. We're the only partyto give such a detailed response to the Declaration," he said.   "What we have done is to isolate positive elements (in theDeclaration) that can be built up and negative elements which wecan seek to revoke. The governments never said it was a solution,the governments said it was a step forward.   Much of the thinking on the part of the Irish government overthe last eight months has been based on the idea that Adamsrepresents a significant grouping within Sinn Fein and IRA whichwould like to see an end to the conflict.   However many "doves" in the republican movement may not beprepared to force the issue, for fear it would split the IRA andproduce a newer, more vicious group.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994TIBET:  DALAI LAMA TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FESTIVAL   OSLO, July 31 (IPS) -- Tibetan leader-in-exile and Nobel Prizewinner, the Dalai Lama, will visit the Norwegian city of Trondheimin October to address the International Student Festival inTrondheim (ISFiT).   The main theme of the festival from Oct 6-15 is Human Rights,said festival organizer Rina Sunder and ISFiT Head of Groups LarsBjoergan Schroeder. They travelled to Dharamsala, India, where theDalai Lama lives in exile, to secure his support.   The two students made a personal representation after theTibetan leader's representatives in London and Dharamsala initiallydeclined the invitation on his behalf. While in India the two alsoinvited a number of Indian government officials and human rightsactivists who will also attend the ISFiT events.   His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, to his followers the "earthlymanifestation of the Avalokiteshvara, Bodhisattva of Compassion"has spent over 35 years trying to find a non-violent response tothe armed invasion and annexation of his historic homeland.   Since the Chinese invaded in 1959, Tibet's temples have beenrazed, its natural resources plundered and its lands seized forChinese settlers and nuclear facilities. The Tibetan environmenthas been degraded and a long list of human rights violations haveseen monks and nuns persecuted and people imprisoned without trial.   "I am fighting for the maintenance of our culture and ouridentity," he told IPS in an interview this year. He says onemillion Tibetans have died since China invaded in 1949. Since thenTibet's spiritual leader has made representations world wide toraise violations of human rights by the Chinese in his country.   "Tibetans are, at best, second class citizens in their owncountry. Deprived of all basis democratic rights and freedoms, theyexist under a colonial administration in which all real power iswielded by Chinese Communist party and the army," he told IPS.

"Unsafe abortions are a major cause of death, therefore accessto safe abortion should be an integral part of reproductive healthservices," says a non-governmental organisation position paper thatwill be presented at the World Women's Conference in China nextyear.   The position paper echoes the view of the Caribbean Associationfor Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA). The paper noted that Cubaand Barbados are among the few Caribbean countries that havedecriminalized abortions. A draft bill to achieve this in Guyanais currently before the Parliament there.   CAFRA's voice is strong on the connection between reproductivehealth and women's rights.   "In the context of the upcoming International Conference onPopulation and Development Caribbean governments should be urgedto actively resist attempts to reject the new framework ofreproductive health and rights which has been negotiated by mostgovernments, in support of the advocacy of the internationalwomen's movement," the document states.   The Caribbean's population and family planning experts willsupport the CAFRA position this September at the PopulationConference to be held in Cairo, Egypt.   The Caribbean's policy position states: "Unsafe abortion is alsoone of the most neglected underlying causes of reproductive illhealth in the Caribbean and constitutes a major unrecognized socialhealth issue.   "Women, adolescents and disadvantaged population groups areparticularly vulnerable to all aspects of reproductive ill healthand satisfactory outcomes cannot be achieved without the fullinvolvement of both men and women."   The regional position, outlined in the Port of SpainDeclaration, calls for "the provision of appropriate informationand services in order to prevent unsafe abortions and to ensurehigh-quality standards for abortion-related services forindividuals and couples."   Although there are no data available on just how many illegalabortions occur in the region, research by CAFRA member NeshaHaniff shows that many women opt for the unsafe, backyardprocedure.   According to Haniff, in Guyana, where health care is very poorand where available, is costly, the rate of abortion is consideredextremely high, although no official figures exist.   Abortion costs between almost seven dollars (900 Guyanesedollars) and $15 (2,000 Guyanese dollars).   "Women interviewed before their abortions said the health systemhad failed them and this was being used as a contraceptive device.They preferred a more long-term, uncomplicated contraceptive withlow maintenance. They had difficulty accepting abortion as analternative but wanted to exert control over the pregnancy. Condomuse was intermittent," Haniff said.   Additionally because of its illegality, many women opt for folkremedies for unwanted pregnancies.   In St. Lucia, abortions are also illegal but unlike Guyana,there is not the same tacit acceptance, according to Haniff.   "The Catholic religion is very influential, advocating naturalcontraceptive methods only and has been problematic for the St.Lucia Planned parenthood Association," she said.   In 1983, the crude birth rate was 30 per thousand and St.Lucia's population was growing at the rate of two percent perannum. High unemployment, compounded by rapid population growth anda mounting dependency burden on the state led the government in1990 to establish the National Population Unit.   Arguing that reproductive rights are human rights, women'sgroups in the Dominican Republic point out that an estimated 25 to50 percent of maternal deaths in that country are a result ofillegal abortions.   They estimate that approximately 70,000 women risk their liveseach year in back street procedures. They say that 40 percent ofbirths in the last five years were unwanted and that 17 percent ofwomen in a relationship have an unsatisfied demand forcontraceptives.   Groups in Puerto Rico, where abortion is legalized, report thatsince legalization, the number of deaths associated with abortionhas declined considerably.Back to Headline List CopyrightBULLETIN OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS via NewsNetJULY 31, 1994BANGLADESH:  DHAKA QUIET DURING TWIN ANTI-NASREEN RALLIESBy Tabibul Islam   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Leaders of right-wing Islamic groupswarned at two rallies in the Bangladesh capital July 29 that thegovernment would have to face the consequences if fugitive writerTaslima Nasreen was not punished.   Several thousand people mobilized to attend the twin ralliescalled separately by the Jamaat-e-Islami and an alliance of 13other radical parties, listened patiently as their leadersthreatened to launch demonstrations against the government.   The fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islamic and the United ActionCouncil Alliance are separately campaigning for the hanging of thecontroversial writer, to make Bangladesh an Islamic republic anda ban on newspapers and organizations they call anti-Islamic.   Though the twin rallies passed off uneventfully, security stillremains tight in Dhaka, which has been disturbed by nearly dailyprotests, marches and demonstrations by opponents and supportersof the controversial feminist author.   The Alliance has given the Khaleda Zia administration seven daysto arrest Nasreen, who went into hiding on June 4 to escape anarrest warrant and a fatwa for blasphemy.   At least 100,000 people attended the Alliance rally, but themuch larger one was the rally of the Jamaat-e-Islami which was heldnear the Baitulmukarram national mosque in Dhaka.   Speakers at both the rallies described 32-year-old Nasreen asa creation of India and the Western world.   Jamaat chief Golam Azam thundered "Taslima Nasreen was anunknown writer...she was created by the Western world and India tomalign Islam," he thundered.   S.M. Suleiman of the Alliance urged the government to scrap alltreaties with India and boycott all Indian goods.   However, Golam Azam, trying to strike a more balanced note, saidhis party was keen on maintaining good relations with its giantneighbor to the west. "But India must not encourage those attackingIslam," he added.   Religious extremists have accused India of supporting Nasreen,who first raised a storm last year after the publication of herbook "Lajja" (Shame), a story of a Hindu family in Bangladeshduring the riots that swept the country in December 1992.   The head of a then little-known radical group in the Bangladeshitown of Sylhet issued a fatwa against Nasreen and a huge cashreward.   Nasreen was living under police protection in Dhaka until June3 when a warrant for her arrest was issued by a Bangladeshi courtfor her provocative interview to the Indian newspaper, TheStatesman.   The English-language daily, published from Calcutta, quotes theoutspoken writer calling for a revision of the Koran. Nasreen hassaid she was misquoted.   Almost daily strikes and protests between Nasreen's opponentsand supporters, who believe she has the right to freedom of speech,disrupted normal life in Bangladesh through June.   The Bangladesh government is under pressure from the West toprotect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being described asthe female Salman Rushdie.   Nasreen is accused of "maliciously outraging the religiousfeelings of Muslims", a charge the religious extremists insist mustbe punished with death.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-23IA087-000629-B029-86http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/ss05.html 205.156.212.5 19970122043553 text/html 72256HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:33:53 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:11 GMTContent-length: 72069Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/ss05.html Sample Issue Copyright CHURCHNEWS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet January 20, 1992 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES VERBATIM OFFICIAL NEWS AND INFORMATION RELEASES [] IN A NEW MOVE, USA PRESBYTERIANS CONVENE REGIONAL CAMPING MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES TO PROBE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF WORKING TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY (236 words) [] EIGHT USA CHURCH DENOMINATIONS OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT (595 words) [] FROM A COMMUNITY NEWSPAPER: NORTH CAROLINIANS SHARE CHRISTMAS WITH FOREIGN STUDENTS (575 words) [] LOUISVILLE, Ky.--The Rev.

[END]Back to Headline List CopyrightCHURCHNEWS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 20, 1992[] EIGHT USA CHURCH DENOMINATIONS OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT92032       STATEMENT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ANNOUNCEDPHOENIX--Eight denominational representatives including thePresbyterian Church (U.S.A.), recently signed a statement againstthe death penalty in Arizona.  Signing for the Presbyterian Churchwere the Rev. Robert V. Chapman, executive, Presbytery of the GrandCanyon, and the Rev. Gary Skinner, executive, Synod of theSouthwest.  Other denominational leaders signing were from theEpiscopal Church, Roman Catholic Church, Evangelical LutheranChurch in America, Society of Friends, United Church of Christ, theDisciples of Christ and the Unitarian-Universalist.     The statement said:"At this time, when 102 persons in Arizona are on death row and anexecution appears imminent, we affirm our unity in opposing capitalpunishment.  As Christian leaders we want to bear witness that thedeath penalty cannot be justified as a legitimate tool of society'sjustice system.  The denominations we represent in Arizona all havespoken nationally against the death penalty."Christians of good will disagree on the use of the death penaltyas a means of achieving justice in our society.  We acknowledgethese differences of opinion.  We also join with all of ourbrothers and sisters in their feelings of anger at heinous acts ofviolence and in compassion for those among us whose loved ones havebeen victims of such crimes."While there are many important sociological arguments againstcapital punishment and while empirical evidence does notdemonstrate that executing prisoners has served to reduce crime,our opposition relies principally on our faith vision of humandignity and solidarity."As Christians and, indeed, as citizens of the United States, weare proud of the mercy as well as justice which have so oftencharacterized our nation's history.  We believe that punishmentshould be primarily redemptive, reformative and restorative.Capital punishment does not lead us to these goals, either for thevictim or for the criminal.  The taking of one human life to servenotice on the lives of others is in itself violent and cruel.  Theuse of the death penalty is inconsistent with the Christian callingto honor the sanctity of all of human life.  We must work tocurtail, not to promote, violence in our society by carrying themessage of God's redeeming love in all of our public and privateinteractions."Jesus Christ, and countless historical examples, teach us that nohuman being is beyond redemption.  The institutional taking of ahuman life destroys forever the opportunity to seek reconciliationof the offender and causes all of us to share in the violent actof killing a person.  The judgment of life and death is God'salone.  When one human being places himself or herself in theposition of making that judgment by murdering another human being,it is a sin.  That sin is compounded when society responds in kind."There should be appropriate punishment for those who commitcrimes, however it is our firm conviction that to succumb to theretaliatory violence of capital punishment is abdicating ourresponsibility as Christians and as human beings."Our fervent prayer is that God's redemptive love will be betterserved in human affairs through the abolition of this cruel andinhuman form of punishment.  We pray, too, that society will findmore effective ways to serve the victims of crimes and theirfamilies, offering them assistance to recover as completely aspossible from the harm they have suffered.  May the values of mercyand compassion which have marked the best of our nation's historyovercome the spirit of vengeance epitomized in capital punishment."General Assembly News, Presbyterian Church (USA), 16Jan92.

We thought our readers would enjoy reading it.--MarjCarpenterROCK HILL, S.C.--Christmas week has been a time to rest andcelebrate the holidays for about 24 foreign students visiting theChristmas International House at Bethelwoods Christian EducationCenter.     The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)-sponsored project providesinternational students who can't get home for the holidays thechance to spend that time with others.     One of the students, Robson Gomes, 30, of Brazil also broughtalong his wife and two daughters, who are with him while he'sstudying in the United States, for the holiday experience.  He isa student at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va.     "This has been a time to rest, a time to be with family anda time to think," Gomes said, "and to meet different people."     Being at Bethelwoods and enjoying the natural beauty of thearea also has given him time to remember God, he said.     "My girls love it.  They don't want to go home" to Richmond,he said.     Gomes will speak at Hermon Presbyterian Church in Rock Hill.     "I won't preach.  I talk, sharing my experiences with God.It's not like a sermon," he said, adding that he has been at theseminary five months and expects to graduate in May 1994.     Michihiko Ogata, 23, has been a graduate student in computerscience at Ohio University since March 1990.     Relaxing in the game room at Bethelwoods after a tour of WRHI-AM radio station and before a trip to the Outlet Market Place,Ogata, a Tokyo native, talked a little about the differencesbetween Christmas in his country and here.     "We don't celebrate Christmas like this.  We don't decoratethe tree.  We don't have a big tree," he said with a smile.  "Wecan go to a restaurant or department store and see treesdecorated."     The Japanese buy small artificial trees already decorated,Ogata said.     This is his second Christmas away from his family and hemisses them.  But - and he smiled again - he misses his dog more.     Bethelwoods is one of only two Christmas International Housesin the country that are operated out of a camp, said Joel Winchipof Columbia, S.C., a student at the Presbyterian School ofChristian Education in Richmond.     The Presbyterian church helps match foreign students in otherareas with host families.     The students at Bethelwoods this year come from Japan, Taiwan,Kenya, Brazil, El Salvador and Costa Rica.  They arrived Dec. 19and return to campuses around the country the following week.     They register for the International House by paying $25 feeand list the first, second and third choices they would like tovisit, Winchip said.     Since arriving, the students have visited churches includingOakland Avenue Presbyterian in Rock Hill and First Presbyterian inLancaster.  They enjoyed a Christmas party at Tirzah Presbyterianand were entertained by the Uriel Cloggers.     The group also has visited Kings Mountain State Park andtoured the S.C. State Museum and Zoo.  On Christmas Day, they droveup to Montreat, N.C., in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Before theyleave, they will tour Brattonsville, Discovery Place and theCharlotte Observer Omnimax Theatre.     The project is supported by Providence Presbytery, with 18churches providing money and food for the students.Sophie SmithThe HeraldGeneral Assembly News, Presbyterian Church (USA), 16Jan92.

This is Betsey Kandlefor Weekender.     Many Presbyterian mission co-workers have been hindered intheir work by political coups and civil wars that have made itnecessary for some to return to the United States.  Two nationsin particular, Zaire and Haiti, have suffered profound politicalstrife which is still going on.     Tom and Noretta Clayton were forced to leave their home inHaiti last October.  Tom Clayton spoke about his adopted countryat a worship service at the Presbyterian Center in Louisvillethis week.  Here are some of his thoughts.     "This is a time filled with confusion and rumors when yourprayers for the people of Haiti are badly, badly needed.Meanwhile, Presbyterian work goes on, limited, but goes on.     "The last 200 years, has seen Haiti stripped of 80% of itsforests.  Nature continues to tear at what is left of thecountry.  Today, Haiti is a land of rocks and barren mountains,with only small pockets of lush, green, life.     "But, in a small area near the Dominican Republic border,the people have built an irrigation canal, a project calledChadev, with the help of mission funds from the PresbyterianChurch.  Now after ten years, they are reaping a harvest ofbetter and more plentiful food.  And their work continues, or atleast will when things settle down.     "In the district of Cormiers, the people have organizedthemselves and are working to reclaim a watershed area that ishome for thousands with the help of Presbyterian missionaries andmission funds.  This project is truly ecumenical - it includesthe local Episcopal and Catholic parishes, an Evangelical Schooland a small clinic run by the Catholic Little Brothers.  RodneyBabe, a Presbyterian agriculturalist, and his wife will beworking with the project when it is appropriate for them toreturn.  They left when we did in early October.  My wife, Nory,serves as administrator of the project and liaison between thePresbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti.     "Today, on the island of LaGonave, in the middle of the bay,there is a small clinic established by the local Episcopal parishunder the leadership of Pere Valdema and with the assistance ofmission funds from the Presbyterian Church.  Nory and I work veryclosely with that group.  With the help of a small group ofdedicated community health workers, trained at Hospital Ste.Croix and working with the people of the Episcopal Church locatednext to the clinic, they are working to provide bothpreventative and curative care to a population of more than10,000 people.     "In the city of Cap Haitian, there is a trade schoolteaching a variety of skills in a three year course, with anenrollment of 500.  In the country, near the city, there is anAgricultural School with demonstration lands, teaching people toteach agriculture.  Both of these schools are assisted by missionfunds from the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).     "And on the southern coast of the country, in a smallvillage called Leogane, there is the Hospital Ste. Croix.Started by missionaries and mission funds from the PresbyterianChurch in the early 1960's, it is now staffed entirely byHaitians and is held as a model of what health care in Haiti canbe.  Dr. David McNeeley, a Presbyterian missionary and Episcopalpriest is the medical director.  His wife, Dr. Marise McNeeley,also a Presbyterian missionary heads the laboratory and bloodbank.  The Drs. McNeeley are still in Haiti and although thehospital staff has been cut in half, they are still providingwhat care they can to the people of the surrounding area.  Mywife and I continue to work as consultants in pharmacy,procurement, and administration to the hospital.     "But we want you to understand that it is not just missionfunds or missionaries or even Haitians that get this work done.It is through God's Grace and your prayers that His work is done.Thank you from the people of Haiti."

Thousands of Haitians took to the sea in small boats lastOctober following the takeover of their country by the military.They risked their lives in search of freedom and security, werecaught by the U.S. Coast Guard, and would have been returned toHaiti except for a court restraining order which is now underappeal by the Justice Department.  They are confined in GuantanamoBay, Cuba, awaiting the resolution of their destiny.     As it always does, the church is reaching out to the refugeesthrough organizations such as Church World Service and Witness andthe U.S. Catholic Conference.  And it is speaking out to Congressand the Administration, urging justice for the Haitians.     Dale S. DeHaan, director of the Church World ServiceImmigration and Refugee Program, testified before a congressionalimmigration sub-committee last November.  He strongly urgedCongress not to allow the administration to return Haitian refugeesto their country by force.  He reminded them of the Immigration Actof 1990 which authorizes the Attorney General to grant TemporaryProtected Status to nationals from countries experiencing war,natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions that endangerphysical safety.  While DeHaan acknowledged that such a grant isnot always the appropriate or necessary response to refugee crises,he urged that this protection be extended to the Haitians.     The Church World Service Immigration and Refugee Program isattempting to resettle 600 of the nearly 1200  Haitians determinedby the government to have a reasonable claim for asylum in theUnited States.

Willis      NEW YORK, N.Y. (DNS) -- As Americans prepare to address thequincentary of Columbus' journey to this land, another voyage of adifferent kind is being acknowledged . . .  a journey in search ofthe spirituality of this nation and its people.      Intrigued by the seeming emergence of a cultural phenomenon,the National Council of Churches is documenting the revitalizationof American spirituality in the fourth program of the "Vision andValues" series on ABC-TV. The program, "Search for Spirituality,"will be broadcast to ABC affiliates on January 19, 1992. It willair locally at 1:30 p.m. on WRTV, Channel 6.      It has been rumored in the media that the movement ofAmericans back to church and religion may well mark the populartrend of the `90s. "Search for Spirituality" probes the questionsthat surround the suggestion. Is spirituality just another decademotif to ring out a century that was marked in the `60s withrevolution, the `70s with drugs, and the `80s with money? Or is itthe bona fide search of a society in pursuit of the boundaries ofcollective harmony and corrective healing?      "There is no question that we're finding a spiritual hungerfrom people of all walks of life," said the Rev. TheodoreNottingham, director of video production for the Christian Church(Disciples of Christ), an NCC member communion and programcosponsor.      "Unfortunately some people look outside the church for whatis truly the church's mission," Nottingham said. "In a way thechurch itself is on a search for spirituality. This search is keyto the church's revitalization."      "Search of Spirituality" journeys across the country todocument the answers. In California, over 200 people representinga wide range of faith groups celebrate new ways of worship throughcreation-centered rituals. In Chicago, an African-AmericanLutheran congregation gives witness to the power and joy ofcommunal spirituality. In Iowa, 5,000 Presbyterian women gather toconstruct new images of God and the church. In New York, 100Vietnam veterans convene for a retreat at the direction ofBuddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh to bind the wounds of war intobanners of inner and global peace.      From gurus to grassroots, spirituality speaks to the seekerswho are redefining their lives under the rubric of personaltransformation and societal renewal. In the process, three centralquestions emerge to prod the spiritual quest: Who am I? Who is myneighbor? Who is God? The journey continues as the answers to eachof these questions unravel the harsh realities of individual livesand interweaves the responses to form new images of self, neighborand God.      "Search for Spirituality" was produced for the NationalCouncil of Churches by Current Production Group.

The people of the slums spoke a wide variety of languages.One day, on a field trip to a park, no one could translate.     Then something happened.  By patching together differentlanguages, she managed to talk with four women resting in theshade.  She learned, she said, "to communicate with the heart."     Kanhai was one of 17 United Methodist mission interns whoshared their stories Jan. 16 at the United Methodist Board ofGlobal Ministries headquarters here.  Fourteen of them havereturned from 16-month foreign assignments and are starting U.S.placements.  Three interns had taken a one-year foreign assignment.     In Zimbabwe, Africa, Don Wilson of South Carolina learned the"people's theology," which is, he explained, "when you're willingto step into their situation and see the world from their point ofview," including other perspectives of God.     Kai Jackson of Georgia, also assigned to Zimbabwe, witnessed"the power of African women organizing for their own economicindependence."  Jackson's contribution included sponsoring adoll-making workshop.     Gina Chamberlain of Illinois turned the frightening experienceof being robbed of a gold cross necklace on the streets of Nairobi,Kenya, into an examination of what action was being taken to helpthe street children who robbed her.     She realized that merely talking about issues or "going to aseminar on the debt crisis or on street children didn't affectthose children at all."     The Board of Global Ministries' three-year mission internprogram--for adults 22-30--combines work and study experiences withthe goals of community-building and cross-cultural interaction.Participants bring back a new understanding of mission and thesearch for justice and become resources for the church.     Joanne Reich of Florida and Jane Eesley of Illinois, who wereboth in Jerusalem, said they saw the everyday life of Palestiniansin a different way than that portrayed by U.S. media.     Eesley also was concerned with the lack of U.S. Christianattention to the Palestinians, some of whom are Christian."Tremendous numbers of Christians who visit the Holy Land," sheexplained, make the trip to "visit stones, not people."     In the same way, Elizabeth Dillard of Illinois and AllenVaughan of Missouri learned of internal refugees and human-rightsviolations in the Philippines.     And beyond the headlines of Eastern Europe, Lonnie Chafin ofVirginia worked at a center in Hungary housing 40 refugees--ofvarying ethnic groups--from the war in Yugoslavia. "Instead of(using) violence, they chose to be a community," he said.     Carrie Lee of Washington and Pamila Lew of Ohio, assigned toKorea, and Dinah Hall of California, who went to Japan, said theycame away more enlightened about the United States and thosecountries and about the relationships between the countries.     Holly Randolph of California, Maribel Mojica of Puerto Rico,Marcia Chamberlain of Virginia and Bert Gardner of North Carolinaall spoke of what they learned from the poor in Latin America.     Children in South Africa taught Laura Butterbaugh of Illinoisabout faith.  She recounted a story about trying to work with afamily of 10 orphaned children--who had seen their parentskilled--and not finding anything to interest them again in life.Singing Christian songs helped the children to revive with joy.

Barth in hisannual report to the board described the whirlwind of events in EasternEurope and the Commonwealth of Independent States and the subsequent publicresponse and relief efforts as "a puzzlement."  He said storage anddistribution of relief supplies are difficult, as is targeting the needy inthose areas.      Cognizant of the priority on the "poorest of the poor" that LWR hasalways upheld, a decision has been carefully made.  LWR's focus will not bediminished but some response to the call for aid in Eastern Europe and theCommonwealth of Independent States will be initiated.  A $20,000 grant toLutheran World Federation (LWF) was announced by Barth informing the Boardthat part of it has already been used to transport 20 tons of food andclothes to Yugoslavia.  This represents an initial contribution to LWR'srecently established Eastern European Fund.  Individuals may contribute tothis fund.      Barth also reported that the impact of the first peace in Ethiopiaand Eritrea in 30 years is widening but that much rehabilitative workremains to be done in the area.  In the past year, LWR completed deliveryto Eritrea and Tigray of more than 150,000 MT of food provided by US A.I.D.Approximately 800,000 people were sustained during 1991 with this food.Through the Emergency Relief Desk in Ethiopia and its newly opened officein Asmara, LWR will continue to monitor the rehabilitative work in thisarea but will not be so deeply involved in food aid in the future.     An LWR partner agency in Nicaragua heralded for its work on peace andreconciliation, a focus of LWR's, was highlighted by Dr.  Barth.  CEPAD(Evangelical Committee for Development in Nicaragua) has trained more than50 local ecumenical peace missions.  Respected by both parties in theconflict-ridden areas of Nicaragua, these missions are able to mediatesatisfactory resolutions, especially concerning land rights.For further information contact Bill Dingler at:LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF NEWS SERVICE 390 Park Avenue South NewYork, NY  10016 212/532-6350[END]Back to Headline List CopyrightCHURCHNEWS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 20, 1992[] LUTHERAN WORLD RELIEF ASSESSES USA GOVERNMENT ATTITUDESTOWARDS NEEDS IN EASTERN EUROPE, HORN OF AFRICA; OTHER AREAS NOTEDLWR WASHINGTON STAFF TELL THE STORY               1/17/92     U.S. government aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States has notcome at the expense of poorer countries, said Carol Capps, representativefor development policy for Church World Service and Witness/Lutheran WorldRelief.  Ms. Capps, reporting to the board of directors of Lutheran WorldRelief, said that while third world needs have never been a high priorityin Congress, the U.S. government appears to realize that the magnitude ofsuffering in the republics of the former Soviet Union is on a differentscale than that in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.     Ms. Capps also reported on U.S. policy toward the Horn of Africa,noting that the international community appears paralyzed by the violencein Somalia, which continues to destroy lives and property.  Governments andhumanitarian agencies have found it difficult to operate in the country, asanarchy set in after the fall last year of President Siad Barre.  Inneighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. has been slow to provide development aid dueto overdue repayments on military loans dating to the time of HaileSelassie, in the early 1970s.  Congressional action which would permitdevelopment aid to the new government of Ethiopia failed when an overallforeign aid bill was not passed in November.  The executive branch couldpermit such development aid and is currently going through the stepsnecessary to effect a waiver of the Congressional prohibition (Brookeamendment) of such development aid.     Ms. Capps introduced Paul Nelson who gave an update on U.S. policyrelating to African recovery and development.  Mr. Nelson and his wifePaola Scommegna recently joined the Washington staff in policy analysis andcommunications.     In addition to the report from Ms. Capps, the board heard reports from:     board member Bishop Harold Skillrud of Atlanta on his     board- mandated monitoring trip to East Africa.     Describing the "exquisite beauty, grinding poverty and     concentrated joy" he found in Kenya, Tanzania and     Zimbabwe, he commended the dedication of LWR staff and     partners in working to ease human suffering.  In an     accompanying slide show, Skillrud showed slides of a     Tanzanian woman who, ten years ago, lived in a small     home made of bark and thatch.  Thanks to a grant of an     in-calf heifer, the woman has managed to raise a small     herd of cattle, increasing the nutrition level of her     family, and building a brick home with a tin roof.  She     also has passed on the gift of her heifer to others so     that they may benefit.     board member Charles Lutz of Minneapolis.  Lutz     reported on his trip to monitor LWR work in Israeli     Occupied Territories, saying the Gaza Strip was "the     most depressing place on earth, with a feeling of     gloom."  With Israelis and Palestinians currently in     negotiations, Lutz found guarded hope among Palestinian     contacts for the prospects of peace.     the president of the board.  Robert Marshall encouraged     board members who are so inclined to write their     representatives and urge them to make the 10 billion     dollar loan guarantee that Israel is requesting     contingent on certain criteria; namely, that there be a     moratorium on all Israeli settlement-building, that the     peace process not be disrupted and that human rights     abuses be decreased.     the board members on the Middle East.  A "sense of the     board" was adopted without objection where by it was     agreed that LWR would not join in any letter advocating     the passage of the $10 billion loan guarantee to Israel     without "iron-clad assurances of a freeze on all     Israeli settlement-building in the occupied     territories.

Working     with representatives of the Lutheran Church-Missouri     Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,     LWR has recently initiated a direct mail appeal program     corresponding only with individuals who have given     directly to LWR in the past.  To date, LWR has spent     less than 8 cents to raise each dollar under the direct     mail program.  With an overall response rate of 9.5%,     LWR is encouraged by the results.     Middle East and Asia Program Director.  In his     presentation to the LWR board, the Reverend Gene     Thiemann, donned a gas mask to make two points.  With a     voice muffled by the mask, he talked first about the     LWR funds that were used to purchase gas masks for the     Augusta Victoria Hospital staff in Jerusalem when the     Persian Gulf war raged. Second, Thiemann talked about     the need to really listen to the voices that get     muffled by warfare, natural disaster and civil strife.

LOUIS (ELCA) -- Nearly 300 Lutheran college studentswelcomed in the last decade of a century that has been marked bya revolution in high technology with a conference on issues offaith and science.     The students came here from about 80 different universitiesfor a conference held Dec. 28-Jan. 1.  The conference "Stewardsof Technology Responding to God's Call,"  was sponsored by theLutheran Student Movement-USA.     "The most important thing we can do is bring the Christianvalue of cooperation into our communities...that will do more fortechnology than all the high technology we can use," said keynotespeaker Dr. Rustum Roy, a leading U.S. materials scientistinvolved in the first Vatican and National Council of Churchesdiscussions of science and religion.     "Don't attack anybody, just go ask everybody a lot ofquestions in a Woody Allen fashion," he said.  Roy is professorof the solid state and professor of geochemistry at PennsylvaniaState University, University Park, PA.  He also serves asdirector of the university's Science, Technology and SocietyProgram.     "Newness is the principal character of godliness and chanceis its principal agent on earth," said Roy in calling students to"prayerful, thoughtful, careful experimenting with life."     "Rippling through the whole scheme is a magnificent,glorious, unifying and loving experience that we in the West havecalled God," said a second keynote speaker, Dr. George K.Schweitzer, alumni distinguished professor of chemistry at theUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville.     "I do not know how love expresses him or herself out therein the universe," he said.  "I do know God is and has beencommunicating everywhere."     In plenary action, students passed resolutions in favor ofconserving water, being accepting of non-Christians and combatingracism.  They narrowly defeated a resolution supporting thehumane use of animals in biomedical research and testing.     Students attended workshops and worship services whichcentered on faith and science issues.  They also visited the zooand botanical gardens in St. Louis.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommitteeon immigration and refugee affairs in the Senate, said LIRS was a"phenomenal humanitarian agency.     "LIRS has made the difference between lives of oppressionand deprivation and lives of hope and freedom for over 150,000refugees from throughout the world," he said.     Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who chairs the Housesubcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law,commended LIRS for "its efforts in organizing assistance forchildren who are being kept in detention centers because of theirlack of legal status in this country."     "While the LIRS does not seek recognition for itshumanitarian efforts, I rise today to commend them," said Sen.Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.  "With the world's refugee populationestimated at 14 million, the work of organizations such as theLIRS assumes an ever-increasing significance."     Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., called LIRS "a vibrant organizationfor 50 years."     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said the more than 6,000congregational sponsors that have joined LIRS in the resettlementprocess, "also deserve praise for their untiring work inaccepting newcomers.  As the only refugee serving in the U.S.Senate, I have a deep concern for the plight of refugees andimmigrants.  I have worked closely with LIRS in the past and lookforward to a continued close working relationship."  Boschwitz isa member of LIRS's honorary 50th anniversary committee.     Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said "It is the privatevoluntary organizations like LIRS which are truly on the frontlines of refugee policy.  On both the local and internationallevel, private voluntary organizations help governments grapplewith the growing refugee problem."     Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., noted the involvement ofLIRS "in efforts to chart a more humane immigration and refugeepolicy within the United States and among the nations of theworld."     Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., pointed out that LIRS is "oneof just two voluntary agencies that resettles unaccompaniedminors."  LIRS has placed more than 3,000 unaccompanied refugeechildren in foster care since 1978.     Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass., said that in Massachusetts"the work of LIRS is well known and has added to the very fabricof our life as a commonwealth."     "The work of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service makesChrist's words manifest and is a shining beacon of hope in aworld in which the lack of human compassion sometimes seemsoverwhelming," Christ said that as you have done to the least ofthese you have also done it unto me, said Rep. Timothy P.Johnson, D-S.D.     LIRS serves on behalf of the Evangelical Lutheran Church inAmerica, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and Latvian EvangelicalLutheran Church in America.

James RudinSpecial to Religious News Service   (Rabbi Rudin is national interreligious affairs director of theAmerican Jewish Committee.)   (RNS) -- What in American life has historically played a key rolein shaping fundamental values of political leaders?   Look for the answer in the early minutes of an upcoming televisionprogram called "Democracy in America," an in-depth look at the livesof Sen. Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle.   Appearing briefly during the Markle Foundation-produced broadcast,to be aired Oct. 11 on CNN, is the Missionary Baptist Church inCarthage, Tenn., where Gore's spiritual life is rooted. It is thechurch where his grandparents worshiped.   And then, during a segment on Quayle, he says that "church onSunday" was a part of his upbringing in Huntington, Ind.   These are but two examples of many in history that highlight thestrong influence of religion on our political process. It was anaspect of the American scene that astonished French historical Alexisde Tocqueville when he wrote a book called "Democracy in America" morethan a century ago.   The connections have continued to amaze foreign visitors. TheUnited States is a highly industrialized First World country thatbehaves religiously like a Third World nation. We have a legal barrierbetween religion and government. Even though there is a legalseparation between religion and state, religion has been a critical,often defining, factor in shaping the values of our political leaders.   Throughout history, religious groups have stressed moral dimensionsof public issues, giving urgency and passion to politics. When leaderssought independence from Great Britain, the cause was preached incolonial pulpits.   The abolitionist and pro-slavery movements were strongly supportedby religious leaders before the Civil War. And in this century, suchmovements as prohibition, civil rights, sexual equality, the variousanti-war efforts and yes, family values, have all found a home inchurch and synagogue.   Religion's deep hold on the political imagination of most Americanssets our country apart from others. High visibility at religiousservices has traditionally been part of a U.S. president's jobdescription.   Some consider the close ties a threat to the American republic. Infact, they may be more a threat to religion. Many American politicalleaders have abused religious symbols and language. And worse, theyhave at times appropriated divine approval for ideology of their ownpolitical parties.   In the heat of a presidential election, it is important to rememberthat God is neither a Republican nor a Democrat, not even anindependent.   It is also important to recognize religion's proper functions insociety. One role, of course, is to develop permanent ethical valuesin future leaders. Are the churches doing their job well? If Gore orQuayle eventually becomes president, as five of our last nine vicepresidents have done, we may all learn the answer.   But religion plays another important role in the political process:to play the biblical prophet Nathan to King David, to be theconscience of political leaders.   Too often Jews and Christians have forgotten Nathan, who confrontedDavid with the seriousness of a moral lapse, and identified with thedominant political values of society. Too often religion has beendeliberately manipulated by political leaders for their own ends.   Writing 200 years ago, James Madison envisioned a robust role forreligion. He called for a "multiplicity of sects" in the public arena,the better to achieve a balance between the compelling demands ofauthentic religion and the complex political process.   Each time we elect national leaders we are striking a new balancefor the future. It is an awesome but a necessary task.                                == 30 ==Back to Headline List CopyrightRNS DAILY NEWS REPORTS via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992Editor sues for wider access to Dead Sea ScrollsRNS>17231By David E. AndersonReligious News Service      (RNS) -- Herschel Shanks, the American editor who broke open afraternity of Dead Sea scholars to ensure wider access to the scrolls,has gone to court to defend that access.   Shanks, and the organization he heads, the Biblical ArchaeologySociety, have filed suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphiaagainst Israeli professor Elisha Quimron. The suit, filed Sept. 25,seeks a declaration from the court that a part of the Scrollsreconstructed by Quimron cannot be copyrighted.   Quimron, a professor of Hebrew Language at Ben-Gurion University inIsrael, is currently a scholar in residence at the Annenberg ResearchInstitute in Philadelphia.   Some eight months ago, Quimron successfully sought a temporaryinjunction barring the society from publishing or distributinganywhere in the world the two-volume book "A Facsimile Edition of theDead Sea Scrolls."   The book, which contains an introduction by Shanks, was the resultof years of labor by him and others to break the hold a small group ofscholars has held on the scrolls since they were discovered in 1947 ina cave in what is now Israel. Shanks' effort was intended to make thedocuments more available to other researchers and the public.   The documents are believed to have been written between 200 yearsbefore and 50 years after the birth of Jesus.   The ancient texts represent one of the most important manuscriptdiscoveries in the field of early rabbinic Judaism and the first yearsof the Christian movement. The originals are kept at the RockefellerMuseum in Jerusalem and research on them is done under the auspices ofthe Israeli Antiquities Authority.   Since the 1950s, a small group of scholars, now numbering just 15,has controlled exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls and lessthan half have been published.   Last year, the Biblical Archaeology Society published its two-volume work containing more than 1,750 photographic plates. The bookmade the text of the scrolls widely available to scholars, researchersand other interested parties.   Part of the volumes included a 120-line portion of thereconstructed text of an ancient document known as MMT, an acronym forthe Hebrew phrase "Miqsat Ma'aseh ha-Torah."   The MMT text is believed to a foundation document of the Qumransect, a Jewish group that broke with the prevailing rabbinic Judaism.   Although the text, amounting to about 120 lines in Quimron'sreconstruction, is 2000 years old, the Israeli scholar, who ispreparing the reconstructed text for publication, says he owns thecopyright on it. Publication in the society's two-voume work is aninfringement of that copyright, he contends.   Shanks said that the Israeli court's injunction, if allowed tostand, "would have very broad implications for all scholarship."   "It's probably the first time where a scholar has claimed such acopyright on an ancient text," he said in an interview with ReligiousNews Service.   Shanks went on to note that the reconstructed Hebrew transcript ofthe text, as pubished in the facsimile, is already in widecirculation.   "Virtually all scholars have this text," he said. "Classes havebeen taught on it. He (Quimron) authorized numerous articles" on it.In 1990, a Polish journal, "The Qumran Chronicle," published a 120-line text of MMT.   In the complaint filed in Philadelphia, Shanks compared thereconstruction of the MMT text to the completion of a jigsaw puzzle.The complaint said that "much, if not all," of the work ofreconstructing MMT has been completed by scholars other than Quimron.He became involved in preparing MMT for publication only in 1980,according to Shanks.   When the reconstructed text is made available for study by scholarsit is expected to shed a great deal of light on the Qumran sect,including its beliefs, religious laws and practices and the then-prevailing practices of Judaism.   Shanks and the archaeology society are asking the court to declarethat publishing a portion of the MMT did not infringe any copyright inviolation of Quimron's rights.   Quimron has until mid-October to reply to the complaint.                               == 30 ==Back to Headline List CopyrightRNS DAILY NEWS REPORTS via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992Q&A: Answers to questions about religionRNS>17232By Religious News Service   (Editor's note: The following is a weekly feature from RNS. Seenote at the end, which invites reader participation.)Color it ?Q: What is the significance of the colors of vestments worn byCatholic priests and some Protestant ministers when they preside overa worship service?A: Violet or purple symbolizes penitence and is used during thetwo major penitential seasons of the church's liturgical year. Thoseare Advent, leading up to Christmas, and Lent, leading up to Easter.   Rose, which symbolizes joy during a period of penance, is worn on aspecific Sundays during each of those seasons.   Red symbolizes the suffering, or passion, of Jesus Christ on thecross, and is worn for services that recall it. They include PassionSunday (also called Palm Sunday) and Good Friday. Red is also worn onPentecost, the major feast associated with the Holy Spirit, and forcelebrations of the feasts of apostles and martyrs.   White, symbolizing purity, is worn for holidays associated withChrist, such as Christmas and Easter; for feasts commemorating theVirgin Mary or saints who are not martyrs. White may also be worn forfunerals.   Green, symbolizing hope and vitality of faith, is worn for"ordinary time," those Sundays that do not fall into other categories.   Liturgical colors were standardized by the Council of Trent in the16th century. Before that, the use of colors varied from place toplace.   In efforts to set themselves apart from Catholics, most Protestantsabandoned use of color in services during the Reformation. But manyhave begun using it again in recent times.Biblical wingsQ: How many birds are mentioned in the Bible?A: About 50, far fewer than the 350 species known to inhabitbiblical lands. Leviticus 11:19 alone mentions more than a dozen,including the eagle, vulture, osprey, buzzard, raven, ostrich, hawk,sea gull, owl, water hen, stork, heron and hoopoe. The list identifiesbirds of prey that are to be avoided because they are considered"unclean."   Of these, the least well-known on the list, the hoopoe, is a 12-inch-long bird with a long, curving beak and hawking call. It has acinnamon or buff-colored body and a high, gold crest tipped withblack. Its back and wings are marked with black and white bands.   The hoopoe, common in Africa and Eruope, forages for insects andworms in manure piles, which accounts for its being labeled unfit toeat.

PAUL, Minn. (RNS) -- Archbishop John R. Roach of theArchdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has denounced the St. PaulPioneer Press for publishing excerpts from a book dealing with priestsand the sexual abuse of children.   Among other cases, the book, "Lead Us Not Into Temptation" by JasonBerry, recounts how the archdiocese and another Minnesota dioceseassigned the Rev. Thomas Adamson, an accused pedophile, to variousparishes despite reports he had abused boys.   In a guest column in the St. Paul newspaper on Thursday, Roach saidthe Berry excerpts, published as a series, raise "serious questionsabout fairness and good journalistic practice."   The information about Adamson "was simply a rehash of matters thathave been public and published by you," he said, in what amounted toan open letter to the newspaper.   "Media throughout the country, including the Pioneer Press, andprofessionals in the field of sexual abuse have recognized that theArchdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis has been a leader incorrecting what we have admitted were serious flaws in the way weaddressed pedophilia cases several years ago," Roach wrote. "Weoperated from ignorance, and we have paid the price.   "More importantly, we have learned, and we have been called upon byinterfaith groups and others all across the country to share ourpolicies," which were published in the Pioneer Press in 1988, he said.   He continued: "Your knowledge of that and your failure to strike abalance by noting it in connection with this series raises questionsabout fairness, and perhaps indicates bias."   Roach said he had "resisted vigorously" the notion that Catholicsare victims of a biased media. Howver, he said, "the decision to runthis series gives considerable credence to the theory of prejudice andbias.   "This archdiocese has been a vital part of this community from itsvery beginning. We have been responsible citizens and have a longhistory of successful service to the community. We have been herelonger than the Pioneer Press, and we will be here after the PioneerPress.   "As you know, over the years we have had meetings with the editorsof your paper to discuss a variety of issues. We work hard to becooperative with the local media.   "If your intent was to embarrass us, you've done it.

AndersonReligious News Service      (RNS) -- Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese of LosAngeles, issued an unprecedented pastoral letter to the entertainmentindustry on Wednesday, telling artists they have a moral obligation touphold "human values" but rejecting any censorship or production code.   "Because I reject censorship, I do not propose a code to governwhat filmmakers may create, nor do I wish to dictate what intelligentviewers may see," Mahony wrote in the 40-page letter. It was timed tomark the fifth anniversary of Pope John Paul II's meeting with leadersof the movie, television and recording industries during his trip tothe United States in 1987.   While saying filmmakers are "rightly jealous" of their creativefreedom, the cardinal added: "But a moment's reflection will convincethem that the freedom they cherish cannot be separated from the moralorder, the demands of truth, a concern for the common good or thewell-being of other people.   "Such a separation would result not in freedom, but in license."   Mahony said he wrote the letter because Los Angeles is theentertainment capital of the world, an area where "a great proportionof the world's entertainment is conceived, financed and produced."   "But I also write for our Catholic community and for all people ofgoodwill across the nation who are viewers of these efforts," he said.   The letter comes in the midst of an intense campaign year debateover "family values," a term Mahony avoided, using "human" instead,and an on-going attack on Hollywood by Vice President Dan Quayle andleaders of the Religious Right.   Mahony, however, has rejected the more extreme of those views.Earlier this year, he quickly disavowed a statement from thearchdiocesan office, which said that he would call for a tough newfilm rating code. It was being proposed by the Atlanta-based ChristianFilm and Television Commission.   In preparing the letter, Mahony met with several leaders of theindustry. They included Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA Inc., parent ofUniversal Pictures, as well as the heads of the Writers Guild ofAmerica West and the Directors Guild of America.   In the letter Mahony posed a series of guidelines filmmakers andother entertainers should apply to themselves, including avoidingsexist portrayals of women. He noted especially that the responsiblefilmmaker's task is made difficult by the fact that so much of theaudience is made up of "young people who are not yet emotionallymature."   "Given the power of film, what might be a tasteful and realisticportrayal of a significant human experience for a disciplined andmature adult, can result, for sensitive and vulnerable young people,in self-destructive, anti-social behavior," he said.   "The Golden Rule applies here," he added. "Responsible filmmakerswill not do to their audience what they would not done to themselvesor to their own teen-age sons and daughters," he said.   The letter was greeted by industry officials with relief andpraise.   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association ofAmerica, called the Mahony letter "wise and thoughtful." DannyGoldberg, president of Atlantic Records and chairman of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California, told the LosAngeles Times he was "impressed" and "moved" by the letter.   "It speaks to the kind of relationship that artists should havewith religion," he said.   On religion, Mahony noted that the "overhelming majority ofAmerican people believe in God and pray regularly. They look to God togive meaning to their lives."   The responsible filmmaker, he said, should ask, "Is the religiousdimension of the characters in their story in evidence. If not, whynot?"   He also challenged filmmakers to upgrade their portrayal of women."Are they persons possessing the same intrinsic dignity as their malecounterparts and, at the deepest level, facing the same soul-wrenchingchallenges to grow? ... Or is the impression given that they aresomehow something less, valued as objects rather than the persons theyare."   In urging that "human values" be reflected, Mahony said such values"are not the exclusive property of any one religious community, ethnicgroup, educational level, economic class or political party."   "To the filmmakers of our community, I say: Make films whichreflect these kinds of values and you actualize what is deepest,richest and most creative within you. By doing so, you will givesomething very special to your audiences. I can think of no better wayfor you to say `thank you' for the superlative talents you have beengiven by God."                               == 30 ==Back to Headline List CopyrightRNS DAILY NEWS REPORTS via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992Pastor resigns prominent Baptist pulpitRNS>17235By Jim JonesSpeical to Religious News Service   DALLAS (RNS) -- A minister hired to be pastor of one of the largestcongregations in the Southern Baptist Convention resigned abruptlyWednesday night, claiming the legendary senior pastor, the Rev. W.A.Criswell, was reluctant to give up leadership.   The Rev. Joel Gregory, named to succeed Criswell in November 1990at 28,000-member First Baptist Church here, stunned members attendinga Wednesday prayer service when he read a resignation statement. Inthe statement he charged that some church leaders were trying toprolong Criswell's ministry at Gregory's expense.   "The ultimate agenda," he said, "is in the prolongation of theincumbent's ministry rather than enabling the new pastor's."   Gregory, 44, said he considered his resignation to be irrevocableand effective immediately.   Gregory acknowledged that a short "transition period" had beenagreed upon when he accepted the prestigious post. At the time he washired, the arrangement was for Criswell to continue preaching at thechurch's 11 a.m. Sunday service, while Gregory would preach at thechurch's other three weekly services. Criswell, 82, was just thesecond pastor of the church, founded in 1898.   However, in the interview Gregory said he had recently learned thatsome congregational leaders were expressing hopes that Criswell, aformer president of the Southern Baptist Convention, would remain assenior pastor until his 50th anniversary at the church, still twoyears away.   "There was a verbal agreement that this was a short-termtransition," said Gregory. "I didn't anticipate it to be 20 months. Icertainly didn't anticipate it to be four years."   Gregory, 44, said he had been told originally that Criswell wouldstep down as senior pastor after only a few months, possibly by thespring of 1991.   Gregory, a noted preacher in the 15-million-member denomination,said, "The decision had elements of pain, but it also had elements ofintegrity and rightness. I feel a verbal understanding amongChristians ought to be honored."   Before accepting the pastorate, Gregory noted, he had been warnedby many fellow pastors that it would be impossible to be the truepastor of First Baptist as long as Criswell remained in the pulpit.   "I was told by many people, and, you know, they were right," saidGregory.   Asked about his plans, Gregory said, "I plan to rest and read. Thatcongregation is a huge burden, a day and night responsibility. I'llrest awhile and see what opens up."   Gregory said he had approached some congregational leaders aboutthe problem in recent weeks and was told he should bring his concernsdirectly to Criswell.   But in his statement he said he had decided that option would notbe appropriate.   Despite the situation, Gregory said, he bears no animosity towardCriswell, who was on the platform with Gregory when he made hisannouncement.   Criswell made no statement at the Wednesday service, and aspokesman at First Baptist said Thursday afternoon that Criswell wasunavailable for comment on the matter.   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)   The Rev. Morris Chapman, president of the executive committee ofthe Southern Baptist Convention, said he was aware of the struggleswithin the Dallas church but had no idea they would result in aresignation.   "Things were not going real easily in the church," Chapman saidfrom executive committee headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. "It was justa time of transition which was not going smoothly."   "Dr. Criswell has given great leadership to the church over theyears," said Chapman. "Dr. Gregory is one of the premier preachers inthe Southern Baptist Convention."   Up until 1990, Gregory had not been publicly identified with eitherthe denomination's moderate factions or its fundamentalists, who overthe past decade have come to dominate most of the denomination'sboards and commissions.   But that year, when it seemed a moderate could be elected presidentof the denomination, Gregory joined with several other prominentpastors to endorse Chapman, the more conservative candidate.   At that time, he said he hoped to "demonstrate that theconservative resurgence in the convention is not simply a punitivepolitical plot to transfer power to one group" and said he hoped "tobe able to call all our people together who affirm the Bible as theperfect work of God."Back to Headline List WT03-B11-26IA087-000629-B029-162http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/tx15.html 205.156.212.5 19970122043722 text/html 41115HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:35:26 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:53 GMTContent-length: 40928Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/tx15.html Sample Issue Copyright THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEWS ON THE TAX FRONT (886 words) BUSINESS TAXES--INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS (669 words) BUSINESS TAXES--TELEMARKETER-EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?

At this time Congress and the Presidentare still at loggerheads.  The jam could be broken at any time,or could outlast the spring thaw.  It does appear that much ofthe reform bill is vulnerable to change.     Most prizes and awards are taxable income.  In YarbroughOldsmobile Cadillac, Inc. (T.C. Memo. 1995-538) the Court heldtrips received by the taxpayer from an auto manufacturer weretaxable income to the company president.  In addition, the Courtfound that two boats were the property of the president andshareholder, even though the corporation held title to the boats.The president was the only person to use the boats.     In an audit of regular corporations, agents often claim anofficer-shareholder's compensation is unreasonable.  Any amountdisallowed is treated as a nondeductible dividend.  In  GuySchoenecker, Inc., (T.C. Memo. 1995-539) the Court sided with theIRS in finding the president's salary to be excessive.  The Courtnoted that the president set his compensation based on what hewanted to take out of the company, and not what would have beenpaid in an arm's-length transaction.  The fact that the presidentdecreased the bonus of one employee while increasing his ownweighed against him.     In Announcement 95-98 (I.R.B. 1995-47, 19) the IRS announcedthat the expiration date on the 1992 revision of Form 3115,Application for Change in Accounting Method has been extended toAugust 31, 1998.     The strong bond market is benefiting taxpayers who oweinterest on underpayment penalties.  In Internal Revenue NewsRelease IR-95-96 the Service announced that the interest ratesfor the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1996 will remain at8% for overpayments, 9% for underpayments, and 11% for largecorporate underpayments.     In Announcement 95-99 (I.R.B. 1995-48) the IRS releasedexamination guidelines for employee plan examiners to use whenexamining plans for compliance with certain distributionrequirements and for the application of the limitation onbenefits.     When incorporating a new business you can avoid a taxabletransaction by contributing assets to the corporation in exchangefor stock (Sec. 351).  However, the corporation's basis in theassets acquired are generally equal to the transferor's basis.In George Georgiou and Judith Georgiou, (T.C. Memo. 1995-546) theCourt held that inventories the taxpayer transferred to a newcorporation had to be valued at the taxpayer's basis.  He couldnot value the assets at their fair market value.     You can only deduct living expenses while away from home ifthe job assignment is temporary.  Generally, that means less thana year.  In Gary M. and Trudy J. Weichlein (T.C. Memo. 1995-553)the taxpayer had no prospect of finding work near her home andworked at a series of jobs away from home, all for the sameemployer.  The Court denied her traveling expenses.     There are a number of similarities between partnerships andS corporations in the way they are taxed.  But there are a numberof differences.  A shareholder's income from an S corporation canconsist of salary and the passthrough of income, but none of theincome qualifies as self-employment income.  That's what theCourt held in Antonio R. Durando (95-2 USTC 50,615).  Since thetaxpayer had no self-employment income, he could not makecontributions to a Keogh plan.     Rev. Proc. 95-51 (I.R.B. 1995-51) provides approval tochange the funding method used to determine the minimum fundingstandard for defined benefit plans under Code Sec. 412.     In Internal Revenue News Release IR-95-68 the IRS announcedthat most taxpayers will be able to have their IRS refundsdeposited directly to their checking or savings accounts whenfiling their 1995 returns.  You must include the necessary bankinformation on Form 8888 (Direct Deposit of Refund) and attachthe form to your return.     Because pending legislation would affect Forms W-4, W-4P andW-4S, in Announcement 95-104 (I.R.B. 1995-51), the IRS is askingtaxpayers to continue using 1995 forms until the 1996 revisionsare available.  However, Form W-5 (Earned Income Credit AdvancePayment Certificate) is being revised and the new form must beused beginning in 1996.  Some filers of this form may no longerbe eligible for the credit.     Direct sellers are not considered employees for withholdingtax purposes. In Letter Ruling 9530001 the Service held thatpersons who worked as canvassers and closers who went door todoor selling home improvement and repair services were directsellers and not employees.  The workers were held to be in thetrade or business of selling consumer products in the home orother than in a permanent retail establishment.  Substantiallyall of the workers' remuneration was related to sales or otheroutput rather than the number of hours worked.  In addition, theworkers perform their services pursuant to a written agreementthat provides that the workers will not be treated as employeesfor federal tax purposes.     Many small business owners operate more than one business,sometimes through separate entities.  In Letter Ruling 9530005the taxpayer performed work for his S corporation and hadconsulting income he reported on Schedule C.  The IRS held thatthe taxpayer was a corporate officer who performed significantservices which were held to be wages subject to FICA and FUTAtaxes and income tax withholding.  Moreover, he could not net thelosses from S corporations with income from self-employment forpurposes of calculating the self-employment (SECA) tax.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BUSINESS TAXES--INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS     You own two corporations.  Madison's bank account isoverflowing; Wilton Inc. can't afford to meet this week'spayroll.  Should you just tell your controller to cut the payrollchecks on Madison's bank account?  It depends on all the facts.However, in some cases it could be very costly move.     The general rule is that a deduction is only allowed to theparty who both incurs (or is liable for) the expense and makesthe payment.  Let's look at the case of a parent and subsidiary.Assume you own 100% of Madison Inc.  Madison has a wholly ownedsubsidiary, Wilton Inc.  Because Wilton is short of cash, Madisonwrites the bonus checks to Wilton's employees on its account.According to Rev. Rul. 84-68 (1984-1 C.B. 31), Madison can'tdeduct the payment.  Instead, Madison records the payment as acapital contribution to Wilton.  Wilton takes the deduction.     Generally, the only disadvantage here is some extrabookkeeping.  Wilton is a subsidiary of Madison, so there'sreally no winner or loser from a tax standpoint.     Now consider a slightly different situation.  Instead of aparent-subsidiary relationship, you own 100% of both Madison andWilton.  Again Madison writes checks for a total of $50,000 topay Wilton's employees.  The IRS recharacterizes this as threeseparate transactions.  One, Madison paid a $50,000 dividend toyou.  Two, you made a $50,000 capital contribution to Wilton.Three, Wilton paid a $50,000 bonus.     The tax effects here are very different.  The dividend isnot deductible by Madison, but is taxable to you.  The capitalcontribution has no direct tax effect.  The $50,000 payment isdeductible by Wilton.  Here, again, Wilton gets a $50,000deduction, but this time you have $50,000 of dividend income.Keep in mind that there are some subtle tax effects.  Forexample, the capital contribution would increase your tax basisin Wilton should you sell the business.     Things can get worse in the second example.  What if Wiltonlater repaid Madison?  The IRS could recharacterize it as a$50,000 dividend from Wilton to you followed by a capitalcontribution by you to Madison.  The roundtrip of $50,000 hascreated $100,000 in income to you.     What if Madison loaned Wilton the $50,000?  If you cancreate a bona fide loan, that should work.  But remember, youshould have a note with a maturity date, collateral, etc.  Whilea much better approach, it may not be a sure thing.  The loanmight be recharacterized if Wilton is thinly capitalized or wouldnot have been able to borrow money from a regular lender.     What about S corporations?  If both Madison and Wilton are Scorporations, the result may not be as disastrous.  Thedistribution from Madison might not be taxable.  Even so, usingthe loan approach makes more sense.     A loan from a regular corporation to an S corporation couldalso have adverse consequences.  For example, you own 100% ofWilton (a regular corporation) and 100% of Madison (an Scorporation).  Wilton loans money to Madison.  The IRS might tryto recharacterize this as an equity contribution by Wilton toMadison.  You'd get no benefit for the additional capital.Worse, the S election could be terminated.     You should also be careful of other transactions.  Forexample, Madison produces widgets which it sells to unrelatedcustomers for $10 each.  Madison also sells them to Wilton, butfor cost, $4 each.  Madison and Wilton are both owned by you.the IRS might try to recharacterize this transaction.  You couldalso have problems if Madison sold the widgets to Wilton for morethan it charges regular customers.  (See Product Discounts,below.)     Another point.  In the examples we assumed you own 100% ofboth corporations.  That's not necessary.  For example, you couldencounter problems if you and 4 other associates own all thestock of both entities.     If you do business through two or more regular corporations,and there are regular intercompany transactions, talk to your taxadviser about setting up a parent-subsidiary relationship.  Andkeep all dealings on an arms'-length basis.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BUSINESS TAXES--TELEMARKETER-EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?     In religion the eternal struggle is good vs. evil.  In theannals of the IRS it's employee vs. independent contractor.  TheIRS and the courts look at 20 factors when making adetermination.  Some factors may not be appropriate.  However,one factor present in almost all cases is the degree of controlby the employer.     Telemarketers were the subject of a recent letter ruling (LR9527009), but the IRS advice was unchanged from an earlierrevenue ruling (Rev. Rul. 74-333, 1974-2 C.B. 328), so it cangenerally be relied upon.     In the first situation, a company engaged an individual toperform services as a telephone solicitor to obtain orders.  Herduties are to telephone certain prospects designated by thecompany and to record the necessary information on an order blankat the time a sale is made.  She is furnished with officefacilities, supplies and a telephone by the company on itspremises.  There is no prescribed period of training; however thecompany does furnish a suggested script.  The calls are made attimes optional to the solicitor, but she is expected to devotefrom 4 to 8 hours daily to the job.  Her services are performedunder the company's name.  She is paid a commission on each saleand is not expected to produce a minimum volume of sales.  Herservices may be terminated at any time.     In this situation, the IRS held the worker was an employeesince the company exercises or has the right to exercisedirection and control over the worker.     In the second situation, the facts are the same as above,but the worker operates out of her own home, performs allservices on a part-time basis, without supervision, and pays allthe expenses incurred in connection with her selling activities.The worker is given a list of names from a telephone directory sothat there is no duplication.  She does not submit reports, otherthan sales orders, does not deliver the products or collectpayments, and is not required to devote any certain amount oftime to the work, perform any services on the company's premises,or produce a minimum volume of sales.     In this situation the IRS held that the company does not orcan not exercise enough control to call the worker an employee.Thus, the worker would be classified as an independentcontractor.     Rev. Rul. 75-242 (1975-1 C.B. 321) presented a slightlydifferent situation.  The telemarketers worked from home,furnishing their own phones, under the company's name.  Thecompany provided the workers with all necessary forms andstationery.  They were given introductory training and furnishedwith a required speech.  The solicitors were required to completea daily report listing all calls made and the number of hoursspent performing services.  The company also specified the hoursduring the day and the number of days a week that each solicitorwas to perform the services.  The company paid the workers on anhourly basis.     Here the IRS held that the worker was an employee because ofthe control involved (hours of work required, reports, etc.),even though the solicitor worked out of his house.     The letter ruling had a slightly different set of facts.Workers who performed the services at offices provided by thecompany and had to work a certain number of hours were deemedemployees.  Those who either had to or choose to work at homewith no restrictions, were considered independent contractors.It didn't make any difference that the workers signed a contractindicating they were independent contractors.     There's no general answer.  Each situation is different.There is one way to avoid problems.  Try to modify your businesspractices to follow the situation described in the revenueruling.  For example, have the person work out of their house (orown office), make them pay for their own supplies, pay themsolely on commission, etc.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TAXES--DEPRECIATION-ALLOWED OR ALLOWABLE     When you sell any tangible personal property (e.g.,machinery, furniture, etc.) used in your business, you may have again or a loss.  The nature (ordinary income or capital gain) andthe amount of the gain or loss will depend on the depreciation'allowed or allowable'.  Allowed or allowable is a technicalterm, but it can be a big trap if you're not careful.     Basically, allowed or allowable means that you've got toreduce your basis in the asset by either the amount ofdepreciation you took, or the amount you should have taken.There's the trap.  If you inadvertently don't take depreciationon an asset, the law assumes you depreciated the asset using thestraight line method, and your basis in the asset will be reducedaccordingly.     Example--In 1988 Madison Inc. purchased a new machine for$10,000, but through a bookkeeping error, never took anydepreciation.  In 1996 Madison sells the machine for $4,500.Since the machine would have been fully depreciated using thestraight line method, Madison's basis is $0 and it will have toreport a gain of $4,500 on the sale.     The $4,500 gain would be the same if Madison had takendepreciation, but it would have gotten $10,000 in tax deductionsover the years.     There's only one possible out.  If you discover the errorbefore it's too late you might be able to file an amended returnand recover some lost depreciation deductions.  More than likelyyou'll only be able to salvage a fraction of what you could havetaken.     Be sure to record and depreciate all fixed asset additions.While not as popular as general accounting software, there anumber of programs that make it relatively painless.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BUSINESS TAXES--PRODUCT DISCOUNTS     Rebates or discounts on products sold to customers ordealers are always deductible, right?  Don't answer too quickly.While you'll have no trouble if you've got a standard formula(e.g., 10% off on purchases over $500, etc.), you could run intoan IRS challenge if you get too tricky.     In one recent case (Foretravel, Inc.,;1 T.C. Memo. 1995-494)the taxpayer was a manufacturer of high-end motor coaches.  Thetaxpayer sold the motor homes through both independent andcaptive (subsidiary) dealerships.  The units had high wholesaleand suggested retail prices (to maintain a top-of-the-lineimage), but substantial discounts might have to be made by thedealer to sell a demo unit, one with an unusual paint scheme,etc.  Adjustments would also have to be made if a customer wastrading in an used coach made by the taxpayer.  On the otherhand, if the dealer could sell a coach at the full price, itcertainly tried to do so.     The taxpayer had no written policy for arriving at adiscount.  The company took into account trade-ins, customergoodwill, the type of customer (a high profile owner such as aleader of a motor home club might get a bigger discount), etc.In fact, because the ultimate profit on the sale might not beknown until after the trade-in unit was sold, the rebates weregenerally not determined until the end of the year.     The taxpayer recorded the rebates by crediting accountsreceivable and debiting bad debts.  When preparing the financialstatements, the company's accountants reclassified the rebates.Unfortunately, because of several oversights, thereclassification was not reflected on the tax returns.     The IRS contended that the incentive payments werecontributions to the capital of the dealerships and thus notdeductible.  That argument was based on the fact that the rebateswere not based on the dealership's performance.     Fortunately, the Court sided with the taxpayer.  The Courtfound that the mistaken accounting entries were not fatal.  TheCourt looked behind the bookkeeping entries to determine the truenature of the payments.  It also found that a strict formula wasnot necessary for the payments to qualify as discounts.  TheCourt noted that the product was unique, there were validbusiness reasons for the incentives, and that the company had tocustomize the rebates to fit the situations.     CAUTION.  While the taxpayer won, not having a numericalformula could cause problems in more normal instances.  Considera regular policy first; handling it the way the taxpayer did hereshould be your fallback position.     Getting tricky can get you into trouble.  In another case(Sun Microsystems, Inc., T.C. Memo. 1993-467) the taxpayer tiedpurchase price discounts to the purchase by that customer ofwarrants to buy the taxpayer's stock.  Again, the taxpayer wonthe case, but not without a fight.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FRINGE BENEFITS--MEAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES     On several occasions we've mentioned that not all meal andentertainment expenses are subject to the 50% rule (i.e., only50% of the expense can be deducted).  Here's some moreinformation on one frequently encountered situation.     Expenses for recreational, social, or similar activity,primarily for the benefit of employees, is not subject to the 50%rule.  The exception only applies to expenditures made primarilyfor the benefit of employees other than those who are officers,shareholders or other owners of a 10% or greater interest, orother highly compensated employees.  Family members of employeesare treated as employees here.     What sort of activities fall under this exception?Christmas parties, annual picnics, summer outings, or maintaininga swimming pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, etc. are givenin the regulations as examples.  You could probably extend thatto occasional office parties.  If the parties are regular, theyprobably won't qualify.  For example, the company signs a bigcontract on Thursday.  Friday evening, most of the office goesout for drinks and dinner, for which the company pays.  Thatshould qualify.  On the other hand, drinks on the company everyFriday won't.     If, because of the number of employees, you have to limitthe number of participants, that's all right.  You just can'tdiscriminate in favor of officers, owners, etc.  That means, youcould fail to fall under the exception if the only people at theouting are officers, or if family members of owners are invitedby not family members of other employees.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996S CORPORATIONS--LOSS PASSTHROUGHS AND BASIS     Losses generated by S corporations and partnerships arepassed through to the shareholders or partners.  However, thelosses can only be used to reduce your taxable income up to yourbasis in the S corporation or partnership.  Losses in excess ofbasis can be carried forward and used in a later year.  Yourbasis is generally equal to your equity plus any loans you madeto the S corporation.  The same rules apply to partnerships, butyour basis can also include any partnership loans for whichyou're liable.     Example--For 1995 Madison Inc. has a $50,000 loss.  You'rethe only shareholder and your basis (at the end of the year, butbefore the loss) is $35,000.  You can only deduct $35,000 of theloss in 1995.  The remaining $15,000 can be carried forward anddeducted in 1996 (or a later year), if you have sufficient basis.     What are your options?  Tax professionals oftenautomatically advise loaning enough money to the corporation toincrease your basis so that you can take the entire loss.     Instead of going with a rule of thumb, work through thenumbers.  Can you use the additional loss in the current year?Even if you can, does it make sense?  For example, assume you'renormally in the 36% tax bracket, but this year you're in the 15%bracket.  Any additional loss will only save taxes at 15%.  Ifthe loss was carried forward, you might be able to offset incomein the 36% bracket.     If the loss for a year is large enough it could offset allyour income and create a net operating loss (yes, individuals canhave a NOL).  In that case the loss can be carried back threeyears.  If you were in a high bracket in that year you might wantto make a capital contribution or loan this year to use theentire loss.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TAXES--PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES     More and more companies are challenging their personalproperty tax assessments.  If your company has a substantialamount invested in fixed assets or inventory, arguing yourassessment can save considerable tax dollars.  Property tax lawsvary from state to state, so there are no general rules.  Buthere are some points to consider.     o Make sure the assets are there.  You may be carryingassets on the books that have been sold or scrapped or moved toanother state.  Consider doing a physical inventory to confirmthe accounting records.     o If the assessment is based on the book value of theassets, make sure you're depreciating the assets correctly.     o Check the law carefully.  The rules vary by state and evenby county and town in many cases.  Some assets may be exempt,others taxed at a lower rate.  Inventory is exempt in about halfthe states.     o You may be able to challenge the formula.  In a recentVirginia case the taxpayer fought the county's approach thatvalued computer equipment at a rate that declined to no less than20% of the purchase price after 5 years.  The judge found theequipment worth no more than 4%  of its cost after 5 years and 1%in subsequent years.     o Make sure the property is classified correctly.  There area number of areas where the definition of personal and realproperty cross.  A single purpose building such as a greenhousemay be considered personal property in some states; real propertyin others.  Items in a building, such as overhead cranes, arealso subject to misclassification.     o You may be taxed on idle equipment that you haven't usedin years.  Consider abandoning or scraping it.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996MANAGEMENT--LICENSING YOUR IDEAS     You may come up with a idea for a new product, process, etc.that has potential but that you can't explore because of limitedcapital, time, expertise or experience in a particular market.One way to generate revenue with little or no expense is tolicense the product to another firm.  Many products aremanufactured under license.  Unfortunately, you've got to takesteps to protect your idea and maximize the revenue.  Here aresome thoughts.     o The license agreement is critical.  Get an attorney who'sa specialist in this area.  It may cost you several thousanddollars more, but it will pay big returns in the long run.     o The contract should take into account changes intechnology.  That may mean it should be for a limited time.  Orprovide for changes in some way.  Technology is changing morerapidly than ever.  Many years ago, when personal computers werein their infancy, a large newspaper gave exclusive rights for online access to its paper without any expiration on the agreement.At that time the agreement was probably worth very little; todaythe agreement is a gold mine.  Changing technology can also havean effect on the medium.  Selling the reproduction rights to abook today may involve a print edition, movie version,television, video tape, CD-ROM, and on-line access.  Failure tocover all possibilities could be costly.     o Definitions and limitations are important.  Does thelicensee include different versions?  Can the product be sold injust foreign markets?  Just the U.S.?     o Make sure the licensee will promote the product.  Chancesare you may be selling the product to a company with a rivalproduct.  They may buy your idea just to keep it off the market.Or they may market your product on a token basis.  Or they maydecide not to promote your product until they can leapfrog yourtechnology.  If all your income is based on royalties, yourreturn may be minimal.     o Include the right to cancel the contract after a certainperiod of time if the royalties don't reach a certain level.  Forexample, if royalties don't reach $20,000 by the end of the oneyear after the agreement is signed.  You can include a second andthird level.  For example, royalties must reach $35,000annualized by the end of the second year.     o The royalty payment will probably be based on sales of theproduct.  The contract should contain a minimum payment amount.For example, the greater of 2% of sales or $10,000 per year.That will give the licensee some incentive to push the product.     o Give the licensee some incentive to increase sales byproviding for progressively lower royalty rates.  For example,royalties are 5% of the first $500,000 of sales; 4% on the next$1 million of sales; 3% on sales over $1.5 million.     o Be sure you have the right to audit the licensee's books.More than one licensee has understated sales to reduce royaltypayments.     o If the company produces a competing product you should beespecially careful.  The contract should contain a clauseprohibiting the company from developing or selling a competitiveproduct during the term of the agreement and possibly for acertain period after termination.     o Limit the right to assign the contract.  You may license asmall software producer with revenue of $5 million a year to sellyour product and feel comfortable in dealing with the owners.What happens if Megasoft Inc. acquires that company?  Will youstill feel comfortable with the license agreement?     o Be especially careful if the product or idea contains someproprietary technology.  For example, you may be licensing a newelectronic device for the medical market because you have noexperience in that market.  However, the device containsproprietary technology that you use in products you sell to theconsumer and military markets.  You want to protect thattechnology.    Licensing can produce significant returns for only a minorinvestment.  However, you need to consider all the possibilitiesand get good advice before signing a deal.  The investment intime and money will pay off.  Consider too, that negotiationshere are likely to be tricky.  It's not like selling a businessor division.  You still want control of the product.     Finally, if the product is not amenable to licensing,consider selling the rights outright, either in total or in aparticular market.  Many of the suggestions above will stillapply (e.g., limit the ability to assign the agreement, becareful if the buyer is a competitor, etc.).  If you do so, makesure you have recourse should the buyer default on any deferredpayments.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996PERSONAL FINANCE--CHOOSING AN ADVISOR     Looking for a personal financial planner?  There's a widerange of choices.  Everyone's familiar with stockbrokers, butwhat does the designation ChFC stand for?  Here are your basicoptions.     Certified Financial Planner  The designation is granted bythe International Board of Standards and Practices for CertifiedFinancial Planners.  To qualify for the CFP license the candidatemust have at least a bachelor's degree, complete an approvedfinancial planning program and have at least 3 years experiencein financial planning (varies with education).  The candidatemust pass a comprehensive 2-day, 10-hour exam.  Aftercertification the individual must complete 30 hours of continuingprofessional education every 2 years.     Chartered Financial Consultant  The designation (ChFC) isawarded by the American College in Bryn Mawr, PA, which alsogrants the CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter) designation.  Thecandidate must have at least 3 years of business experience (lesswith an undergraduate or graduate degree).  He or she must alsotake 10 courses through American College and then pass 10 2-hourexams.  A ChFC must complete 60 hours of continuing professionaleducation every 2 years.     Personal Financial Specialist This is a specialtydesignation awarded to CPAs.  The designation is granted by theAICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).  Thefirst step in qualifying is to hold a current CPA certificate andbe an AICPA member.  The education requirements are the same asthose for a regular CPA certificate and vary by state.  However,every CPA must pass a comprehensive exam that is the same fromstate to state.  In order to receive the Personal FinancialSpecialist (PFS) designation, the CPA must have at least 250hours of financial planning experience each year for thepreceding 3 years and pass a comprehensive 6-hour exam.  A PFSmust complete at least 72 hours of continuing education inpersonal financial planning every 3 years (in addition to 750hours of experience every 3 years).     Chartered Financial Analyst A CFA is more likely to be asecurities analyst or investment adviser than a personalfinancial planner.  He must have a bachelor's degree or anequivalent amount of work experience and pass three comprehensivetests, each of which is 6 hours long.  He must have 3 years ofexperience as a financial analyst.     The tests for the first three designations focus onfinancial planning fundamentals, income taxation, insurance,investments, estate and retirement planning, etc.  The CFAdesignation focuses on financial accounting, quantitativeanalysis, securities analysis, etc.     Broker or Registered Representative  The person must have abackground in the securities business and pass a series of tests,including the General Securities Examination and state securitiestests.  He is "registered" with the Securities and ExchangeCommission.  He generally works for a brokerage house.     Other Choices There are many other individuals who willprovide financial advice, but whose qualifications are unlikelyto match those mentioned above.     Pros and Cons For overall financial planning (estateplanning, insurance, tax planning, etc.) the first three choices,certified financial planner, chartered financial consultant andpersonal financial specialist are about equally ranked.  Apersonal financial specialist might have the edge if the CPA firmyou're dealing with has one or you need the broad base ofknowledge that a CPA has.  For example, a CPA with a PFSdesignation might be better able to help you with both businessand personal financial planning.  You should be wary of brokersand other planners since their background is not as general andthey are likely to steer you into investments that they sell.  Achartered financial analyst would be a good choice for help inpicking particular securities or industries to invest in, but maynot be a good choice for overall planning.     A final word.  Even accredited professionals should bechecked out.  Ask about their experience.  It is notinappropriate to get references or ask business associates, yourbanker, etc. about them.  And you've got to feel comfortable withthe planner.  Personal feelings are sure to creep in to theplanner's opinions.  For example, a 60-year old adviser is likelyto be more risk adverse than one 30 years old.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SMALL BUSINESS TAX REVIEW via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996IN BRIEF:     Director's liability . . . Officers and directors ofcorporations owe a fiduciary responsibility to the corporationthey represent.  Clearly, that means they can be held liable ifthey act in bad faith or with gross negligence.  And it goeswithout saying that an officer or director has to put theinterests of the corporation ahead of his personal interests ifhis interests conflict with those of the corporation.  However, aboard member who does nothing may be at risk.  Board members havebeen sued for inattention to the matters of the corporation.     Leasing . . . Leasing, instead of buying and financing thepurchase, may make sense for a lot of reasons, but keeping yourbalance sheet clean probably isn't one of them.  In most cases alease obligation has to be disclosed.  In the case of a financelease (basically, where you own the equipment at the end of theterm for little or no extra outlay), the capitalized value is anasset; the payments are a liability.  Even if you don't haveregular financial statements, most creditors will ask you aboutlease obligations.     Bonuses . . . Want to reward an executive or employee?Giving a bonus rather than a big raise can make sense.  Threereasons.  First, giving a raise may affect other payments such asvacation and sick pay.  Second, should the employee not performas well next year, or if you're strapped for cash, you won't belocked into a higher salary.  Third, it's usually much easier tokeep a bonus quiet than a raise.  That means you can give itselectively without creating office talk.     Speed is everything . . . You're buying a new computer.What should you look for?  The MHz (megahertz) rating isimportant, but if you're looking for pure speed, that's not theonly factor.  Final results will depend on a number of factors.For example, if you're running software that's heavily dependenton RAM (random access memory) you could find that a 90MHz Pentiummachine with 16M bytes (megabytes) of RAM is significantly fasterthan a 133MHz unit with 8M bytes of RAM.  If your budget istight, you might want to go with the slower machine and use thesavings to put in more RAM.  Likewise, if you do a lot ofgraphics work, a graphics accelerator card with extra memory willpay for itself.     Merger mania . . . If you've got a significant portfolio ofstocks, sooner or later one of them might be a merger target.  Ifthe deal's all cash, you've got no choice.  However, in manydeals you have an option.  You can elect to take the cash or takethe stock in the acquiring or combined entity.  What's the bestapproach?  If you take the cash, you'll have an immediate gain orloss.  If you take the stock, your gain or loss will be deferreduntil you sell the new stock.  Deferring the gain can make sensein many cases, particularly if you've already realizedsubstantial gains during the year.  Talk to your tax andinvestment advisors.  If you're going to take the stock and planto hold it for a while, be sure the prospects for the acquiringcompany are sound.     Tax exempt munis from Puerto Rico . . . The general rule isthat obligations issued by a state or municipality is exempt fromfederal income tax and from tax in the state of issuance.  Forexample, if you're a Massachusetts resident, interest on bondsissued by Massachusetts (or a municipality in the state) wouldnot be taxable.  If you're a New York resident, the income wouldbe taxable.  There's an exception.  Interest on bonds issued byPuerto Rico and other U.S. territories are exempt in all states.Thus, interest on a bond issued by the Virgin Islands would beexempt to both a New York and a Massachusetts resident.  Thesebonds can be particularly useful to taxpayers who are transferredfrequently.     Slow payers . . . Your terms are net 30 but Madison Inc.always pays you 60 days after billing.  They're an important,long-time customer and the check always arrives on the 60th dayso you live with it.  That may be all you can do.  However, youshould still monitor the payments.  If the 60 days begins tostretch to 65 or 70 days, there may be a real problem.  Even ifthe company is still financially sound, they may be testing you.Now's the time to step in and make sure they don't stretchpayments any farther.  In fact, it may be the perfect opportunityto ask them to speed up payments.     Is the property insurable? . . . That may be the firstquestion you should ask before purchasing a new home (or businessproperty).  Many insurers, hit by huge claims, are avoidingcertain areas or properties entirely.  For example, severalcompanies will write no policies on homes within 1,000 of thecoastline.  You may still be able to get insurance, but only fora big premium.  An extra 10 feet back may save you over $1,000per year.  You should also keep insurability in mind if you'rebuying a new car, investing in a business, etc.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-27IA087-000629-B029-204http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/tx12.html 205.156.212.5 19970122043750 text/html 60147HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:35:46 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:53 GMTContent-length: 59960Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/tx12.html Sample Issue Copyright TAX NOTES TODAY via NewsNet JANUARY 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Today's Tax Highlights 96 TNT 1-H SUMMARIES OF TODAY'S IMPORTANT TAX NEWS.

TAX ANALYSTS ANNOUNCES NEW CITATION SYSTEMS.     Starting January 1, 1996, Tax Analysts adopted a new citationsystem to identify full text documents. A single, uniform number nowidentifies each new document that we add to our print, electronic,microfiche, fax, and CD-ROM publications. You can use that number toobtain documents in whatever publishing medium you find mostconvenient.     No matter where a document appears or how you choose to orderit, the identifying number is now the same.     The new citation format consists of the abbreviation "Doc"followed by the last two digits of the current year, plus a serialnumber. For example, the 141st document received by Tax Analysts in1996 is identified in this way:                             Doc 96-141     Pre-1996 documents will continue to be identified by means ofour earlier citation systems. In other words, citations alreadyassigned to documents will not change.     We believe that our customers will find our new citation systemto be substantially simpler and more convenient than the multiplesystems that we have used in the past.Pinpoint Citations     Along with the unified full text citation system, Tax Analystsnow provides pinpoint citations by means of bracketed paragraphnumbers in full text documents appearing in our print and electronicpublications. The new system enables you to specify the preciseportions of a full text document to which you wish to make reference.     The new pinpoint citation system is available in substantiallyall full text documents produced by Tax Analysts in print andelectronic form, including court decisions, IRS announcements andrulings, congressional reports, and the like.     The new paragraph numbering system does not apply to documentsthat already have their own numbering system, such as statutes andIRS regulations.     The new paragraph numbering system is based on precedentsdeveloped in British Columbia and recently adopted by the SupremeCourt of Canada. Paragraph numbering has been discussed extensivelyin the United States as a means of providing pinpoint citations inelectronic texts, but it appears that Tax Analysts's adoption ofparagraph numbering is the first broadscale use of paragraphing toprovide pinpoint text citations.     To cite to a specific paragraph in a Tax Analysts's document,simply place a comma after the document citation and then add therelevant paragraph number. For example:                           Doc 96-141, 28     Ranges of paragraphs or a series of individual paragraphs may becited as follows:                          Doc 96-141, 28-33                                 or                       Doc 96-141, 28, 37, 54     Tax Analysts' citation system and its guidelines for paragraphnumbering are not copyrighted. The memorandums discussing theseissues, together with the related computer programs, are available tointerested members of the public, and to other publishers, onrequest. They will be made available in January 1996 on the Internet.

Congressional and White House negotiators left the CapitolDecember 29 promising to meet through the weekend if necessary tohammer out a budget deal.     "I expect us to make further progress," President Clinton toldreporters. "We will begin to deal with some of the difficult issuestoday involving how we can balance the budget and protect Medicare,Medicaid, education and the environment," said Clinton, who did notmention taxes.     House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said, "There are reasons tobe cautiously optimistic. I would hope that over the next two orthree days we could basically get this done and have everything upand running and everyone paid for while the staff work[s] out thetechnical details."     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-2                AIRLINE EXCISE TAXES SLATED TO EXPIRE.     The 10 percent excise tax on airline tickets was scheduled toexpire at midnight December 31 unless Congress and the presidentapproved legislation to extend it. That was considered an unlikelyprospect, although high-level budget meetings were scheduled tocontinue through the weekend.     Under the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Program, excise taxesare imposed on domestic passenger tickets, domestic freight waybills,international departures, and noncommercial aviation fuel.     The budget reconciliation bill Congress passed in November wouldextend these excise taxes through September 30, 1996. Contingent onthis extension, the reconciliation bill also would extend throughnext September 30 airlines' exemption from the 4.3-cent-per-gallontax on aviation fuel.    IRS AND NATIONAL ARCHIVES AT LOGGERHEADS ON ACCESS TO RECORDS.     Writing a history of the IRS from the advent of the modernincome tax (1913) to today would be difficult. The National Archivesdoes not have much information, and the IRS is not likely to provideany. Unlike most government agencies, the IRS does not turn many ofits records over to the Archives. This has been its practice sincethe 1920s. Since 1976, with the tightening of the confidentialityrules under Internal Revenue Code section 6103, the IRS has been evenless willing to turn over records to the nation's document preserver.     Even an employee authorized to use internal records would havedifficulty researching a complete history of the agency -- becausethe IRS does not have its own centralized recordkeeping or filingsystem.     Recently, the IRS's first and only historian, Shelly Davis,resigned in protest over the way the IRS was mishandling its recordsand the agency's refusal to send documents to the National Archivesas required by law. (See The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 15, 1995, p.A1.)     And late last year, the National Archives and RecordsAdministration (NARA) issued a report evaluating the IRS's recordsmanagement. NARA found that the IRS is neglecting federal lawsregarding record retention.     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-4     IRS RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PANNED BY NATIONAL ARCHIVES.     The IRS's records management program has serious shortcomingsthat must be fixed if the agency is to be in compliance with federallaw, according to a recent report by the National Archives. Theevaluation of IRS practices found that the agency does not send tothe Archives the kinds of records routinely transferred to it byother federal agencies -- which is a nice way of saying the IRS isnot doing what the law says it has to do.     An important concern is the Archives' inability to appraisedocuments for archival retention because of disclosure restrictionsclaimed by the IRS under Internal Revenue Code section 6103, whichrestricts the disclosure of tax return information.     The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) isauthorized to conduct inspections or surveys of the records, recordsmanagement programs and practices of federal agencies, and recommendimprovements.     Authority to save or dispose of a government record must comefrom NARA. This is done through records control schedules, whichdirect what happens to a record or class of records. The schedulesare prepared by the federal agency, but the final disposition of arecord or class of records must be approved by NARA. An agency cannotlegally take unilateral actions on records dispositions.     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-5YEAR IN REVIEW: FOR THE SERVICE, 'PIVOTAL' YEAR CONTAINS ITS SHARE OF                              SETBACKS.     By all accounts, 1995 was a trying year for the Service. In manyhigh-profile areas -- computer modernization, the budget, electronicfiling, and compliance programs -- IRS setbacks seemed to outnumberthe victories, at least as far as Congress was concerned.     After years of favorable treatment from congressionalappropriators, the IRS found the new GOP Congress resistant toadministration funding requests. Lawmakers, frustrated by what theysaw as a spending vacuum caused by Tax Systems Modernization (TSM),became increasingly critical of whether TSM funds were being usedeffectively.     The net budget result: $200 million less in funding than theagency received in fiscal 1995, and nearly $1 billion less thanrequested by President Clinton. Before the IRS budget was signed inlate November, the agency had endured a several-day shutdown andannounced an indefinite suspension of the Taxpayer ComplianceMeasurement Program (TCMP). Along with the TCMP, casualties includedthe elimination of a couple thousand IRS jobs, forcing officials tomake some tough choices, not all of which were well-received.     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-6                TWO MEN CHARGED IN RENO BOMBING PLOT.     Two Nevada men were charged last week with attempting to bomb anIRS building in Reno in December.     Ellis Hurst, 52, and Joseph Bailie, 40, both of Gardnerville,Nev., appeared before U.S. Federal Magistrate Phyllis Atkins and werecharged with attempted destruction of a government building and useof a destructive device in a crime of violence. (For prior coverage,see Doc 96-435 (2 pages), 95 TNT 253-4, or H&D, Dec. 29, 1995, p.5141.)     The men are accused of attempting to set off a bomb December 18in a parking lot adjacent to the IRS building in Reno. Authoritiesfound that the fuse of the bomb had been lit, but that the bomb didnot explode.     Reuters reported last week that the men had a dispute with theIRS. "Hurst related both he and Bailie had had difficulties with theInternal Revenue Service in the past," said Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms Special Agent Richard Stoltz.     The BATF said the the material removed from the device was amixture of fertilizer and fuel. Authorities said that had itexploded, it would have injured or killed many people.     Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Rachow said the men face a 30-yearmandatory minimum sentence for use of the explosive device. He saidhe would seek grand jury indictments.     IRS senior spokesman Frank Keith said the agency's field officesall have disaster recovery plans in place in case of a bombing, anact of God, or some other violent episode.     The disaster recovery plan was most recently used last springwhen an off-site building at the Martinsburg Computing Center in WestVirginia caught fire in the middle of the night. Because of thecontingency plan, IRS employees were able to get telephone servicerestored and computers working by the next morning. IRS ISSUES PROPOSED RULES ON DISTRIBUTIONS OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES                          BY A PARTNERSHIP.     The Service has issued proposed regulations (PS-2-95) relatingto the treatment of a distribution of marketable securities by apartnership. The regs reflect the amendment made to section 731(c) bythe Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-465) regarding thetreatment of marketable securities as money for purposes of sections731(a)(1) and 737.     In general, the term "marketable securities" includes anyfinancial instruments that are actively traded. Further, section731(c)(2)(B)(v) provides that an interest in an entity is amarketable security if substantially all of the entity's assetsconsist of marketable securities or money. The proposed regulationsprovide that substantially all of the assets of an entity consist ofmarketable securities or money only if 90 percent or more of theentity's assets at the time of the distribution consist of suchassets.     In addition, the proposed regs provide that an interest in anentity is a marketable security to the extent that the value of theinterest is attributable to marketable securities or money thatconstitute less than 90 percent but 20 percent or more of theentity's assets. The 20 percent threshold means that an interest inan entity holding only a small amount of marketable securities won'tbe treated as a marketable security.     The proposed regulations also provide that a marketable securitywill continue to be treated as a marketable security even if thepartnership or its partners are restricted by agreement or otherwisefrom selling or exchanging the security. According to the Service,that provision is intended to prevent a partnership from avoidingsection 731(c) by temporarily restricting the transferability of thedistributed security.     Consistent with section 731(c)(3)(A), the proposed regs containthree exceptions to section 731(c). First, they provide that if themarketable security was contributed to the partnership by thedistributee partner, section 731(c) doesn't apply to the distributionof that security.     Second, the regs provide that section 731(c) doesn't apply tothe distribution of a marketable security to the extent that thesecurity was acquired by the partnership in a nonrecognitiontransaction in exchange for property other than marketable securitiesor cash and (i) the security is actively traded as of the date ofdistribution and (ii) the security is distributed by the partnershipwithin five years of either the date the security was acquired by thepartnership or, if later, the date the security became activelytraded.     The proposed regulations further provide that section 731(c)doesn't apply to the distribution of a marketable security if (i) thesecurity wasn't actively traded on the date acquired by thepartnership and the entity to which the security relates has nooutstanding actively traded securities at the time the security wasacquired by the partnership; (ii) the security is actively traded asof the date of distribution; and (iii) the security was held by thepartnership for at least six months before it became actively tradedand the security was distributed by the partnership within five yearsof the date on which it became actively traded.     Section 731(c) doesn't apply to the distribution of marketablesecurities by an investment partnership to an eligible partner. Theregs contain provisions relating to that exception. The proposedregulations also provide rules for coordinating section 731(c) withsections 704(c)(1)(B) and 737. Finally, the regs contain an anti-abuse rule stating that the provisions of section 731(c) and theregulations must be applied in a manner that's consistent with thepurpose of section 731(c) and the substance of the transaction.     The regulations are proposed to apply to distributions ofmarketable securities by a partnership to a partner on or afterDecember 29, 1995. A public hearing on the regs has been scheduledfor April 3, 1996, beginning at 10:00 a.m., in the IRS Auditorium inWashington. Written comments on the proposed regulations and requeststo speak at the hearing (with outlines of oral comments) are due byMarch 13, 1996.(PS-2-95)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-8           IRS CANCELS HEARING ON PROPOSED SUBPART F REGS.     The Service has canceled the public hearing on the proposedregulations (IL-75-92) under sections 952, 954(c), and 960 relatingto the definition of subpart F income and foreign personal holdingcompany income of a controlled foreign corporation and the allocationof deficits for purposes of computing the deemed-paid foreign taxcredit. The hearing had been scheduled to take place on January 4,1996.

The Service has issued proposed regulations under section 367concerning transfers of stock or securities of domestic corporationsby United States persons to foreign corporations pursuant to acorporate organization, reorganization, or liquidation.(IL-9-95) (60 F.R. 66771-66772)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-10 IRS PROPOSES RULES FOR ALLOCATION OF ACCRUED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS.     The Service has issued proposed regulations (EE-35-95) undersection 411 that provide rules for calculating an employee's accruedbenefit derived from the employee's contributions to a qualifieddefined benefit pension plan. The regs reflect changes made by theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1993, which amended the law to change theaccumulation of employee contributions and the conversion of thoseaccumulated contributions to employee-derived accrued benefits.     Before OBRA '89, section 411(c)(2)(B) specified that theconversion factor to be used to compute the employee-derived accruedbenefit was 10 percent for a straight life annuity beginning atnormal retirement age of 65, and that for other normal retirementages, the conversion factor was to be determined in accordance withregulations. OBRA '89 deleted the 10 percent conversion factor andreplaced it with the requirement that the accumulated contributionsat normal retirement age be expressed as an annual benefit beginningat normal retirement age using an interest rate that would be usedunder the plan under section 417(e)(3).     To reflect the OBRA '89 amendments, the proposed regulationsdefine "appropriate conversion factor" for an accrued benefitexpressed in the form of an annual benefit that is nondecreasing forthe life of the participant as the present value of an annuity in theform of that annual benefit beginning at normal retirement age at arate of $1 per year. That amount is to be computed using the interestrate and mortality table that would be used under the plan undersection 417(e)(3) and reg. section 1.417(e)-1T. To reflect the post-OBRA '89 conversion factor definition and to conform to commonactuarial practice, the proposed regs would change the "multipliedby" language in reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(1) to "divided by."     Section 411(c)(2)(C), as amended by OBRA '89, provides that aninterest rate of 120 percent of the applicable federal midterm rateunder section 1274 is to be used for accumulating contributions onlyup to the "determination date." For the period from the determinationdate to normal retirement age, the interest rate that would be usedunder section 417(e)(3) must be used. The proposed regs would amendexisting reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(3) to reflect those rates.     Proposed reg. section 1.411(c)-1(c)(5)(i) defines "determinationdate" for purposes of section 411(c)(2)(C)(iii) in a case in which aparticipant will receive his or her entire accrued benefit derivedfrom employee contributions in any one of the following forms: anannuity that is substantially nonincreasing, substantiallynonincreasing installment payments for a fixed number of years, or asingle sum distribution. In such a case, "determination date" meansthe date on which distribution of the benefit begins. For thatpurpose, an annuity that is nonincreasing except for automaticincreases to reflect increases in the consumer price index isconsidered to be an annuity that is substantially nonincreasing.     The regulations are proposed to be effective for plan yearsbeginning on or after January 1, 1997.(EE-35-95) (60 F.R. 66532-66535)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-11     FINAL REGS PROVIDE RULES FOR CASH REPORTING BY COURT CLERKS.     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8652) undersection 6050I(g) on the information reporting requirements forfederal and state court clerks on receipt of more than $10,000 incash as bail for any individual charged with a specified criminaloffense. T.D. 8652 adopts with revisions the temporary and proposedregulations (T.D. 8572; IA-57-94) that were published on December 15,1994.     The 1994 regulations provided that a clerk is the clerk's officeor the office, department, division, branch, or unit of the courtthat is authorized to receive bail. According to the Service, acommentator suggested that the regs clarify whether reporting undersection 6050I(g) is required by a clerk if an entity that is not apart of the court receives bail. In some jurisdictions, for example,a sheriff receives bail. The final regulations provide that ifsomeone other than a clerk receives bail on behalf of a clerk, theclerk is treated as receiving the bail. Therefore, the clerk mustfile the information return.     Under the 1994 regs, a statement must be sent to each payer ofbail reporting certain information, including the aggregate amount ofreportable cash received by the clerk. The final regulations clarifythat the aggregate amount requirement can be satisfied either bysending a single written statement with an aggregate amount listed orby furnishing a copy of each Form 8300 relating to that payer of bail.     The final regulations also clarify that if multiple payments aremade to satisfy bail reportable under section 6050I(g) and theinitial payment doesn't exceed $10,000, the initial payment andsubsequent payments must be aggregated and the information returnmust be filed by the 15th day after receipt of the payment thatcauses the aggregate amount to exceed $10,000. However, payments madeto satisfy separate bail requirements aren't required to beaggregated.(T.D. 8652)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-12   IRS FINALIZES ALLOCATION AND APPORTIONMENT RULES FOR R&E COSTS.     The Service has issued final regulations under section 861concerning the allocation and apportionment of research andexperimental (R&E) expenditures for purposes of determining taxableincome from U.S. and non-U.S. sources. The regulations do not makemajor changes in the proposed regulations, and are effective January1, 1996.     The proposed regulations contained three principal changes into the existing regs. First, allocation of R&E costs to three digit-- rather than two digit -- SIC code product categories of grossincome would be permitted. Second, the percentage of R&E costs thatmay be exclusively apportioned to U.S.-source income under the salesmethod of apportionment under reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii) would beincreased from 30 percent to 50 percent. And third, use of theoptional gross income methods of apportionment would constitute abinding election to use those methods in subsequent years.     The Service agreed to a change regarding the optional grossincome methods of apportionment. It was suggested that the finalrules include a 50 percent exclusive place of performanceapportionment under the optional gross income methods to be parallelwith reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii)(A). The final regs don't go thatfar: they include a 25 percent exclusive place of performanceapportionment under the optional gross income methods.     The regs also change the binding election rules: IRS permissionwill not be required to change methods under reg. section 1.861-8(e)(3)(iii)(C), provided that the taxpayer has used one method forfive years.(T.D. 8646) (60 F.R. 66502-66510)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-13   FINAL REGS PROVIDE PAL RULES FOR RENTAL REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES.     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8645) undersection 469 providing rules for rental real estate activities oftaxpayers engaged in real property trades or businesses. Theregulations reflect changes to the law made by the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act of 1993. The final regulations adopt the proposedregs (PS-80-93) published on January 10, 1995, with revisions. (Forthe full text, see 95 TNT 6-11.)     OBRA '93 added section 469(c)(7), which provides that rentalreal estate activities of qualifying taxpayers are not subject to therule that treats all rental activities as passive. It also providesthat each of a qualifying taxpayer's interests in rental real estateis treated as a separate activity unless the taxpayer elects to treatall interest in rental real estate as a single activity.     The proposed regs provided rules for determining whether ataxpayer qualifies for treatment under section 469(c)(7). Except formodifications in response to comments received on the proposed regs,the final regs generally adopt the rules in the proposed regs.     Citing the statutory language and legislative history, theService said the final regs retain the rule in the proposed regsprohibiting qualifying taxpayers from grouping rental real estateactivities with other activities in determining whether the taxpayersmaterially participate in the rental real estate activities. It saidit invites comments, however, on whether the material participationtests in reg. section 1.469-5T(a) should be amended to include alook-back material participation test for taxpayers significantlyinvolved in the development or construction of their rental realestate interests.     The final regs are effective for tax years beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 1995.(T.D. 8645) (60 F.R. 66496-66502)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-14     PARTNERSHIP PROPERTY DISTRIBUTION REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED.     The Service has issued final regulations (T.D. 8642) undersection 704(c) relating to the recognition of gain or loss on thedistribution of contributed property by a partnership under section704(c)(1)(B). T.D. 8642 also provides final rules on the recognitionof gain on certain distributions to a contributing partner undersection 737.     The final regs clarify the proposed rules in a number ofrespects, but do not make major changes. The final regs are effectiveJanuary 9, 1995. (For text of the proposed regs (PS-76-92), see 95TNT 5-7 or H&D, Jan. 9, 1995, p. 515.)     The Service noted that a clarification was sought on theinteraction of the like-kind exception and the disguised sale rulesof section 707(a)(2)(B). The Service says there's "no suggestion insection 704(c)(2) or the proposed regulations that the like-kindexception was intended as an exception to the disguised saleprovisions." The final regs confirm that the disguised sale rules canapply to a distribution, "even if the distribution would otherwisehave qualified for the section 704(c)(2) like-kind exception."     Despite numerous suggestions for "clarifying or modifying theanti-abuse rule in the proposed regulations," the final regs adoptthe proposed rule without change.(T.D. 8642) (60 F.R. 66727-66739)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-15       FINAL GSTT REGS ELIMINATE CONTROVERSIAL 'SPOUSAL RULE.'     The Service has issued final generation-skipping transfer taxregulations (T.D. 8644) under chapter 13 of the code. T.D. 8644adopts with revisions proposed regulations (PS-73-88; PS-32-90)published on December 24, 1992. The final regulations are effectiveDecember 27, 1995.     One notable change concerns the estate tax inclusion period(ETIP). Proposed reg. section 26.2632-1(c)(2)(ii) provided that anETIP existed during the period in which the transferred propertywould have been includable in the transferor's gross estate had thetransferor retained an interest held by the transferor's spouse, butonly to the extent the spouse acquired the interest from thetransferor in an inter vivos transfer that was not included in thetransferor's taxable gifts or for which a deduction was allowed undersection 2523. According to the Service, commentators stated thatthere was no support in the statute for that spousal rule, and anysuch rule would require a legislative change. The final regseliminate the spousal rule and Example 5 of reg. section 26.2632-1(c)(5).     Some of the other more significant revisions involve variousdefinitions. Proposed reg. section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(i) providedgenerally that for purposes of determining whether a transferconstitutes a direct skip, the generation assignment of a person whowould otherwise be a skip person is redetermined by disregarding theintervening generation, if certain individuals have died before thetransfer (for example, a predeceased child of the transferor). Thatsection has been modified to provide that if an individual who is amember of the intervening generation dies no later than 90 days afterthe transfer, the deceased individual is treated as havingpredeceased the transferor, if the governing instrument or applicablestate law provides for that treatment.     Further, reg. section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(ii) has been added toprovide that if a transferor makes an addition to an existing trustafter the death of an individual described in section 26.2612-1(a)(2)(i) (that is, an individual in the intervening generation),the additional property is treated as being held in a separate trustfor purposes of chapter 13.     Other revisions, modifications, and clarifications to theproposed regulations concern the transition rules, the uniformstatutory rule against perpetuities, allocation of the GST exemption,erroneous allocations, the determination of the applicable fraction,the division of a single trust into separate trusts, and theapplication of chapter 13 to nonresident aliens.(T.D. 8644) (60 F.R. 66898-66926)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-16      IRS UPDATES RULES FOR FORM 1040 ONLINE ELECTRONIC FILING.

Proc. 96-20) (1996-4 IRB 1)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-17         SUSPENDED S CORPORATION LOSSES AREN'T TRANSFERABLE.     In technical advice, the Service has ruled that a taxpayer maynot deduct losses disallowed and suspended under section 1366(d)(1)at a time when the taxpayer's former spouse owned the S corporationstock.     The husband and wife separately owned shares of the Scorporation's stock. In a year when the corporation had a loss, aportion of the husband's loss was disallowed at the shareholder levelbecause the loss exceeded his adjusted basis in the stock.     The husband subsequently transferred all of his stock in thecorporation to the wife incident to their divorce. As of that date,the husband had not taken the carried over losses.     For the tax year at issue, the wife deducted the losses carriedover from the year when the husband owned the stock. On audit, thelosses were disallowed because they were associated with stock ownedby the husband and, the IRS agent asserted, could not be transferredto the wife.     Agreeing with the auditing agent, the Service pointed out thatsection 1366(d)(2) provides that any loss disallowed by the basislimitation in section 1366(d)(1) is treated as incurred by thecorporation in the succeeding tax year "with respect to thatshareholder." The use of the words "with respect to thatshareholder," the Service said, requires that losses be personal to ashareholder and that they not be transferred in any manner.     The Service further concluded that section 1041 doesn't changethat result, adding that no gain or loss is recognized on thehusband's transfer of the stock to the wife. The transfer is treatedas a gift, it said, and the wife's basis in the stock is thehusband's adjusted basis at the time of the transfer.(LTR 9552001 (3 pages))     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-18    COMPANY MUST PAY INTEREST ON BACKUP WITHHOLDING TAX LIABILITY.     The Service has ruled in technical advice that a corporation isliable for interest regarding backup withholding tax liabilityimposed by section 3406.     In 1992, the corporation was selected for a Form 1099 compliancecheck for the years 1990 and 1991. At the conclusion of thecompliance check, the IRS examiner proposed assessments for backupwithholding tax liability under section 3406 because the corporationfiled Forms 1099 without taxpayer identification numbers. Also,penalties were assessed under section 6721 for failure to filecorrect Forms 1099 and under section 6722 for failure to furnishcorrect Forms 1099.     Most of the backup withholding tax liability asserted againstthe corporation was abated under section 3402(d); however, interest,penalties, and a portion of the backup withholding tax liability werenot abated. No agreement was reached at the examination level or atIRS Appeals. The IRS district director made a notice and demand forthe assessed taxes and interest.     The Service noted that the corporation would not be liable forinterest if the interest-free adjustment provisions of section 6205applied. If the corporation had satisfied that section's requirementsfor reporting the tax and making a supplemental return, it couldqualify for an adjustment of its backup withholding tax liability.However, the Service pointed out, notice and demand for payment ofthe tax due was made before the filing of the supplemental return (orthe deemed filing of a supplemental return by signing an agreement tothe adjustment). Consequently, under reg. section 31.6205-1(a)(6),the interest-free adjustment provisions of section 6205 don't apply.     Therefore, the Service concluded, regarding the backupwithholding tax that has been abated under section 3402(d), thecorporation is liable for interest for the periods beginning with thedue date of the return for the period in which it was required towithhold, but failed to do so, until the recipient of the reportablepayment satisfied his federal income tax liability for the period atissue. Regarding liability for backup withholding tax that hasn'tbeen abated, the Service said, the corporation is liable for interestfor the periods beginning with the due date of the return for theperiod in which it was required to withhold, but didn't, until itpays the tax, or the recipient pays income tax on the reportableamount, whichever is earlier.(LTR 9552003 (6 pages))     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-19       SELF-UNLOADING FARM VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO EXCISE TAX.     The Service has ruled in technical advice that a self-unloadingautomobile truck body manufactured by a company and sold through itsretail division is subject to the section 4051 excise tax.     The company is in the business of manufacturing agriculturalequipment, including the self-unloading truck body. The body has a V-shaped bottom that the company says was designed to haul farm cargosuch as seed and harvested potatoes. The body has a variable speedunloading conveyer belt and a drive system that may be driven by thetransmission's power take-off. The variable speed function isincorporated into the design of the unloading system to match theunloading speeds required for each type of load that may be carriedby the body. The company's sales literature states that the body maybe used to haul seed, potatoes, beets, and small grains.     In ruling that sales of the truck body were taxable, the Servicepointed out that the exemption provided by section 4053(2) doesn'textend to truck bodies designed for general use, even though thebodies are used to transport farm cargo. To be exempt, it said, abody must be primarily designed to haul seed, feed, or fertilizer toand on farms. The Service found the truck bodies in question to befunctionally similar to those described in Rev. Rul. 75-462, 1975-2C.B. 419, in that they are not primarily designed to haul seed, feed,or fertilizer. Rather, as suggested in the company's salesliterature, the bodies in question are designed for general haulingof farm cargo, in addition to seed, the Service concluded.(LTR 9552002 (3 pages))     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-20 FUND-RAISING ORGANIZATION'S OPERATION OF FISHING FACILITY GIVES RISE                TO UBIT; ROYALTY ARGUMENT IS REJECTED.     The Service has ruled that amounts a section 501(c)(3) fund-raising organization receives in operating fishing facilities at alake are subject to unrelated business income tax.     Under an agreement with an other entity, the exempt organizationis licensed, for a fee, to occupy and use a lake and the adjoiningsupport facilities (a dock), to provide the public with a lake areaspecifically for fishing on alternate weekends, year-round. Theexempt sells fishing passes to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. Activities at the lake are controlled by paid personnelwho operate a ticket office, police the facility, and supervise thedock and boat ramp. General recreation activities, such as picnickingand swimming, are prohibited at the lake.     No apparent charitable activity takes place at the lake. Thefund-raising organization entered the license agreement solely togenerate revenues which, after the payment of expenses, will bedistributed to client social service and welfare agencies.     The Service concluded that payments the exempt receives from thegeneral public for use of the lake are income from an unrelated tradeor business regularly carried on. The Service noted that usage of thelake is similar to any commercial fishing facility. Comparing thearrangement to greens fees paid to play golf, the Service said theadmission fee is a charge for the provision of personal services.(LTR 9552019)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-43    GAO DEEMS 1995 FILING SEASON GOOD -- DESPITE SERIOUS PROBLEMS.     The General Accounting Office has concluded that the IRS had asuccessful 1995 filing season, although the agency still had someserious difficulties, particularly on the public relations front.     Although IRS indicators show that most of the 1995 filing seasongoals were met, the GAO found, anti-fraud initiatives caused muchadverse publicity, taxpayers continued to have serious problemsreaching the IRS on the telephone, and a new document system designedto increase productivity failed to do so.     The GAO praised IRS steps to combat fraud, but said the outcryover the delay of more than 7 million refunds could have been avoidedhad the IRS done a better job of communicating that even taxpayerswith legitimate returns might be subject to a delay.(GAO/GGD-96-48)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-76 IRS ISSUES TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED REGS ON TRANSFERS OF STOCK IN U.S.                CORPORATIONS TO FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.     The Service has issued temporary and proposed regulations (T.D.8638; INTL-9-95) under section 367 concerning transfers of stock orsecurities of domestic corporations by United States persons toforeign corporations pursuant to the code's corporate organization,reorganization, or liquidation provisions. To a large degree, theregulations simply update and coordinate temporary guidance providedsince the relevant statutory changes were enacted in 1984.     Temporary and proposed regulations issued in May 1986 includedsection 1.367(a)-3T, which relates to transfers of stock orsecurities of domestic or foreign corporations by U.S. persons toforeign corporations. The Service modified those regulations inNotice 87-85, 1987-2 C.B. 395. Regulations based on Notice 87-85 wereissued in August 1991, and further guidance was provided in Notice94-46, 1994-1 C.B. 356. The regulations that have been set forth inT.D. 8638 incorporate and modify the rules announced in Notice 94-46.     The positions taken in Notice 94-46 have been modified in twosignificant ways. First, the regulations shift the ownershipthreshold from "50 percent or more" to "more than 50 percent," sothat a U.S. transferor may qualify for an exception to section 367(a)in situations where U.S. transferors, in the aggregate, receiveexactly 50 percent of the stock of the transferee foreign corporationin the exchange.     Second, although the new regulations retain the presumption thatshareholders of the U.S. target company are U.S. persons, generallyit does not retain the cross-ownership presumption or take cross-ownership into account. The Service explained that the regulationscount cross-ownership "only in the limited circumstance where U.S.officers, directors, and 5 percent or greater shareholders of theU.S. target company own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent ofthe total voting power or the total value of the transferee foreigncorporation immediately after the transfer (a control group case)."In such a case, the Service said, the exchange is taxable to all U.S.transferors.(T.D. 8638) (60 F.R. 66739-66746)     Electronic Citation: See 96 TNT 1-77  IRS RELEASES 1988 INTERNAL NOTICE OUTLINING PURPOSE OF LITIGATION                           GUIDELINE MEMOS.

The rules introduced in the 1995 Finance Act aredesigned to bring the taxation of income in such circumstances withinthe scope of the new self assessment system. They apply to rent andother income paid from April 6, 1996.Under the existing rules tenants, broadly, are obliged to withhold taxat the rate of 25 per cent on gross rental income paid to non-residentlandlords. Informal arrangements were possible to pay on a net basiswhere a UK agent was employed and an annual tax return was filed onbehalf of the non-resident landlord.The new regulations set out in detail the obligations of non-residentlandlords, their agents and tenants.Non-residentsThe scheme applies to landlords whose "usual place of abode is outsidethe UK". This unfortunate expression has been continued in the newlegislation and its precise meaning is unclear. Although in somerespects this corresponds broadly with residence for tax purposes, itis not identical. A booklet issued by the Inland Revenue interprets theexpression as follows: It considers individuals who usually liveoutside the UK as being covered by the scheme. This does not includesomeone who is temporarily living outside the UK for six months orless.This does not include someone who is temporarily???? In relation tocompanies, it covers those that have their main office or other placeof business outside the UK.It notes that companies incorporated outside the UK will normally havea usual place of abode outside the UK. Companies which are treated asresident in the UK for tax purposes will not be regarded as having ausual place of abode outside the UK. It also notes that the scheme doesnot apply to the rental income of UK branches of non-residentcompanies.Trustees are regarded as having a usual place of abode outside the UKif all the trustees have a usual place of abode outside the UK.The Inland Revenue booklet notes that normally where a person istreated as non-UK resident for tax purposes they will have a usualplace of abode outside the UK. It is clear however that the twoconcepts are not viewed by the Inland Revenue as being identical.Tax BaseThe regulations require prescribed persons to deduct tax at the basicrate from UK rental income, pay the tax quarterly to the Inland Revenueand submit annual information returns setting out income expenses andtax deducted. The basic rate from April 6, 1996 is 24 per cent.Letting agentsPrimary liability rests with letting agents. These are defined in thelegislation as persons who act on behalf of the non-resident inconnection with the management or administration of its UK propertyrental business.A statement by the Inland Revenue in a recent tax bulletin indicatesthat they view this as a wide definition which includes those who actin an informal manner such as friends or relatives as well asprofessionals such as estate agents who collect rent. It does not coverbanks who merely provide accounts into which the income is paid.In addition it applies to agents only if they handle or control UKrental income on behalf of the non-resident. Therefore, accountants whodo no more than prepare accounts and tax returns or agents who merelyfind tenants in return for fees without collecting any rent are notincluded.Persons who provide legal services are specifically excluded. Thiscovers solicitors recovering arrears of rent or receiving apportionedrents in the course of a sale of property. If, however, solicitorscollect the first payment of rent after drawing up the lease they willbe covered because that is viewed as going beyond the provision oflegal advice or services.TenantsWhere there is no letting agent the tenant must operate the scheme inmost cases. Tenants who pay rent of #100 per week or less are excludedunless served with a notice from the Inland Revenue to operate thescheme.In either case the withholding person is required to register with theInland Revenue. Tax is paid to the Inland Revenue quarterly.In the case of letting agents tax is deducted against:- all Schedule A income, plus- other Schedule A income paid away by the tenant in the quarter at theletting agents direction, less- expenses paid in the quarter which the agent can reasonably besatisfied are allowable expenses of the non-resident landlord.If expenses in the quarter exceed income received then the agent maycarry back surplus expenses to earlier quarters in the same year endedat March 31 taking later quarters before earlier ones. Any surplusexpenses not used in this manner may be carried forward to futurequarters including those in a later year.In the case of tenants, tax is calculated on:- Schedule A income paid in the quarter to the non-resident landlord,plus- Schedule A income paid to a third party not being a payment they canreasonably be satisfied is an allowable expense of the landlord.Tenants must show the tax due on a quarterly return submitted withpayment within 30 days of the end of the quarter. In the case ofletting agents they will both return and pay in respect of all non-resident landlords they represent. As tenants calculate tax on amountspaid there is no carry back of surplus expenses.Schedule A BusinessIncome from property underwent a significant reform in the 1995 FinanceAct (see FTWTR December 1994 page 228). Schedule A business essentiallycomprises all property rental and the scheme covers income received byor within the control of a letting agent or where there is no lettingagent, amounts paid by a tenant. It includes all annual profits orgains arising from any land in the UK including income from the lettingor licensing of any furnished or unfurnished property and any premiumschargeable as income rent charges ground rents etc.Deductible expensesThe test for deductibility is now similar to that in relation totrading activities. Expenses are those which the agent or tenant can bereasonably satisfied are allowable in computing the profits of the non-residents Schedule A business paid by the agent or the tenant. TheInland Revenue proposes to publish guidance notes on this subject. Ifthe guidance notes are followed there will be no penalty for deductingexpenses which ultimately turn out not to be deductible.They have warned where agents are unable to satisfy themselves whetheran expense is deductible, for example where there is insufficientinformation about the purpose of the expenditure, they should notdeduct it.Payment without deduction of taxThe regulations make provision for non-residents to receive rentalincome without deduction of tax. Application may be made which whenapproved will permit agents or tenants to pay without deduction of tax.This may be allowed where the non-residents' UK tax affairs are up todate or where they have never had any UK tax obligations or where theydo not expect to be liable to UK income tax (for example where expenseswill likely exceed income).In each case they must undertake to comply with all their UKobligations including filing of all returns and paying tax due on time.The Inland Revenue will give reasons for any refusal and an appeal maybe made against such a refusal. Agents and tenants will be notified ofthe obligation to resume withholding if the approval is withdrawn.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996TRANSFER PRICING - UNITED STATES COST SHARING REGULATIONSCode S482 was amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to require thatconsideration for the use of intangible property transferred in acontrolled transaction must be commensurate with the income generatedby the item of intangible property. Congress did not intend to precludemultinational groups from entering into bona fide research anddevelopment cost sharing arrangements as an appropriate method ofallocating income attributable to intangibles among related parties.The IRS issued a study of intercompany pricing in 1988 known as "theWhite Paper". The White Paper suggested that most bona fide costsharing arrangements should have certain provisions.For example, cost sharing arrangements should cover all research withina particular three-digit SIC code, most participants should be assignedexclusive geographic rights in developed intangibles (and should beable to predict benefits and divide costs accordingly), and marketingintangibles should be excluded from bona fide cost sharingarrangements.The IRS issued proposed cost sharing regulations in 1992.The final regulations issued in December 1995 define a cost sharingarrangement as an agreement for sharing costs in proportion toreasonably anticipated benefits from the individual exploitation ofinterests in the intangibles that are developed. Although a taxpayermust satisfy certain formal requirements to contend that a cost sharingarrangement exists, the IRS may apply the cost sharing rules to anyarrangement that in substance constitutes a cost sharing arrangement.For a US-based company, this could result in a loss of R&D deductions.The final regulations provide that neither a qualified cost sharingarrangement nor an arrangement treated in substance as such, will betreated as a partnership. Moreover, a foreign participant will not betreated as being engaged in a trade or business within the US solely byvirtue of its participation in such an arrangement.The final regulations emphasize the move away from a strict use ofnumeric ratios in measuring the sharing of costs with the anticipatedbenefits. Thus, for example, no allocation will be made with respect toa qualified cost sharing arrangement, except to make each controlledparticipant's share of the intangible development costs equal to itsshare of reasonably anticipated benefits.Similarly, in listing the requirements for qualification, the finalregulations provide that the arrangement must provide a method tocalculate each controlled participant's share of intangible developmentcosts based on factors that can reasonably be expected to reflectanticipated benefits. The new standard is intended to ensure that costsharing arrangements will not be disregarded by the IRS as long as thefactors upon which an estimate of benefits was based were reasonable,even if the estimate proves inaccurate.As under the proposed regulations, a cost sharing arrangement must beset forth in writing and contain a number of specified provisions,including the interest that each controlled participant will havereceived in any intangibles developed, referred to as "coveredintangibles". If the research results in the development of intangibleproperty that was not foreseen at the inception of the cost sharingarrangement, the property is also included as a covered intangible.The final regulations permit participation by unrelated persons,referred to as "uncontrolled participants", in a cost sharingagreement. Controlled taxpayers may be participants, referred to as"controlled participants", provided that they use or reasonably expectto use covered intangibles in the active conduct of a trade orbusiness. An entity that chiefly provides services as a contractresearcher may not be a controlled participant. However, nothingprevents a service entity such as a contract researcher from furnishingresearch and development services to the members of a qualified costsharing arrangement in return for appropriate consideration.As under the proposed regulations, the activity of another person maybe attributed to a controlled taxpayer for purposes of meeting theactive conduct requirement. However, the standard has changed. In theproposed regulations, the controlled taxpayer merely had to bear therisk and receive the benefits of the attributed activity. Under thefinal regulations the attribution will be made only where thecontrolled taxpayer exercises substantial managerial and operationalcontrol over the attributed activities. Thus, a shell entity isunlikely to qualify for participation.The final regulations define intangible development costs as operatingexpenses other than depreciation and amortization expense, and an arm'slength charge for tangible property made available to cost sharingarrangements. As under the proposed regulations, the IRS may adjust thepool of costs shared in order to properly reflect costs that relate tothe intangible development area.The final regulations define anticipated benefits as additional incomegenerated or costs saved by the use of covered intangibles. The pool ofbenefits may also be adjusted in order to properly reflect benefitsthat relate to the intangible development area. Anticipated benefits ofuncontrolled participants will be excluded.A share of reasonably anticipated benefits will be determined using themost reliable estimate of benefits. This rule echoes the best methodrule for determining the most reliable measure of an arm's lengthresult under the substantive transfer pricing regulations. Thereliability of an estimate of benefits principally depends on twofactors; the reliability of the basis for measuring benefits used andthe reliability of the projections used.The cost to operating income ratio used in the proposed regulations tocheck the reasonableness of an effort to share costs in proportion toanticipated benefits is deleted from the final regulations. Instead, anallocation of costs or income may be made if the taxpayer did not usethe most reliable estimate of benefits. That determination will dependon the facts and circumstances of each case. The most reliable basisfor measuring anticipated benefits must be used and the measurementbasis must be consistent for all controlled participants. Theregulations provide that benefits may be measured directly orindirectly.In addition, regardless of whether a direct or indirect basis ofmeasurement is employed, it may be necessary to make adjustments toaccount for material differences in the activities that controlledparticipants perform in connection with exploitation of coveredintangibles, such as between wholesale and retain distribution.Indirect bases for measuring benefits may include units of production,sales, operating profit and any other factor that bears a relationshipto benefits.The final regulations provide that projections used to estimatebenefits must include a projection of the time over which benefits willbe received and a projection of the benefits anticipated for each yearin the period. A significant divergence between projected and actualbenefit shares may indicate that the projections were not reliable. Asignificant divergence is defined as divergence in excess of 20 percent between projected and actual benefit shares.If there is a significant divergence, which is not due to anunforeseeable event, the IRS may use actual benefits as the mostreliable basis for measuring benefits. Conversely, no allocation willbe made based on a divergence that is not considered significant aslong as the estimate is made using the most reliable basis formeasuring benefits. For purposes of the 20 per cent test, all non UScontrolled participants are treated as a single controlled participantin order that a divergence by a foreign controlled participant with avery small share of the total costs will not necessarily trigger anallocation.A taxpayer receiving a cost sharing payment must reduce its researchand development expense. The final regulations adopt a net approach tofoster simplicity and preserve the character of items actually incurredby a participant to the extent not reimbursed.Any payment that in substance constitutes a cost sharing payment willbe treated as such, regardless of its characterization under foreignlaw. This rule is intended to enable foreign entities to participate incost sharing arrangements with US controlled participants even ifforeign law does not recognise cost sharing.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996KATZ COMMISSION ON TAX REFORMThe Katz Commission of Inquiry into tax reform (see FTWTR January 1995p3) released their Third Interim Report in December 1995.The thrust of the First Interim Report was that the Revenueadministration had to be restructured to ensure effective revenuecollection and to make meaningful tax reform possible.In an announcement at the end of 1995, the Government accepted most ofthe Commission's recommendations on administrative reform. Theseinclude the establishment of a combined Inland Revenue and Customsauthority with a greater degree of independence than before. Theeffectiveness of collection is expected to improve almost immediately.The longer term benefit will only be realised over several years.Several recommendations are not final in this report, althoughimportant indications of future developments are recorded.Retirement SavingsThe most comprehensive recommendation in the Third Interim Report isfor retirement funds to be brought into the tax net. This deviates fromthe decades long South African formula of deductible contributions topension funds, exempt build-up in the funds, and taxability on payout.The Commission recommended a 30 per cent flat rate tax on normaltaxable income in the funds. The recommendations are motivated by twoconsiderations. First, assets of some R500 billion, an appreciable partof the economy, are controlled through these funds; over the years thishas brought about a massive, structural inducement to arbitrage betweenthe taxable and exempt sectors of the economy. Second, the retirementindustry has enjoyed a degree of fiscal privilege which is viewed asincompatible with other priorities in a democratic society.The current tax exemption for payments from public sector funds shoulddisappear. Differences in tax treatment between pension, provident, andbenefit funds are to be removed, especially those concerningdeductibility of contributions. Limitations on deductibility are to beeased. Lump-sum payouts are to be taxed at progressive rates withreference to a capital sum; thereafter pensions, whether in lump sum orthrough annuity, will be untaxed. Transitional measures are proposed toensure that no vested rights are affected. The Commission has expressedthe view that at least some of the additional tax collected should beapplied towards relief in the income tax area.Business Tax IssuesCorporate profits - The report expresses a preference over the longerterm for an imputation type system, but finds that currentadministrative capacity and the likely lesser sophistication of anemerging corporate sector militate against real progress at this time.The current system of a Secondary Tax on Companies (STC) shouldtherefore be retained; however, the STC rate of 25 per cent ondistributed profits has a distortionary effect and should be reduced tosomething like 15 per cent.Several more detailed measures are proposed to streamline the STC. Noneaffect the basic principle that STC is an additional tax on companiesupon distribution and dividends are untaxed in the hands of recipients.The Commission noted the acceptance by the UK authorities of the STC asa creditable tax for treaty purposes and an apparent acceptance by theJapanese authorities that the tax will qualify for foreign tax creditpurposes.The Commission took cognisance of the fact that the STC is notcurrently enforced against foreign businesses operating in South Africain the form of a branch. After rejecting a branch profits tax theCommission recommended that this tax be abolished for branches ratherthan to be retained and not enforced.Group Taxation - South Africa currently has no general group taxsystem. Each corporate entity is regarded as a separate taxpayer. TheCommission strongly criticised this and recommends introduction of anelective group basis of taxation. In view of expected administrativedeficiencies, it proposes a gradual introduction.Initially a group will be defined as involving only 100 per centaffiliations (employee shares excepted). Losses carried forward intothe new system will not be allowed against group profits. Initiallyonly current year losses will be dealt with on a group basis. Theintention is to extend the degree of full consolidation grouptreatment.Share Incentives - The Commission did not favour sweeping incentives toencourage employee share ownership. It did recommend a system ofdeferral on the fringe benefit tax consequences of employer assistedfinance for the acquisition of employer shares. It also recommendedthat, proper dealers apart, it should be made clear that employees willnot be taxed on gains on employer shares.Anti Avoidance - The current general anti-avoidance provision in theIncome Tax Act (Section 103) provides the taxpayer with two maindefences - namely that the transactions in question did not have a taxadvantage as sole or main objective and that they did not create rightsand obligations abnormal within the relevant circumstances. The lattertest has been increasingly interpreted by the courts as subjective, toa point where it became very difficult to attack certain avoidanceschemes. The Commission proposed that the abnormality test should bescrapped in favour of a bona fide business purpose test.This will apply in all business situations. Private family transactionswill continue to be governed by a normality requirement. The Commissionsuggested that the provisions should not apply where it could be shownthat the transaction would not result in misuse of the Income Tax Act.Other Levies - The Commission strongly criticised the current RegionalServices Council Levies (low-rate levies on payroll and turnover), butstopped short of recommending their abolition, mainly because theirfate could best be decided by the Financial and Fiscal Commission - abody charged with adjudicating funding as between the variousprovinces.It favoured abolishing the financial services levy on financialinstitutions in favour of including all fee based financial servicesunder the VAT net.It recommended abolition of the marketable securities tax on sharetransfers on the stock exchange, and similar stamp duties on othertransactions.Other MattersCapital Gains Tax - The Commission recommended against a capital gainstax at this time. The benefits would not justify the cost, effort andcomplexity; such a tax is not a priority. The Commission did recommendthat, should a capital gains tax ever be considered, assets would haveto be assigned a benchmark date value which would then not be subjectto the tax.Instead, the Commission recommended continuation of the donations taxand estate duty, although they could be merged into a new capitaltransfer tax.Land Tax - Study into the feasibility of a land tax continues. Insofaras South Africa already taxes municipal property on a local governmentlevel, such a tax will mainly affect rural land. The Commission hasalready indicated that a land tax on the national level would be veryunlikely, but scope remains for such a tax on a local or regionallevel. Further recommendations will be made in due course.Taxpayer rights - The Commission proposed that the administrationarticulate certain basic rights for taxpayers. In its First InterimReport it has listed a number of provisions in the current law whichwould probably fall foul of the Interim Constitution regarding basicrights and administrative fairness.In this report they proposed a Statement of Taxpayer Rights. Thisstatement will not constitute a legal Bill of Rights.Implementing these principles will be a function of specificlegislation, Codes of Practice, intervention by the existing PublicProtector and a tax specific ombudsman.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EUROPEAN UNION: TRANSIT CHARGE UNDER PRIVATE CONTRACTThe European Court of Justice has ruled on the question as to whether atransit charge payable under a private contract has equivalent effectto a customs duty and is therefore illegal under European law in Eduardde Bois et Fils SA and General Cargo Services v Garanor ExploitationSA.Garanor managed an international road station and brought proceedingsagainst two customers for non-payment of a contractually agreed chargeknown as a "taxe de passage" (transit charge). The appellants wereforwarding agents and recognised as such by the customs authority. Inaddition to paying rent to the respondent for premises at aninternational road station where customs clearance operations arenormally completed, they paid a flat rate transit charge for eachvehicle in international transit calculated on the basis of monthlyreturns by the appellants.The charge was intended to cover expenses of the respondent in respectof the performance by the customs and veterinary services of theirtasks as providers of services in the public interest.The Court ruled that the charge is illegal under European law if it isdesigned to compensate a private undertaking for bearing costs arisingfrom the performance of services in the public interest even if theyhave not been imposed by the state but arise from an agreementconcluded by that undertaking with its customers.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EUROPEAN UNION: VAT ON RESEARCH PROGRAMMESIn response to a Parliamentary question, Commissioner Monti hasconfirmed that under the Protocol on the privileges and immunities ofthe European Community as reflected in Article 15(10) of the Sixth VATDirective, goods and services supplied to the Commission are exemptfrom VAT, either directly or by means of a subsequent refund of tax.He said that the Commission is anxious to ensure that organisationswhich participate in Community funded research and technologicaldevelopment programmes receive equal treatment under the common VATsystem. It will therefore monitor the situation carefully takingappropriate measures as necessary.The question raised concern that if individual universities andresearch organisations have to reclaim VAT from the British Government,they will find it almost impossible to do so if the Commission does notintend to change the policy of globally claiming VAT on researchprogrammes from member state governments.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996EUROPEAN UNION: DELAY IN DEFINITIVE VAT REGIME LIKELYIn response to a question in the European parliament the taxationcommissioner Mr Mario Monti has refused to give an assurance that thedefinitive system for VAT will enter into force on January 1, 1997 asstated in article 28 of the sixth VAT directive.The directive was amended in 1991 to introduce a transitionalarrangement for a period of four years which is to expire on December31, 1996. A final or definitive system was to enter into forcethereafter which was proposed to embrace the original system. Thisenvisages tax imposed in the country of origin of goods or servicesonly with input tax being claimed by business customers in the countryof destination based on the tax charged in the country of origin.The transitional arrangements are however automatically extended untilthe definitive system enters into effect.Reasons given by the commission for the delay are the amount of workdone and the recent enlargement of the EU. They view it as unlikelythat the deadline will be met.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BELGIUM: WEALTH TAX HINTMr Elio di Rupo, the deputy prime minister of Belgium, has raised thepossibility of introducing a wealth tax and a "generalised sociallevy", as a way of taking some of the pain out of spending cuts in thisyear's budget.Belgium already has high tax rates, but the government needs to raiserevenues to plug the budget deficit.Mr di Rupo said: "The problem of social security will not be solvedonly acting on the spending side and asking exclusively for an effortfrom those who benefit from various social benefits".Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FRANCE: FINANCE AMENDMENT LAW 1996The Finance Amendment Law finally adopted by Parliament on December 21,1995 has been submitted to the Constitutional Council ("ConseilConstitutionnel"). Its entry into force depends on publication in the"Journal Officiel" and the approval of the Constitutional Council.Simplified Declaration SystemSmall or medium companies may be taxed under a special regime calledthe simplified declaration tax system. Such companies may keepsimplified accounts and report their income on a simplified return. Thescope of application of this system has changed.Previously, companies with annual turnover not exceeding Fr 3,800,000for sales and lodging or Fr 1,100,000 for services, qualified for thesimplified system.Under the new law, the thresholds are increased to Fr 5,000,000 forsales and lodging and Fr 1,500,000 for services. The simplified regimewill now concern 60,000 to 70,000 companies representing 8 per cent ofthose taxed under the normal regime.The thresholds first apply to 1995 personal income tax, to corporateincome tax for tax years closed at December 31, 1995 and from January1, 1996 for VAT.VATThe new law mainly enacts the second VAT Simplification Directive95/7/EEC of April 10, 1995.The transposition concerns operations of jobbing, ("travail a facon")which are now treated as services; the territoriality of work andexpert evaluation on personal tangible property and transportation ofapproach; the basis of taxation on import; suspensive customs regimesand export procedure by sales notes.Other VAT provisions which do not derive from the second simplificationDirective include a new simplified form of tax representation forcertain operations where no VAT is due in France.PropertyAccording to article 1115 of the French Tax Code (CGI), the purchase ofproperty by professional real property dealers is subject toregistration duty reduced from 18.6 per cent to 0.6 per cent if thedealer undertakes to sell the property within four years from the dateof acquisition.Because of the crisis in the property market, the 1992 financeamendment bill extended the deadline for sale to December 31, 1996 forproperty acquired before January 1, 1993.The new law extends this for a further two years to December 31, 1998.It also introduces a reduced tax rate for sales made between January 1,1999 and December 31, 2001 as follows:- sales in 1999 - 75 per cent- sales in 2000 - 50 per cent- sales in 2001 - 25 per centThe tax is due in the month following the sale.Sales benefitting from reduced tax are not subject to the 6 per centadditional duty. This is normally due by dealers who do not comply withtheir undertaking to sell within 4 years.Interest on late payment at 0.75 per cent per month, remains. Itapplies from expiry of the period during which the sale should havebeen made.Contribution of property realised from January 1, 1996 is not to beconsidered as a sale for the application of article 1115 of the CGI.Professional IncomeUnder article 93 of the CGI, the taxation of professional income is inprinciple determined on a cash basis. Professional income comprises noncommercial income of professionals such as doctors or lawyers.However, the tax administration accepts the accrual basis at thetaxpayers' request.The accrual system option is now provided by law and must be exercisedbefore February 1 of a given year.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FRANCE: TAX LAUNCH DELAYEDThe French government, under pressure from leaders of its own centre-right majority, postponed for a month the launch of a new tax designedto wipe out welfare deficits. "The contribution for the reimbursementof the social deficit will apply from February 1, 1996" instead ofJanuary 1, the Labour Ministry said.A former budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a member of the rulingRPR party, and a centrist former defence minister, Mr Francois Leotard,had urged the government to delay the new 0.5 per cent income tax for ayear, saying the economy was too fragile to sustain it.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GERMANY: TREATY OVERRIDEGerman bilateral tax treaties which eliminate German taxation onforeign enterprises have allowed activities in Germany both without taxand the bother of tax formalities. In the last few years domestic lawamendments have changed the whole situation.Section 50d of the income tax act (Einkommensteurergesetz, Estg) hasbeen amended three times in the last three years. It now requirespayments subject to German withholding tax to be made without regard toany tax treaty or the provisions implementing the EU parent-subsidiarydirective. The foreign creditor may only claim a refund of tax withheldif he can prove that he is entitled to the treaty or EU benefit. Undercertain circumstances the debtor may apply to the competent authority(the Bundesame fur Finanzen) for approval not to withhold tax.If the foreign creditor is a company, the tax authorities may deny itthe exemption if the shareholders personally would not be entitled tothe tax exemption and if there are no economically convincing reasonsfor using the company and the company has no commercial activities ofits own.The importance of these provisions has grown because obligations towithhold have been broadened. Previously, only licence fees, dividendsand similar profits were subject to withholding. Now the proceeds fromthe sales of enterprises, real property and patents are subject towithholding. The tax authorities require withholding on gross paymentsrather than net profits.These rules and the approach of the tax authorities have been widelyregarded as not conforming to treaty obligations and EU law. Inparticular, treaty exemption of profits from commercial activities andthe parent/subsidiary directive's abolition of withholding taxes seemcontrary to the provisions.The tax authorities emphasise that the rules and their application areonly onerous for German debtors and therefore do not discriminateagainst foreign enterprises.A number of cases have now focused on the issues. The first importantdecision of the Federal Tax Court (Bundesfinanzhof) was published in1995. In a further decision in 1995 the Federal Tax Court has confirmedand made clear its position.The Federal tax court did not discuss the conflict with treaties butpointed out that treaties are implemented by national legislation.National legislation may be amended and overturned by furtherlegislation. This is what happened in the case of section 50d Estgaccording to the Federal Tax Court. The consequences for contractingstates may be discussed between the governments but are not to beregarded by the court according to German doctrine on publicinternational law.In German tax law the practical approach has been different. It isassumed that domestic tax law is not intended to infringe internationallaw. Domestic law and treaties are therefore to be interpreted so thattreaties could prevail over national law or that domestic law not beread as contradicting a treaty. This is supported by section 2 of theAct on Tax Procedure (Abgabenordunung), which gives a provision derivedfrom a tax treaty precedence before a provision of purely national law.The latest court decision overturns the traditional method ofinterpretation and will encourage the treaty overriding legislationwhich Germany has recently begun to enact.The decision only deals with a question under a bilateral treaty.Conformity with EU law still has to be discussed.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996GERMANY: JOBS THROUGH TAX BREAKSGermany plans to encourage new business creation and give taxconcessions to small and medium sized enterprises as part of aprogramme to boost employment, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's financeminister, said on December 10, 1995."We are doing everything to encourage business start-ups and we want asensible company tax reform," he said in an interview with theFinancial Times.As part of a "symmetrical finance policy" that reduces the governmentdeficit and taxes in parallel, Mr Waigel said he wanted to get rid ofGermany's wealth tax and the local trading capital tax, a levy thattaxes companies even when they do not make a profit.He also wanted to blunt the impact of local profit taxes on small andmedium sized companies by lowering initial tax rates and givingconcessions to companies building up financial reserves."The government does its duty if it consolidates the budget and triesto cut those taxes and levies within its power," he said.

According to article 13, paragraph1, these costs are not deductible, unless the owner can demonstratethat they contribute to profits which are taxable in the Netherlands.This rule may prove to be a serious problem for a Netherlands companywhich acquires a minority participation in a concern which is activeboth in the Netherlands and in other countries. The company may havedifficulties acquiring the information required to demonstrate that thecosts it incurred with respect to said participation contribute toprofits taxable in the Netherlands.To accommodate companies which find themselves in this situation, theUndersecretary of Finance recently stated that these costs areconsidered to be incurred with respect to profits taxable in theNetherlands if the minority participation has a "sufficient"substantial relation with the Netherlands. This may be the case if theNetherlands' business activities of the company in which theparticipation is held are "material" in relation to the total businessactivities of the concern of which that company is a part.According to the Undersecretary, costs incurred with respect to aminority participation will be deductible if:- the company in which a minority participation is acquired is aresident of the Netherlands and conducts business activities in theNetherlands. This includes Netherlands resident subsidiaries, in whichthat company has an interest of at least 25 per cent;- the business activities conducted in the Netherlands are material inrelation to the whole of business activities conducted by the concernof which the Netherlands companies are a part;- the acquiring company, together with related companies, does not owna controlling interest (25 per cent or more) in the participation.The meaning of "material" is undefined since, depending on the specificcircumstances of a case, different factors may be decisive with regardto the question whether the business activities have a sufficientrelation with the Netherlands. However, the Undersecretary did indicatethat, although no fixed percentage can be assumed, 5 or 10 per cent maybe considered material.Given the important role of the participation exemption the letter hasimportant practical implications. Unfortunately, since the "material"criterion is not explained in detail, it is not quite certain what theexact range of approval is.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NETHERLANDS: CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATEUntil January 1, 1996, Netherlands corporate income tax was levied at40 per cent on profits up to Dfl 100,000, and 35 per cent on theexcess.

The results are morefavourable and represent several relaxations. In particular,individuals can remain overseas for periods of up to 10 years or longerwith agreement.

The principle that a non-UK incorporated company is residentwhere its central management and control is exercised is based on ahandful of decisions the most recent of which is nearly 40 years oldand the majority of which are over 80 years old.The two companies in question were subsidiaries of a UK resident parentcompany. One was formed for the purpose of receiving the purchase pricewhen the UK parent purchased a company and assumed its debts.Two of the directors were resident in Bermuda and were executives in acompany which managed the day-to-day affairs of the offshore company. Athird was a Jersey resident solicitor. Board meetings were held two orthree times a year in Bermuda attended by the two Bermuda directors. Noadvance notice of board meetings was given and no agenda was circulatedalthough the Jersey director was kept informed of what was decided.The company's business was the making of loans to other members of theparent company's group at the request of the parent company.The second company remained dormant for some five years and thereafterparticipated in the financial dealings of the first. It was managed byaccountants in Guernsey. Two of the directors were residents of Sarkwhere the board meetings were held.The Inland Revenue argued that the boards of both subsidiaries merelyrubber stamped decisions which had been made by the parent and had notaddressed their minds as to what they were being asked to do. They didnot really make decisions. While documentation was made in Bermuda thedecisions were taken in London.They also argued that if, on the facts, a local board submitted todirection from outside then that was central management and controlledfrom outside. It was insufficient to go through the forms of corporategoverning where in fact decisions purportedly taken by a subsidiariesboard were taken at the direction of a parent. They argued that itcould not sensibly be said that the boards were making the decisionsand that in reality they were taken by the parent.The Commissioners identified the following principles based on existingcases:- The Company was resident where the directors met and transacted theirbusiness and exercised the powers conferred upon them;- If the directors met in two places the Company's business was whereits real business was carried on and the real business was carried onwhere the central management and control actually abided;- A determination as to whether a case fell within that rule was purelya question of fact to be determined by a scrutiny of the course ofbusiness and trading;- The actual management and not the place where a company ought to bemanaged determined its residence;- It was an exceptional case for a parent company to exert control forits subsidiaries as a parent usually operated through the boards of itssubsidiaries;- Although a board might do what it was told to it did not follow thatthe control and management of the company lay with another so long asthe board exercised their discretion when coming to decisions and wouldhave refused to carry out an improper or unwise transaction; and- When deciding the issue one should stand back from the detail andconsider the picture which the whole of the evidence presented.On these principles the Commissioners found that although thesubsidiaries were complacent to do the will of the parent they didactually function in giving effect to the parents' wishes. Proposalswere discussed at board meetings and decisions were made by thedirectors in the best interests of the Company. They would have refusedto carry out any proposal which was improper or unreasonable. Theparent did not control the board in the exercise of their powers. Itcould have taken steps to remove the directors but could not controlthem in their conduct of the business. The companies were thereforeresident in Bermuda and Sark respectively.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED KINGDOM: WITHHOLDING TAX RATESThe Inland Revenue has issued a press release to clarify the rates oftax withheld at source following the budget of November 29, 1995. Thebasic rate of income tax was reduced from 25 to 24 per cent. Generally,withholding has been at the basic rate. However certain rates of tax onpassive income have also been reduced to 20 per cent. As a result theprincipal withholding tax rates from April 6, 1996 will be as in thetable below.20% ratePayment- Interest paid by banks, building societies and other deposit-takers- Interest on UK Government and other securities- Interest distributions by authorised unit trusts- Other annual interest payable under deduction of tax- Purchased life annuities (income element)- Certain payments made by paying and collecting agents24% rate- Annual payments (including charges on income, such as payments underdeeds of covenant to charities, and distributions by unauthorised unittrusts)- Other annuities (where PAYE does not apply)- Rents paid to non-resident landlords- Patent royalties- Payments to foreign entertainers and sportsmen (subject to anyapplication for a reduced tax payments)Income treated as paid under deduction of taxCertain income is treated as though tax has been deducted from it butthe tax is not repayable.

In December, thePresident vetoed the balanced budget bill passed by both Houses ofCongress. The bill contained major tax reform proposals. Subsequently,the Administration offered its seven year balanced budget proposal,relying on significant tax increases to offset middle class tax relief.Included among the revenue raisers are the Administration'sexpatriation tax as modified by the Senate (all gains of expatriateswould be taxed upon expatriation, rather than the proposal adopted byCongress involving a 10 year extension of US tax jurisdiction inconnection with the sale of US assets), and the foreign grantor trustproposals. Other revenue raisers in the Administration's plan include:- A reduction in the dividends received deduction available tocorporations, from 70 per cent to 50 per cent thereby increasing tax onintercompany dividends from a maximum rate of 10.5 per cent to amaximum rate of 17.5 per cent.- Treatment of preferred stock as boot in corporate organizations andreorganizations, forcing recognition of gain on the receipt ofpreferred shares as consideration for the transfer of property.Conditions similar to those that appear in the anti-conduit regulationswould have to be met for the provision to apply. Those conditionsestablish a standard under which an equity transaction hascharacteristics of debt.-  The conversion of a C Corporation to S Corporation status would be ataxable event for any corporation that has a value in excess of US $5million.- Limiting replacement personal property received in like kindexchanged to property located in the US.-  Limiting the net operating loss carryback period to one year, butextending the carryover period to 20 years.- Creating a new class of Subpart F income for notional principalcontracts and including income from the lending of securities asSubpart F income.- Treating certain corporate redemptions that would be affordedfavourable dividend treatment in the hands of a corporation underexisting law as capital gain transactions. For a corporation, capitalgains are subject to higher tax rates than intercompany dividends.- Limiting interest expense deductions for corporations in connectionwith the issuance of debt which (i) had a maturity in excess of 40years or (ii) provides for the payment of interest in the form ofshares of the corporation.In addition, the Administration proposes to loosen the rules applicableto captive insurance companies so that premiums paid to captives willbe treated as insurance if more than 50 per cent of the captive's netpremium income relates to the insurance of risks of unrelated persons.The Administration also proposes to modify the rules applicable todomestic corporations operating in Puerto Rico and claiming benefitsunder Code S936.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED STATES: REGULATIONS FOR PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPSOrdinarily, a partnership is not considered to be a separate entity forpurposes of computing taxable income. Rather, under the aggregatetheory of partnerships, a partnership is treated as a flow through toits partners, who are generally deemed to receive the income and incurthe expenses booked by the partnership. Nonetheless, in somecircumstances, a partnership may be treated by financial markets as theequivalent of a publicly traded corporation.In 1987, Code S7704 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted to providecorporate treatment for publicly traded partnerships. This means that aseparate level of tax is due from the partnership and the partnershiploses its status as a pass-through to its partners. Existing entitieswere given a 10 year carryover before the new rules were to becomeeffective.Under the statute, a partnership is a publicly traded partnership ifinterests in it are traded on an established securities market or arereadily tradeable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalentthereof. Final regulations have been adopted implementing the statute.Under the final regulations, an established securities market includesa national securities exchange registered under section 6 of theSecurities Exchange Act 1934 or a national securities exchange which isregulated under the laws of its place or organization.Partnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market or thesubstantial equivalent. If, under all the facts and circumstances, thepartners are readily able to buy, sell or exchange their partnershipinterests in a manner that is comparable economically, to trading on anestablished securities market.The regulations contain a number of safe harbour exceptions. Under thefirst safe harbour, certain transactions are expressly disregarded indetermining whether partnership interests are readily tradeable on asecondary market. These transactions include traders in which carryoverbasis exists, either from a transferor of the partnership interest orresulting from a distribution from a partnership, transfers at death,transfers among family members, the issuance of partnership interestsin exchange for cash, property or services, distributions from aqualified retirement plan or by an individual retirement account.Second, a transfer that is pursuant to a redemption agreement nototherwise described above will be disregarded in determining whetherpartnership interests are readily tradeable on a secondary market orthe substantial equivalent thereof if certain conditions are in placeto prevent the redemption and a potential issuance of a comparableinterest in a transaction that follows closely in time.Under the third safe harbour, transfers effected through a qualifiedmatching service which match lists of intended sellers and potentialpurchasers will be disregarded.Finally, private placements are disregarded. To constitute a privateplacement under the final regulations, all partnership interests musthave been issued in a transaction that was not required to beregistered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the partnership mustnot have more than 100 partners at any time during the tax year.The final regulations provide rules of application for the foregoingprovisions. If a transaction does not fall within a specific safeharbour, the transaction is not presumed to be a trade of a partnershipinterest on an exchange or on a secondary market or the equivalentthereof. Thus, no presumption arises as to the effect of thetransaction. Taxpayers are free to argue that the particular facts andcircumstances relating to a transfer of a partnership interest are notsufficient to cause the interest from being sold on the substantialequivalent of a secondary market. If the sum of the partnership capitalor profits interests transferred during the year, exclusive oftransactions covered by any of the safe harbours, does not exceed 2 percent of the total interests in partnership capital or profits, thepartnership is not a publicly traded partnership. Finally, if thegeneral partner and related entities own more than 10 per cent of thecapital or profits interests at any time during the year, allpercentage computations are to be made exclusive of the interests ownedby the general partners and related entities.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED STATES: NEW SOURCE REGULATIONS PROPOSEDThe source of income is an important concept under US tax law. For USentities, the source rules control the computation of the foreign taxcredit limitation. For foreign entities, the source rule frequently iscrucial in determining whether the US has jurisdiction to tax. CodeS863(b) controls the source of income that arises when a companyengages in income producing activities in more than one location.In December, the IRS proposed revised regulations under Code S863(b).Under the proposal, taxpayers are to use the apportionment method todetermine the source of the income when inventory is manufactured inone country and sold in another country. Under this method, 50 per centof the income is sourced in the place where the sale occurs and 50 percent is sourced in the place where the production assets are located.The existing regulations are not limited to production assets and thereference in the proposed regulations reflects a targeted approach tothe types of assets that are taken into account in the computation. Aproduction asset is any tangible or intangible asset owned by thetaxpayer and directly used to produce the inventory in issue. Excludedare accounts receivable, marketing intangibles, transportation assets,warehouses, the inventory itself, raw materials, work in process,working capital, investment assets, prepaid expenses and stock of asubsidiary.If the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership which owns productionassets, a pro rata portion of those assets will be attributed to thetaxpayer from the partnership. If the taxpayer is a member of anaffiliated group within the meaning of Code S1504(a), the productionactivity of the members of its group must be taken into account.Tangible production assets are located where they are found andintangible production assets are located where the associated tangibleassets are found.As under the current regulations, an independent factory price may beused to determine the source of income. It may only be elected if thetaxpayer regularly sells part of its output to wholly independentdistributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to reasonablyreflect the income earned from production activity.Also, a taxpayer may request advance permission to base its allocationon its books and records. As part of its submission, the taxpayer mustshow that the books and records are not affected by tax considerations.Rules are also provided in the proposed regulations for transportationincome and for mineral extraction activities.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED STATES: FINAL REGULATIONS FOR R & D EXPENSESThe IRS issued final regulations regarding the allocation andapportionment of research & development ("R&D") expenses to variousclasses of income. For US based taxpayers, the regulations will haveprimary impact on the computation of the foreign tax credit limitationand possibly the computation of combined taxable income for taxpayerswho export through foreign sales corporations or domestic internationalsales corporations in order to obtain certain tax benefits.The regulations finalise a proposal that was circulated for comment inMay 1995. The proposal provided relief to taxpayers in three broadways. It allowed taxpayers to allocate R&D expenses on the basis of athree digit SIC code, rather than on the broader two digit code asprovided in existing law. The percentage of R&D expenses that may beapportioned exclusively to US sources is 50 per cent if the salesmethod of allocation is used.This is an increase from 30 per cent under existing regulations. Anelective apportionment based on gross income is permitted, but onceelected may not be changed without the permission of the LRS.The final regulations modify the proposed regulations in two broadways. First, taxpayers that elect the gross income method ofapportionment may make an exclusive apportionment of 25 per cent of theR&D to the US. Under the proposed regulations, an exclusiveapportionment was allowed only if taxpayers elected the sales method ofapportionment. The IRS believes that this is an equivalent benefit tothe exclusive apportionment of 50 per cent under the sales method.Second, the prior written consent of the IRS to change from the grossincome method to another method is no longer required once the taxpayerhas used the gross income method for 5 years.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED STATES: EXCISE TAX ON PREMIUMS PAID TO FOREIGN INSURERSThe Supreme Court will review the decision in US v IBM F3d (Fed.

The official view is that the basic frameworkof Indonesian tax law is structured to be internationally competitiveand thereby tax inducements should not be necessary to stimulateparticular sectors of the economy.The top marginal rate of corporate and personal income tax had beenreduced from 35 per cent to 30 per cent. The Minister of Finance hasbeen granted authority to reduce the top rate to 25 per cent.Remaining incentives included deferral of value added tax for approvedinvestment companies including foreign investment companies. Also thecorporate income tax and value added tax arising from contractsfinanced by foreign grant or loan aid were borne by the government ofIndonesia under previous regulations. The Directorate General of Taxessought to discontinue deferral of value added tax under the provisionsof the amended Value Added Tax law. A Presidential Decree was publishedin April whereby foreign aid financed contracts signed on or afterApril 1, 1995 would be subject to tax.Both changes were controversial and generated considerable discussionand lobbying. Further changes have recently been announced whichpartially reinstate the facilities. Deferral of value added tax hasbeen restored in respect of all investments which have been approved bythe Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) but not later than March 31,1996.The related investments must be realised by December 31, 1999. This isonly a partial restoration of facilities for deferral of value addedtax but may enable those potential investors, which had made plansassuming deferral of value added tax, to go ahead. The period ofrealisation may, however, not be extended sufficiently for largeprojects where delays are not uncommon. The imposition of VAT on newinvestments of plant and equipment results in additional cash outflowsof 10 per cent during the investment period of a project. Although suchvalue added tax may be recovered, extended delays in refunds are notuncommon.Tax facilities for foreign aid contractors have been restored followingthe publishing of Presidential Decree No 42/1995 dated November 30,1995. The implementation is back dated to April 1, 1995 and thuscancels Presidential Decree No 13/1995 which had withdrawn facilities.The government of Indonesia will thus continue to bear the corporateincome tax and branch profits tax applicable to such contracts.Facilities also extend to import duties, value added tax and sales taxon luxury goods. Facilities only extend to the main contractor and notits employees or subcontractors.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SOUTH KOREA: 1996 AMENDMENTSSignificant tax reforms have come into effect at the beginning ofJanuary 1996.Corporate Tax RatesTaxable Income             1995     1996up to W100 million         18%      16%over W100 million          30%      28%Inhabitant tax of 10 per cent (7.5 per cent in 1995) of corporate taxshould be also included.

The changes are designed toenhance Australian borrowers' access to overseas capital markets.Interest paid to foreign lenders that does not qualify for theexemption is subject to a 10 per cent interest withholding tax.The current interest withholding tax exemption has four features:- interest must be paid by an Australian corporation to foreignlenders,- borrowings must be by way of widely held debentures issued by anAustralian borrower,- the borrowed funds must be used for business purposes, and- the borrower must obtain an exemption certificate from theCommissioner of Taxation prior to the payment of interest.Changes to the exemption will eliminate the need for taxpayers toobtain an exemption certificate and will modify other requirements ofthe present law. Thus, in line with Australia's new self-assessmentsystem, it will be the responsibility of Australian borrowers toascertain whether the interest qualifies for an exemption from theinterest withholding tax.Importantly, the requirement that borrowed funds must be used in anAustralian business will be removed, so the withholding tax exemptionwill be available where borrowed funds are used to finance housing andconsumer loans.The wide distribution of debentures requirement will be replaced by a"public offer" test. To satisfy the public offer test, funds must beraised by the issue of securities to unrelated foreign lenders by acompany resident in Australia. It will no longer be necessary to meetthe stricter "widely-held" test formerly used.To protect the integrity of the interest withholding tax where noexemption applies, borrowers who fail to deduct interest withholdingtax from non-exempt interest payments will be denied a deduction forthe interest payments.The new interest withholding tax exemption rules apply from January 1,1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: OFFSHORE BANKING UNITSThe Government is modifying the Offshore Banking Units regime toprovide Australian-based offshore banking units with greaterflexibility. An offshore banking unit is a banking entity located inAustralia that borrows and re-lends funds offshore. Interest paymentsby offshore banking units are exempt from interest withholding tax.To ensure the operations of offshore banking units were completelyinsulated from Australian banking businesses, the original offshorebanking units exemption imposed strict quarantine rules on the units,including prohibitions on Australian investments.Offshore banking units that undertake fund management activities haveargued that the prohibition prevents them from offering clientsbalanced global portfolios, which normally would contain someAustralian assets. The government has responded to the criticism byannouncing that offshore banking units that undertake fund managementactivities will be able to invest up to 10 per cent of the value oftotal funds under management in Australian assets.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONCESSIONThe government has announced changes to the research and development(R&D) tax concession, which provides a 150 per cent deduction foreligible R&D expenditures, to combat 'gravedigging' practices designedto exploit the concession.The 'gravedigging' practice involves consultants examining companyrecords for previous years' expenditures that might qualify for thespecial deduction and applying long after the fact for recognition ofexpenses as R&D outlays.Under the new rules, registration for the concession must take placewithin six months of the end of the year in which the expenses wereincurred. Transitional arrangements will allow registration of expensesincurred in the 1993-94 tax year and the 1994-95 tax year (ending 30June 1995) until 30 June 1996.

After discussions with various merchant banks itsettled on a scheme that involved the transfer of funds through aseries of bank transfers from Melbourne to the Cook Islands, where thefunds were eventually deposited.Interest paid on the deposit was subject to Cook Islands withholdingtax of 5 per cent. The taxpayer then claimed the interest was exemptfrom Australian tax pursuant to a provision that formerly exempted fromAustralian tax income subject to foreign tax in its country of source.The Commissioner attacked the arrangement, arguing the true source ofthe income was Australia, where the scheme was devised and the moneyoriginally deposited, not the Cook Islands, where it was finallydeposited. The Commissioner argued in the alternative that thearrangements should be struck down on the basis of the general anti-avoidance provision in the income tax legislation.The Federal Court rejected the first argument, finding that the sourceof the interest income was the Cook Islands because the taxpayercompleted the deposit contract in the Cook Islands, and ignoring theearlier steps in the scheme.The Court agreed that several of the elements required for theoperation of the general anti-avoidance provision were satisfied, butconcluded that the principal element required by the provision, thatthe scheme be one of the dominant purpose of which was to obtain a taxbenefit, had not been satisfied. The dominant purpose of the scheme,the Court said, was a commercial one, to obtain the maximum return onthe money investment after the payment of all applicable costs,including tax.The effect of the decision is to revive the "choice" doctrine used bycourts to decimate a predecessor general anti-avoidance provision.Under the choice doctrine, the general anti-avoidance provision had noapplication if the taxpayer were faced with two commercial choices andchose the option that attracted the lower tax liability.If the decision is not reversed by the High Court, legislativeamendment of the anti-avoidance provision is likely. In the meantime,the scope of the anti-avoidance measure is severely constrained.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996AUSTRALIA: GOODWILLThe Australian Taxation Office has recently lost two important cases onthe meaning of goodwill for tax purposes. The decisions open the doorto considerable tax benefits for many owners of small businesses.The meaning of goodwill is relevant to a capital gains tax concessionthat exempts from taxation 50 per cent of the gain realised on the saleof a small business (with a net value of less than $2 million) that isattributable to the sale of goodwill associated with the business.In the first case, Case 59/95, the taxpayer sold a taxi business,including the car, equipment, shares in a cab co-operative, and taxilicence and attributed the amount of consideration received in respectof the taxi licence (calculated as the excess of consideration receivedover the market value of the car, equipment, and shares) as payment for"goodwill" and thus eligible for the 50 per cent exemption.The Administrative Appeals Tribunal agreed with the taxpayer'scharacterisation, concluding that the value of the licence was in itspower to confer monopoly privileges to the holder and in the context ofa taxi business, these privileges amounted to the goodwill of thebusiness.In the second case, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v KrakosInvestments (not yet reported), the taxpayer sold a hotel and pubbusiness and leased the business premises to the new owners. TheCommissioner of Taxation characterised the significant payment receivedby the vendor as a lease premium, reflecting the location value to thebusiness, while the taxpayer claimed the payment was consideration forthe sale of business goodwill.The full Federal Court agreed with the taxpayer's characterisation. Thedecision is likely to have a major impact on the tax consequences ofsales of small businesses, as it makes it very difficult for theCommissioner to carve out part of the sale price and attribute it tofactors apart from general goodwill.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW ZEALAND: DEDUCTIONS FOR WARRANTY CLAIMSIn CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has allowed a deduction forexpected warranty claims. Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited("Mitsubishi") sold vehicles to dealers for on-sale and indemnifiedthose dealers for a warranty provided on sale against defects inmaterial or workmanship appearing within one year or 20,000 kilometres,whichever occurred earlier. Evidence was given in the High Court thatin 1988 63 per cent of vehicles sold gave rise to a subsequent warrantyclaim for which Mitsubishi indemnified the relevant dealers.Mitsubishi deducted the estimated warranty costs for tax purposes inthe year in which the vehicles were sold. The Commissioner subsequentlydisallowed the deduction. The case was argued on different bases:- Whether the estimated warranty expense was properly deductible asbeing "incurred" under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 ("Act")in the year of sale of the vehicle;- Whether, if no deduction was available under section 104, theestimated warranty costs nevertheless reduced the assessable incomeproperly derived in the year of sale, ie the purchase price was notfully earned until the warranty period expired (at the latest, one yearlater); or,Whether the warranty income should be spread under the accruals rulescontained in sections 64B to 64M of the Act.The High Court held that a deduction was properly allowable undersection 104. The Court of Appeal held that a deduction was notallowable under section 104 because the estimated warranty expense wasnot incurred. However, the Court held that to the extent that the pricefor the vehicle included an amount for the warranty, that amount wasnot derived in the year of sale but should be spread over the period ofthe warranty under ordinary principles. The Court of Appeal also heldthat the accrual rules did not apply to the particular contact. ThePrivy Council disagreed with the Court of Appeal and held that adeduction was properly allowable under section 104.Their Lordships considered the terms of the warranty to determinewhether Mitsubishi became "definitely committed" to the estimatedexpenditure in the year of sale of each vehicle. They agreed with theCourt of Appeal that the effect of the warranty was not a promise thatthe vehicle was free from defects on sale. They held that any liabilitywas contingent on a defect appearing and notification being made withinthe warranty period and until that occurred, no liability was incurred.Nevertheless, although that conclusion on the scope of the warrantyresulted in the Court of Appeal finding that the ability to deduct wasdeferred to a later income year, that was not the end of the matter fortheir Lordships.They were not prepared to determine deductibility by rather arcanelegal distinctions between contingency and defeasibility as had beendone in earlier cases and by the Court of Appeal. The question waswhether with all the surrounding circumstances a legal obligation inthe future can be said to have accrued. In making that determinationtheoretical contingencies were disregarded. Given the data available,their Lordships held that the defects were a matter of existing fact,not future contingency, as 63 per cent of the vehicles sold were foundto display defects within the warranty period. Those defects must haveexisted at the time of sale.The contingency that owners might choose not to seek repairs was likelyto be quite small and would not make a material difference to theaccuracy of the estimated expenditure. Accordingly, their Lordshipsheld that the warranty costs were deductible in the year of sale undersection 104 of the Act.The finding on deductibility made it unnecessary for their Lordships toreach a view on either of the other issues. However, they did commentin relation to the second issue that, because Mitsubishi had not made aseparate charge for the warranty, in their view there was nojustification for treating part of the price of the vehicle as if itwere a separate charge for the warranty. They indicated that in theiropinion the full price should have been recognised as income and therecould be no deferral of income for the warranty costs.They would not have been prepared, if a deduction was not allowable, to"manipulate" the ordinary rules for the recognition of income to givesuch a deferral.The decision of the Privy Council does seem to have changed the testfor determining when expenditure is incurred for the purpose of beingdeductible under the Act. For the reasons set out below, however, thischange may not have much practical significance.Back to Headline List CopyrightWORLD TAX REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SPAIN/PORTUGAL TAX TREATYThe ratification of the Spain/Portugal income tax treaty signed inMadrid on October 26, 1993, was published in the Spanish Official StateBulletin on November 7, 1995. It replaces one since 1968 and addressesthe problems arising from the new financial relationship between thetwo countries.Section 10 of the new treaty retains the right to tax dividends in thepayers's country. The rate of tax may not exceed 10 per cent if therecipient holds 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of thepaying company directly.Income from Government Stock may be taxed in both states.Interest may be taxed in the contracting state of origin at a rate notexceeding 15 per cent.Capital GainsWhile the 1968 agreement permitted the country of residence only to taxcapital gains, the new agreement provides that gains may be subject totax in the state where the company, whose shares have been sold, isresident if the vendor has, either directly or indirectly, held atleast 25 per cent of the authorised share capital of the said companyfor the previous twelve months.Companies, whose assets consist of land and buildings, may be liablefor tax in the country in which the lands and buildings are located.Limitation of BenefitsNo reductions in or exemptions from the taxation of dividends, capitalgains, royalties or interest shall apply in the case of companiesengaged in the management of securities or other assets if more than 50per cent of the authorised capital is held by shareholders who are notresident in the state where the company in question is domiciled.

However, the income tax on petroleum produced in Malta, is notcovered.Business profits would be taxable in the source country, if theenterprise carries on business through the permanent establishment(PE), therein. However, profits, directly or indirectly attributable tothe PE, will only be taxable if the PE takes an active part innegotiating, concluding or fulfilling contracts entered into by theenterprise. Attribution will be to the extent of the contribution ofthe PE in those transactions. The PE provision is not applicable toinsurance profits.The term PE, among other fixed places of businesses, includes anoffshore drilling site. A building site or construction or assemblyproject or connected supervisory activities is a PE, if it lasts formore than 6 months. Certain activities are deemed a PE. Exploration ofthe seabed, and its sub-soil or exploration of natural resourcessituated there as well as activities, which are complimentary orauxiliary to such activities. Also included is the use or installationof substantial equipment or connected supervisory activities.Dividends, interest, royalties and fees for services, and technicalservice fees, are taxable in both the states. Tax in the source state,may not exceed on dividends in India, 15 per cent, reduced to 10 percent, in the hands of a 25 per cent participating company.

In his introduction the author notes that they are probablythe most mobile individuals in the business world. As they become morewell known income may be derived in many different countries andresidential ties to a particular country may lessen. Taxation of suchindividuals in a source country may be problematic given the short stayand the lack of any strong economic ties with that country.The author also refers to concerns expressed in the 1987 OECD study ontaxation of the entertainment business that imply that entertainerseither evade tax or at best negligently prepare their returns.Certainly he notes that perceived abuses by such individuals are betterreported than abuses by other taxpayers who do not enjoy celebritystatus.The central focus of this book is a comparative analysis of the taxtreatment of non-resident entertainers and athletes in seven countriesAustralia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and theUnited States. The key themes are firstly the question of allocation ofincome and secondly enforcement. Most countries adopt withholdingmechanisms. Given the complexity of the entertainment industry a numberof issues are involved depending on the nature of the source of income.The clash between personal service income and a royalty income isparticularly difficult.The analysis of each country proceeds through an examination of thetaxation of non-residence generally and the treatment of non-residentsemployed or carrying on business in the particular country. It alsoconsiders the treatment of royalties and the general withholdingarrangements, as well as those specifically applicable to entertainersand athletes. In each case, the effect of tax treaties on domestic lawis considered, as well as the application of VAT.The OECD study on the taxation of entertainers and athletes refers tosophisticated tax avoidance and an industry increasingly categorised byloosely connected chains of companies, partnerships and joint ventures.However, the principal focus of planning and indeed, anti-avoidancerules apart from withholding, analysed in the book revolves around theuse of loan-out and slave companies. In each jurisdiction, thetreatment of such entities is considered in detail.A chapter is devoted to a detailed analysis of article 17 of the OECDmodel convention. He covers the history and interpretation of thearticle in great detail. It illustrates some of the anomalies in therule where although singers and actors are covered by the article theirentourage is not. Other closely related professions who are equallymobile such as "super models" also appear to be excluded.This is a thorough and detailed book. For example in consideringarticle 17 he analyses in some detail the concerns of each of thecountries considered in relation to their concerns on the applicationof article 17 in the context of their domestic laws.Many tax books today are padded out with appendices comprisingvoluminous source material. This is certainly not the case here. Thetax treaties of all of the countries have been carefully researched andthe results are contained in tables identifying the date when thetreaty entered into force, articles analogous to article 17,limitations on the application of the article within the treaty andother relevant comments.A further chapter is devoted to illustrating the rules by reference toexamples. They comprise a pop group on a world tour and a professionalathlete participating in a number of tournaments around the world.This is not a book about tax planning. Indeed the concerns of theauthor expressed in the conclusion are for effective and efficienttaxation of non-resident entertainers and athletes and the policyissues relating to it. The bulk of the book covers income tax althoughVAT is also considered.It is a highly thoughtful, thoroughly researched and very readablebook. It is clearly a must read for anyone involved in this area. Itsonly drawback is the absence of an index although the lengthybibliography is extremely useful.Back to Headline List WT03-B11-29IA086-000622-B034-34http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/td01.html 205.156.212.5 19970122043939 text/html 15427HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:37:45 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:38:10 GMTContent-length: 15240Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/td01.html Sample Issue Copyright TEIKOKU JAPANESE COMPANY REPORTS via NewsNet January 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES THE SENDAI BANK, LTD.

That big, bulky PBX may soon be replaced by a tiny PCcard.A PC card now sold by NetPhone, Northboro, Mass., performs allthe standard functions of a PBX, including basic call switching,executing hunt groups, call forwarding and conferencing, forexample.The best thing about the NetPhone, however, is its price. Thecard and its accompanying software only cost $4,295. That priceeasily beats spending several hundred thousand dollars for a PBX,says Dave Zweiban, telecom consultant at the International Group,Los Angeles, Calif.Here's how the NetPhone works: The Windows-based system operateson a 486 PC that uses Novell Netware and acts as a server on aLAN, says NetPhone spokesman Bob Fletcher. The card plugs intothe 16-bit ISA slot of the PC, and is connected to phone lines ona punchdown block.One card can only handle six trunks and 18 extensions, but sixcards can be installed on a single 486 PC, says Fletcher. Yourfull capacity is 36 incoming trunks and 108 extensions -- enoughfor a mid-sized site.NetPhone also includes features that aren't standard on PBXs. Avoice mail system, an automatic attendant and a CTI program thatlinks Caller ID numbers to customer records are included inNetPhone's software. And each PC on your LAN is loaded withsoftware that receives Caller ID from the PBX server and links itto files, Fletcher says.But is the PC card too good to be true? Many of the long-standingPBX manufacturers think so. The majority of PC-card PBXs can'thandle digital lines, T1s or ISDN yet, says Tony Tissot, adirector of marketing at Rolm, San Jose, Calif. And, there islittle redundancy built into the cards, adds Tissot. In moststand-alone PBXs, you can order back-up circuits formission-critical applications, he says.Tissot is right on many counts. The NetPhone system, for example,can only handle analog trunks and phones for now, and doesn'tsupport T1s, ISDN or frame relay. Plus, NetPhone doesn't have aUPS (uninterruptable power supply) built into it. But, thecompany does suggest putting at least a 30-minute UPS on yourserver.When power goes out completely, each card has an automatic "ringdown" feature, says Fletcher. That means each card has oneextension that works off the phone company's power, so you candial out, he adds. And, if your server gets locked up or fails,but its power is still on, the PBX will function normally,although voice mail and CTI will not run.NetPhone is now working on T1 and ISDN capabilities for itscards, and plans to have them ready by the end of '96, saysFletcher. The company is also developing programming that willlet companies link PBX servers together and control them from acentral PC. That would eliminate one of the other currentadvantages of PBXs, says Fletcher.Ironically, Mitel doesn't think card-based PBXs are a bad idea.The company is developing a PBX for release in 1996 that combinesPC cards and a LAN server, says Mitel marketing manager RobClark. The cards plug into the back of a PC and will connect toboth digital lines and T1s, he adds. Up to 200 extensions can beserviced by the PBX.Manufacturing PC cards that switch calls isn't a big gamble,Clark explains. "Companies will be pushed into using CTI as itbecomes more and more common in business, and customers will evenstart requesting it," he says. "And CTI is very easily integratedwith LANs -- in some cases more so than with PBXs," Clark adds.Note: if you buy an initial NetPhone card, the card's price isreduced to $3,295 for additional cards. NetPhone's number is(508) 393-7979.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996MOTOROLA BEATS CELLULAR "PHREAKS"Worried that hackers may run up big bucks on your company'scellular phones? Motorola is taking a step that should preventhackers from using devices to intercept your phones' electronicserial numbers and phone numbers.The company is launching a new line of phones with a microchipthat encrypts each subscriber's phone number and serial number.Encryption encodes the numbers with algorithms that can only bedecoded by a decryption key at cellular base stations.Phreaks will still be able to intercept signals, but shouldn't beable to crack encrypted codes without a decryption key.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996USE YOUR ROOFTOP TO MAKE BIG BUCKSLook up at the stars. Do you see dollar signs in the heavens? Youcould if you look a little lower and rent out your rooftop forwireless antennas.Rooftop management companies desperately want rooftop space tomeet a rising demand for antenna locations from wirelesscarriers. The telecom bill and the '96 auction of PCS licenseswill create an explosion in the number of rooftops needed forcellular, microwave, PCS and paging antennas over the next threeyears, says John Cipollone, vice president of Tower EconomicsCompany Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Tower Economics, a rooftopmanagement company, is now signing deals for rooftop space thatpay owners between $300 and $1,300 per month, adds Cipollone.The best part of generating revenue with rooftop leases is thatregistering with the management companies is free, says JimInnes, director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. Thecompanies put your buildings on their list of eligible sites anddo all of the marketing to wireless carriers, adds Innes. And therooftop companies get paid by earning a commission on the monthlypayments a carrier gives you, but only after a deal is signed,explains Innes. You don't have to do any of the dirty work, likeconducting tests for interference or writing up contracts.The Teachers College at Columbia University, New York City,recently got a surprise when it was offered a deal for rooftopspace. The college was considering going with Local AreaTelecommunications (Locate), New York City, for local servicewhen Locate's technicians noticed one of the college's buildingswas ideal for a microwave antenna, says Tom Fiorella, a businessservices analyst at the college.Locate had rooftop management company AAT Communications Corp.,Edison, N.J., contact the university and make an offer for spaceon the 15-story building, says Fiorella. The offer was $4,800 peryear for 10 square feet of rooftop, he adds.What type of buildings are needed? Virtually any height is usedby carriers, says Arne Jerfsten, manager of technical support atLocate. Many small buildings are positioned on hills that providegood locations for antennas, he adds. Plus, PCS antennas don'thave to be located high above the ground, says Cipollone.Even if your company is located in a rural area, you shouldregister with a rooftop management company, says Jim Innes,director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. Carriersmust reach rural areas if they want to stay competitive, Innesexplains. You can register with multiple management companies,such as AAT at (908) 417-3993, Tower Economics at (610) 667-0351and Apex at (215) 875-0791.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 19965 TIPS FOR GENERATING ROOFTOP DOLLARSHere are five tips from rooftop management professionals on howto take advantage of the upcoming need for space:1. Make sure the carrier that wants to use your rooftop does aninterference study before its equipment is installed. Carriersare required to do so by FCC rules that say the integrity of thesurrounding area and its telecom equipment must be preserved,says Jerfsten.2. Get a copy of the local zoning laws by contacting the city orcounty your building is located in. Some areas prohibit buildingsfrom reaching certain heights.3. Make sure the rooftop company considers your building'sstructure, says Innes. When dishes grow larger than two feetacross, some walls have to be reinforced. Structural alterationsusually bring an increase in the monthly revenue you can make,however.4. If you want negotiations with a carrier to be as little of aburden as possible for your company, have a rooftop managementcompany handle them, says Columbia University's Fiorella. But,you may be able to get more money if you handle the dealyourself, he adds.5. Don't hold out on a deal for long periods of time for extramoney. Carriers need space so quickly that they will make anoffer to another company while you are waiting, says Cipollone.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996A LOCAL SERVICE REFUND FROM THE BELLS?MCI has petitioned the FCC to require the Baby Bells to returnmillions of dollars in lobbying expenses that were unlawfullybilled to customers. So, you may soon get a boost for yourbudget.The FCC found the Bells improperly charged ratepayers $116.5million from 1988-1991 for lobbying in a recent audit. But,instead of requiring the RBOCs to give back the money tocustomers, the FCC only slashed the price cap on future Bellaccess charges by $5 million, MCI claims.The FCC found BellSouth passed on $27 million in expenses, BellAtlantic $21.5 million, Ameritech $18 million, Southwestern Belland Nynex $14 million each, PacTel $12 million and U S West $10million.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996NEW FAX SERVICES MAKE YOU AN OFFICE HERORead this and your staff may erect a statue of you. That'sbecause you can save them loads of word processing by convertingfaxes into files that can be read by WordPerfect, Microsoft Wordand Excel before they reach the office.Educational Testing Services (ETS) in Princeton, N.J., has savedmoney on data processing by using a fax-conversion service fromGlobal Fax, Warren, Mich. Incoming faxes are changed into alanguage compatible with ETS's IBM mainframes, says FrankMcKeown, principle systems engineer at ETS.Global Fax is processing the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)registration form for ETS, says McKeown. The forms arestandardized and have fill-in circles and blanks for hand-writtenanswers, he adds.And when they are faxed to ETS's 800 number, they are routed toGlobal Fax by AT&T, says Paul Kennedy, vice president at GlobalFax. Our company then changes the faxes into two seperate fileformats for the educational testing company, he adds.Besides the mainframe files, ETS is having Global Fax make TIFF(Tagged Image File Format) files from the original faxes so ETScan load them into Hijack fax software for viewing, adds McKeown.ETS has always had a company policy of keeping original copies ofregistration forms in case questions from students arise later,says McKeown.Global Fax emphasizes that faxes can be converted into almost anylanguage, including ASCII and DOS Text. Companies use the serviceto drop faxed product orders and invoices straight intoaccounting software, for example, says Kennedy.ETS can't pinpoint exactly how much money it has saved, but underits pilot program, it has received 2,000 two-page faxes in thepast two months. Paying employees to enter the data from theforms into ETS's computer system would have been much more thanit cost for Global Fax to convert them in a few hours, saysMcKeown.Global Fax says that in general, fax-to-data conversion costsbetween $1.00 and $3.00 per fax. The price depends on the lengthof the fax, the number of data fields involved, how muchconversion from hand-written copy is needed and the amount ofaccuracy desired. Global Fax offers from 95% to 99.9% accuracy.But McKeown says to shop around. He went with Global Fax becausethe company gave him the best offer out of three companies herequested proposals from. You can get a list of fax-to-datacompanies by calling your 800 carrier. Global Fax's number is(800) 887-4329.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 19965 TIPS ON STARTING A FAX-TO-DATA PROGRAMHere are five more tips from McKeown on how to begin afax-to-data program that will save you bucks:1. Prevent customers from sending extra faxes on your 800 linesby having them include their credit card numbers on faxes. Givecustomers a warning that if more than one fax is sent with theircredit card number, they will be charged for the extra faxes.2. Make sure your fax-to-data service provider notifies you ofthe number of faxes that come out garbled. If the number gets toohigh, you should discontinue the service.3. Market the fax service as a convenient tool for customers.After all, they don't have to pay for postage or a phone call tomake orders.4. Use caution because some fax-to-data companies have you dialinto one of their databases to retrieve faxes. If that's thecase, make sure you have a service with enough bandwidth thatdownloading image files doesn't tie up your lines for hours.5. Find out if the fax-to-data company you are considering has anarchiving service. Global Fax will back up faxes at itsfacilities for a period from days to weeks after they arereceived for a reasonable fee, says McKeown.Back to Headline List Copyright411 NEWSLETTER via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996PC CARD LIFTS YOU TO FRAME RELAY CLOUDS FOR LESSYou could lay $2,000 on the table to buy a frame relay routerthat will link your LAN to a carrier's frame relay cloud.But, you'd be paying too much. You can purchase a new PC cardfrom Motorola that makes the connection for only $999.The card is called the Vanguard 100 PC. And, it lets you plug anon-frame relay LAN router into it to send your LAN's trafficonto a frame relay network. You don't have to pay for anexpensive upgrade of a current router or buy a new one to link toframe relay, says Rod Wilson, a marketing director at Motorola,Mansfield, Mass.Another good use for the Vanguard 100: At remote sites where youdon't need more than one connection to your company's frame relaynetwork. When the card is plugged into the back of a PC, itsdigital service unit can have a phone line configured for framerelay plugged into it.And there is a bonus with the Vanguard 100. If you can only getISDN at a site, the card can be ordered with an ISDN networktermination device on it. But watch out! It only handles one Band one D channel because it was designed primarily for framerelay, says Wilson.Motorola says it doesn't have any users of the card yet becauseit's so new. It, in fact, is the first FRAD (frame relay accessdevice) on a PC card on the market.But the Vanguard 100 should find users quickly because it is aneasy way for companies to link to frame relay networks, says TimBurke, independent telecom analyst at the Yankee Group, Boston,Mass. At this point the technical know-how isn't always there attelcos when it comes to helping companies link to frame relay, heexplains. But the Vanguard 100 makes the connection a simpleplug-and-play operation, adds Burke.There is a disadvantage. The Vanguard 100 will only give you aconnection speed of 56 Kbps, says Wilson. This limits the card touse primarily at sites that don't have long, constant hours offrame relay usage, adds Burke.

The number of calls taken by reps per hour alsoincreased from 7.5 to 12, and the average wrap-up time forfinalizing post-call records decreased from 120 seconds to 45seconds. And, since Octel's agents take calls on 800 numbers thatthe company pays for, the savings added up, says Kevin McKinnon,director of customer service at Octel.Another bonus: Although Octel's incoming calls doubled in 1995,the company only had to hire 50% more staff. In past years, Octeldoubled its staff when calls doubled, says McKinnon.The Teknekron CTI system that Octel installed is calledOrchestra!, and it sits on a central server and individualworkstations like most CTI programs. But Octel posed a specialproblem because its workstations don't have hard drives, so theCTI program couldn't be loaded on them.Teknekron had to load both parts of Orchestra! onto the LANserver and have screen-pops delivered to workstations using theiraddresses, says McKinnon. At first, packets were not exchangedcorrectly and the timing of the screen-pops was off, he adds. ButTeknekron fixed the problem within a few days and the CTI programhas worked fine ever since, McKinnon says.A program called Rendezvous! makes the connection between aTeknekron Series III ACD on Octel's SRX PBX and Orchestra! on theLAN server. Rendezvous! is loaded onto a Sun SPARCstationminicomputer (the two are sold together) and collects call datafrom a management port on the ACD. Calls are then routed based onthe number that the customer has dialed or the customer's CallerID, among many options.You can also list the skills of each of your representatives onRendezvous!, and then rank your agents' abilities on each skill.Calls can be routed to the best available agent based on theirratings.McKinnon says that the cost of the Teknekron CTI system isreasonable, especially considering the savings it has alreadygenerated for Octel. Installing the Series III ACD, Orchestra!,Rendezvous!, a Sun SPARCstation and AutoQuality! (which recordscalls so you can monitor agents) runs $2,500 to $5,000 perworkstation, says John Kaiser, managing director at Teknekron.The system usually pays for itself within a year or two, he adds.One problem: Orchestra! only works with AT&T, Nortel andTeknekron PBXs.

According to many in the industry,1996 is going to be the year AIN gets down to business.  Many carriersnow have enough services in the market to begin leveraging them andbenefitting from combined service offerings.  AIN services areproliferating and submerging into the network to the extent that theydon't generate quite as much amazement as they used to.       There continues to be tremendous momentum in the AIN hardwaremarket, but the wireless market is beginning to overshadow the Belloperating companies (BOCs) as a source of business according to somevendors, who see the BOCs as reaching a "hardware plateau."  Someindustry observers believe that the solution to this problem, and theway to create continued growth in the AIN market, is to develop opensystems.  There are forces within the industry trying to achieve this,and outside forces are converging on the market.  There are signsthat, one way or another, 1996 will be the year AIN interoperabilityfinally happens for real.  ...Getting the Flywheel Up to Speed     On the service side, synergistic effects are beginning to appearfor carriers who plunged into AIN early.  A prime example isBellSouth, although the carrier's lead in service deployment may benarrowing as other BOCs increased their activities and began to catchup in 1995.     BellSouth's Executive Director for AIN Scott Schaefer describesthe company's AIN division as an accelerating engine, with the carriergaining expertise, and customers beginning to drive the process to agreater degree.  "Because we've gotten the proliferation of AIN thatwe had in 1994 and 1995, we're starting to get a lot stronger feedbackloop from the marketplace," said Schaefer.  "They've got their handson this stuff.  They're using it, and they're coming up with new ideasand extensions for services that we haven't thought of before."     Expect the geographic scope of AIN services to expand in 1996 aswell, meeting the demands of customers who want services to work thesame way no matter where they are.  The bugs will eventually getworked out of interstate caller ID, and the recent agreement betweenAmeritech and U S West to share calling name databases is a sign ofthings to come.  ...More Hardware Players     The growth of the AIN market and the increasing opportunities fordevelopers from the mainstream computing market will mean more newhardware products and new industry participants in 1996.       "I think more people are going to be drawn into being technologysuppliers in the AIN arena," said Schaefer, "and not just at theService Control Point or Service Node levels, but maybe in niches likevoice recognition as a specialty that they would integrate with alarger platform or some other specialty function.  There's room inthere for niche players to come in and integrate their specialtywithin the broader AIN platform."     The result of these new competitors will be continuing gains inprice/performance.  Hardware and software prices dropped significantlyin 1995, and this trend will continue in 1996.       Chris Ebling, marketing program manager at Tandem Computers Inc., agrees that Tandem's prices have come down since the beginning of1995, as have those of its competitors.     "It's a little bit more difficult to talk about the cost forswitch-based [intelligent networking]," said Ebling.  "That tends tobe hidden a little bit more in the overall bids the switch vendors putout, but I suspect that has come down as well.  I've heard that thepricing of IN loads on switches has come down significantly this year,and that was one of the larger barriers for some of the smallerindependents to getting in."  ...No Cottage Industry Yet     The part of the original AIN promise that has so far been almostcompletely overlooked is the appearance of third party softwaredevelopers.  Despite some interest from potential developers and someefforts from carriers to accommodate them, the anticipated industry ofindependent AIN service builders has simply not appeared.     Ebling sees this as a serious problem for intelligent networking. "If we don't figure out a way to get third party application providersinvolved in this market, then intelligent networking will remain justan infrastructure product and it will never really realize its fullpotential."     According to Ebling, the only way to create this market isthrough true interoperability, at a level that still does not exist inthe AIN market.     "There is no common application environment thatyou can develop applications to," said Ebling.  "Tandem has its own. Yeah, we publish it.  Big deal.  HP has its environment.  IBM has itsenvironment with Bell Atlantic.  So people are creating proprietaryopen systems if you will.  Sure they're open, but they're proprietaryin terms of the API so that people who are developing service logicare doing that only for one vendor's system.  There's no portabilitybetween the systems.  There's no incentive for someone to get involvedin that market because they'd be developing for one particularplatform and it's a very high investment to develop these kinds ofapplications."     Ebling argues that this will eventually become a cripplinglimitation for AIN if it isn't overcome.  "Until we can figure out away to provide a common application environment, I believe that AINwill never be much more than what it is today," said Ebling.  "It willcertainly never reach its full potential."     One force attempting to overcome this problem is the IntelligentNetwork Forum, which is accepting charter members until Jan 31.  Ninecompanies have so far made financial commitments to the Forum.  (Formore information on the Forum, contact John C. Nowell at 312/507-8882.)   ...Advanced Intelligent Internet?     One standard which is beginning to show its face in theintelligent networking field is TCP/IP.  The Internet protocol isattracting large numbers of developers precisely because it has becomethe de facto standard for large- scale data networks.  From theInternet, TCP/IP is beginning to invade the corporate LAN market andother fields as well, including intelligent networking.     At least one company, Genesys Telecommunications LaboratoriesInc., is working on a way use TCP/IP to integrate CPE-basedintelligence with the SS7-based intelligence of the signaling network. According to Vice President of Network Applications Richard Pickering,TCP/IP is bringing about "a total change in the way intelligentnetworks can be designed.  There is a sea change.  SS7 has had thelast few years, and I think TCP/IP will have the next few years."     Genesys' NetVectoring technology allows Internet platforms toessentially send orders to the signaling network.  Genesys hasdemonstrated an application that allows an Internet user to click abutton on a company's web page and generate a voice call through thepublic network to the company's call center.  The Internet applicationpasses data on both ends of the desired connection to the SS7 network,allowing it to set up the call.  During the call, the same applicationwould be able to tell the signaling network when more bandwidth wasneeded, to add a video connection to the call for example.     In this vision, the old argument about whether the intelligenceshould be in the network or in the terminals is sidestepped. NetVectoring works by integrating intelligence in both locations.  "Inorder to achieve [dynamic bandwidth control] you need the centralnetwork intelligence to be able to collaborate with some intelligencethat's working within the application itself," said Pickering, "whichtends to be in the originator's point or the terminator's point."   ...A Voice Traffic Lane on the Superhighway     The integration of "endpoint intelligence" into the intelligentnetwork can provide more elegant solutions to some problems than AINalone can offer.  For example, the ability to dynamically share thebandwidth of a single connection among several devices has thepotential to reduce the need for individually numbered connections andease the number exhaust problem.  Such applications will distributecall routing intelligence beyond the SS7 network, and require a fairlyclose connection between the SS7 network and the Internet, as well asother data networks.     Although the process may not be complete by the end of 1996, itis likely that the Internet will evolve into a kind of meta-networkrunning in parallel with other, more specialized networks, includingthe SS7 signaling network and the circuit switched voice network. Both these networks will continue to play a role, since they areoptimized to perform critical communications functions, but theirultimate position may be as specialized sections of a sophisticatedand highly intelligent multimedia network.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED INTELLIGENT NETWORK NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996UNISYS AND BELLCORE TEAM TO OFFER NEW NETWORK MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES     Unisys Corp. and Bellcore have formed a strategic alliance underwhich they will integrate the NIRIS platform, a Unisys product used tocollect and examine SS7 network information, with Bellcore's NetMavinlink monitoring software.  The result will be a generic, network wide,operations support system that promises to give carriers more controlthan ever before over their SS7 network traffic.  Immediateapplications are expected in fraud prevention and traffic loadcontrol, but the NIRIS/NetMavin combination will also allow newapplications in areas from billing to marketing.  ...One More Network on the Top     The alliance makes it possible to combine the local levelmonitoring capability of the existing NIRIS platform with the highlevel intelligence of NetMavin.  NIRIS platforms are already deployedin some carriers' networks where they generally operate alongside aSignal Transfer Point (STP).  Acting essentially as a packet sniffer,the NIRIS platform reads all incoming SS7 traffic as it passes throughthe STP link and collects it as necessary.     "Through the basic component of the NIRIS platform, the data iscollected, filtered, and massaged to some degree and passed off to theapplicable application program that's looking for certain pieces ofinformation," explained Jerry Parker, director of sales for NIRIS atUnisys.     This capability is expanded to cover the entirety of thecarrier's infrastructure by networking these individual NIRIS unitstogether -- using a traditional wide area network -- and connectingthem to a central application server running NetMavin.  The combinedsolution will allow carriers to search their networks for particularkinds of messages and collect them at a single point to performanalyses in near real time that can describe the status of the entirenetwork.  ...Right, Now Pay Attention 007     The NIRIS platforms do much more than passively absorb andretransmit messages, however.  It would hardly be practical toduplicate the entire traffic load of the SS7 signaling network and aimit across a WAN at an application server.  Thus the NIRIS platformsactively study the information they are receiving and only sendmessages to the application server that are relevant to what it istrying to do.  "The most effective place to collect [data] is near theSTP site," said Bellcore's Product Manager for NetMavin Mike Myers. "They usually have between 50 and 200 signaling links coming into acertain STP, so you monitor the links there.  One of the tricks whenyou're dealing with this massive amount of data is to effectivelymanage it.  You only want to copy what we call 'interesting' or'important' messages, and a message doesn't have to be copied multipletimes; it can be reused by each application as necessary."     The benefits of this capability for carriers could be immense. "In a big network, it's not atypical for several hundred millionmessages to be flowing every single day," said Myers.  "This is anincredible source of data for a large service provider that ispresently untapped, so the joint solution is a unique way to get thisdata and use it to the corporation's best advantage."     One of the most obvious applications, and the one with the mostimmediate impact on carrier bottom lines, is fraud prevention.  Theonly other system capable of tracking calls across the entire networkis the billing system.  While the billing system might detect fraudwhen it generates a massive monthly bill for a subscriber, the damageis already done.     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination will be able to pick out fraud asit is happening.  One example that Myers cites is illegal callresellers who operate in large metropolitan areas.  "They'll open upan apartment or a storefront, and they'll advertise on the street thatyou can call anywhere in the world for $10 an hour," Myers explained. "They'll have multiple lines in there, and they'll just pump calls 24hours a day into the network.  Today's scenario is at the end of themonth, when the bills come in, the service provider realizes that thisperson owes them a quarter of a million dollars.  Of course by thetime they send the bill to the customer, that person's long gone."     The NIRIS/NetMavin combination would be able to detect the suddenappearance of massive call volumes from a particular location, andcompare the traffic to specified criteria to decide if it should alerta security agent.    ...Other Applications Await     Fraud control is only one application area for the system, whichwill serve as a generic support infrastructure.  It will also performtasks such as monitoring traffic for sudden surges and helpingreconstruct the conditions that created an outage so that similaroutages can be prevented in the future.  Even marketing applicationswill be possible as carriers use the system to mine the tremendousamount of data they already generate on millions of individualtransactions with customers.     "What we're talking about today is really the first wave in usingthat data effectively," said Myers, who described the philosophy ofthe system as a "bit of a paradigm shift."  Instead of having thetelephone company buy "focused solutions" in which a single tool isacquired to solve a single problem, the NIRIS/NetMavin combinationwill offer a range of applications to be used by "wildly disparatepeople within the telephone company.  This solution won't just solveproblems for one small part of the company," said Myers.

It alsoscreens calls; takes messages if the call is not connected; andimmediately notifies the user by pager, short message service (SMS) ore-mail.  According to TPS, the service can connect more than 50percent of calls on the first attempt, compared with a U.K. average of20 percent.

Chicago was chosen because of its "high concentration ofmultiple types of radio traffic, a large variety of ... structures (includinghigh-rise buildings) and a complex customer base," Ameritech said.In its most sophisticated form, the PCS will be able to make use of signalingsystem 7 and integrated services digital network (ISDN), the RHC said.  It didnot say how the microcell channels would accommodate the greater bandwidthrequirements of ISDN and intelligent-network services.  Like most proposalsfor experimental PCSs, Ameritech's request gave little technical detail.The company would not say what manufacturer will supply the microcell basestations, interfaces to the public switched telephone network and hand-heldphones.Nor has the RHC determined where in the city it will start its test or when itwill begin, although it did say that it would conclude operations within twoyearsAmeritech said it would test three different services.  The first, and mostrudimentary, is similar to Britain's telepoint service.  Users will be ablemake and receive calls at home and make calls within 25 to 100 yards oftelepoint-type public base stations.The second phase will add an alert signal to let a customer know that a callis coming in.  As with the first phase, hand-off capability between cells willnot be available. The third stage network will allow customers to make andreceive calls from their homes and all public base stations and will havehand-off capability.Ultimately, up to 100 cell sites, each 50 to 200 yards in diameter, and 1,000portable handsets may be used.The RHC also will experiment with sending low-speed data over PCS, said DaveConnolly, Ameritech Services manager of corporate strategy.An important part of the trial will be testing what customers are willing topay for each type of service.  "We've had some people say, 'I don't wanttwo-way service.'  They don't want their phone going off in public," Connollysaid.How To Please Everyone?Ameritech envisions offering a variety of PCS services, he added. "At home,they may want full, two-way service like their regular phone.  Outside thehome they may want something else."Which presents Ameritech with the formidable problem of letting the customerchange service at will.  To arrange that, Ameritech will rely heavily onintelligence within its wireline network."When you read the other [PCS] filings and they ask for personalcommunications networks, they're asking for a specific type of service withswitching and intelligence and databases," Connolly said.  "We want to use ourown [wireline] network for that to keep the radio network simpler."By testing increasingly complicated systems, the RHC also will face thedifficulty of finding one or more manufacturers who will develop products toorder, Connolly noted.  Sticking with one manufacturer would simplify matters,but "We're going to see how things develop and who can to what for us" beforedeciding, he said.The company emphasized that it will develop an interface between the radiosystems and its wireline network that will allow furnishing ISDN andout-of-band signaling.At today's state of the art, however, Ameritech won't be able to provide true"2B+D" service over the channels covering just 50 MHz of radio spectrum.Customers probably will not be able to use their PCS phones to transmit voiceand data at the same time, Connolly said, "But even one "B" plus "D" is betterthan other proposals,"  The D channel could be used to provide informationabout signal strength and facilitate hand-off, he said.  Andintelligent-network services such as call forwarding, selective call blockingand caller ID also would be possible.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNOVEMBER 7, 1990PCS SUGGESTIONS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAR -- NOBODY AGREESThe personal communications service (PCS) comments submitted to the FCC Oct. 1set a landmark of sorts.  Rarely have so many parties intensely held suchdifferent views about what a new service is or should be.  Roughly 100personal communications service (PCS) comments, comprising some 3,000 pages,submitted to the FCC Oct. 1, testify to the discord.But on one thing commentors agree:  Consumers want new wireless services.According to figures furnished by Motorola, there are more than 100 millioncommunications devices (excluding CB and toys) in use today.  Land mobileaccounts for 48 million subscribers, as of Jan. 1, 1990.Over 50 million cordless telephones are in service.  And cellular subscribershave passed the 4-million mark.  Motorola projects that these combinedcategories will grow from 100 million to almost 500 million by the end of thisdecade.  That would equal nearly one wireless device for every two localaccess lines. Millicom backs up its contention with a study from Arthur D.Little which indicates that 40 percent of all U.S. households would subscribeto PCN if it were priced $10 above existing telephone service.  The percentagedropped to 14 if the service were priced at $40 above existing telephoneservice.CT-2, or outgoing, telepoint-type systems; digital European cordlesstechnology (DECT), a CT-2 variation accepted in Europe; and personalcommunications service (PCS) proponents are joined by cellular carriers,telephone companies and private radio service providers in their optimismabout the vast market potential for both wireless devices and services.That's where agreement stops.  As a result, PCS is sure to be built on afoundation of controversy.The Miles-Per-Hour SpectrumGTE, for instance, sees PCS in "miles-per-hour" categories.  That is, thespeeds at which mobile users are moving.  It characterizes today's cellularservice as a "60 mph service," in which customers are moving at high speedsover wide areas.  To GTE, a new "6 mph service" is emerging that will meetpedestrian needs -- a local offering designed for short walking distances.Finally, GTE envisions a "zero mph service" that would be used in specificlocations.  Wireless PBX or wireless building networks fall under thiscategory.In contrast, McCaw Communications, one of the largest non-wireline cellularcarriers in the country, envisions PCS as a continuum of mobile servicesintegrated into a seamless network. In this plan, cellular provides the corenetwork on which new microcellular PCS services will be introduced.Pedestrian and in-building needs should be met by existing cellular spectrumor through new spectrum for cellular carriers.Telephone companies have a fundamentally different view.  They see wirelessservices as a new means of accessing the established public switched network.These "tetherless" access systems would consist of residential- orbusiness-area transceivers which would:  1) be a substitute for local loops,2) replace in-building wiring with more flexible systems,  3) provide localarea computer networks,  4) meet needs of special communities such as trailerparks, marinas, resorts and convention centers, and  5) provide a lessexpensive form of telephone service to remote areas, now referred to as basicexchange telephone service.The telephone companies insist that PCSs are best built upon the telephoneinfrastructure of the future with its digital switching, integrated servicesdigital network transmission, signaling system 7 and intelligent-networkcapabilities.New Kid On The BlockMillicom and other PCS proponents have a radically different concept in mind.To them, PCS will be a stand-alone, digital network of advanced microcellularnetworks.  Local-exchange telephone service would be a competitive businessopportunity, not an infrastructure to be built upon.CT-2 and DECT advocates argue that pedestrian-based services can offerimproved residential cordless services, new public payphone services andin-building telecommunications.  They complain that industry analysts areunfairly denigrating their capabilities and overstating the ability of PCS andcellular to meet such needs.Private radio service providers are concerned that the commission's notice ofinquiry talks about common-carrier services without leaving adequate room forprivate-carrier provision of PCS.  Private carriage may be appropriate incases such as self-contained, in-building networks. Cordless telephonemanufacturers simply want out of the PCS debate.  They worry that theTelecommunications Industry Association's request for new 46-49 MHzfrequencies will be delayed and ensnared in the PCS melee.As if these different visions of PCS weren't enough cause for debate, thecomments reveal sharply contrasting technical, spectrum-allocation,eligibility and federal/state jurisdiction issues.Will It Work?Three basic technical approaches for PCS are suggested.  Not one of them,however, has been field tested in a real-life situation. Qualcomm advocatescode division multiple access (CDMA), a digital, spread-spectrum technologythat permits numerous calls on one channel.  CDMA would permit PCSs to sharefrequencies with existing services, its advocates say.Motorola, GTE and AT&T question whether CDMA can operate without its ownexclusive spectrum allocation.  Millicom's test in Orlando, Fla., where aversion of PCS will be tested in the private, fixed microwave range, mayresolve the question. Time division multiple access (TDMA) systems similarlydo not emerge unscathed.  Motorola, McCaw and others note that TDMA has notbeen adequately tested.Centel has announced another variant -- "narrow advanced mobile phone systems"(NAMPS). NAMPS, an analog technology, would use discrete portions of thecellular bands for microcellular applications.  The technology, developed byMotorola, will be tested next year in Las Vegas. A fourth option, only hintedat to date, is frequency hopping. AT&T has indicated it will explore thistechnology.In short, no one really is sure what CDMA, TDMA, NAMPS or frequency hoppingcan offer.  They must undergo a wide variety of tests in the lab and in thefield.  Until test results are in, the agency can't answer questions such aswhether spectrum sharing is possible or how many PCSs technically could beaccommodated in any given market.  The last point clearly affects whether ornot PCS spectrum scarcity is real or perceived. The FCC specified 1850-1990MHz as a potential home for PCS.  But none of those holding licenses tooperate in that spectrum are stepping forward to volunteer to relocate.  Infact, law enforcement agencies, petroleum companies, railroads, broadcasters,public utilities and others have all argued that it would be prohibitivelyexpensive and technically dubious for them to be evicted from or forced toshare their spectrum.Stunting GrowthIn addition, private and common carrier land mobile operators want to hang onto the three unused 1 MHz slices of spectrum in the 900 MHz band that the FCChas suggested using for CT-2 and DECT.  They need it, they say, to handlespecialized mobile radio and paging growth.Here, engineering fades and a political question appears:  Does the FCC havethe will and fortitude to act in the face of such opposition?Assuming the FCC finds new spectrum for PCS, the most contentious issue of alllooms -- Who will be allowed to file for new spectrum?  The FCC's noticeoffers two tentative possibilities. First, to promote competition, cellularcarriers would be barred from using new PCS spectrum to expand their systems.Second, some new spectrum might be set aside for local telephone companies tointroduce new telephone services.Telephone companies, of course, support a telephone-company set-aside.Non-wireline cellular carriers strenuously oppose any prohibition that wouldprevent them from applying for new spectrum within their own cellular markets.If The nature of the game and the rules are settled, that still leaves thequestion of referees.  State utility commissions argue against any FCCpreemptions or classification of PCSs as private radio services.  That wouldautomatically preclude state regulation under Section 332 of theCommunications Act.  They are joined by rural independent telephone companiesconcerned about PCS as bypass threats.The plain fact is that there aren't many hard facts in the opening comments.Nor is it likely that such information will materialize in time for the Dec. 1reply comments.  Given this state of affairs, the commission is left either toremain idle until tests are finished or to take a more active role and setguidelines. -- Nancy J. VictoryNancy J.

It beginsbroadcasting a regular, pulsing signal over the low end of the FM band.Patrol cars pick up the signal on special Lo-Jack receivers, which print outthe stolen car's description and vehicle identification number.A compass-like device in the patrol car points in the direction of the stolencar, indicating which way to turn to home in on it.Since the company began selling them in Massachusetts in 1988, 50,000 Lo-Jackunits have been installed, and 1,200 stolen cars have been retrieved -- a 95percent success rate -- the company says.Lo-Jack sells its transmitters through new-car dealers and provides thepatrol-car receivers and related equipment to police departments for a nominal$1 charge.With 15 million new vehicles sold each year in the U.S. -- and a car stolenevery 30 seconds -- Lo-Jack has tapped into a lucrative market, sayssecurities analyst Jyoti Aggarwala, whose firm, Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., ofNew York, recommends Lo-Jack stock as a long-term investment. If the companywins just 1 percent of the new car market, it will garner $45 millionannually, she estimates.But Lo-Jack, which went public in 1983, has yet to show a profit, largelybecause it must spend about $2 million each time it enters a new state,according to company president Michael Daley. Lo-Jack's current strategy is tofocus on stolen-vehicle recovery, not vehicle location.  It strives to get itssystems adopted by police agencies, preferably the state police, in what Daleyterms the "top 10 states," where 60 percent of the nation's auto sales andthefts occur.Though it only expanded outside Massachusetts in 1988, Lo-Jack already hasrecruited police departments in Miami, Chicago and Detroit, and anticipates anagreement with state police in Illinois, where 63,000 cars were stolen in1988. Daley and Aggarwala agree that Lo-Jack should be profitable by 1992.By then, however, Lo-Jack may be feeling the heat from some competitors.  Sofar there is one entry: the Intercept system from Code-Alarm of MadisonHeights, Mich.Sounding The AlarmWhen an Intercept-equipped car is stolen, a transmitter hidden in the vehiclebegins broadcasting the car's location to Code-Alarm's headquarters, using thecellular telephone network. The module knows the car is stolen because othersensors on the car have been tripped, explains Mary Gingrich, Code-Alarm'soperations coordinator.The module knows its location because it receives the broadcasts of the LoranC network, a nationwide radio navigation system used by aircraft and boats,which also covers one-third of the land area of the continental United States.Code-Alarm headquarters, in turn, notifies local police of the stolen car'slocation and even its speed.Gingrich says that, if police approve, Code-Alarm can tell the Interceptmodule to shut off the gas to the car's motor, bringing any chase to agrinding halt.Other competitors with products in the works include an Indianapolis, Ind.,firm named MITS Inc. and International Tele-trac systems, which is testing acellular-based system for tracking fleet vehicles that Daley says could easilybe adapted to tracking stolen ones.Of these, Teletrac's could represent a major threat because of Teletrac'spartnership with PacTel Corp., the cellular telephone subsidiary of Bellregional holding company (RHC) Pacific Telesis.  (Lo-Jack has challenged thatpartnership as a violation of the AT&T Consent Decree's ban on the provisionof information services by RHCs.)Lo-Jack suffers a disadvantage over such competitors, noted Dennis Zogbi, ananalyst with the U.S. Market Perspective division of World InformationTechnologies in Northport, N.Y. "Owners have to notify police before a searchfor a car begins. If somebody steals a car at night, the owner may not beaware of it until morning.  In New York City, most cars stolen in Manhattanare driven into New Jersey and disassembled in "chop shops" within 30minutes."Element Of SurpriseDaley acknowledged the potential problem, but said that Lo-Jack owners havehad little difficulty in actual practice.  "We don't perceive it as aweakness," he said.  "We have recovered cars within hours, days and weeks ofbeing stolen without damage.  The thief doesn't know whether a driver has lefta car for a few minutes or a long time."Thieves also don't know if the car is equipped with Lo-Jack, and aren't likelyto take the time for a thorough search, Daley said. "In this state[Massachusetts] we've had thieves steal the car, then drive it somewhere tocool off.  They go back in several days to see if it's still there."In real life, more sophisticated systems such as Code Alarm's havedifficulties, too, Daley said.  "The owner must set codes on leaving the carand returning."  If not, the alarm goes off.  If the owner forgets the code ora family member who doesn't know the code takes the car, a false alarm mayresult.In any case, there is still a delay.  "The police must contact the owner toverify that it is, in fact, a stolen vehicle.  The police don't want to beembarrassed or be sued for false arrest," Daley said. "And since they operateon cellular, they can only be used in cities or areas of heavy vehicletraffic," he noted.In confronting these competitors, Lo-Jack will likely maintain a decided priceadvantage, Agarwalla notes.  Its Lo-Jack Retrieve product, the transmitter,sells for $595, including installation, which Lo-Jack representatives dothemselves, randomly concealing the device in one of 35 locations on the car.There are no monthly charges because the unit is used only if police activatea hunt for it.For customers in Massachusetts and Florida, the deal is even better:Insurance companies there give those who also buy Lo-Jack's optional $100Lo-Jack Prevent product, a theft-prevention device, at least a 25 percentreduction in the cost of their comprehensive auto insurance coverage.And, if the customer's car is stolen and not retrieved, any Lo-Jack customergets his Lo-Jack investment refunded. By comparison, Code-Alarm's Interceptcosts $1,495, including installation and a cellular telephone.Lo-Jack scored a coup last year when the FBI, at Lo-Jack's request, persuadedthe FCC to designate a special frequency (173.075 megaHertz) for usenationwide by Lo-Jack's small transmitters.Daley says the FCC's action will smooth police acceptance of the devices,eliminating the need to gain a specific FCC license for each state.For the future, Daley says Lo-Jack will "expand this network till we cover oneend of the country to the other," largely by winning the involvement of policeagencies along major transportation corridors on both coasts and alongInterstate 80 through the Midwest and West, he says.Lo-Jack, he adds, is also discussing cooperative arrangements with Europeanpolice agencies, and, one day, would like to expand the use of its technologyto recover stolen aircraft and boats. Just last year, he notes, a Lo-Jack unitinstalled in a truck led to the breakup of a hijacking ring when that truckwas stolen and tracked to a Florida warehouse.Police found the truck in less than an hour, Daley says.-- Edward WarnerBack to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNOVEMBER 7, 1990TELEPOINT-TYPE SYSTEMS MORE LIKELY TO BECOME PROFITABLEA British consulting firm has concluded that telepoint-type systems, limitedthough they are, are more likely to return profits to investors than personalcommunications networks (PCN)."We see a window of opportunity for telepoint," said Enda Hardiman, generalmanager of telecommunications market analysis for London-based BIS Mackintosh.Telepoint, as used in Britain, is a one-way telephone system accessed outsidethe home.  Users move to within a few hundred yards of a base station(typically mounted on a building) and make outgoing calls.The keys to telepoint success, according to BIS, are its low cost compared topersonal communications and telepoint's proven technical feasibility.  Threesuch systems have been operating in London for more than a year, noted IanReese, author of an analysis comparing telepoint to PCN.  In contrast, no PCNshave been put into commercial service or given field tests."PCN operators are caught between a rock and a hard place," Hardiman said.The current estimate to produce a PCN phone, which can receive calls as wellas make them, is about $3,000, he said.  A telepoint phone, which is limitedto placing outgoing calls, costs about $400.PCN operators are either going to have to retain a high price for the phonesor subsidize them with income from high airtime charges, Hardiman said.Because PCN must be considered a riskier investment than telepoint, operatorswill have to pay higher interest rates to investors, according to Reese.  As aresult, a PCN system large enough to cover 60 million people (about thepopulation of Great Britain and Ireland combined) would become profitable nineor 10 years after startup.Getting The PaybackA telepoint system of equal capacity, on the other hand, would begin makingmoney in its sixth year, according to Reese's analysis."Unlike telepoint, PCN is unproven, and the rational investor should attach ahigh level of risk to investment in PCN," BIS said.PCN is seen as a much larger system, attracting some seven million subscribersby the end of the seventh year of operation, as opposed to 600,000 telepointsubscribers in the same period.Revenue per subscriber would be about the same, however. Telepoint subscribersare projected to pay about $700 a year for airtime, whereas PCN subscriberswould pay about $800, according to Reese.  The telepoint figure matchesrevenues quoted by current system operators.  The PCN estimate is based uponaverage use of cellular telephones in the United Kingdom.BIS estimates that the hypothetical PCN would realize a profit of about $100million in its first year in the black, or 3.6 percent of total investment.By the end of the same period, telepoint would increase in value about 75percent, Reese said.  That corresponds to an increase in value of about $104million on an investment of $140 million. The sizeable increase can beattributed to predicted profit margins.  "Like other telecommunicationsinfrastructure investments, once the major initial capital outlays have beenrecovered there is considerable potential for large and sustained profits asthe service matures," BIS said."PCN must, for the time being, be regarded as a high-risk investment withuncertain long-term yield prospects," Reese concluded.Bell Atlantic, which proposes to begin a telepoint field test in Philadelphiain December, had no estimates of demand for service or when a commercialsystem might become profitable. "At this time, we're just testing thetechnology," a spokeswoman said.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNOVEMBER 7, 1990PAC TEL PROPOSES MOST EXTENSIVE U.S. PCS TESTPacific Telesis has proposed a two-year, five-city research project intopersonal communications service (PCS) radio frequency (RF) propagation andsystems performance.Pac Tel applied for an experimental license on the eve of the Oct. 1 deadlinefor comments on the FCC's inquiry into advanced wireless technology."PCS is more than just wireless cellular," said Stagg Newman, Pac Tel'sassistant vice president for corporate strategy.Pac Tel wants to "provide a 'global' picture of radio propagation andinterference characteristics at different frequencies," he said.  The systemstests are designed to "provide an understanding of the new PCS systemalternatives, including propagation characteristics, system capabilities,functionality, economies and preliminary user acceptance," the company said.Although Pac Tel, Pacific Bell and PacTel Cellular will focus on advancedwireless communications, many of the features contemplated will rely onintelligent network capabilities. If Pac Tel's experimental license isgranted, testing will start with examinations of how signals of variousfrequencies and power levels behave in different cities, starting with SanFrancisco and Los Angeles and reaching across the country to Chicago, Dallasand New York.Narrowband and wideband testing will be done in the following frequencyranges: 614-806 megaHertz (now allocated to UHF television), 824-849 MHz and869-894 MHz (cellular telephone services), 849-851 MHz and 894-896 MHz(air-to-ground services), 864-868 MHz (public safety and specialized mobileradio).Also, 901-902 MHz, 930-931 MHz and 940-941 MHz (general purpose mobile radioand advanced paging) 902-928 MHz (industrial, scientific and medical [ISM]services, automatic vehicle location and amateur radio), 1850-1990 MHz(point-to-point microwave), 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz (point-to-pointmicrowave) and 2400-2483.5 (ISM and low-power or spread-spectrum uses).Pac Tel will seek out "challenging RF environments" to test propagation andinterference characteristics.  "These tests  will encompass five metropolitanareas, each with distinct topography, and will include a combination ofin-building, on-street and unique coverage situations at ranges of less thanand greater than one kilometer," the company said.The tests will attempt to answer some of the questions the FCC posed in itsPCS inquiry, namely:  "Can PCS be overlaid within existing spectrumallocations on a shared basis?" and "Can multiple spread spectrum operatorsshare the same spectrum?"Newman said these tests will attempt to settle the debate about whetherspread-spectrum technologies can, in practice, share the same frequencies aspoint-to-point microwave.Seeing DoubleThe second phase of Pac Tel's testing proposal will focus on tests of at leasttwo "technology platforms" and will reflect experience gathered from the RFpropagation and interference research.  About 100 handsets and 20 to 30 basestations will be established for each technology in a given city.The basic system will offer a "low-end, low-functionality" service with small,low-cost handsets providing an "enhanced version of CT-2," according toNewman.  The second will be a "high-end, next-generation cellular" servicecomplete with "intelligent network functionality," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightADVANCED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNOVEMBER 7, 1990TELEZONE SET TO BEGIN IN 1992American TeleZone will begin public service in two years, according to CEORobert Gray.

The company's one-way, telepoint-type systemwill operate under Part 15 of the FCC's rules, governing devices such asmodel-airplane controls, which do not require licenses.TeleZone's greatest lure will be price.

In the last twoyears, nothing has happened.Union ChallengeMore serious, though, has been the challenge to change mounted bythe labour union which has threatened to bring the country to ahalt. The union activists fear that privatisation will mean loss ofjobs, reduced benefits and job insecurity, and have found a numberof allies among extremist religious and student groups. The climaxof their activities was in June when they seized the office of theMinister of Information and Communications.KT Vision 2005As a result, Korean president Kim Young-Sam sacked the president ofKT and installed Lee Joon, a former four-star general who was incharge of the First Army. Lee Joon is taking the credit for "KTVision 2005".Experts, however, believe that, so far, privatisation, and possiblythe new vision, are intended to be mainly cosmetic gestures todistract attention from KT's troubles.Others doubt that the company will be able to transform itselfsuccessfully into the envisioned dynamic competitive carrier whenit really loses its monopolies. The big squeeze is already upon KT.Competition started in the long distance business this year and thegovernment is even set to licence two carriers to enter the keylocal call business by the end of this year.It is believed that the strongly entrenched vested interests ofmonopolies will not relinquish their benefits without a fight, andKorean monopolies are showing themselves to be of an usuallyresilient breed that are very hard to break up.Therefore, the government is going to have great difficulty inmeeting its obligation to move KT into the private sector by 1998,which it is committed to do under World Trade Organisation (WTO)provisions.OECD MembershipFailure to do so would also jeopardise Korea's claim to membershipof the OECD. With such powerful opposing forces in conflictingmotion, the near and medium-term weather in and around KT looksdistinctly cloudy.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BRIDGING YOUR BUSINESS WITH THE TELEPHONE SYSTEMfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11A large transportation company provides improved customer serviceutilising a simple screen pop based upon the calling lineidentification (CLID) feature of ISDN.As a customer calls in to request a pickup of a parcel, the accountrepresentative automatically sees the customer's profile before thecall is answered.This type of service can significantly reduce the call duration ofa standard parcel pickup request and removes the majority of therepetitive components of the customer service representative'sdaily routine.Furthermore, this CTI customer has enhanced the databaseapplication that the customer service representative uses so thatthe database application automatically prompts the customer servicerepresentative to discuss issues that the caller has inquired aboutpreviously as well as additional information such as serviceenhancements and parcel tracking.Possible enhancements to this customer's configuration would be toscreen the incoming calls and review the customer numbers.Premium customers (the 80/20 rule where 80 per cent of yourrevenues are generated from 20 per cent of your customers) could bequeued with higher priority into the call center.As well, an automated voice response system could be used to screencallers looking for tracking information and parcel confirmation.A credit card service bureau with local call centers in Japan, SanFrancisco, New York, and Paris implemented a networked CTI solutionwhich provided a complete pay back in less than four months on longdistance toll charges alone.This customer provides services for Japanese credit card holders.As is typical in a service bureau, the agents are required toprovide a different level of service for different callersdepending on the services that the originating company contractedwith the service bureau.In this particular case, the average call duration was eightminutes as agents scrambled to determine the appropriate level ofservice based on the callers profile.The service bureau implemented a complete CTI solution in which aSQL database was integrated with an voice response system and acomplete integrated network of call centers.When an incoming call terminates on an agent, the SQL database willbe automatically triggered to enable the appropriate services forthe caller based upon the DNIS number and the callersidentification.Depending on the callers' request, the caller inquiry could beserviced locally or transferred (with the account data attached) toa remote call center.This configuration reduced the average call duration from eightminutes down to three minutes per call and significantly enhancedthe professionalism of the call center.Another CTI customer is a service center for a large multinationalsemiconductor firm.They have centrally located their Asian call centre and configureda series of 1-800 telephone numbers from all Asia-Pacific countriesto centrally terminate upon the call center. The call center isconfigured in teams which provide an account-focused servicecenter.Each team handles calls from a particular country and/or account.The customer uses a CTI technology to provide priority queuing forthe premiums customers, as well as basic ACD overflow capabilitieswhere, if all the team members are engaged, the calls will overflowto another team/cell.This CTI solution has provided a means for this customer to providea centralised call center which centralises the unique skillsrequired to support their customer, as well as enhancing theservices for previous customers.Next IssueNext month, we will take a look at the latest API-Javatel. This APImay turn out to be the best way  to ensure long term viability inyour CTI solution because Java will be supported on multipleplatforms. The Javatel API will support  multimedia transmissionover both the Internet and regular phone lines.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996NORTEL CONTRACTfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11Mandarin Communications, one of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees, hasawarded Nortel a contract worth HK$426 million (US$54.9 million)for a DCS 1800 network.

These will raise network layout coststremendously, though it is believed that expected increase innetwork traffic within Hong Kong will compensate for that cost. Theresearch also notes that the company is addressing issues such ascost control to position itself strategically in the global telecommarket. According to Dan Sherman, regional telecommunicationsanalyst at Salomon Brothers, "HKT is lowering its cost structurewhich alone should enable the company to exceed currentexpectations. Growth earnings will be seen in the range of 13 to 15per cent over the next three years".Slashes in expenditure are coming through staff reduction byretrenching 700 to 1100 heads per year until 1998; an upper targetof 13,500 job cuts is expected to be reached by end of 1998.Other major cost cuts are being implemented by outsourcing its dataand technical services to IBM, allowing an estimated savings ofHK$50 million (US$6.45 million) per year, says the report.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ATM CHARGE BY GDCfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11US-based ATM switch specialist, General DataComm (GDC), is bringingApex-Strobos, its latest 25 Gbps ATM edge switch to the region.

Pager growth saturated anddeclined, while trunk radio continues to be a "niche" and privatenetwork application. And CT2 has been replaced by cellularupgrades.Most telecom analysts tend to agree with Smartone's view point ofthe wireless telco market, but tread carefully when commentingabout the future. They say the wait-and-see approach has to betaken.Analysts say, "with the new PCS license been awarded, it isinteresting to see whether the six service providers can come outwith products and services on time as promised.""Right now in Hong Kong the cellular penetration is 16 per cent outof a population of 6 million," said Christopher Lau, controllerservices of Smartone.

And the market changes aredriven by competition, technology, regulations, the countrieseconomy and peoples life style.Lau said, "to date Smartone has 100,000 subscribers under its belt,but this figure will grow further as the market changes."But Smartone's predictions for the next 18 months are optimistic.They claim that there will be an emphasis on non-voice services andproviders will explore new market segments due to saturation ofusage, competition and user behaviour change.There will be messaging service developments with extensive use ofIVR/voice messaging together with voice recognition enhancement.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ISDN GATEWAY FROM REDCOMfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11Redcom has launched its ISDN Gateway Exchange (IGXA).

(CITIC), Siemens, and American InternationalGroup, Inc.The partners are expecting around 600,000 subscribers to connect toits network by the year 2010. Running on GSM, the network willcover the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan and QingDao. China Unicom, theonly cellular competitor to the MPT, will operate the GSM networkswhich is expected to boost the European technology further in thecountry. Currently, China is also trialling the DCS 1800 systems,as a compliment to its 900 MHz spectrum.Biggest MarketKurt Hellstrom, president of Ericsson Radio Systems and aparticipant at the session, noted that Asia's growing demand forcellular services is lucrative enough to make it the swedishtelecom giant's biggest market, quoting that Hong Kong and Chinawere already its second biggest trading place. Referring to HongKong's new PCS licences, he pointed that networks for such serviceswould also be GSM-based, only operating at a higher frequency bandthan current systems.These new mobile services roll-out and associated value addedservices will only increase penetration level of mobilecommunications in the territory from 18 to 40 per cent by the nextmillennium, and the role of equipment suppliers will be to keep theprices low to stimulate demand in mass markets such as Hong Kong.Five of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees have already opted for theGSM standard.However, some major concerns of operators still need attention-onebeing billing and collection where their major concern is offeringservices to anyone that comes into their markets and recovering therevenues; the other major point of focus is the assurance ofroaming facilities to as many countries as possible to thesubscribers.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996MKTL'S PAGER LICENCE IN JEOPARDY OVER DE-ACTIVATIONfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11THE Ministry of Communications is planning to initiate actionsagainst Modi Korea Telecommunications Ltd (MKTL) for its failure tomaintain a database for its pagers, a pre-requisite for theindustry.It may even withdraw MKTL's licence.Family problems have led to dissent at the top level within theCalcutta-based MKTL's holding company, Rossell Industries, whosesales turnover has dropped steeply in 1995-96 to one-tenth itslevel two years earlier [Rs56.7 million (US$1.64 million), againstRs516.8 million (US$14.99 million) in 1993-94].On Sep 10, 1996, the Alipore Court had issued an order ofinjunction, restraining MKTL from de-activating the services ofnearly 1,000 subscribers.In utter disregard of the Court's instructions, MKTL disconnectedthe services of the subscribers on the night of Sep 11.The court issued another order on Sep 17, directing the company torestore all connections.This has not yet been done. MKTL has admitted that it is notmaintaining a database of pager users, and that it "needed thepagers physically to ascertain the codification".However, Appocon Consultants, in a letter to the Ministry ofCommunications, has strongly urged the cancellation of MKTL'slicence "in the larger interests of the general public, as they arenot competent enough to provide such services".Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996INDIAN MINISTER IN CORRUPTION CHARGEfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11Pandit Sukh Ram, minister for Communications in the ousted Congress(I) cabinet of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, is in the thickof a massive corruption scandal that is threatening to turn theentire telecoms world in India upside-down.Sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided hishouses in New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh), and found Rs 36million (over US$ 1 million) in loose cash and jewellery, lyingabout the houses in suitcases and attache-cases.While all this was happening, Sukh Ram himself happened to beabroad, having ostensibly gone there for medical treatment.The minister has since been trying every trick in the book to evadethe sleuths, and avoid coming back to India. The latest was that hehad produced medical certificates to show that, as a heart patient,he had been advised by his doctors not to travel to India duringSeptember.Sukh Ram has been unable to account for the money found in hishouses, but Congress is worried that he may  pass them off as fundscollected for the party.There were several telecom firms that were his favourites, notablyHimachal Futuristic Communications Ltd. (HFCL) and Advanced RadioMasts, whom he favoured with orders after overruling therecommendations of the Telecom Commission.Fiat IssuedThe new Communications minister, Beni Prasad Verma, has sinceissued a fiat to the Department of Telecommunications (DOT),separating the process of placing purchase orders from thedecision-making on telecom equipment.He has said that all future orders will be placed by theappropriate DoT authorities, and not by the minister.BY SHIRISH NADKARNICopyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ISDN SERVICES TO COMMENCE SOON IN INDIAfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11THE Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in India  has upgradedits existing Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) to commerciallyintroduce Inte-grated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services.Prospective users were provided with ISDN connectivity by end-October 1996.Worldwide, ISDN has emerged as a powerful tool for integratingvoice, data and image signals.It may even be used for provisioning voice, data and image servicesthrough an existing telephone network."The PSTN has been suitably upgraded through the installation ofISDN switches to handle computer data transfers at 64 Kbps.Digital Transmission"Previously, this was impossible. In addition, the PSTN facilitatesdigital fax and image transmission," said MP Modi, chairman,Telecom Commission."The speed of data currently transmitted through the PSTN issignificantly restricted by the design of codes supplied by variousswitching system manufacturers," he added.To date, the PSTN has been solely optimised for human voicetransmission at much lower speeds-ideally at 4,800 bauds per second(bps), going up to a maximum of 9,600 bps.As a result, to transmit computer data at high speeds-for example,at 64,000 bps (that is, at 64 kbps)-a user was compelled to obtaina leased line from the DoT at a phenomenal cost. Thus, theinstallation of a 64 Kbps line for a customer located 5 km awayentailed a minimum initial investment of Rs26,500 (US$750), coupledwith a bi-monthly charge of Rs5,000 (US$141).Worse, leased lines are prone to frequent failure.Further, since the line is exclusive, the user seldom has theoption to switch over to a new line.Officials at the DoT believe that ISDN subscribers will not facesuch problems, and that data transmission at 64 Kbps will bepossible at substantially reduced prices.A prospective ISDN subscriber will only need to procure a specialISDN handset for Rs300 (US$8.70), an ISDN PC card to obtain 64 Kbpsaccess, pay the DoT registration fee of Rs3,000 (US$87), and aRs1,000 (US$29) monthly rental as basic access rate (BAR).Simulataneous CallsImportantly, ISDN subscribers will be able to simultaneously handletwo independent calls on an existing telephone line.The transmission mode could be speech, data, image or video. Thecall set-up time between two ISDN subscribers is also very short,compared to PSTN.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996OPERATORS BANKING ON PHS AS ALTERNATIVE IN THAILANDfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY SUTHISAK KRAISRITHAILAND will finally became the second country in the world to usethe Personal Handyphone System (PHS), a cordless technology createdby Japan.Two operators are expected to introduce the system, UnitedCommunication Industry (Ucom) and the Shinawatra Group are makingthe first move to compete with fixed-line operators who have beenstepping into their mobile market.According to the Telephone Organisation of Thailand, there is stillroom for at least two more private mobile phone operators to investin the handyphone service as well.Shinawatra has been faced with fierce competition, especially fromthe in-flux of Internet-related businesses. To stay ahead, thedecision was made to embrace the handy-phone business."As Shinawatra Datacom has expertise in networking, it hascapabilities in providing handyphone services as well," said aShinawatra executive.The Ucom Group shares the same idea. But its proposal may be closerto reality.Ucom has been shouldering huge losses caused by the freezing of theCT2 business since three years ago. The company wants to convertthe one-way communication service-called Fonepoint in Thailand-intoa two-way service.Ucom plans to use Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication(DECT) technology to make the conversion.Potential DoubtTelecom analysts are doubtful of the potential of the PHS, and feelthat Thailand may not take to the technology as the Japanese havedone. Japan expects its number of registers to increase to threemillion by year end. A TA senior executive said PHS would becomeanother choice for those who could not afford mobile phones.The service is expected to gain wider acceptance in crowdedBangkok-which offers a big market-but probably not in theprovincial regions.Though the market potential is questionable, the Thai operatorshave no qualms about the technology.They believe that the investment in PHS is long-term and are hopingthat it will eventually develop into the same level as mobilephones.TA has promised to launch its personal handyphone by April nextyear while TT&T also plans to introduce its products at about thesame time. The difference is that TT&T has already scaled down itsinvestment from investing in 20 provinces to around 8 provinces.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996FOXCOM'S FIBREOPTIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEMSfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11System 7000 is a low cost L-band (950 MHz-1750 MHz) distributionsystem for satellite antenna remoting.The system is suitable for situations where the highest possibleperformance is not required and link distances do not exceed 10 km.The system is designed to take its RF input from an LNB ordownconverter and directly convert this to 1310 nm light by meansof a Fabrey Perot laser.

(HCL) and Optel-two companies it hadearlier accused of being involved in a cartel.In accusing the two companies, communications minister, Beni PrasadVerma, had said: "We will take a serious  view of any cartelisationthat takes place. We will write strongly to the directors of thesecompanies against their involvement in the formation of cartels,and ensure that we don't deal with these companies in future."In case companies get into a cartel again, we may be forced tofloat a global tender."But in mid-September, the DoT went ahead and placed orders with thesame companies-a proceeding that has caused waves of confusion towash through the industry."Since these two companies have been given the orders, it onlyfollows that they have gained from the cartelisation," said adisgruntled competitor who had also hoped to get the order.The tender had been floated on Mar 22 for the procurement of 21,000km of fibre optic cable.This included 9,000 km of six-fibre optical fibre cable, 10,500 kmof 12-fibre cable and 1,500 km of 24-fibre cable.Sixteen bidders had taken part in the tender. They includedSterlite Industries, Vikas Hybrid, Gujarat Optical, Birla Ericsson,Aksh India, Optel, HCL, Plasmac and Bhilai Wires, Surana Telecom,Sudarshan Telecom, Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited(HFCL), Uniflex Cables, RPG Telecom and Plasman Telecom.CartelWhen the bids were opened on May 21, it was found that all bidders,barring Sudarshan Telecom, had engaged in the cartel.They had quoted a price which was 16 per cent higher than the priceat which they had supplied orders the last time round.All the prices were in a narrow range, which indicated that thetelecom companies had probably met and decided upon the quotationsthey would make.Sudarshan's quotations were substantially lower than that of theother 15 bidders .It had quoted Rs717.2 million for the supply of 9,000 km of thesix-fibre cable, while the other bidders' quotes ranged fromRs961.9 million to Rs970.9 million.ScandalThis is not the only scandal to rock India's telecommunicationsindustry.In 1995, the former communications minister, Pandit Sukh Ram , hadscrapped the tender and placed orders with companies he favoured.Sukh Ram is currently in Tihar Jail for having assetsdisproportionate to his known sources of income.Meanwhile, the DoT has been finding it difficult to get the holdersof the Letters of Intent (LoIs) issued by it for six basic telecomcircles, to sign the licence and interconnect agreements.RPG Telecom, Tata Telecom, Hughes Ispat, Usha India, Essar Telecomand Reliance-Nynex have all raised issues such as port charges,billing disputes and arbitration, in separate letters to the DoT.No Re-negotiation"We are not re-negotiating the tender," explained a spokesperson ofEssar Telecom. "We want the scrapping of the clauses that wereadded later to the tender, and which would make the projectsfinancially unviable."The inclusion of port charges, for example, is downrightunreasonable."The LoI holders have also demanded that the roles of the DoT, theTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the licensor beclearly defined.Said the Essar official: "All regulatory matters, such as thereview of the licensee's technology, quality of service standards,and termination, revocation or suspension of licence, should be thesole responsibility of the TRAI.Arbitration"Arbitration should be undertaken by an independent panel chosen byan agreement between parties or undertaken by the TRAI when it isestablished."One of the major problems that the DoT is facing is that it issorely under-staffed.Many managerial positions are vacant and there have been nogovernment sanctions to recruit new people.The DoT is also plagued by the fact that all the telecom playersinsist on having their say whenever any modification is made to anyagreement.They are adamant that modifications should not be at the solediscretion of the telecom authority, but by mutual agreement.Clearly, considering the DoT's constant changes of stance in thepast, the operators are being extra cautious.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996TWO-WAY PAGING SOLUTION FROM NEXUS FOR ASIA-PACIFICfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY LAWRENCE NORMIENexus Telecommunications Systems was founded in 1991 to develop andmanufacture portable wireless communication and location productsfor two-way paging, automatic vehicle identification, andindustrial monitoring telemetry.Nexus has developed a  wide area communication and location networktechnology that combines the cost-efficiency of one-way pagingtechnology with the huge market potential of portable two-waycommunication and location systems.System OverlayThe Nexus approach is particularly attractive because its productoverlays existing paging system infrastructures, consequentlyimplementation and operation costs are significantly reduced.The Nexus two-way communications and location system exploits aone-way paging infrastructure for the out-bound communications link(from the network to the subscriber devices) and proprietarydigital  spread spectrum technology for the in-bound communicationslink (from the subscriber to the network).The frequency hopping spread spectrum technique is effective incombating interference due to spectral congestion, multipathpropagation and jamming as well as providing communicationssecurity. The network complies with US FCC standard Part 15 andoperates in the band between 800 MHz and 1 GHz.The network uses interferometric techniques to determine thelocation of a unit in the field.Transmissions from the unit are received by at least two basestations, each equipped with an array antenna to determine thedirection of arrival from the point of transmission.The arrival angle is calculated at each base station and the resulttransmitted to the command and control center, where the locationof the transmission is calculated and displayed on an electronicmap together with identification information.Nexus has been active in the Asia-Pacific market for two years. TheNexus "NexNet" two-way paging  and location network becameoperational in Sydney, Australia this September, following the Nov1995 signing of an agreement with INC Communication, an Australiancompany engaged in data communications, manufacturing, andservices.Wide Growth"The roll-out of the Nexus system and technology is the directresult of the wide growth of the paging market in Asia Pacific andthe popular demand for value-added services" said marketing managerAdi Pundak-Mintz.Shlomi Tenenberg (VP Sales) said that the company's 1997 objectivesinclude expansion into paging markets other than Australia.The company also is seeking additional partners for deploying itssystems in local markets in Asia-Pacific.Nexus technology already is being used under license in India andtwo-way paging and end-units are manufactured for Nexus by SamsungElectronics Corporation  (Korea) under a nonexclusive licensingagreement.According to Pundak-Mintz, specific product definition andmarketing  issues that relate specifically to Asia-Pacific includehigh volume usage, the requirement for special character sets inend-devices, and the high sophistication of technologically-adaptive customers.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ISRAEL-THE LAND OF HIGH TECH OPPORTUNITIESfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY PETER TSUKAHIRAHigh-tech business culture is being transformed as the rate ofworldwide technological change steadily increases.This is evident in fields none other than high-speed, local areaand wide area telecommunications.The personal computer revolution has placed even greater computingpower on the desktop in offices and homes around the world.With the explosive growth of electronic mail services and theInternet's World Wide Web, more and more people are using theirpersonal computers as networking end-stations than ever before.This surge of technological change, coupled with greater freedom ofaccess to networked information, is forcing the creation of newtypes of corporate structures.Older, hierarchical corporate structures with fixed chain-of-command reporting and clearly defined functional "borders" areunable to respond quickly enough to exploit developing marketopportunities.Today's high-tech markets consist of multi-national, multi-culturalorganisations where even small and medium-sized manufacturers areplayers in the global environment.De-centralised corporate structures, based on personalrelationships and shared goals rather than rigid organisationallines, are required to survive and thrive in this internationallycompetitive environment.Cultural MosaicIsrael's society is young in the sense that the modern nation isnot yet even 50 years old. Israel is a cultural mosaic ofimmigrants from literally every corner of the globe. Everyone, itseems, has a different cultural background and this has resulted ina society where boundaries tend to be relatively undefined andwhere extreme informality is considered normal.Israel is a small and militarily vulnerable country. Israeli armyofficers are taught to view advance planning as necessary, but onlyas a basis for making required changes. That is to say, they aretaught to quickly adapt to changing conditions, to improvise and tohave a positive attitude towards taking calculated risks.Despite having invented one of the world's first minicomputers inthe early 1970's, the Israeli computer industry has not been aforce to be reckoned with until quite recently.Israel's high-tech industry has grown rapidly and in the presentera of networked computing, this small nation fields a number ofhigh-tech developers and network device manufacturersdisproportionate to its size.Representatives from key industry publications confide that Israelhas joined the greater Boston area and Silicon Valley as a majorgeographical source of advertising dollars.The reasons for Israel's new-found prominence in this field ismultifarious. It has to do with the youth and vitality of modernIsrael, a highly educated workforce and the motivation of thetalent available.The Israeli high-tech industry excels at producing practical,robust and relatively simple solutions for complex problems.Perhaps this is the result of the kind of military training thatevery young man experiences as part of his upbringing.Quality performance in small groups and quick decision-making byjunior officers are Israeli traits developed in the army. Theseabilities will serve Israel well in the fiercely competitiveinternational high-tech marketplace.The computer networking world is still relatively new and growingrapidly. Small groups of highly motivated engineers working in non-structured environments can still create the next industry's "hotbox" or best seller product. Because time-to-market is crucial tothe success of a new product, quick decision making and on-the-flyimplementation are highly valued.These Israeli capabilities have not gone unnoticed in the globalsearch for high-technology talent. Huge multi-national companieshave begun acquiring  smaller Israeli high-tech communicationscompanies.In recent years, NiceCom, a Tel Aviv-based ATM developer wasacquired by 3Com; Scorpio Communications by US Robotics;intelligent hub maker, LanNet was acquired by Madge of the UK andLAN switch start-up, Ornet was bought by Siemens.I believe the Asia Pacific societies place a high value on virtueslike patience, self-discipline and social cohesion. This isreflected in the attitudes and behaviour of the workforce and Asian"corporate culture."These strengths lend themselves to precision manufacturing and highquality, low cost mass production. It seems that as soon as a giventechnology stabilises, companies in Asia Pacific add refinementsand then seize market leadership.This is apparent in the worldwide market for computer memory chips.This technology was pioneered in the US and Europe but now isdominated almost entirely by Asian companies.In spite of Asia Pacific dominance in a wide range of industriesfrom musical instruments and automobiles to optics and electronicequipment of all kinds, one vital technology has proven mostdifficult to master. This is the area of microprocessor design.While Asia is the champion of computer memories, the US hasmaintained a commanding lead in microprocessors.The major US chip manufacturers (Intel, Motorola, NationalSemiconductor) each have large facilities in Israel wheremicroprocessors and other devices like digital signal processorsare designed and built.The Intel Corporation recently completed planning for the nextgeneration Pentium processor, the first to be developed entirely inIsrael. Intel also announced plans for an additional US$1.6 billiondollar facility in Israel for flash memory fabrication.An interesting but little known fact is that Silicon Valley inCalifornia, a place where new technologies abound, is home to manyexpatriate Israelis. When some high-tech companies in Israelrecruit, they will often place ads in local San Jose newspapershoping to catch experienced returnees.As more Asian companies enter the global high-tech marketplace,contact with Israeli technology developers will grow.PartnershipsCollaboration between Israeli and Asian communications companieshave the potential to be extremely innovative and fruitful.There are already some notable partnerships existing todayproducing very positive results. Asian companies doing businesswith Israel stand to gain not only technology but ideas. Israel'sclose geographic and cultural proximity to Europe means access toEuropean market channels for Asian-Israeli business tie-ups.Israeli high-tech products are to be found in operation oncustomers' premises throughout Asia-Pacific. Direct investment inIsrael by South-east Asian multi-national companies is growing.Increasingly, in today's global marketplace, the Far East will bemeeting the Middle East in high technology.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE SUBSCRIBER LOOPfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11FOR many new telephone users in fast-growth telecom regions such asChina, Korea and India, their initial experiences have been withtraditional phone services over ordinary twisted-pair copperwiring.However, major telecom providers in China and other countries arenow installing sophisticated high-speed, high-bandwidth, all-digital backbone infrastructures.But for most users, primary telephone services will, for now, bebased on this traditional, POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)model.In POTS, the speaker's voice is carried over analogue circuitswhich originate at the telephone's microphone. The signal isdelivered to a subscriber-loop switch. There, the voice waves areconverted into digital information then sent via high-speed linesto the subscriber-loop switch of the receiving party.But even within POTS, significant advancements are underway,particularly in the key analog-to-digital and digital-to-analogconversion components, ie. the codecs.For instance, thanks to semiconductor integration, codecs and theirrelated filtering functions-which used to require multiple chips-were combined into single, integrated chips in the early 1980s.The resulting devices contributed substantially to the worldwideproliferation of digital telephone switches.Now and in the future, newer DSP (digital signal processing)technologies and smaller semiconductor process technologies areenabling designers to build codecs with multi-channelarchitectures.Today, each telephone number requires a unique codec in thesubscriber loop switch. Multi-channel codecs will be able to handleseveral independent subscriber telephone conversationssimultaneously.Eventually, as many as 32 channels may be integrated in a singlepiece of silicon.The savings in space and cost will be significant.And those savings will help further boost residential and businesstelephone installations in countries such as China, whereexpectations currently run as high as 20 million new lineinstallations per year.Fibre to the CurbAnother advance involves the continual distribution of telecomfunctions-and of "fat-pipe" digital bandwidth-closer to homes.To do that, telecom providers are now able to place a multiplexer,called a digital loop carrier (DLC-also known as a remote accessunit), between the subscriber-loop switch and the home.The DLC helps to extend the geographical area served, and itextends high-speed digital bandwidth for video and similarapplications closer to the user.This type of distribution permits bringing "fibre to the curb," orat least to the DLC.Although copper twisted pair and coaxial cable are digital-capable,fibre is preferred both for reasons of economy and because itpermits greatly extended service provisioning.Another critical subscriber loop function is the subscriber linecard, or SLIC.The SLIC co-exists with the codec at the subscriber loop switch orthe DLC. Its role is to perform certain supervisory functions, andto balance the subscriber loop in order to produce an optimalsignal.Subscriber loops vary in length and signal characteristics fromcountry to country and even among local services.In response, the newest trend in SLIC technology involves software-programmable balance features.These permit providers to make on-site adjustments to meet variousspecifications without requiring circuitry modifications. Theresult: remotely-controlled automation, and more easily distributedfunctionality.Digital to the DoorIn addition to "fibre to the curb", ISDN (Integrated ServicesDigital Network) is fast gaining notoriety as a major performanceenhancer for Internet communications.At up to 160 Kbps bandwidth, it can make Internet graphics seem tojump onto the screen-a vivid contrast to the less nimbleperformance of today's typical 14.4 and 28.8 Kbps modems.Beyond its Internet performance, the advent of residential ISDNrepresents a milestone in the evolution of the subscriber loop.By simply adding ISDN transceivers at each end of the subscriberloop, operators can make use of the same copper twisted pair wiringnow employed for low-speed analog services to deliver high-speed,all-digital information right to the user's own computer.All that is needed today, for people in many parts of the world, isan ISDN adapter card or external modem, and an added service fromthe telecom provider.And for users in countries with newly-developing telecominfrastructures, ISDN may be closer than it seems.Today, the services may be analog POTS, but the backbone andsubscriber loop switches in developing countries such as China,Korea, India, and Taiwan are ISDN-capable-good news for future ISDNusers in those regions.Also good news is the fact that, as with other technologies, futuregenerations of ISDN transceivers are destined to becomeincreasingly smaller and more economical.As with the codec, newer ISDN implementations will make use ofmultichannel architectures. As many as eight individualtransceivers may be integrated into a single silicon chip at thetelecom provider's subscriber loop switch, and this will help todrive down costs, and drive up availability.Semiconductor integration will benefit users in other ways.Future ISDN internal adapter cards (or external modems) willfeature increasing levels of integration.Today, those units contain numerous discrete support devices-fortranslating data formats between the internal PC bus and the ISDNtransceiver, for instance, or for the codec functions stillnecessary to support a second, standard telephone or fax service asa peripheral to the PC.In the future, they will be integrated with the microcontrollers,memory and other components that populate adapter cards into atrue, single-chip adapter card system.Video in the LoopWhat's next? Full motion video, for one thing, over standardtwisted-pair copper wiring, thanks to the "XDSL" (or X DigitalSubscriber Line) technologies: Asymmetric (ADSL), Hybrid (HDSL),and Very-high-speed (VDSL).In reality, a second pair of copper wires will have to be added tothe subscriber loop in order to do the job. But the result will bewell    worth the small additional infrastructure expense.For instance, ADSL has been tested at a download rate of more than6 Mbps, and an upload rate of 640 Kbps-faster than ISDN, and farbeyond today's common modem speeds.Moreover, ADSL is closer than many realise, as well.Numerous lower-speed ADSL products are already on the market.With ADSL-and with the advances in compression made possible bysophisticated DSP semiconductor technologies-telecom providers willfinally be able to offer high-quality movie transmissions toresidential users.Subsequently, the subscriber loop will be enhanced again by theaddition of HDSL as a user choice.HDSL may not offer as high a download bandwidth as ADSL, whichcontinues to improve as development progresses, but it will bringsymmetrical capabilities to twisted pair transmissions. This willopen the door to the possibilities of interactive movies and games,potentially a vast market.Along with ADSL and HDSL, will come VDSL. It may require adding asecond twisted pair to the telephone line.Most homes already have "twisted quad" or better wiring in place,even though they do not use it.In new installations, savvy telecom providers are likely to usemultiple pairs in order to be prepared for the future. VDSL willreward its implementers with a download bandwidth that could reach52 Mbps, and upload bandwidth as high as 6 Mbps.Bandwidth KnockingImportantly, these and other advances in subscriber-loopcapabilities will make possible exponential increases in home-delivered bandwidth-all over traditional twisted-pair copperwiring.By putting in place the infrastructure basics today-the high-speedwide-area digital backbones, and the digital-ready subscriber-loopswitches-the world's telecom providers are preparing the way forrelatively easy upgrades to higher-bandwidth technologies, and toadded user services.At the same time, these advances will not necessarily limit usersto a single, copper-wire transmission medium. Various cable-oriented providers are pushing hard to gain a share of the high-bandwidth residential/small office market via fibre-optic or hybridfibre/coaxial technologies.Advances in twisted-pair technologies will prove beneficial to thetraditional telecom providers, as will their experience withcommunications interactivity.As for the cable companies, they already have the high bandwidth;what they need is an interactive, economical "subscriber-loop"infrastructure-just like the telecom providers.In all probability, the users will benefit from having choices inboth technologies.Today's analogue POTS user can migrate forward as twisted pairbandwidth grows, and can elect to grow with POTS-or move to cable-at points along the way that are convenient for the user, and notdictated by industry vendors.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996TELECOMMUNICATION SWITCH MANUFACTURERS STILL RULESfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11While the computer manufacturers are gaining ground intelecommunications networks under IN's advances, there should be nomistake: the telecommunications switch manufacturer is still king.This is because the manufacturers can use IN functions as a leverin the sale of central office switches, and offer an entire packagethat is guaranteed to work flawlessly.Perwira Ericsson's AXE switches, currently delivered to TelekomMalaysia, include IN functions, as did Lucent's  shipments of 5ESSswitches to Philippines' Globe Telecom. Ericsson will add AXEswitches/SDH transmission equipment to those shipped to theGuangdong PTA by Lucent.Telecom equipment manufacturers also win IN contracts outside ofdirect switch sales. Ericsson has implemented a universal personaltelecommunications platform in Australia; and Guangdong-Nortel willsupply the Beijing Telecommunications Administration (BTA) with INfeatures that build on the CCS7 network supplied previously to theBTA.Switch manufacturers are collaborating with computing manufacturerstoo. Parts of Hewlett-Packard's (HP) OpenCall platform were used inNortel's ServiceBuilder architecture, and Lucent is working with HPto jointly develop IN functions.Switch manufacturers are also continuing to develop IN on theirown. This year, Lucent showed Advantage, an IN platform forcreation, customisation, and delivery environment of IN servicessuch as voice/fax mailboxes, voice activated dialling and onenumber services for mixed media. Advantage serves as both SCP andIP (see main story on page 10 for definitins) for wire line andwireless networks; its capabilities extend from the PSTN to dataand multimedia networks.Intelligent GainSiemens introduced the concept of using intelligent agents with INthrough its global advanced intelligent network (GAIN) platform.The idea was demonstrated with a calendar manager application thatautomatically arranged appointments in an electronic diary. Thosemessages could also be read over the telephone.Tandem Computers' NonStop operating kernel, and Himalaya andIntegrity IN middleware are joined by the S4000 Unix standardservers. The company's platforms have been installed for callprocessing, operations support systems and decision support.Vying to increase its role in telecommunications, HP's  strategyplans to serve as the hardware, operating platform and applicationsmiddleware.HP's OpenCall platform, released in September last year, is a bidto do much of the same for IN. In addition to its relationshipswith Nortel and Lucent, Fujitsu, Ericsson, and Nokia are somecompanies offering OpenCall support.IBM's Multiple Services Platform/6000 (MSP/6000) for business andresidential IN applications, uses the company's RISC System /6000operating under AIX. MSP/6000 can operate as both SCP and/or IP inthe network, and is bundled with software handling voice, fax, anddata IN. MSP/6000 uses CallPath DirectTalk/6000 as a voiceperipheral for voice messages, interactive voice response, andaudiotex. Data processing adds functions such as messaging andgateways for e-mail, and access to on-line services.Call management provides the SSP function and manages user andservice access to the MSP/6000 node. Messaging support adds line-based paging notification and applications interfaces to othermessaging systems.System IntegratorsBellcore, formerly the communications research facility of the UStelcos, is one of the world's most influential AIN consulting andengineering service companies. While Bellcore will work within theoperator's requirements, it also has its own IN/AIN service controlpoint system (ISCP) software. ISCP consists of SPACE (servicecreation and positioning software), DRS (data and reports system,for custom data collection and reporting), and a data distributor.For the IP component, Bellcore has its intelligent servicesperipheral, which allows voice or keyboard directions to accesscomplex IN functions.The Sema Group is a major systems integrator with a global reach aswell. A large part of the company's focus is in wireless systems,though its value added services manager (VAS Manager) provides anIN core around which wireless and wire line services can be built.The VAS Manager uses interactive voice response, and integratesvoice and text messaging, as well as supports wire line callrouting and wireless roaming.The integrator has worked together with Alcatel to supply wirelesscomponents to Indonesia's Satelindo as well.Unisys, a hardware supplier and systems integrator, offers its A-Series OpenFrame computers with its Network Applications Platform(NAP) software.For IN, NAP's VoiceSource application provides interactive voiceresponse. VoiceSource has been used for automated attendant,automatic collect calling, enhanced emergency services and audiocalling directories. It has also been used for networking (such asX.400), fax response, paging, and voice messaging services.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996TINA-THE NEXT MILLENNIUMfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11THE Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA)standard proposes two actions: to merge AIN (Advance IntelligentNetworks) and telecommunications network management with thecomputer industry's object-oriented software and client-serverdistributed computing concepts; while removing these functions fromtheir link to the underlying transport network.The management aspect of TINA is handled according to theTelecommunications Management Network (TMN) specifications.TINA is based on an "open" computing architecture, incorporatingthe Object Management Group's (OMG) common object request brokerarchitecture (CORBA).CORBA is used to allow software "objects" and applications to worktogether, independent of the underlying hardware and programminglanguage used. TINA's object definition language, for example, is asuperset of OMG's CORBA interface design language, using additionalconcepts for grouping, stream interfaces and service attributes tosupport real-time traffic in large networks.Part of TINA's charter is to fill the role as the service andmanagement platform for ATM and multimedia broadband services. Thismeans managing and providing Internet services and telecominfrastructure. TINA is meant to integrate completely into existingwire line and wireless IN infrastructures, and is being designed toco-exist and cooperate with all existing IN services.Service creation in TINA will be a matter of picking and choosingfrom a software object library of re-useable service components, towhich new components can be defined and added continuously.TINA ConsortiumThe TINA Consortium (TINA-C) was founded in 1993 and consists ofengineers from 40 telecoms and IT companies around the world (seeTable 1). With its HQ at Bellcore's facilities in the US, TINA-Chas a five-year charter to define and validate a softwarearchitecture that will allow communications services to beintroduced efficiently where computing, entertainment andtelecommunication industries are merging.This year, TINA-C will evaluate, validate, and refinespecifications whose completed architecture is expected to bepresented by the end of 1997.The TINA concept consists of several architectures; distributedcomputing, service, network and management.The computing architecture describes how software objects should be'plugged' into the distributed processing environment. The servicearchitecture defines how services are provisioned, accessed, andused. The network defines how the network resources are ordered andused to establish end to end connections. The managementarchitecture gives specifications for configuring, accounting,performance, and security.Unlike IN, which is applied separately to each call, TINA definessessions which can be any number of activities to achieve apurpose. There are several types of sessions under the servicearchitecture, eg. an Access Session defines the entrance into TINAservices, allowing the user to access, make requests, and retrieveinformation.Where UPT (universal personal telecommunication) exists today as abasic form of mobility, TINA defines three different types ofmobility for future universal mobile telecommunications systems(UMTS): Personal mobility allows a subscriber to use servicesindependent of their network point of attachment and specificequipment. This feature is offered by some PABXs, which allow anemployee to sit down at any handset, punch an identifying code, andhave access to all their personal, customised features.Terminal mobility makes use of terminals independent of the pointof attachment to the network, and exists today in the form of UPT.Session mobility, which allows service sessions to 'follow' theparticipant. This means that a subscriber could suspend a sessionand resume it from a different terminal at a later time. Thisallows the subscriber to request information and have it ready thenext time the service is accessed.Figure 2 gives an example of TINA-C operating for service deliveryto users through a telecoms network. The user domain represents theuser and their terminal equipment The content domain representsthose that produce or licence content for wholesale use, such asthe film industry or multimedia information providers.The network domain is the network operator, eg. PTT, which providesthe underlying connections to deliver the content. The retailerdomain is the brokers of information services who present and'sell' the available information services to the consumer.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996SWITCHING AWAY TO CLIENT-SERVER NETWORKSfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY BRIAN WASHBURNTHE Intelligent Network (IN), first thought up in the 1960s, hasgradually migrated from the telecommunications equipmentmanufacturers field into the realm of computing.In the early years, the intelligence resided in the switch. Eachswitch needed a "service logic", instructing it how to process anddirect calls. This meant that with any new service introduced, thesoftware in each switch had to be upgraded.As switch software became more complex, new IN features also becameriskier. In telecommunications where there was little room forsoftware bugs, IN services developed by telecoms switchmanufacturers often were not compatible.A simple solution was to take the service logic away from theswitch, and place it in a central computer, which would serve thenetwork. The switches would thus only hold the interfaces that sendand receive information with this central computer. This developedinto the modern concept of IN.Today, the IN market is inhabited by a mix of computing, softwareand telcos. Together with telecommunications network management, itappears that the computer manufacturers are gradually making in-roads on a hardware basis and looking towards inheriting the restof the field as well.Freephone (toll free) and premium rate services were some of thefirst IN features developed using off-switch computing.More advanced IN features  today include universal personaltelecommunications (UPT), or one number services, and virtualprivate networks (VPNs). UPT introduces the concept of the mobileterminal, routing calls by various schemes to the subscribers,regardless of whether they are at home, at work, or travelling witha mobile handset.VPNs allow Centrex services to be available over the wide areainstead of on a switch by switch basis, allowing four digitinternal dialling and other features such as call hold, callforward, and three way conferencing through the public network.To denote the difference between the simpler IN services(freephone) and those advanced services, the term AdvancedIntelligent Network (AIN) came into use.AIN describes IN that gives greater control to the computer, and isless reliant on the central office switches.In March 1992, the ITU defined Intelligent Network Capability Set 1(IN CS-1), which set a global standard frame work for constructingadvanced IN services and interfaces. Last year, the ITU-T completedenhancements to CS-1. Defining additional IN capability sets (CS-2,CS-3) under Study Group 11/Working Party 4 of the ITU-T isprogressing well, and the work is published under the Q.12XX seriesof recommendations.Components in today's IN architecture are: the service switchingpoint (SSP), service control point (SCP), service creationenvironment (SCE), service data point (SDP), service managementsystem (SMS), and intelligent peripheral (IP) (see Figure 1).The SSP is an element installed at the local exchange. When a callrequests an IN service, eg. by dialling a calling code thataccesses a freephone service, the SSP sends the request over thesignalling network to the service control point, which uses thecommon channel signalling system 7 (CCS7) or other signallingprotocol. It then awaits instructions on how to handle the call.The SCP is the "intelligence" behind the IN. It receives requestssent by the SSPs, processes and sends a reply such as call routinginstructions back to the SSP. It does not matter how many SCPs arein the network, or where each is located, as long as each switchhas an SCP it can access.The SDP is another name for a database which connects and suppliesthe SCP with data. Some IN services need to store a great deal ofdata, eg. UPT system contains several cross-referenced phonenumbers for hundreds of thousands of customers.The IP provides custom resources for interaction between a user andthe IN. Presently, this is voice processing coupled with servicessuch as speech and number recognition for wire line or wirelessnetworks.The SCE and SMS are not part of the actual active services underthe IN make-up. Rather, the SCE is a design and modellingenvironment to develop and test new services before loading themonto the SCPs. The SMS handles central network management for theSCPs, and is used to introduce and distribute new softwarethroughout the network.IN, however, is not only a matter of adding intelligence to thepublic network, its challenges reach far beyond the IN componentsthemselves.Billing is one issue that needs to be resolved. Fortunately, INbilling is somewhat similar to toll-operator billing. In networkswhere operator assistance, call collect, and third party billingare incorporated into the billing infrastructure and eventuallyfind their way onto the subscriber's invoice, adding IN support isanother step in the same direction.IN requires capturing information and adding the charges tosubscriber invoices. Many current billing systems are inflexibleand must be modified to accommodate the more complex IN, especiallywhen services like usage-based IN service metering are introduced.Additionally, the IN equipment needs some sort of accountability togenerate reports.Things become even more complex when multiple network services areinvolved. UPT that incorporates cellular, wire line, paging, andother types of terminal devices operated by different PTT branchesor operators can create a billing nightmare.The technical counterpart to the headache is in tying existingvoice and fax messaging, interactive voice response, and othernetwork elements into the IN.But perhaps the most difficult issue is that IN obstacles do notend on technical matters: Which branch is responsible for the INfunctions and the customer? How does the PTT determine the revenuesplit from services that span across another operating unit'sresources, and across different networks? These concerns are joinedby regulatory issues-where a PTT's operations may not be authorisedto operate "bundled" wire line, cellular, and paging services.Another area of potential trouble, but one of great potentialbenefit as well, is in testing how new IN features may interactwith existing IN.For example, combining UPT with VPN service to allow businessprofessionals to dial in to a home office from anywhere may be avery valuable feature for some businesses. This sort of servicewould allow an employee to call the company's freephone number,give a security identification, enter their present telephonenumber and forward all business calls to their location.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996NEW GIGASWITCH/IP: SIMPLE, COST EFFECTIVEfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY GRAEME K. LE ROUXEARLIER this year we looked at the state of play with ATM.We suggested that, while the ATM standards set was coming alongnicely, deploying a real ATM network was still fraught with morethan a few problems.While much work has been done since then, ATM is still somethingthe average network manager is best advised to treat as a spectatorsport if at all possible; but the game is getting more interesting.Practical AdvancePerhaps the most practical advance in ATM has been recentlyintroduced by US-based Ipsilon in partnership with Digital in theform of ATM-based IP Switching technology.This is probably the first generally useful application of ATM.It is, perhaps, more than a little ironic that IP Switching asexhibited by the Digital GigaSwitch/IP is in effect, a method ofturning an ATM network into a single logical IP router.Remember the hype about ATM marking the beginning of the end of therouter?Ipsilon's technology differs significantly from other ATM-basedrouting solutions which have been less than impressive.The ATM-based router "solutions" which have been released byseveral vendors, have simply been various methods of connecting oneor more "fat pipes" to a traditional router.Ordinary IP traffic is broken into cells, transmitted with varyingdegrees of reliability across an ATM network, and  reassembled intothe original IP packets.This should not be confused with the process of de-fragmentationwhich IP routers do not perform.The reassembled cells are then routed in the traditional mannerusing information propagated with ordinary routing protocols suchas RIP or OSPF.Build a network of, say, five routers using this type of technologyand all you are doing is substituting ATM interfaces-one perrouter-and an ATM switch for ordinary high speed serial interfaces-four per router.Such a network behaves in exactly the same way whether you useserial interfaces or ATM, provided you do not flood the ATM switchin which case cells are dropped.There is no solid data on what happens if you do flood the ATMswitch in a situation like this because nobody has tried it yet inthe real world.It is possible that your expensive ATM switch might turn into arandom fault generator and the five routers (or the end stationsconnected to them), would then spend a lot of time reconfiguringthemselves around the "faulty" links through the ATM network andtrying to retransmit data.On the other hand, the routers might throttle back transmittingstations via normal IP mechanisms.This would leave the ATM switch with the inter-router trafficgenerated by the routing protocol in use-that is a much smallerload.In this case, it would recover, enabling it to provide reliablelinks once more and, in turn, permitting the routing algorithms toconverge.Which of these scenarios actually occurs would depend upon theequipment in use, the nature of the IP traffic between the routers,the performance of the IP's flow control mechanisms, theintelligence of the router's ATM interfaces, and so forth.Would the network recover or not?Flip a coin or better yet buy the network described above, try itand send us an e-mail; we'd love to know.Avoids ProblemsIpsilon and Digital's approach avoids the potential problems in thescenario described above in two ways.First, Digital's Gigaswitches are designed such that no possiblecombination of ports can exceed the back plane bandwidth of theswitch which, when combined with their non-blocking ATM flowcontrol algorithms, all but eliminates dropped cells.Second, Ipsilon treats the whole ATM network as a single routerwhich extends, in the example outlined above, to five separatelocations and not a network of discrete routers.As a result there are no convergence issues-OSPF, RIP, and so forthare intended to work between routers, not within them.If you were to interconnect five GigaSwitch/IP-based networks(let's say, five large university campuses) via 10 links (standardDDN links, for example), you would have precisely the sameconvergence issues which you have right now -ATM would not comeinto it.Target MarketThe GigaSwitch/IP is aimed at Internet Service Providers or largecampus sites.It is significantly cheaper than any comparable solution based onstandard routers.All this is made possible by the remarkably simple-at least inconcept-idea of looking at the nature of an incoming IP packet.If an incoming IP packet is something short,  let's say a DNS lookup, then a routing decision is made and an SVC is set up within theATM network by the Ipsilon software.The packet is broken up into ATM cells, transmitted via the SVC,the SVC is torn down, the packet reassembled and transmitted out ofthe destination port of the "router". This is a slow process. TheSVC set up and tear down is, however, not significant and neitheris the process of packet disassembly and re-assembly.It is the routing decision which takes the time-this is whatprohibits the average "ATM-capable" router from working much fasterthan the same device connected to a serial interface.The interesting part is that only about 10 per cent of IP packetsfit this category of a "short" transmission.Ninety per cent of IP traffic is a stream of several packets suchas a file transfer, Web page hit, and so forth. For this sort oftraffic, there is no point in setting up and then tearing downSVCs.This means that after the first packet is processed, you have avirtual point-to-point link within the ATM network which is, inthis case, the router.If you have a point-to-point link between the source anddestination ports in your router, you do not need to make a routingdecision on the rest of the packets in the stream. This means thatyou can bypass the router's decision making engine.The result is an improvement in throughput of several hundredpercent at little, if any, extra cost.A six-slot GigaSwitch/IP costs less than US$60,000 and has amaximum throughput of 5.3 million packets per second. This makes itbetter than five times that of an average high-end router, which islikely to cost almost double the price.Another practical application for ATM which has developed nicelyover the last year or so is the use of ATM as a backbone within acampus environment.Using ATM as a campus backbone boils down to using it tointerconnect hubs within discrete areas, usually of departmentalsize (say 250 plus users), of a campus. In this mode, ATM canintegrate data, voice and video services, but only for very largesites due to the cost of the necessary high-end equipment.Such equipment is still only available from vendors like Nortel-although some traditional IT vendors such as IBM, which with thehigh end of their Nways product line, are making inroads into thismarket. As a data only solution based on PVCs, campus ATM backbonesare now relatively cost effective- even where the "campus" is alarge building.This is particularly so when one looks at the cost of managedports, the ATM application used by most sites.In addition, the advantages of ATM, such as extending VLANs beyonda single hub, are other cost-effective factors that work in ATM'sfavour.VLANs in and of themselves are not generally of major interest tothe average network manager.Capabilities of VLANsHowever, the sort of capabilities they provide such as loadbalancing across collision domains, isolating various types oftraffic or categories of users, logically distributing server-basedapplications while physically centralising equipment, arepersuasive arguments for deploying systems with a VLAN capability.For example, a university might wish to isolate student, researchstaff and administrative traffic.A VLAN built on an ATM backbone would permit each group to beassigned a logically separate, campus-wide, network.An interconnection between these networks could be made, forexample at some convenient central point via any appropriatecombination of routers and firewalls.Such a network would need only a single media link, such asordinary multi-mode fibre, between each building in the campus,perhaps similar links within larger buildings, and a series of VLANcapable, hubs-DECHub 900s, 3Com sONCore or Bay 5000 are somepossibilities.These could be connected either directly or via some form of thirdparty concentrator to the ATM backbone.In the case of hubs, like the DECHub, which have tight integrationbetween their back plane VLAN capability and that of their options,this requires the simple inclusion of an ATM switch option in thehub.VLANs created within the hub's backplane or option modules can beextended across the ATM network with no more effort thanconfiguring the original VLAN.In the case of hubs which do not have such tight integration, theVLAN is created within the hub and a router option added.This router is then connected to the ATM network in such a way thatthe ATM network appears as several discrete logical ports.This leads to the potential for the situation described in theexample above in reference to the potential for convergenceproblems with routing algorithms.Maximum BandwidthHowever, since the maximum bandwidth between the routers and themaximum throughput of the routers is known (as we have maximumperformance figures for the routers and we would be working in acampus environment where device latencies are either known or canbe easily measured) we could build such a network with sufficientexcess capacity to make the probability of flooding any one ATMswitch very low- not eliminate it, just make it very low.Alternatively we could deploy a campus backbone in the form of adevice using Ipsilon's IP switching technology or somethingsimilar, when such competitive products become available.Digital may be the first to market this sort of technology but itis unlikely that they will be the last.In most other areas there has been little practical change in thestate of play with ATM.LAN emulation continues to underwhelm anyone who looks at it tooclosely, wide area ATM services are still mainly experimental andof debatable cost efficiency to either the carriers or theircustomers, and carrier level backbone ATM is still looking like aworld of static PVCs.There is also the question of deployment time frames versusstandards developments.In the wide area, carriers plan in terms of five, 10 or 15 yearsfor major changes to their networks and recovering the cost of suchchanges.In a campus environment, a carrier's customers typically require aminimum of two to three years to recover the cost of new equipment.Changing StandardsStandards change significantly within 12 months and such changesrequire expensive upgrades or straight replacement of equipment.ATM will not find the sort of general acceptance that technologiessuch as ISDN, FDDI, or 100Base-T have.On the other hand if, or when, the benefits of VLANs based on ATM,Ipsilon/Digital's implementation of IP switching, or some othergenerally useful application of ATM technology, find favour withand are deployed by, a significant section of the market, theprocess of standards development will slow to a more economicallyexpectable pace.Stay tuned. The ATM World Series is far from over.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996FORUM ON VOICE IN ATMfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11ATM for carriers: Is it real? According to Norman Gale, Nortel'sdirector of Magellan marketing, Asia-Pacific, the ATM forum'sdiscussions on ATM Adaption Layer (AAL) should be of interest totelcos.Said Gale, "To enable voice over ATM more efficeintly, the new AAL6 is being proposed to code voice channels."AAL 6 examines the streaming of multiple channels into ATM cellsand according to Gale, it is addressing two issues: Packing celldensity and minimising delay (echo cancellation)."This will solve the issue of narrowband-to-broadbandinternetworking," adds Gale.Overall, the ATM wave in the Asia-Pacific is still in the testingstages and according to Gale, it is in the backbone services thatATM should figure prominently at the initial stages.In the Enterprise market, Nortel is working on its ATM technologieswith Fore Systems.Gale sees at the moment, 34 Mbps ATM may be next step for the WANmarket, which is increasingly being driven by newer technologieslike Frame Relay.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BAY TARGETS ACCESS EDGE MARKETfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY SIMON CHEWBAY Networks is banking on the recent growth in the Internet andIntranet markets to capitalise on an emerging need in thetelecommunications market.At the recent Partnersphere Executive Conference held in Bali,Bruce Sachs, executive vice president and general manager of Bay'sInternet/Telecom Access business unit, revealed that Bay istargeting the access edge of service providers.Said Sachs, "With our Baystream product, we can do both Routing andFrame Relay (FR) switching on the same hardware, so that it ispossible to build one large network that provides both FR accessand leased-line routing or dial-up connections to the Internet."Sachs added that this was useful due to the competitive nature ofservice provision where the price of connectivity is becoming moreand more of a commodity. A network that offers both services willthen lower the cost of ownership for the provider.With the recent acquisitions of Lancity, a cable TV modem vendorand Penril's DSP modem business, Bay is now offering a software-driven access architecture that is scalable and lower priced toboot. Sachs sees personal video-conferencing as an application thatis beginning to take off here.Said Sachs, "We again, have the ability to provide multipleservices from one hardware platform with software upgrade, thuslowering costs and ownership."Bay also sees an opportunity in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), inthe telecommunications sphere.Based on their experience US-based Concentric Networks, (which hasVPNs in Europe and are looking for links in the Asia-Pacific), Bayis confident that on-line services like interactive games andbanking will make an impact in the region.Addressing the need of product differentiation by ISPs, Sachsexplained that Bay could offer ISPs a VPN solution that makes itpossible to attain a guaranteed QoS to their customers.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996PHILIPS THROWS DOWN GAUNLETfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11You get a new phone if yours does not work.

For Malaysia, TRI believes that the main business wouldcome from tracking and data messaging services.Added Parker, "The total market is divided into two basic usertypes: machine-to-machine applications fro tracking and monitoringwhere a sensor initiates the communication, and personalcommunications services where an individual initiates thecommunication."Parker estimated the total market to be worth about 168 millionsubscriber units with a third of the demand coming from Asia.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996NEW ISSUES FOR NEW NETWORKSfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY BEN CHONGThe installation of full service networks (FSN) has thrown upseveral new issues in test and measurements for service operators.FSNs are networks set up to carry digital voice, video and datatraffic as well as establish a foundation for the futureinteractive multimedia services much bandied about now. However,according to Tektronix, cable TV operators learning to offer voiceservices and traditional telcos who are going big with VOD areencountering new issues when installing their core and accessnetworks.Said Linc Reed-Nickerson, product marketing manager, TransmissionTest, Tektronix: "New services create new problems. Cable operatorsand telcos understand their traditional services well, but they nowmust learn how to optimise for new services."FSNs are mostly based on the broadband Synchronous DigitalHierarchy (SDH) technology, including new installations in China,with architectures based mostly on a hybrid fibre/coax physicalmedia.Tektronix says that the digital signal now contains a complex mixof voice, video and data traffic which causes problems in thetransmission, if the test and measurement equipment used duringinstallation and regular maintenence of the network are notsophisticated enough to capture and analyse the signals.Compounding the difficulties is the fact that ATM and MPEG-2 arethe technologies providing video transport on SDH networks. MPEG-2drop-outs are especially noticeable.Said Reed-Nickerson, "In the analogue world, you could judgepicture quality from the video picture. In the digital world,degradation sets in immediately, not gradually. The picture justgoes away suddenly."A whole new barrage of tests are now essential, said Reed-Nickerson. Timing and synchronisation tests are vital because ofthe hybrid SDH/PDH networks and the fact that video and ATM-basedvoice require high quality timing.Jitter and wander test functions are now also essential to maintainservice quality measurements.Tektronix says that low frequencyjitter causes video subcarrier phase shift which causes colour lossin the video.In addition, hybrid analogue-digital systems produce distortionsassociated with purely analogue systems. Some of these distortionsinclude composite triple beat, composite second order, crossmodulation and ingress. Newly introduced measurement devices, suchas Tektronix' Tek 2715 allow the pin-pointing of all suchdistortions.Operators also need to know that better indicators of signalquality have to be used. For example, using raw Bit Error Rate is abetter indicator of system performance problems than using thecorrected BER.Understanding the FSN is increasing at a steady pace in Asia. SaidReed-Nickerson, "Last year operators asked about access networktesting only. Now questions about core network installation havesurfaced. It is an indication of the new digital services beingdeployed such as ISDN and compressed voice."Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996LOW-DENSITY MARKET A FERTILE GROUND?from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY SIMON CHEWWireless is undoubtedly the "in" technology of this decade. Themany cellular networks are testimony to the effectiveinfrastructure that it provides. However, the low-density market isundermining its cost efficiency.According to Steve Chen, vice-president, marketing of Celcore,operators are able to achieve revenue targets from urban networksdue to the optimisation from the large number of subscribers. Inthe rural market, operators have been reluctant to offersophisticated services.Said Chen, "The low-density market may not be profitable as thesystem may not be optimised."In fact, most operators offset the costs by charging their urbansubscribers a higher price.Celcore has identified the potential of the low-density market andoffers a solution for operators.Taking a cue from the client-server (network centric) model in thecomputing industry, Celcore offers a distributed network approachto deliver wireless services without backhauling other networks.The Globalhub from Celcore is an intelligent network platform thatfunctions as the Authorisation and Call Routing Equipment (ACRE) ina cellular system (through IS-41) to offer advanced personalmobility services and one-number access.In addition, Celcore's Globalsystem product family supportsprotocols like AMPS, ETACS, GSM and PCS and enables carriers totailor their networks according to the number of subscribers.Said Chen, "We are evolving digital interfaces to support CDMA andTDMA as well."LeverageWith a regional office already in India, Celcore's latest venturewas a partnership with Thailand's UCOM, which, according to Chen,will leverage on the latter's experience in system implementationin the region.The agreement calls for Celcore to offer turnkey solutions towireless operators as well as introducing UCOM as a potentialoperating partner. In addition, Celcore has entered the Indonesianmarket with a contract to expand Komselindo's AMPS network.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996AT&T COMMITTED TO INDIA'S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRYfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY SHIRISH NADKARNIIN the wake of the corruption controversy embracing formertelecommunications minister Pandit Sukh Ram, there are seriousdoubts  whether the telecom tenders approved by the former ministerwill be allowed to go through. But John Legere, president of Asia-Pacific for the American telecom giant AT&T, has no doubt that theprojects which have already been taken up will be undisturbed.#APT: Why hasn't AT&T done much in the long-distance telephonysegment  in India?Legere: You may know that AT&T is a founder-member of the WorldPartners Association (WPA), which is an alliance of carriers. MostAsian PTTs are members of this alliance; and we are trying toconvince Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the country'soverseas telecommunications arm, to become a part of it. VSNL is anentity most suitable to serve our multi- national customers inIndia, so we are looking at a partnership with it.Once it is part of the WPA, we can work together towards seamlesslyserving the global needs of Indian customers, and also serving ourmultinational customers in India. We will offer private line FrameRelay and PTN services.APT: But aren't there other similar alliances like, for example,Global One?#Legere: There is Global One, there is Concert. The model they offeris more of an invest-when-you-can, ally-when-you-have-to type.WPA's success has been substantial in Asia, where carriers havefelt threatened by other alliances, and have wanted to bindtogether. We feel we have a formula that is best for VSNL andIndia.APT: Why has AT&T  missed the bus, as far as basic services areconcerned?Legere: We had studied the Indian market for a full 18 monthsbefore we bid for basic services in the telecom circles whichoffered, from our  point of view, the most potential.We contacted more than 10,000 customers, and did a massive amountof technological research on Indian requirements. Even our bids inMaharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Karnataka were pretty aggressive-perhaps more aggressive than any other multinational player.But we didn't get the circles we wanted, and those were the onlyones we were prepared to bid for. Now that they are gone, we willconcentrate on wireless services in the two states we have andestablish our brand and service in India.APT: Have you faced any major obstacles in the cellular arena?#Legere: Well, we are definitely concerned about the allocation offrequencies, and we have made these concerns known to theauthorities. They are urgent, day-to-day problems, but they havenot slowed us down. We are still on schedule to start our servicesby Christmas. Meanwhile, we are optimistic that, if the governmenthas said it will address the problems we are facing, it will stickto its word.APT: Why has AT&T chosen to concentrate outside the US?Legere: Look at it from the opposite side. Five years ago, Indiadid not even figure among the top 50 countries in the world, interms of usage of telecom services. Now the traffic out of thiscountry is expanding by leaps and bounds, and it is already in thetop 20.We have estimated that, by  2005, India will be one of the threebiggest traffic streams to the US. Once the tele-density in Indiaand China grows, the traffic streams will be unparalleled and wewant to be part of the action.APT: For the future, which other countries are you looking at,especially in Asia?#Legere: We have a thoughtful, focussed and aggressive globalisationstrategy; and have targeted countries we wish to go into. Apartfrom India, we are building infrastructure in Canada and the UK.So far as Asia is concerned, our largest investments are in India,where we have made a commitment of US$1.5 billion. Our other majorinvestment in cellular services is in Hong Kong, where we have aventure called Smartone.We are also significantly expanding our on-line services in Asia.We have advanced services delivered through the Internet in HongKong, Japan and Australia. India is potentially a huge market forInternet services, and if those licences are given out, we willdefinitely be interested.We are looking to bid in several other Asian countries, likeThailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of whichprovide major opportunities. However, you must appreciate that wehave to pick and choose the places where we want to have majorinvestments; and, in Asia, we have consciously chosen India.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996PLDT JOINS THE PHILIPPINE INTERNET BANDWAGONfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11THE Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) has takencontrol of the Philippines' leading Internet Service Provider(ISP)-an event greeted with dismay by ISPs and subscribers wary ofPLDT's embrace.Infocom Technologies,  which claims 60 per cent of the Philippines'infant Internet market, elected a PLDT man, Renato Gendrano,president and CEO in September. Gendrano said the new owners wantedto "accelerate the growth of Infocom's Internet business". Theirvision was to build a second Internet Backbone and to make the Netmore accessible.Gendrano announced that Infocom intends to install 200 new digitallines to give dial-up users faster access to the Net. He also saidInfocom would launch new products such as Philippine-wide roamingaccess through a 1-800 number; e-mail to paging capability and pre-paid Internet cards for international access. Funding will begenerated by the capital markets, loans and direct capital infusionfrom PLDT.Infocom subscribers access the Net via an E1 gateway with a speedof 2.048 Mbps , the fastest and largest among all ISPs. Infocomclaims 3,000 direct subscribers. Add to this the subscribersbrought in by its 16 resellers and Infocom's total subscriber baseamounts to around 20,000.Infocom expects this base to increase 15 per cent by end-1996.Gendrano said Infocom is targeting an astounding 400 per centgrowth in 1997.Small Slice of PieWhatever the real number of subscribers, the size of thePhilippines' Internet subscriber pie is far too small for thebooming number of ISPs. Industry estimates place the total numberof ISPs at an astonishing 79. In contrast, there were some 22 ISPslast March and only 6 in August 1995.About four-fifths of these ISPs are resellers who sell access tothe Net but who do not necessarily have all the hardware andservices of a major ISP. Both resellers and major ISPs are fightingfor a market estimated from 40,000 to about 100,000 subscribers.Industry sources estimated the number of Net users at only 15,000last March and expected this to double at year-end.Internet access rates in the Philippines are cheap and the intensecompetition is expected to drive prices down even further.Executive Power Centre rocked the industry early this year byoffering access at only P90 (US$3) per hour and the same rate forevery succeeding hour. Infocom charges individual subscribers a lowP800 (US$30) per month and corporate subscribers P50,000 (US$1,900)per month for leased connections. ISPs charge a one-time connectionfee that ranges from P90 to P50,000.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MUSCLES INTO PHILIPPINES TELECOM PIEfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY PETER GALACEDEUTSCHE Telekom has become a key player in the intenselycompetitive Philippine telecoms industry with its equityacquisition in Isla Telecommunications (Islacom).Islacom is a CMTS and IGF operator lagging in its commitment toinstall 700,000 telephone landlines by 1998.DT becomes Islacom's second strategic partner after Thailand'sShinawatra International.Islacom StakeSources in Philippine telecoms speculate that DT will acquire a 20per cent stake in Islacom at the expense of Shinawatra, which nowcontrols 30 per cent.The remaining 70 per cent is held by Asia Communications Holdings(Asiacom), a Filipino company controlled by the Delgado family.Islacom has so far refused to confirm the extent of DT's equitystake.Islacom only acknowledges that it had entered into a "technicalpartnership" with DT.Simeon Kintanar, commissioner of the National TelecommunicationsCommission (NTC) said DT is infusing both equity and technologyinto Islacom.Kintanar attended the signing of the joint venture agreementbetween DT and Islacom in early September.At press time, the signing ceremony was to have taken place inManila.Islacom was identified by the NTC, the government agency thatregulates Philippine telecoms, as one of six companies lagging inits LEC commitments as of the first half of the year.Islacom has an obligation to install 130,000 landlines in 1996 and443,000 landlines in 1997.The company estimates that it will need P25 billion (US$1 billion)for its LEC project in the next five years.Following the signing of the joint venture agreement, DT advancedUS$40 million for Islacom's LEC roll-out programme and cellularoperations.Industry observers say Islacom sought a second strategic partnerbecause Shinawatra is unable to extend the capital requirementsneeded by Islacom projects in the next 10 years.Islacom also has a licence for paging operations, but is notactively engaged in this service.Sources say DT may have cast its lot with Islacom because thelatter's LEC service area is one of the most lucrative in thePhilippines.Cebu City is acknowledged as the Manila of the south and isexperiencing an economic boom.Islacom's LEC service area in southern Philippines includes Cebu,Mandaue, Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, Siquijor, Samar,Leyte, Iloilo, Bacolod, Bohol, Aklan, Antique, Capiz and Guimaras.Lucent AgreementThe company recently signed a US$43 million agreement with LucentTechnologies Philippines (an AT&T subsidiary) for its LEC projectand the improvement of its international gateway switch.Islacom is one of five Philippine CMTS (cellular mobile telephoneservice) providers.It is ranked either fourth or fifth in the number of subscribersand it has 40,000 subscribers to date.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BINARIANG AIMS FOR FULL SPECTRUM OF SATELLITE SERVICES IN ASIA-PACIFICfrom ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11BY BEE-KAY SENMALAYSIA will launch its second satellite Measat-2 into orbit onNov 13.It will be placed into the 148 degrees east orbital slot whileMeasat-1 is currently positioned at 91.5 degrees   east."By putting Measat-2 at 148 degrees east, the footprints of thesatellites will be extended up to east Australia and Hawaii,"Binariang's senior manager Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid said in KualaLumpur recently.Besides Malaysia, the footprints of both satellites will coverIndonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. Binariangis the owner and operator of the two satellites and has threeorbital slots.Arianespace has been chosen to launch the satellite from theEuropean space port in Kourou, French Guiana. Both satellites aremanufactured by Hughes.The second satellite has been flown to Kourou, where it will betested before being encapsulated into the Arianespace launchvehicle, Ariane 44L, for launching. The launch vehicle will have aco-passenger, Arabsat.Additional EquipmentAdditional equipment and a ground antenna is being installed at theLangkawi control centre to accommodate Measat-2 as it will be in adifferent orbital slot.Binariang has invested RM600 million (US$235.8 million) for themanufacturing and launching of the two satellites as well as groundfacilities.Achieving breakeven for both satellites is expected to be in lessthan five years.Halim said besides leasing transponders, Binariang was aiming toprovide a full spectrum of satellite services with both thesatellites in orbit.Binariang is considering providing Vsat (very small aperatureterminal) services by next year. It recently teamed-up with Hughesto provide the terminals.This is in line with providing rural telephony which can be linkedto the PSTN, via the satellite. Halim said this mode is more costeffective as operational costs are lower.Binariang is also forging alliances and partnerships withinternational satellite and broadcasting players in the region tolease satellite transponders.Binariang is also considering launching Measat-3 by 1998, whichwill be a much bigger satellite than Measat-1 and 2. Details arebeing worked out but Binariang is aiming to provide global coverageand a lot more capacity.All the 15-Ku band transponders have been leased to its affiliatecompany Measat Broadcast Network.The affiliate recently launched the country's first 23-channelsatellite television and radio network known as Astro (All AsianTelevision and Radio Company). Measat Broadcast Network hopes totarget 1 million subscribers (20 per cent market share) by year2000.It is anticipated that there will be five million homes withtelevision sets in the country by then.More than 80 per cent of Measat Broadcast Network's revenue willcome from subscription fees with the remaining 15 per cent throughthe sale of air time.Measat Broadcast Network will levy an RM80 (US$31.44) monthlycharge for the 23 digital satellite TV and eight radio channels.This is in addition to the one-off installation and equipmentcharge of RM1,680 (US$660.24), which includes the satellite dish,digital satellite receiver (DSR), remote control and smart card tobe purchased by subscribers directly from Philips, which hasexclusive rights.Measat Broadcast Network needs an average of 700,000 subscribers tobreakeven."We can reach that figure in two and a half to three years' time,"Measat Broadcast Network's chief operating officer, Paul Edwardssaid, after the launch of Astro in Kuala Lumpur on Sep 25.Measat Broadcast Network has so far invested RM500 million(US$196.5 million) and intends to invest an additional RM500million to expand Astro's broadcasting and production complex, theAll Asian Broadcasting Centre (ABC) and programming as well. Astrowill offer its services to neighbouring countries by early 1997,Edwards added.DTU ServiceThe direct-to-user (DTU) service can be made available to 30million subscribers in India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia,Taiwan and east Australia. However, Singapore is  not too keen onthe DTV service being aired within as it already has its own cableTV network.The Astro service is also an interactive multimedia platformcapable of delivering services such as home banking and shopping,stock exchange information and Internet access as well.

This coincided with speculation that DT had doubts overTRI's prospects in an already overcrowded, highly competitivesector. TRI refuted within the same day saying it would formaliseits deal with DT in October, thereby quieting rumours of itstroubled DT deal. TRI disclosed that it had signed the ManagementAgreement, and Technical Assistance and Training Agreement with DT,signifying DT's ready participation in TRI.TRI executives are denying the allegation, but those close to thedeal revealed that DT had requested for a re-negotiation. DT has,however, kept silent over the matter. A research analyst said DTdid not want to be left out of the booming Asian telecommunicationsbusiness and was keen to establish a foothold in Asia via TRI."It would not jeopardise its plans here just because TRI's shareprice plunged. However if DT had requested for re-negotiations, itwas part of the provisions in the preliminary agreement between TRIand DT in May  should TRI's share price come down", said theanalyst.TRI announced on Sep 26 that it had revised the sale price pershare to be paid by DT from RM9.50 (US$3.73) to RM9.25 (US$3.64).TRI said it will issue 68.07 million new shares which represents 10per cent of TRI's existing paid up capital.ING Barings analyst Soon Teck Onn commented that the pricedifference was negligible and reflected DT's keenness in acquiringa stake in TRI. DT had agreed in May to buy a 21 per cent stake inTRI in two installments. The first installment will involve 68.07million new TRI shares, while the second installment of theremaining 11 per cent, will come from the existing shareholders.Under the preliminary agreement, the price of RM9.50 (US$3.73)could be re-negotiated if the TRI stock price slipped below RM7.46(US$2.93) before the alliance agreement was sealed. DT will now payTRI RM629.64 million (US$247.45 million) for the 10 per cent stake(or the first installment), instead of the RM646.66 million(US$254.14 million).

Fujitsu and NEC are expected to make similar announcementssoon.The ban on leasing circuits to public circuits has long been one ofthe main pillars of NTT's monopoly.Under pressure to deregulate, the MPT permitted the linking of oneend of leased circuits to the public network from April 1995 andNTT has been charging 9,900 (US$93) a month per circuit connection.NTT's latest initiative can be seen as a move threatening its majorrivals among the new operators-the long distance carriers DDI,Japan Telecom and Teleway Japan.Indeed, NTT recently also announced that it would cut the circuitconnection charges to just 1,000 (US$9.40) a month.The long awaited 100 (US$.94) per three minute long-distance callcould quickly become a reality.

Both organisations made thestatement stating that there are currently ample telephone lines."TA, (having 2.6 million lines), will not sell out all of itstelephone lines until 1998," said Supachai Chearavanont, TA'sexecutive director.Adisai Bodharamik, CEO of TT&T, (whose 1.5 million lines would befully registered by the end of next year), said, "Once you add theTelephone Organisation of Thailand's (TOT) yet to be installed800,000 lines, the market will be oversupplied in the next twoyears."At the end of September, the two private fixed-line operatorsdelivered their combined 4.1 million lines to the TOT, as committedin their contracts, meeting the country's target of a 10 to 100teledensity.In addition, Adisai believed that "repeat orders" with TT&T and TAwould be likely when the demand rises. This means that any newplayers would have little chance to enter the market.Another factor which was said to have delayed the installationprogramme was line registration. Registrations fell below targetpartly due to the economic slowdown during the past year. Theresult was that both operators could only sell less than half oftheir ready lines by the second quarter of this year.Due to the general election this month following the Housedissolution in late September, major projects have been put onhold. Thus, TA and TT&T are enjoying a duopoly, at least until theturn of the century.However, there was a price to pay: The tight Sep 30 deliverydeadline forced the two telcos to spend heavily on telephone linesconstruction. As sales were below expectations, their secondquarter performance disappointed investors."Their sales of telephone lines was slow, even in the fisrtquarter. This means slower gains compared to growing operatingcosts," said an analyst.Mobile MarketMeanwhile, equipment makers have been monitoring market movements.Suppliers like Lucent are concentrating on the mobile phone marketas the pending six-million line programme "will not happen soon,"said a Lucent senior executive.Copyright 1996 Asia-Pacific TelecommunicationsBack to Headline List WT03-B11-34IA086-000622-B034-188http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te120.html 205.156.212.5 19970122044241 text/html 89937HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:40:30 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:33 GMTContent-length: 89750Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te120.html Sample Issue Copyright ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNet January 22, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES BINARIANG RISES TO MALAYSIAN TELECOMS CHALLENGE (904 words) AUSTRALIA: FOXTEL-AUSTRALIS MERGER FACING RESISTANCE FROM WATCHDOG (593 words) AUSTRALIA: TELSTRA FACES TARIFF RETHINK (528 words) AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT SAYS "NO" TO UNIVERSAL SERVICES PLAN (579 words) HONG KONG: HUTCHISON RESTRUCTURES IN ASIAN EXPANSION DRIVE (665 words) INDIA: BASIC SERVICES AUCTION HEADS FOR THIRD ROUND (1069 words) INDIA: CRACKS APPEAR IN CELLULAR J-VS (892 words) JAPAN: NEW MINISTER VOICES 'SERIOUS' RESERVATIONS ON NTT BREAK-UP (454 words) PHILIPPINES: PILTEL THREATENS TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN J-V (608 words) ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS - POSSIBLE INTERNATIONAL EQUITY ISSUES 1996 (92 words) PHILIPPINES: PLDT MAKES FIRST STAFF CUTS (354 words) SRI LANKA: SRI LANKA PRESSES AHEAD WITH TELECOMS PRIVATISATION (487 words) SRI LANKA: GREEN LIGHT FOR FOREIGN WIRELESS LOOP VENTURES (309 words) TAIWAN: CONTROVERSIAL BILLS SHOULD BE PASSED BY MONTH-END (565 words) TAIWAN: TAIWAN PLANS TO OFFER 8 NEW GSM AND PCS LICENCES (464 words) TROUBLES AT DAYA MITRA - INDONESIAN KSO UNIT - COULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIES (1614 words) NEWS TELECOM NEW ZEALAND PLANS TO ENTER CABLE TV MARKET (244 words) GSM NETWORK IN SHANGHAI (224 words) TELEKOM MALAYSIA SIGNING EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS (230 words) PAKISTAN'S NATIONAL OPERATOR OPEN TO BIDDING (183 words) BUKAKA SINGTEL SHORTLISTS 3 SUPPLIERS (133 words) KOREA'S FIRST DIGITAL CELLULAR SERVICE (127 words) NTT APPLIES TO REDUCE CHARGES ON PERSONAL HANDYPHONE SYSTEM (149 words) CHINESE MOBILE HANDPHONE SYSTEM VENTURE (99 words) SRI LANKA TELECOMS PROJECT (118 words) JAPANESE CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS (167 words) SINGAPORE'S GROWTH IN BUSINESS SPENDING (104 words) NTT WANTS TO REDUCE LONG-DISTANCE CALL CHARGES (185 words) ST SATELLITE TO LOOK INTO SATELLITE VENTURES (160 words) CASIO PAGERS TO BE MANUFACTURED IN INDIA (87 words) ITALTEL SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH JINGFENG (65 words) CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996BINARIANG RISES TO MALAYSIAN TELECOMS CHALLENGEBinariang scotched talk that it is way behind with plans to becomeMalaysia's second carrier with last week's successful launch of thecountry's first telecoms satellite.The on-schedule launch, from the European Space Agency facility inKourou, French Guiana, put Malaysia on a par with its neighbours interms of satellite TV capability and reaffirmed Binariang's commitmentto challenge the mostly government-owned Telekom Malaysia in everysector of its business.Binariang, which paid for the Arianespace launch, holds licences for acellular network, a satellite communications system, internationalgateway services and a fixed network - the only Malaysian company soendowed.The company reckons its advanced 2-satellite system - a second HughesSpace & Communications Co. spacecraft will be lofted in the middle ofthe year - will give it the technological muscle to beat the besttelecoms service providers at home and abroad.The first of the satellites has 5 high power Ku-band transponders and12 C-band transponders which will give Binariang the capacity for 40digital TV channels, 8 digital radio channels, a GSM cellular systemand the digital firepower to fulfil its domestic and internationaltelecoms aspirations.Binariang - controlled by Malaysian oil, gaming and property tycoonAnanda Krishnan - will beam only TV programming approved by thegovernment. Except for Singapore, Malaysia is now the only SoutheastAsian country that outlaws satellite TV.Legislation is passing through parliament to change the law so thatBinariang can beam into Malaysian homes - and those beyond. But thereis no legislation that will help Binariang beat the 7 other companiesmuscling for a slice of the telecoms market in Malaysia.Competitors say that because Binariang has been late in getting itsfully digital GSM cellular network up and running, the company has madeit easier for less worthy competitors to resist government attempts toforce mergers in the overcrowded industry. Because of the late GSMstart-up, Binariang is now competing in a 5-way battle for the 600,000or so Malaysians that own mobile phones (See APTA July 17).Late last year Binariang was at pains to deny claims from competitorsthat it was behind schedule with its roll out of services. Said DonaldSwan, Binariang's chief operations officer: "If you launch 4 lines ofbusiness on an integrated basis in 12 months there are bound to beproblems". Swan is also a vice president of US West, which last yeartook a 20 per cent stake in Binariang for an estimated $230m.A huge potential problem for Binariang is the government's abruptpolicy reversal last June (See APTA June 5). After handing out licencesto all comers, Kuala Lumpur decided there had been too many takers andthat a shake-out should be engineered. Prime Minister Mahathir said:"If possible, there should be mergers among them so that there are only3 or 4 companies."At a heated meeting in September, the licence holders said they had nointention of doing this. The government had issued the licences and waslegally obliged to honour the commitments it had made.Binariang, Time Telekom and Mutiara Telecommunications all insist thatthey are going ahead with their investments - despite rumblings fromwithin government about overcapacity and duplication and agreementwithin industry that there will undoubtedly be some rationalisation ata future point. On this, Swan said: "There is going to be a shakeout inthis new industry and Malaysia is going to be no exception. You willsee mergers and partnerships and people becoming niche players."A long shot is for Time Telekom, part of the politically well connectedRenong group, to buy a controlling share of Telkom Malaysia from thegovernment.A fourth likely survivor would be Celcom, the first private cellularnetwork and by far the biggest with over 75 per cent of cellularsubscribers. For 1996, the big action in the Malaysian telecomsindustry is going to be in mergers and acquisitions.Malaysian telecoms playersPLAYER          OWNERSHIP DETAILS      COMMENTSTelekom         Government 72%         National operator with fullMalaysia        28% free float         service licences for fixed,                Listed                 trunk and international                                       calls.

The merger would cut the number of players inAustralia's fledgling pay TV industry from 3 to 2 and combine Telstra'scomfortable lead over Optus Vision in cable rollout with Australis'monopoly over satellite and microwave distribution (See APTA October23).Although there is no widespread expectation that the AustralianCompetition and Consumer Commission would actually block the merger,comments by its chairman, Professor Allen Fels, have raised thepossibility that the ACCC will impose strict conditions.This would force a rejig of the merger, under which Telstra and Optuswould sell Foxtel to Australis for stock giving them a combined 60.5per cent of its total capital. They would also have 6 directors out of10.Professor Fels said in early January the ACCC was worried about theimpact of the merger on the pay-TV and telephony markets, and thattelephony was of more concern because of its vast size. However, hestressed that no decision had been made. The merger was announced inOctober and Australis and Foxtel said they expected the deal to be putto Australis shareholders in early December.They executed formal contracts just before Christmas and Australisadvised the Australian Stock Exchange it expected to release documentsin mid-January for the meeting. Both companies have maintained asteadfast silence since Professor Fels went public with his concernsabout the merger. They had hoped for a decision at the first meeting ofACCC members for the new year 2 weeks ago, but nothing emerged exceptreports the commissioners had endorsed Professor Fels' hard-line stanceon the merger.Optus Vision has argued the merger would create a "communicationscolossus" that would have "devastating and irreversible" effects oncompetition and consumers and threaten Optus Vision's plan to crackTelstra's local calls monopoly with cheaper local calls.Australis and Foxtel have replied that the merger would make littledifference to competition in the pay-TV market because the 2 companiesalready run common programming under an earlier deal sanctioned lastyear by the ACCC's predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission. The TPCappeared to treat pay-TV operators as participants in a broader TVmarket that included terrestrial free to air broadcasters in itsreasons for that decision.Although it emphasised this did not constitute a final determination ofthe relevant market for pay-TV operators, the decision was taken as asign that the merger would be approved on the grounds that a merger offledgling pay-TV operators would have little impact in a marketdominated by established terrestrial broadcasters. But Professor Felsplayed this down, saying the merger could be found to be anti-competitive in telephony - the bigger market - even if it had beenfound not to unduly affect competition in pay TV.After a slow start Australis' subscriber numbers have more than doubledin the space of a few months to about 70,000, largely as a result ofhaving adopted Foxtel's giveaway A$20 connection fee and A$40 a monthsubscription rates.Neither Foxtel nor Optus Vision, which did not launch their servicesuntil September/October, have revealed subscriber numbers.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996AUSTRALIA: TELSTRA FACES TARIFF RETHINKTelstra suffered a setback in its plan to restructure tariffs aimed atservice providers late last year (See APTA December 18). Australia'stelecoms regulator, Austel, rejected 2 new service provider tariffs inthe course of approving a package of changes to residential, consumerand business tariffs. The changes slashed business line rentals, longdistance and ISDN charges and sharply rationalised Telstra'sbewildering range of flexiplan discount plans.They were designed to help Telstra compete better with Optus and theaggressive service providers which have taken $3bn in annual revenuesfrom Telstra. They also aimed to force a rationalisation among serviceproviders, especially at the bottom end of the market where aggregatorssimply combine the bills of their customers and pass back the resultingvolume discounts to them, leaving Telstra to bill and service themindividually.The flexiplan changes resulted in the withdrawal of 2 local call plansthat proved extremely popular with aggregators, offering volumediscounts of up to 15 per cent, and replaced fees with per accountthresholds for those that remained.Telstra argued that the heavy use of these tariffs by simpleaggregators was requiring it to pay the discounts without enjoying thesavings of dealing with a single high volume customer.The tariffs were replaced by 2 new service provider tariffs offeringdiscounts of up to 37 per cent on long distance and 8 per cent on localcalls for service providers operating full billing help desks and someservice responsibility.Telstra's strategy of encouraging service providers to take moreresponsibility for billing and service is consistent with the views ofAustel, which does not regard aggregators as sustainable competitors orbelieve they bring the same benefits as value added and switchedservice providers. But the watchdog nevertheless disallowed the newservice provider tariffs on the grounds that they bundled competitiveservices with uncompetitive services (local calls) and did not meet theneeds of the service providers' industry.Since the disallowance, Telstra has continued to talk to serviceprovider representatives and was expected to meet with Austel over itsnew proposals for these tariffs as APTA went to press.Telstra was saying nothing about the changes it proposed to satisfyAustel, but the chairman of the Service Providers Action Network(SPAN), Brian Perkins, said Telstra was still insisting on bundlinglocal calls with long distance."I don't think what they are proposing is likely to satisfy us orAustel," said Perkins, a senior executive at the switched reseller AAPTelecommunications. He added that SPAN had no response from Austel toits request that the regulator order Telstra to leave its popular localcall flexiplans in place while the fate of the new service providertariffs is resolved.Telstra's new tariffs are slated to take effect on February 1 butAustel has expressed concern about the inadequate time this leaves theworst affected service providers to restructure their businesses.Aggregators are being offered the option of upgrading their facilitiesand becoming value added service providers, selling out to a valueadded service provider, or applying to become authorised Telstradealers on more favourable terms.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT SAYS "NO" TO UNIVERSAL SERVICES PLANA suggestion by national carrier Telstra that services covered by itsuniversal service obligations be handed over to Australia's telecomsregulator Austel to put out to tender was quickly stomped on by thefederal government over the Christmas-New Year break.The suggestion was contained in a submission by Telstra to a governmentinquiry into community service obligations under its new competitionregime, which is exposing utilities and the professions to competitionregulation for the first time.Telstra's submission said the current practice of leaving it with soleresponsibility for providing uneconomical services - such as servicesto rural and remote areas and payphones - failed the test of economicefficiency and was inconsistent with government's plan to bring in morecompetition after 1997.The carrier also said the cross-subsidisation inherent in universalservice reduced incentives for investment by Telstra or other carrierswhich might otherwise have entered the market for these services.Telstra was backed by the Australian Telecommunications Users' Group(Atug), which agreed that tendering would ensure "the best service isprovided at the best price" and said the way some rural services havebeen provided under USO arrangements was "nothing short of appalling".This was a reference to the digital concentrator radio system (DRCS)that Telstra uses for remote parts of Australia that can noteconomically be reached by landlines.Telstra chose DRCS over the Aussat satellite service (now owned by thesecond carrier Optus Communications) but this is widely believed tohave been a mistake. Atug says DRCS proved "grossly inferior" and theAussat satellites "would have been a much superior arrangement."Optus and AAP Communications - a subsidiary of AAP Information Servicesand a corporate half brother to the switched reseller AAPTelecommunications - both expressed support for the idea and said theywould be interested in looking at any services put up for tender.However, the Federal communications minister Michael Lee said USOservices would not be put out to tender as the idea had been rejectedwhen the government fashioned its post-1997 reform package last year.Opposition communications spokesman Senator Richard Alston supportedLee and said cross-subsidies from city to rural and remote customerswould remain under his party's plan to privatise Telstra.Their caution can be explained by the proximity of a tight Federalelection, which must be held by May but is being tipped to be held inMarch, and by the electorate's sensitivity to telephone service prices.Telstra's initiative was reported as an attempt to "privatise"universal service, but these are already calculated by Austel and paidfor by the 3 carriers in proportion to their revenues. This wouldcontinue if they were put out to tender by Austel.AAP Communications supplies "full mesh networks" to mining camps usingsatellites and Hughes telephony earth stations, including payphoneservices that offer employees calls to capital cities at local callrates.The group's director of marketing Geoffrey Rolls said it would"certainly" be interested in providing similar services to Telstra'srural and remote customers. It could run a network via satellites witha hub in Sydney or Perth, or alternatively "beam bandwidth into aremote area then split it off into effectively a local loop," he said.Mark Harwood, Optus' sales manager for national media, said Optus wouldlook at any USO services put out to tender but "it would have to be abusiness case decision."Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996HONG KONG: HUTCHISON RESTRUCTURES IN ASIAN EXPANSION DRIVEHutchison Whampoa is to revamp its telecoms units as part of a newexpansion drive focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. The companystressed the move is not preparatory to a separate listing for itstelecoms interests; however, the restructuring would simplify such amove further down the line.At the same time, Hutchison bought back a 25 per cent stake in itspaging business from Motorola, the US semiconductor and personalcommunications giant. Motorola retains a 30 per cent interest inHutchison's Hong Kong cellular telephone business.Analysts are loathe to rule out the prospect of a future spin-off,especially now that plans to float Orange, the UK personalcommunications network, are coming together.Under the shake-up, a new umbrella company Hutchison TelecommunicationsHong Kong (HTHK) has been created to consolidate the marketing andoperational resources of Hutchison's mobile telephone, paging and fixedline network services as well as its trunked radio service in China,Hong Kong and Macao. The move, in classic Canning Fok style - Fok hasbeen the group's managing director since 1993 - aims to createsynergies resulting in greater productivity and cost effectiveness.It is the second big shake-up in Hutchison's 10 year telecoms history.Hutchison Telecommunications was formed in 1986 to spearhead expansionin Hong Kong's relatively competitive (that is, cartel-free) paging andcellular mobile phone sector. However by 1992, having expanded intooverseas markets and nibbled at satellite, Hutchison unveiled a majorretrenchment of its telecoms operations, sacking 40 staff andsurrendering its Asia-Pacific ex-Hong Kong, China and Macao operationsin the process.This time round there are no casualties, just aggressive expansionplans. The group will this year invest HK$700m to upgrade its networkservices in Hong Kong and expand its mobile infrastructure - the numberof cell sites have already swollen threefold to 300 (from 100) over thepast 5 months.The company claims to have some 120,000 mobile phone customers and saysabout 30,000 customers have subscribed to its recently launched fixed-line network in Hong Kong. Hutchison plans to double both subscriberbases this year.Less bullish is the outlook for the lower market CT2 network, thesector that proved to be Hutchison's Achilles heel in the UK where itwas ultimately forced to close its Rabbit CT2 operation, writing offHK$1.4bn in the process. Locally subscribers to Hutchison's CT2 networkhave dwindled to below 70,000 from 100,000 last year.Telecoms businesses in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region will comeunder the wing of Hutchison Telecom International, headed up by CNKhoo. Included here, as well as paging and mobile services, are VSATand radio broadcasting.While Hutchison is one of the colony's leaders in mobile services -commanding some 18 per cent of the mobile telephone market and 29 percent of the pager market - its debut in the fixed network arena at theend of last year was less pronounced. This is at least partially areflection of erstwhile monopoly Hongkong Telecom's stranglehold on themarket and partly to do with Hutchison's own strategy which is broadlysimilar to that of fellow new entrants New T&T and New World Telephone(See APTA June 5).As well as emphasising discount international calls (still strictly theexclusive province of Hongkong Telecom, although many loopholes to getround this exist), all 3 companies are relying on newest technology toprovide a total package for consumers, with a different range of nicheservices designed to appeal to business and residential users.The synergies thrown up by Hutchison's revamp will be seen as the fixed-network builds on its mobile communications strengths, with wirelessservices revolving round the hub of its wireline technology.The company, again like its 3 new competitors, is bidding for the newmobile licences which were to have been awarded last year but have beenheld up by deliberations in Beijing (See APTA June 19, November 6).Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996INDIA: BASIC SERVICES AUCTION HEADS FOR THIRD ROUNDFollowing the poor response to the second round of bidding, the auctionof basic services licences in India is heading for its third round.The second round which earlier this month drew bids for 5 of the 13licences on offer, only attracted 6 of the 16 consortia eligible tobid. Ten groups opted to stay out of the round altogether.Of the 13 licences on offer, only Punjab attracted more than one bid(See table over page) and all the offers were far beneath theastronomical fees quoted by the Himachal Futuristic-led consortium(HFCL-Bezeq) in the first round (See table and APTA September 11,December 18).Licences back on the table for a third time will be: Andaman & Nicobar,Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, North East, UttarPradesh (East) and West Bengal.Any further progress will in all probability await a decision from theSupreme Court on the numerous petitions calling for the privatisationto be re-examined. The court has ruled that basic services licenceswill not be issued until all the petitions - of which there are now 10 - have been looked into and disposed of.Following the second round, Tata Tele Service, Basic Tele Service,Reliance Industries and Techno Telecom India are set to win the 4licences of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Bihar respectivelyas they are the only groups which bid for these circles. Essar BellAtlantic should be operating basic services in Punjab where it is aheadof its only rival, Bharti Telenet, in its offer.Shyam Telecom and Hughes-Ispat are set to operate services in Rajasthanand Karnataka as the licensing authority, the Department ofTelecommunications (DOT), accepted that it had been mistaken inrejecting their bids in the first round (See APTA December 4). Added tothose already allotted, 12 of the total 21 basic services on offernationwide have been allocated.Analysts say there were several reasons behind the poor turn-out in thesecond round including the growing controversy over the HFCL-Bezeqconsortia's winning bids and last month's parliamentary uproar over thehandling of the tender (See APTA December 18). But the strongestnegatives were the high reserve prices set by the Department ofTelecommunications for each licence - the fee had not left to much roomfor profits - and the extremely tight tender deadline.A representative of AT&T Birla said the group had decided not to rebidfor Gujarat where it had made an offer which was rejected as being toolow. "After a thorough evaluation of the business case, the J-Vconcluded that at present our figures do not come up to the level ofthe reserve price determined for Gujarat," he said.If it were not for the strong business interests of the companies whichmade offers in the second round, even the 5 licences where they placedbids might have had no takers.The Reliance industrial group has over $8bn worth of power, refinery,petrochemical and downstream business coming up in Gujarat. The Tataindustrial group and Bell Canada, partners in Tata Tele Service, andUsha Telecom, the Indian partner in Techno Telecom India, have alreadywon cellular licences in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively.Essar is reportedly buying equity in one of the companies selected forthe Punjab cellular licence.RPG, the local partner in the Basic Tele Service group, is involved incellular in Madras - capital of the state of Tamil Nadu where it placedthe only bid for the basic services licence for that state. It showedits special interest in this licence by offering a fee of roughly 2 anda half times that over US West-BPL's offer in the first round - anoffer which was $285m over its initial offer for the licence.Aside from the Tata Tele Service group which offered more than doublethe Rs18bn ($520m) it bid in the first round for Andhra Pradesh, feeoffers for the other circles were only marginally above the DOT's fixedNVP.Bidders are still baffled at the formula behind the reserve prices setby the DOT on each licence, and the Department has still not disclosedhow it came up with the figures. The reserve price for the Gujarat forinstance is much less than that for the relatively less prosperousstates of West Bengal and Kerala.Meanwhile, Bharti Telecom is the first of many aggrieved bidding groupsto turn to the courts. The J-V has submitted a petition to the highcourt which says it should have won the licence for Punjab.Sunil Mittal, Bharti Telecom chairman, said the situation was"ridiculous". The company had offered a quote over 2 times the figuredeemed as a reasonable levy by the DOT when it bid in the first round,but still was not allocated a licence.Tata Tele Service has also now turned to the courts to resolve itsdispute over the DOT's decision to allocate the Maharashtra licence tothe Hughes-Ispat group. Though Hughes-Ispat offered $674m over the TataTele Service bid, the latter was told it had won overall "on points" -there are a number of additional criteria which are included in theevaluation process. However, higher authorities then decided to rejectthis decision made by the Tender Evaluation Committee and to award thelicence to the highest bidder - the Hughes-Ispat alliance - instead.Alongside these 2 new cases, India's Telecoms Industry and ServicesAssociation (TISA), which lobbies on behalf of local telecomsinterests, has turned to the court to block the DOT's decision tocharge the first instalment of the licence fee before the operatorsbegin service.Offers for basic service licences - second round (India)Licence zone     Category    Bidders               Licence fee (Rsm)Andhra Pradesh       A       Tata Teleservices             42,000.0Tamil Nadu           A       Basic Teleservices           116,200.0Punjab               B       Essar Commvision              45,934.0                             Bharti Telenet                36,750.0Gujarat              A       Reliance Industries           33,963.3Bihar                C       Techno Telecom India           2,665.7                             Total                        240,763.0                             (excludes Bharti)                NPV of the quoted    NPV of reserve    H1 fee in 1stLicence zone    licence fee (Rsm) licence fee (Rsm)  bid round (Rsm)Andhra Pradesh       13,126.8            12,500            153,650Tamil Nadu           36,051.4            25,500           45,202.5Punjab               14,251.2            12,700           90,650.0                     13,679.7            12,700           90,650.0Gujarat              10,537.2            10,500          150,850.0Bihar                 1,400.6             1,400            2,440.0                     Total                               442,792.5Source: Asia-Pacific Telecoms Analyst.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996INDIA: CRACKS APPEAR IN CELLULAR J-VSCracks have appeared in 3 of the J-Vs selected to operate cellularservices in India last month over disputes which are certain to end inpartnership changes.Differences have emerged between partners in the Koshika Telecom,Modicom Network and HHS Communications J-Vs over recent weeks.Pilipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel), foreign player in the KoshikaTelecom J-V, has been pitted against majority partner, Usha India Ltd.(UIL) in a highly-publicised disagreement over its equity stake (Seestory page 9) while Modi Wellvest, majority partner in the ModicomNetwork alliance, appears to be in a terminal dispute with its USforeign partner Vanguard. Singapore Telecom is seeking a way to backout of Hinduja HCL Singtel (HHS Communications).Problems at Modicom Network, the Indian-US-Thai alliance which holdslicences for the 2 areas of Punjab and Karnataka, appear to hinge on adispute over how much equity capital the foreign partner should tip in.Vanguard says it agreed to invest $13m of the $50m equity required forthe $100m project (to be funded on a 1:1 debt-equity ratio) for a 26per cent stake. But the Modis claim that project costs have now risento $250m and Vanguard must pump in more funds if it wants to keep agrip on its 26 per cent stake.Vince Snowden, Vanguard's representative in India, said the company wasnot willing to give more than agreed in the original shareholdersagreement and had no intention of giving its permission for a change ofpartnership. "Modicom used our networth and experience as keys tosecure the licences and now after getting them, they want to bring innew players at our expense," he said.Last month, Modi Wellvest approached the DOT saying it wanted toreplace Vanguard with Telstra - Modis' partner in cellular services inCalcutta. But Telstra replied in a statement that not only had it "notmade any commitment to anyone or any consortium to buy in or join theconsortium" but that "Telstra is not contemplating participation in theModicom consortium."Modi then said that Motorola and Lazard Brothers Asia were planning tojoin it with 20 per cent and 29 per cent equity respectively, butChicago-based Bob Young, vice president, Motorola Network VenturesDivision said Motorola had been approached by a number of cellularoperators to invest in their ventures, "but nothing has been finalisedas yet."This tangle has remained unresolved despite intervention last week byTelecom Commission chairman R K Takkar. Modi Wellvest holds 51 per centof Modicom Network and the 23 per cent balance is held by Thailand'sTelecom International.Meanwhile, Singapore Telecom is reportedly seeking to withdraw from theHHS Communications J-V - licensed to operate in Tamil Nadu - as it isnot keen on participating in a single licence zone. To take on thelicence, the J-V is required to up its original offer by $84m to matchthe fee offered by the highest bidder in that state (US West-BPLCellular which offered $238m). Ashok Leyland and HCL are the otherIndian partners in the venture.So far, the DOT appears to be taking a lenient view of the possiblepartnerships changes emphasising it wants to see services kick-startedas soon as possible.Takkar says the DOT will not interfere if the changes fall withinCompany Law and Foreign Investment Promotion Board guidelines and newforeign partners are financially qualified and have necessary serviceoperation expertise. Government has the right to vet ownership changesin the first 3 years under the contract agreements, but appears not towish to get involved.The DOT has also been forgiving in allowing consortia to take longer inpaying the first instalment of the licence fees required - the tenderconditions are very specific in saying that if the licence fee is notpaid by the date due, the next highest bidder will be given the chanceto step in. Takkar said however: "The offers won't be cancelled unlesswe are convinced that the parties are not serious." He noted thatcompanies are having to pay a heavy penalty in interest payments on theamounts they owe and would not bear the burden if they weren't serious.So far, 28 licences of the 33 selected are set to operate services intheir licence areas having deposited the first instalment of thelicence fee and signed the licences (See APTA December 18). The licencefees are to be paid in 10 annual instalments.Koshika Telecom, Modicom Network and HHS Communications have still tomake the first payment (due to their internal disputes) as have AircelDigilink and Hexacom India for their Rajhasthan licences. These last 2groups have sought an extension until month-end following a disputewith the DOT over whether they should match the highest offer for thecircle quoted by the Modicom group. Modicom was only permitted to takeup 2 cellular licences due to the tender's networth restrictions andopted to drop the Rajasthan licence after it placed winning bids in 3circles (See APTA December 18).The second Karnataka licence has gone to J T Mobile. J T Mobile hadmade an identical offer to AT&T Birla for the licence and the DOT brokethe tie by a draw of lots.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996JAPAN: NEW MINISTER VOICES 'SERIOUS' RESERVATIONS ON NTT BREAK-UPThe break-up of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) which hasbeen at the centre of debate in the Japanese telecoms sector over thepast few months has taken a new direction under Prime Minister RyutaroHashimoto's cabinet.Hashimoto, who became Japan's leader on January 11 appointed IchiroHino to the "sensitive" position of Minister of Posts andTelecommunications and within a few days of taking office, Hino statedthat he has serious reservations about the idea of breaking up NTT intoa few companies.Hino noted that the ultimate decision will be a political one that willtake into consideration the views of all 3 ruling coalition parties -Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party ofJapan (that of ex-prime minister Tomichii Murayama), and the New PartySakigake. Hino has also said that many politicians acknowledge that NTTis striving to restructure its organisation so as to boost itsefficiency - some have argued this negates the necessity for itsbreakup.Serioku Kajiyama, the new chief cabinet secretary (the officialspokesman for the government) added that it is probable that there willbe no quick decision on the proposal to divide up NTT. Such a decisionwould be likely to be made in the next fiscal year, according toKajiyama. The principal concerns were how Japan can remain competitivewith other advanced nations in the telecoms arena and how a possiblebreak-up of NTT would affect the country's internationalcompetitiveness, Kajiyama said. He implied that to divide up NTT wouldmean scattering the resources of Japan's sole telecoms company capableof competing in the global arena.Japanese newspapers have widely reported that Prime Minister, Hashimotoopposes the idea of an NTT breakup. Furthermore, with elections comingup in the not-too-distant future, major politicians like Hashimoto seekto avoid alienating NTT's labour unions - which will mobilise tens ofthousands of votes.The Telecommunications Council, an independent advisory body, is slatedto submit a report to the government in late February that is likely toadvocate a division of NTT so as to spur domestic competition. However,the new Hashimoto cabinet appears to be more concerned about Japan'sstatus vis-a-vis international telecoms competition and especially innurturing Japan's technical capabilities in the sector.Hashimoto's position largely opposes the idea of dividing NTT on thebasis that it would damage NTT's research efforts as well as itspotential to "compete" with international heavyweights such as AT&T,MCI and British Telecom.NTT - Japan's "flag carrier" - is currently limited to the domesticmarket, but the new government's rationale could indicate that it maybe allowed to compete internationally sooner than might have beenexpected.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996PHILIPPINES: PILTEL THREATENS TO WITHDRAW FROM INDIAN J-VPhilipino Telephone Corp. (Piltel) has threatened to withdraw from a J-V with Usha India Ltd. after disagreements over how the partnershipwould be divided.The Philippines' leading mobile-phone provider and Usha have resumednegotiations to head off a collapse of Koshika Telecom Ltd., which wonlicences to operate cellular telephone service in 3 areas of India.Both sides have expressed confidence that deal can be worked out thatwill allow Piltel a larger stake. In the meantime, a New Delhi courthas issued a restraining order blocking Piltel's withdrawal.Piltel notified Usha that it intended to drop out of the partnershipafter the Indian company refused a request for a larger stake. Underpreliminary agreement, Piltel was granted a 10 per cent equity interestin Koshika with an option to increase to 34 per cent.Usha has balked at allowing the increase, saying Piltel failed toexercise its options before the bidding for the cellular licence wasissued late last year. Usha holds 85 per cent of shares in Koshika withthe balance of 5 per cent in the hands of a US-resident individual,Chirinjeev Kathuria. "We are still in the process of negotiations,"said Joseph Santiago, head of Piltel's legal department. "We just wantthem to stick to the original agreement."Santiago sent a team of negotiators to Manila to try to hammer out theownership disagreements with out success. Another round of talks wasscheduled in January. The court has instructed Piltel not to withdrawor dilute its shareholding below 10 per cent until the case is disposedof. The next court hearing is fixed for March 27.Analysts said Piltel's threat to quit Koshika was nothing more than anegotiation ploy to force Usha to increase the Philippine company'sequity stake. Without Piltel, the J-V could be in jeopardy along withthe cellular phone licences."Piltel wants to increase their participation to the point where theyare the managing partner," said Wilfred Son Keng Po, vice president atWorldsec International Ltd. in Manila. "Usha wants a silent partner."Vineet Rai, senior vice-president of Usha said Piltel had realised thereal worth of the project after the licences had been issued. "We willnot succumb to arm-twisting by our foreign partner," he said, "and byobtaining an injunction we are further securing our position."Ajay Chaudhury, Koshika Telecom chief executive added that the firststage of the project would be completed by April 2 "with or withoutPiltel". Piltel refused to send its technical staff for the projectunless it was allowed the additional equity, but Koshika brought inTelecom Finland subsidiary, Telecon, to assist.When the partnership with Usha was announced, Piltel officials said itwas a step toward taking the cellular company regional by providingexpertise in designing cellular networks in developing countries.Piltel is the largest cellular phone operator in the Philippines with asubscriber base that is forecast to reach 195,000 subscribers by year-end. The country's population is about 65m.Koshika's 3 service areas cover 260m people in Orissa, Uttar PradeshWest and Uttar Pradesh East. That is a potentially lucrative source ofadditional revenue, particularly when Piltel faces growing competitionat home.Santiago said the experience in India hadn't soured Piltel on becominga partner in other companies in the region. "We are still trying tolook into being partners in other countries in the region," Santiagosaid. "We have to learn from our experience in India."Ramon Cojuangco, Piltel chairman, said 2 countries near India hadapproached the company about cellular contracts.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS - POSSIBLE INTERNATIONAL EQUITY ISSUES 1996Country        Company     Possible size   Comments                          of int tranche                                  (US$M)Australia      Optus                $150   Likely in first half                                           1996               Telstra            $1,000   Likely after federal                                           elections in early                                           1996India          Various new          $500   To raise capital to fund               network                     network build-out               operatorsIndonesia      Various new          $500   To raise capital to fund               network                     network build-out               operatorsKorea          Korea Telecom      $1,000   Under consideration by                                           government               Korea Mobile         $300   Under consideration               TelecomPhilippines    Various new          $200   To raise capital to fund               network                     network build-out               operatorsSri Lanka      Sri Lanka            $500   Under consideration               TelecomSource: Salomon Brothers.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996PHILIPPINES: PLDT MAKES FIRST STAFF CUTSFor the first time in the company's long history, Philippine LongDistance Telephone Corp. (PLDT) is eliminating jobs to increaseefficiency and trim excessive costs.PLDT said it will eliminate 661 jobs - or 2.3 per cent of the totalworkforce - thorough lay-offs or early retirements. The cuts are thefirst phase of a retrenchment programme that could reduce PLDT'sworkforce by 10 per cent."This is a significant change in the company's culture," said RicardoTan, assistant vice president for investor relations. "We've never donethis in the 7 decades of our existence."The departing employees include 35 executives, 243 managers and 383workers. The company did not say how much it will spend for earlyretirement or how much the long-term payroll savings will be.PLDT is among the region's most inefficient telcos with about 48 linesper employee, compared with 196 for Hongkong Telecom and 97 for TelekomMalaysia, according to CS First Boston. Total salaries and wages in1994 were Ps4.03bn ($153.8m), or nearly 29 per cent of the company'soverall expenses.The lay-offs come as the 67 year old company undergoes an unprecedentedexpansion to try to meet growing demand for communications. Between1993 and 2001, PLDT plans to add almost 3m lines to its current networkof about 1.5m. It also plans to make its network all-digital to offernew network services such as call-waiting and conference calls.PLDT officials said many of those leaving are personnel familiar withold equipment that the company is phasing out. "Some, rather than gothrough retraining, would rather retire and take the golden handshake,"Tan said."The programme will immediately cause some huge cash outlay, but themedium- and long-term cost savings are enough to offset any initialexpense," said Conrad Andres, research director at DVP-Daiwa SecuritiesPhilippines Inc.PLDT, a former monopoly, now faces at least 8 companies in thelucrative market for international calls. Some 60 per cent of itsrevenue comes from overseas calls.

"Privatisationof Sri Lanka Telecom is non-negotiable," the minister said adding thattrade unions were resisting because they were not fully aware of theprocess.Earlier this month, the government awarded the restructuring of SLT toa consortium comprising investment bankers Deutsche Morgan Grenfell andDevelopment Finance Corporation of Ceylon, accounting firm DeloitteTouche Tohmatsu International and law firm Slaughter and May.The minister said SLT together with 2 private operators with a licenceto provide wireless loop connections will be able to hook up only400,000 new telephones by 1997 although the demand would be well over1m. He said SLT was committed to an investment of some Rs20bn ($377m)in the next 18 months but would find it difficult to raise the capitalunless it was privatised soon."We need huge resources to develop telecommunications," Samaraweerasaid. "We must understand the realities of the 21st century. We have tomove forward with the new technology and for that we can't get money onour own."Privately, however, analysts say the government is desperate to raisemoney through the sale of its assets to meet a huge budget deficitbrought about by its ballooning defence expenditure. The rulingPeople's Alliance had opposed privatisation when it was in opposition,but was forced to resort to do it to bridge the budget deficit ofRs87.5bn (1.65bn dollars) in 1996.The government hopes to raise Rs21bn ($396.22m) from the sale of stateenterprises during 1996. The Sri Lanka Telecom sale along with thenational airline AirLanka are expected to raise most of that revenue.Both will be up for grabs by the middle of the year. Sri Lanka Telecomhad a turnover of Rs5,000m (94.33m dollars) in the year endingSeptember 1995.Telecommunication trade unions say that retrenchment will be inevitableas private management's take over SLT, which currently employs some7,500 workers. The number of direct exchange lines operated by SLT is200,000.The World Bank has been asking Sri Lanka Telecom to reduce its staffbut officials said they were only prepared to reduce the worker/phoneratio by increasing the number of phones. However, there was no moneyfor that.The trade unions argue that tariffs will rise sharply followingprivatisation. The SLT currently charges Rs13,000 ($245) for a newphone connection although the actual cost is estimated at Rs106,000($2,000)."Privatisation is a curse," said J. B. P. Dissanayake, the president ofthe Joint Organisation of Telecommunication Unions (JOTTU). "We allmust oppose it," he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996SRI LANKA: GREEN LIGHT FOR FOREIGN WIRELESS LOOP VENTURESSri Lanka has given the green light to 2 foreign consortiums to set upprivate telephone networks across the country using wireless looptechnology.Secretary to the ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, K. C.Logeswaran said the cabinet had accepted proposals by Bell Canada andTelia of Sweden to set up networks with 100,000 lines each within 3years. "They will have 3 weeks to incorporate companies locally toundertake the work," Logeswaran said. "Thereafter, they will be issuedlicences to (formally) operate parallel networks in competition with(state-owned) Sri Lanka Telecom."The 2 consortiums will have to pay a once-and-for-all fee of Rs300m($5.66m) each for the licence but they will be free to determine theirtariffs."We got the initial proposals on June 30 and within 41 days we wereable to go through the technical evaluation process and obtain cabinetapproval for the 2 private networks," Logeswaran said.Logeswaran said each of the 2 private operators - who will competeagainst each other as well - was expected to provide at least 40,000phone connections in the first year of operation and go up to 100,000lines within 3 years.There are some 220,000 potential telephone subscribers in the queue,some which have been waiting for nearly 10 years for a phone connectionfrom Sri Lanka Telecom. However, the government estimates that theactual demand is about 1m.The two private operators will provide "wireless loop" phoneconnections - eliminating the need for costly land lines - connectinginto Sri Lanka Telecom's backbone network to access internationalcircuits and other phone users in the country.Long delays in obtaining fixed line phones in Sri Lanka have boostedthe sales of cellular phone operators in the past 6 years.

The fact that the controversial bills had passed the first 2readings showed a government commitment to bulldozing the proposalsthrough the legislature - despite outcries by the national operator'semployees, they said. Delays which have extended month after monthwould soon be over; bills that pass the third and final reading becomelaw.At a press conference, Liu Chao-shiuan, Minister of Transportation andCommunications (MOTC), last month avowed that privatisation "willhappen" and was "inevitable". Since then, the government has repeatedlystressed that the privatisation of the Directorate General ofTelecommunications (DGT) forms the backbone of its Asia PacificRegional Operations Centre (APROC) plan - the high-profile scheme whichcalls for Taiwan to become a regional hub for multinationalcorporations and international telecoms traffic.Meanwhile, however, several thousand DGT employees have continued toprotest outside the LY during the many review sessions being held byits Telecommunication Committee since late December. They areprotesting that privatisation and liberalisation will see the new ChinaTelecommunication Co. - a spin-off of DGT proposed under one of thebills - become an uncompetitive state-owned operator which will beforced to rationalise, resulting in huge lay-offs.Union members also threatened to shut off telephone switching systemsthat operate public telephones and to destroy telecoms equipment, butthe DGT has countered that any employee found attempting to do so,would be dismissed. High ranking MOTC officials have asked unionmembers to take a hard look at "the problems" facing Taiwan's telecomsindustry."One of "the problems" they feel is the inability of existinginfrastructure to service the needs of large corporations that relyheavily on the network - the kind of corporations that the APROC policyis seeking to attract.Acer Sertek Inc. - Taiwan's largest computer manufacturing company -dragged this issue centre stage earlier this month when it threatenedto move its international telecoms centre to Hong Kong or Hawaii. Acerplans to call in a telecoms company, such as AT&T or MCI, to help setup an international network for them.The announcement shook several government agencies, prompting the highranking Council for Economic and Development to say the group's plansto move should be taken "as a warning to the country."Top officials have been quoted in local papers as saying that unlessthe 3 bills are passed by the legislature, the lack of a strongtelecoms infrastructure will be detrimental to the island's ambitionsas a regional operations centre.The pro-liberalisation lobby would appear unstoppable. Minister Liusaid that he and other ministry officials would mobilise legislators topass the bills including amendments that call for the lucrative pagingand cellular sectors to be cracked open (See story below).Several computer associations have also been collecting signatures toshow their support for the passing of the bills.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996TAIWAN: TAIWAN PLANS TO OFFER 8 NEW GSM AND PCS LICENCESTaiwan looks set to offer a total 8 new cellular licences to would-beoperators following a public meeting held last month which looked intoplans to liberalise the sector.Following the meeting, chaired by Mao Chi-kuo, Vice Minister of theMinistry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) it was decided that atleast 3 regional GSM licences (covering north, central and southTaiwan) and 3 regional PCS licences as well as 2 island-wide PCSlicences should be offered to new operators. Revised proposals areawaiting approval by the Legislative Yuan (See story above).Other parties at last month's meeting included representatives fromAPROC Window (the group that advised the MOTC to liberalise), highranking officials from the national operator, the Directorate Generalof Telecommunications (DGT) and private companies vying for licences.The number of new licences on the table has come as a surprise to manyobservers.Taipei-based David Hoffman, Technology Practice Director at Coopers andLybrand, told APTA that while competition would be healthy for Taiwan,he believed the introduction of so many licences at one time would makeit difficult for consumers to differentiate between the products andservices on offer and for operators to get a head start. He added thatthe nature of the licences may not be "entirely fair" to operators: "Itdepends on who wins the licences, whether they are also able to worktogether," he said. "Taiwan does not have a strong regulator to overseethat interconnections are easily made.If the DGT is involved in the process, it would be in their owninterest to make it as difficult as possible for their competition toenter the market."The bills propose an auction method for awarding licences, but this iscoming under fire from local lobby groups. Hoffman agreed: "Auctionsfor multiple licenses don't work all that well."An auction would only encourage collusion and higher pricing becausethose who make astronomical bids would be unable to charge more thanthe going rates, he said, and recommended a bid-type method of awardinglicenses linked to performance, as was adopted in Hong Kong.In Hong Kong, operators put down a performance bond, proposed tariffrates and their plan for network deployment cover range and stated whenthey would be up and running. The bidder guarantees to pay a penalty ifit fails to do what it outlined in its proposals. That way, operatorspropose their best service, fastest roll out time and are obliged tocome up with their proposed goods on time.Edmond Tsai, Motorola general manager, told APTA he believed cellularpenetration in Taiwan could reach well over 3m users by 2000 - up to 15to 20 percent of the 21m population by then.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996TROUBLES AT DAYA MITRA - INDONESIAN KSO UNIT - COULD CAUSE DIFFICULTIESDomestic telecoms provider PT Telkom has launched its remarkable JointOperating Scheme (JOS), handing over the running of most of Indonesia'stelecoms infrastructure to private-sector consortia. But with TelkomMalaysia apparently reconsidering its participation in the scheme,there is uncertainty about the future of the PT Daya Mitra Malindoconsortium, due to take over the telephone network in Kalimantan thismonth.Telkom president Setyanto Santosa said on 13 January, without givingdetails, that there were still difficulties within Daya Mitra.Daya Mitra has been plagued by unidentified "internal problems" sinceshortly after the JOS contracts were signed in October (See APTASeptember 25, December 18). The difficulties were earlier thought toinvolve a tug-of-war between leading local partner PT Alatief NusakaryaCorp. and the major foreign partner in the venture, Telkom Malaysia,regarding control of the project.In early January Telekom Malaysia, which has a 25 per cent stake in theconsortium, raised the possibility of a withdrawal from the project.Given that each of the JOS consortia was required to make up-frontpayments of tens of millions of dollars any firm replacing theMalaysian company would presumably "buy it out".Kalimantan is now the only JOS division that has yet to be handed overto its selected consortium. Encompassing most of the large island ofBorneo, the territory is the smallest project in the scheme in terms ofboth the number of existing lines and the lines to be installed (Seetable over page).Daya Mitra's other members are PT Intidaya Sistelindomitra; KoptuindoTelecom Malaysia Bhd; TM Communications (UK) Ltd; and AmericanInternational Assurance Co. Ltd. Under its contract with Telkom, theconsortium is to lay 237,000 new lines over the next 3 years (See tableprevious page).According to M Furqon I Hanief, executive director of the IndonesianTelecommunications Society (Mastel), the problems in Daya Mitra is notone between Telekom Malaysia and Alatief Corp. but is rather,"something inside Telekom Malaysia"."If it was a dispute between the partners, Alatief could easily findanother foreign partner," Hanief told APTA. "There are plenty ofJapanese companies which would very much like to participate," headded.Alternatively, Hantief speculated, Telkom Malaysia's extended posturingmight be designed to exact changes to Daya Mitra's JOS contract. But hesaid he did not know what the desired changes to Daya Mitra's contractmight be. "I have been asking various people about this, but so far Ihaven't got any answers," he conceded.While Daya Mitra is alone among the 5 JOS consortia in holding up itsascension to the driving seat, Jakarta observers are taking asympathetic view of the group's difficulties, obscure as they are."It is probably genuine that they are balking at the terms," saidJakarta-based Robert Adair of GK Goh's Securities. Representatives ofDaya Mitra declined to comment on the problem.Indonesia's Telkom, which floated 19 per cent of its enlarged sharecapital on the New York, London, Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchangesin November, has reportedly advised the Jakarta Stock Exchange thatTelkom Malaysia may have to be replaced with another foreign partner.During their 15-year concession periods, the 5 JOS consortia areexpected to operate and maintain their existing fixed lines in theirrespective geographical divisions, as well as laying a total of morethan 2m new lines before the end of March 1999. This expansion is to bethe private sector's contribution to the 5m lines which the governmentaims to see laid by the end of its 6th 5-year development plan (April1994-March 1999).Telkom is to receive a minimum annual payment from each of theconsortia - in the region of $100m and 30 per cent of their operatingrevenues. The existing networks are assumed by the JOS contracts to beself-financing, while the costs of the new lines are to be borne by theconsortia. As Telkom's Santoso was quoted recently: "Telkom has nothingto lose."Greater Jakarta and East Java, Indonesia's 2 largest manufacturing andcommercial centres, will remain in Telkom's hands.The JOS contracts are said to provide that Telkom may grant furthernetwork-expansion projects to the companies, while the JOS consortiaare to have what is described as "First negotiating rights". Jakartabased Laksono Widodo of Barings in Jakarta speculated that the DayaMitra difficulties involve the number of new lines stipulated in thecontract."Probably Telkom Malaysia plans to install more than the number oflines stated in the contract," he told APTA. "So the local partnerwould have to contribute more in terms of investment." Widodo addedthat the dispute appears to be between the parties to the consortium -an increase in the number of lines would presumably entail an amendmentto the contract between Daya Mitra and Indonesia's Telkom.Any amendment to any of the JOS contracts is bound to be resistedstrenuously by Telkom, not least because of the precedent it would setfor the other 4 consortia. Telkom Malaysia may not be the onlyparticipation company nervous about the profitability of the JOSscheme, under which the private sector bears virtually all the risks."It's quite dangerous ground for Telkom. Others might start asking tohave their contracts amended," said an analyst with an internationalfirm in Jakarta. "The government wants to avoid any substantialrenegotiation of the KSO (JOS) agreements particularly in view offuture privatisations," the source told APTA.In the JOS division of Eastern Indonesia, which is comprised ofSulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and East and West Nusa Tengara, PT BukakaSingtel took over the telecoms network on 3 January. Comprised ofSingapore Telecom International and Fadel Muhammad's Bukaka TelekomindoInternational, the consortium is to lay 403,000 new lines.Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, a consortium of PT Astratel Nusantara (59 percent); PT Intertel Pratama Media; the cooperative of telecoms ministryemployees; France Cable et Radio (a France Telecom subsidiary), tookover the existing 600,000 lines in Sumatra on 8 January. Astratel is asubsidiary of Indonesia's publicly-listed Astra International Pramindois expected to install 460,000 new lines on the island at an estimatedcost of $570m. Santosa was quoted as saying that his company's minimumrevenue payment from Pramindo would be Rp514bn for this year, a figureto be paid on top of 30 per cent of operating profits.Reuters reported in mid-January that Pramindo has mandated BanqueNationale de Paris, Chase Manhattan Bank Asia, Fuji Bank and SocieteGeneral to arrange a $350m commercial loan facility to finance theSumatra project. The credit facility, which is to be offered forgeneral syndication shortly, will mature in 8 years.In the JOS division of West Java, the PT Aria West Internationalconsortium took charge of domestic telecoms on 12 January. Aria West ismade up of PT Aritmas Kencana Murni, PT Aria Bahtera Internusa, US WestInternational and the Asian Infrastructure Fund. Its contract providedfor the installation of 500,000 new lines, more than doubling the sizeof the phone network to 985,896 lines by the end of March, 1999. Thiswill see Sumatra's telephone penetration reach 3.8 as compared with 1.8at present. Penetration (the ratio of lines per 100 population) standsat 1.6 lines nationally.PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia, made up of PT Indosat, WidyaDuta Informindo, Kokarindo, PT Krida Salindo Sentosa, Telstra(Australia), Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, Itochu, and Sumitomotook over the JOS division of Central Java and Yogyakarta on 9 January.The consortium must lay 400,000 new lines.

It was reacting to a court order obtained by ClearCommunications which prevents it going ahead with a programming centreagreement with Sky.Clear is seeking to have the programming content agreement stopped onthe grounds it is anti-competitive (See APTA October 9).This court offer follows an earlier one relating to Telecom's purchaseof 24.9 per cent of Sky from its major shareholders Bell Atlantic andAmeritech. This is in limbo until the courts rule definitively on thebid by Clear and BellSouth New Zealand to have overturned the go-aheadfor the deal from the New Zealand Commerce Commission.Telecom has already hinted it might eventually not go ahead with thatpart of the deal if the value of the investment, and therefore theprice it has to pay, goes up too much in the intervening period.As the agreement to acquire a financial stake in Sky was alsoconditional to reaching a content agreement, the deal is now injeopardy on 2 fronts.On the other, Telecom says, "Clear's spoiling tactics just reinforceour determination to get on with the business of providing a newservice and offering more choice to more and more people."Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996GSM NETWORK IN SHANGHAIChina Unicom, fledgeling second network operator, has attracted 10,000subscribers to its GSM network in Shanghai since it began signing themup 3 months ago.

The MPT was trying tomatch its services in the digital phone market, he said, and wasspending heavily on advertising to promote its services for the firsttime.Unicom plans to lay a fibre-optic cable network in Beijing and to addan additional 40 to 50 base stations to its cellular network there.This would take its capacity to 100,000 connections in Beijing, Pengsaid, including 30,000 lines for long distance calls.Back to Headline List CopyrightASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMS ANALYST via NewsNetJanuary 22, 1996TELEKOM MALAYSIA SIGNING EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTSTelekom Malaysia has followed the example of rival Binariang andstarted signing exclusive agreements to provide telecoms services.Binariang, which last week lofted Malaysia's first telecoms satellite(See cover story), was the first in the field signing with tenants andco-investors in the massive Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) project inthe heart of capital.

The magazine wasfirst available at SpeechTEK '95, a conference for speechtechnology developers held in Boston.The premier edition featured articles on a variety of speechrecognition issues. The articles included how speech shouldbecome the natural interface for public telephone networkservices, the advent of "no hands" dialing for cellular carphones and the speech recognition problems caused by differentdialects. The magazine also featured detailed market forecastsfor the various segments of the automatic speech recognitionand text-to-speech markets and a review of the factorsinvolved in the development of API (application programinterface) standards.Filling an Industry VoidDespite the fact that voice recognition and speech synthesishave become hot industry topics for many business andtechnical publications, users have long had to gleaninformation from publications that had only a casual interestin the topic. "Speech Technology fills a long standing void inthe industry," said Lewis. "We were surprised to find that noother national publication focused on speech. The timing, thetechnology and the market conditions all seemed right tolaunch the magazine at this time."CI Publishing is a division of Comtek International, Inc.,which produced and managed SpeechTEK.Back to Headline List CopyrightAUDIOTEX UPDATE via NewsNetJanuary 1996THIRD ANNUAL ASAT CONFERENCE SCHEDULED FOR APRILAdvanced Speech Applications and Technology (ASAT),'96 hasbecome the commercial speech recognition show.

(643 words) YEAR IN REVIEW LAN SWITCHING HUB MARKET GROWING: GOOD NEWS FOR CARRIER ATM SALES (400 words) CopyrightBROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 19961995 YEAR-END BROADBAND NETWORKING REVIEW     Upon reviewing the developments in the 1995 broadband networkingmarket, the differences in terms of market acceptance and technicaldevelopment of each broadband technology -- frame relay, switchedmultimegabit data service (SMDS), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-- are dramatic.  Each networking solution occupies a differentposition on the acceptance curve, and carriers and vendors pursuednumerous strategies in 1995 to spur the adoption of the technologies.     It is not news to BROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS' readers that framerelay had an incredibly successful 1995.  Carriers increased therobustness of their networks to meet clamoring demand, pursued avariety of pricing strategies designed to capture greater marketshares, and offered enhanced frame relay services to satisfy moresophisticated users.  All three measures reflect the technology'smaturity and mass market acceptance as a wide area networkingsolution.  ...Frame Relay Pricing Approaches     AT&T, Sprint Corp., and MCI Communications Corp. all unveiled newframe relay pricing strategies in 1995.  AT&T -- hoping to leveragewhat it saw as a trend toward meshed networks and encourage users toadd more network sites -- lowered the price of permanent virtual cir-cuits (PVCs) by 65 percent to 85 percent and raised its frame relayport charges by 35 percent to 45 percent (See BNN, April 18, 1995).       Sprint pursued a different pricing tactic to attract customers,offering a very low-cost, zero committed information rate (CIR)service for users needing no more than four PVCs (See BNN, June 27,1995).       MCI took yet a third track.  The carrier eliminated the mileagebands that had been associated with its service and offered usage-based billing, which should prove attractive to low-usage customers(See BNN, Oct. 3, 1995).  Expect more pricing changes in 1996 ascarriers continue to seek new methods for luring customers to their networks and as the FCC has required that all facilities-basedcarriers file frame relay tariffs.     Carriers also increased the robustness of their frame relayservices. In 1995, LDDS Worldcom was the most aggressive of the longdistance carriers at pursing network-to-network interface (NNI) agree-ments with local and international providers.  Worldcom offers NNIservice in 31 domestic cities via interconnections with all of theregional holding companies and other local carriers.  Someinternational agreements are also in place.  The links allow Worldcomto extend its network reach and to provide customers with lower costlocal access.     AT&T unveiled a strong suite of frame relay disaster recoveryoptions, while Sprint launched a managed frame relay access device(FRAD) service for Systems Network Architecture (SNA) users.  MCIsought to expand customer access to its frame relay network byoffering a wide array of remote access options.  (See BNN, Nov. 28,1995; Oct. 3, 1995; and Nov. 14, 1995)  ...ATM Infrastructure Buildout     In the wide area ATM arena, carriers continued building theirinitial infrastructures in preparation for expected customer demand. LDDS Worldcom, Sprint, Ameritech Corp., GTE Corp., and MFS Datanetwere among those that upgraded their ATM networks in 1995.  ATM alsoproved to be a successful carrier backbone solution for transportingframe relay traffic.     Although few customers actually are buying native ATM services,carriers experimented with new service offerings designed to make ATMeasier to use and to tempt customers to test the service.  Sprintlaunched low-speed T-1 ATM as well as a frame relay-to-ATM serviceinterworking offering.  Both services provide a migration strategy forframe relay users that may need additional capacity in their congestedsites and also offer users a lower-cost option for experimenting withATM.  Other carriers are expected to launch similar services.     Worldcom became the first carrier to offer available bit rate(ABR) ATM based on StrataCom's early implementation of ABRcapabilities on its BPX switch.  As the ATM Forum's traffic managementspecifications solidify in 1996, expect additional vendors andcarriers to roll out products and services based on the muchanticipated ABR spec.     MFS Datanet took a unique approach to running voice traffic overits ATM backbone.  Although MFS Datanet's WAVE offering is based on aproprietary solution that utilizes Nortel's Magellan Passport ATMswitch, the service demonstrates MFS' ability to develop easy-to-useATM solutions.  Customers don't have to change their networks, but cancontinue using their existing PBX systems and data networkingequipment to transport data and voice traffic over variable bit rate(VBR) ATM (See BNN, Sept. 5, 1995).     This ability to make ATM transparent to users will be criticalfor attracting customers to the service.  Carriers and vendors that dothis well will have an advantage in 1996, and recognition of this factis demonstrated by the surge of interest that developed in the secondhalf of 1995 for wide area ATM access products. Several vendorsincluding ADC Kentrox, OnStream Networks, and Premisys  began shippingor unveiled plans to produce wide area ATM access products.  Thistrend is sure to continue in 1996.  ...Offering End-to-End Solutions    Another key trend that evolved throughout 1995 in the ATM arenawas the importance of offering customers end-to-end solutions thatencompass both local and wide area networks.  Some vendors, NewbridgeNetworks for example, concentrated on developing their own productsthat span both the LAN and WAN, while others like FORE Systems andNortel pursued partnerships that involved joint product development aswell as co-marketing.  Acquisitions and partnerships are likely tocontinue in 1996.  Smaller firms likely will attempt to increase theirmarket presence by merging with each other, and large companies willgobble up startups with unique and innovative products.  ...SMDS, The Sleeper Service    Although SMDS is not expected to achieve frame relay's popularity,several developments in 1995 will help spur additional sales.  Manylocal carriers rolled out low-speed SMDS, which should prove popularwith firms wanting to add remote sites to the corporate network.      The growth of image intensive applications in the printing andmedical communities is expected to continue in 1996, and SMDS hasproven popular in these industries.  Pricing changes by MCI, whicheliminated the service's usage minimums, also should lower thebarriers to entry for companies wanting to move to the new service.      The Internet proved a boon to all three broadband technologies in1995, as companies bought circuits from carriers for access andvendors sold products to build high-speed Internet backbones.  Aslocal telcos continue their move into the Internet access business in1996, vendors and carriers with products and services that performwell in the Internet environment are expected to prosper.Back to Headline List CopyrightBROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996ON THE MOVE FROM BROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS*  FORE Systems plans to buy LAN switch manufacturer ALANTEC Corp. ina one-for-one stock swap that Montgomery Securities values at over$750 million.

Racal will pay Pounds 132.75 million ($204.5 million) to acquire BRT.    BRT's business principally consists of providingtelecommunications services to Railtrack and the railway operatingcompanies.  With some 6,900 miles of trunk cable and 10,000 miles ofbranch cables, BRT is the largest telecommunications infrastructurenetwork operator in the U.K. other than British Telecom, Mercury, andmilitary establishments.     The BRT network provides voice, data, and radio network services;private circuits; and a range of customer premise equipment.  Thecompany employs around 2,800 people based at some 180 locationsthroughout the U.K.  The business is divided into four operatingsections:     *  Networks. Provides and manages fixed and mobiletelecommunications network services.    *  Carrier Services. Provides dark fiber, management of tele-communications wayleaves, and management of pay phones and otherproperty-based assets.    *  Maintenance. Provides maintenance of equipment andtelecommunications and electronic systems.    *  Projects and Works. Comprises a project engineering andinstallation service for the supply of telecommunications networks,systems, and equipment.  ...Competitive Position Strengthened    BRT will become a separate subsidiary within the Racal NetworkServicesgroup, managed on a fully integrated basis with the other businesses. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Racal's competitive positionto provide managed network services and to enhance the prospects forthe Racal Group as a whole.  BRT's fiber-based network will provideaccess to extensive telecommunications circuits and telecommunicationswayleaves over Railtrack and British Railways Board property.  Theintegration of BRT with other Racal Network Services businesses willresult in cost savings through improved utilization of BRT capacity,sharing of assets, and avoiding duplication of functions within theenlarged group.    Ownership of the BRT network and its capabilities will enhance theprospect of securing substantial and strategically importantcommercial and government contracts.  Racal's existing work force willbe strengthened through the addition of the skilled engineering andnational maintenance staff employed by BRT.    Commenting on the acquisition, Racal Chairman Sir Ernest Harrisonsaid, "There is considerable growth potential for BRT in both the railcommunity and other related markets within the fast-moving managedtelecommunications sector, where Racal has an outstanding record... As the turnkey contractor responsible for the installation andmaintenance of the entire voice and data communications infrastructurefor the Channel tunnel, Racal has particular expertise in the railenvironment, and we believe that the acquisition of BRT will bringsubstantial benefits to both parties."    Racal won the contract to establish the Government Data Network --which remains one of Europe's largest private data network -- in 1989,and also manages the communications requirements of a growing numberof major companies. Despite losing out to Mercury to provide managedcommunications services for the police and for NatWest Bank, Racalgained a full telecom license in 1994, and has in excess of 300,000customers for its voice, data, and messaging services.    Because BRT is a member (with a 7.7 percent share) of thepan-European rail communications consortium, which is building anoptical network, there will be opportunities for Racal to expand intocontinental Europe as well.

Work on all three documents is progressingin tandem so that the provisions in each will align.    George Dobrowski, chairman of the technical committee and directorof broadband switching and signaling for Bell Communications Research,reported that group members clarified various points in all threespecs.  Regarding the provisions for allowed cell rate, membersdecided that ATM switches, rather than network interface cards, wouldbe responsible for governing allowed cell rates.     "By putting the function in the switch, it allows us to eliminatetwo quality of service (QOS) parameters, so it simplifies the trafficmanagement and signaling procedures.  It also reduces the cost ofimplementation in the network interface cards," Dobrowski said.  Headded that switches can better bear those implementation costs becausethey are spread over more users.  ...International Interoperability Addressed    The groups determined that support for the internationally definedQOS classes (i.e. A,B,C,D) is mandatory, whereas the parameterapproach defined by the ATM Forum will be optional.  However, asDobrowski explained, "If you do specify [the parameters] and thedevice is able to understand them, then the parameter approach willtake precedence over QOS classes because it gives you more precision." He added that the QOS class approach is the only one included in theinternational standards and that vendors wanting to sell equipment inEurope need to use an internationally recognized standard.  "Thisaddresses the interoperability concerns that people had betweenequipment based on ITU standards versus ATM Forum implementations,"Dobrowski said.    In the signaling arena, the group solidified negotiationprocedures.  "With the previous release of the signaling spec, if theconnection point couldn't accept your request, you had to start theconnection all over again," Dobrowski explained.  "Now, somenegotiation will be possible.  Users can access or reject or adjustdownward their initial request and go forward with it."   The resultis faster connections, as users won't need to resend certain signalingmessages if network capacity is not available to meet their bandwidthrequirements.    Other specs out for final ballot include the DS-3 direct mappingphysical layer interface, an addendum to the 155 unshielded twistedpair (UTP) physical layer interface, the native ATM services semanticdescription (or ATM application programming interface), the ProtocolImplementation Conformance Statement (PIC) for UTP 3, and theconformance abstract test suite for AAL type 5.  A clarifying LANemulation addendum also was released.  ...Reevaluation Underway    As work nears completion on many critical issues before the ATMForum, members are closely examining the role the body will take inthe future.  "We are going through a strategic planning process,identifying potential work areas or what holes exist in providing end-to-end ATM connections.  We will go through a debate and votingprocess to pick out high priority items," Dobrowski said.  He saidthat so far the group has identified 21 potential work areas, and thatin April the technical committee will restructure its working groupsand make new assignments.  Although he wouldn't commit the committeeto any specific areas, Dobrowski noted that, "The item which receivedthe most attention at the last meeting was wireless ATM.  It's stillearly to say, but that seemed to have very broad support and...that isa candidate for new work."Back to Headline List CopyrightBROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BT SETS NEW SPEED RECORD FOR FIBER.

These includean optical transistor, which BT claims is capable of processinginformation at 80 Gbps, and a high-speed optical switch many timessmaller than existing designs.    These are the basic building blocks used to construct anall-optical telephone exchange that can read information from a packetof data at a rate of 100 Gbps, decode the identity of the intendedrecipient, and switch the packet onto its destination path.  BTanticipates bringing this technology out of the lab during 1996, andbuilding a working prototype photonic network.  The prototype networkwill use the existing optical fiber linking six towns in South EastEngland to allow the new devices to be tested in real workingconditions.

Insight believes that the growing LAN switching hub marketis good news for the ATM industry because such hubs provide amigration path to ATM, while still allowing companies to maximize theuse of their legacy systems.     "LAN switching hubs are the immediate solution and will provide aneasy migration to ATM switching platforms when their use becomeswidespread toward the end of the decade," said Robert Rosenberg,president of Insight.    The research firm predicts that shipments of LAN hubs in theUnited States will grow from $4.6 billion in 1995 to $14.9 billion bythe year 2000.  Worldwide hub revenues are targeted to increase from$6.2 billion to $19.7 billion in 2000 (see box).  In its report,Insight outlines a variety of strategies that carriers can use tocapture a piece of this growing market.  ...Technical Cooperation Encouraged     Carriers are encouraged to promote close alliances with switchmanufacturers and to freely exchange technical information withvendors.  "If the switch manufacturer has access to the technicaldetails of the carrier's network operations, the switch manufacturercan then design products which work well with the carrier's publicdata service," writes Insight.  "The user would be assured of both thenetwork performance and the compatibility between the carrier'snetwork and the LAN switch."    Insight also believes that using wide area ATM to support a LANinterconnection service offers carriers significant opportunities forgrowth.  It recommends that service providers:    *  Strictly adhere to ATM standards.  Compliance will ensure thatprocedures such as congestion control are uniform across both localand long-distance networks and that interconnection is transparent tousers.    *  Provide cost-effective ATM service pricing.  The cost ofdeploying ATM needs to be justifiable initially for data traffic only.    *  Use flexible connections.  Provide a simple tariff based onport bandwidth capacity and avoid the complexities of frame relaypricing.    *  Provide competitive differentiation.  Value-added features andindustry-specific applications can help carriers distinguish theirservices from pure ATM transport offerings.

The 76-channel video offering would compete directlywith incumbent cable TV operators statewide and would offer"competitively priced" services.     For example, the company will offer near-video-on-demand at"much greater frequency" than cable TV pay-per-view offerings inthe state, said Patrice Listfield, President of SNET PersonalVision.  In addition, she said subscribers will be able to call upmovies from remote controls.  At CTR's deadline, the company wasplanning to apply on Jan. 25 for the franchise.     With the announcement, SNET becomes the latest telephonecompany to reject a VDT model.  Ameritech Corp. already has signedcable franchise agreements in several towns in its service area. Regarding SNET, Ms. Listfield said the company will continue its350-subscriber VDT trial in West Hartford until that area can beincluded in its cable operations.  Meanwhile, the company plans towithdraw all its pending VDT applications at the FCC.  "We justdon't want to keep Connecticut customers waiting," she said.     Ms. Listfield declined to say whether the company always willprice services at rates below existing cable TV rates, adding, "Wedon't aim to [offer service] at higher prices."  She said SNETPersonal Vision will be the first company to bundle local exchangeservice and cable TV offerings in the same package.  "We are pavingthe way," she said.  "This is unprecedented."     SNET's plan is unique because it would bypass hundreds ofpotentially lengthy franchise negotiations with local governments. Connecticut is one of the few states that oversee cable TVfranchises at the state level.  Most states leave that authority toindividual cities.     SNET Personal Vision will deploy a hybrid fiber optic/coaxialcable network and hopes for DPUC approval by mid-December, Ms.Listfield said.  She said no cross-subsidization will occur betweenthe company's cable and telephone operations, in accordance withstate and federal law.  The SNET Personal Vision subsidiary may useSouthern New England Telephone Co. facilities, but it will pay feesor rent as would a separate company, she said.  Hoshang Mulla, VicePresident-network planning for SNET, said Personal Vision willpresent "a very well thought out and extremely fair and properproposal" to the DPUC that guards against cross-subsidization.       He added that network upgrades in progress will boostefficiency so much that the cost of providing telephone service canrecede as the video operations are deployed.  Mr. Mulla also saidnew technology will allow the video network to continue operatingduring power outages, as occurs with SNET's existing localtelephone service.     Ms. Listfield declined to discuss possible cross-promotionactivities that could stem from SNET's combined video, localtelephone, and long distance operations, but she predicted tie-insbetween the company's business contacts from its printed directorydivision and cable TV advertising sales.  "We certainly look tocapitalize on those relationships," she said.  She added thatPersonal Vision will use results of the West Hartford trial to helpfacilitate the cable TV deployment.     The company said it expects its upgraded system to reach 36%of Connecticut homes and business by the end of 1998, with 64% ofthe state completed by the year 2000 and full deployment by 2009. That schedule coincides with the $4.5 billion upgrade plan thatSNET announced about two years ago, officials said.  Amongcommunities where the build-out will be complete by the end of 1998are Bethel, Bloomfield, Branford, Bristol, Darien, East Haven,Fairfield, Farmington, Meriden, Milford, New Britain, Norwalk, OldGreenwich, Stamford, Stratford, Wallingford, West Hartford, andWestport.  Also by 1998, the system will be partially complete inBridgeport (65%), Danbury (89%), Hartford (17%), New Haven (70%),North Haven (79%), Plymouth (55%), Trumbull (16%), West Haven(98%), and Weston (92%), Personal Vision said.     Personal Vision said it expects to deploy the service inportions of Darien, Fairfield, Norwalk, Stamford, Weston, Westport,Farmington, New Britain, and West Hartford within "a few months"from the time it receives regulatory approval.  In addition, SNETplans to engage in negotiations with NYNEX Corp. in Greenwich, andWoodbury Telephone Co. in Southbury and Bethlehem, to "developarrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cablealternative in those areas."Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996AT&T's $137.5 Million Deal with DirecTV Enhances Already PowerfulCable TV Competitor     AT&T Corp. has acquired a 2.5% equity interest in directbroadcast satellite (DBS) provider DirecTV, Inc., for $137.5million.  The deal gives DirecTV marketing access to AT&T's 90million customers and bolsters its competitive position against thecable TV industry.  Under the deal, AT&T has the option to increaseits stake to 30% over the next five years, depending on how manysubscribers it enrolls over an unspecified period.  The deal'sprice tag puts AT&T's valuation of DirecTV at $5.5 billion.  Thecompanies said they expect to start joint marketing by mid-1996.     AT&T chose an equity investment over less involved partneringschemes to "put your money where your mouth is, so this isn't justa marketing game," said Joseph Nacchio, Executive Vice President ofAT&T's consumer-small business division.  He declined to disclosewhat specific triggers would allow AT&T to increase its investmentbut said there will not be another option until at least 1997.     The purchase, which was announced Jan. 21, came two daysbefore AT&T was expected to bid for its own DBS license in theFCC's auction of the remaining orbital slots at 110 and 148 degreesWest Longitude.  Mr. Nacchio said the company opted to buy intoDirecTV because obtaining its own license was expected to cost morethan $1 billion for bidding and system deployment.       He said it would have taken at least two years to get theservice off the ground, time that AT&T did not want to cede tocompetitors.  DirecTV, on the other hand, is already establishedand would allow AT&T to tap the market now, he said.     Analysts at Merrill Lynch endorsed AT&T's approach.  Theypredicted "no significant impact on earnings" but said AT&T'sequity investment strategy is "a smart and sensible way of enteringthe home entertainment business."  In addition, they said the movemay have implications for cable TV companies and "makes it somewhatmore imperative" that MCI Communications Corp. step up its effortsto bid for a DBS slot.     In addition, AT&T and DirecTV touted the marketingpossibilities.  DirecTV President Eddy Hartenstein said AT&T willbe an "extremely powerful" outlet to promote DirecTV services andincrease its brand identity.  Mr. Nacchio promised that "a lot ofinteresting marketing techniques" will come to light over the nextfew months.  Plans include allowing customers to use an AT&T creditcard to finance the purchase of the 18-inch satellite dishesrequired to receive DirecTV--at "very attractive" interest rates.      Mr. Nacchio said 12 million customers now use the card.  Inaddition, AT&T will add a DirecTV sales pitch to its telemarketingand direct sales efforts, and its retail outlets--first establishedfor wireless sales--will be used to sell DirecTV as well, Mr.Nacchio said.  He said AT&T also plans regularly to promote DirecTVin its billing literature.       The cable TV industry could use the deal to enhance itsargument that the FCC's "effective competition" standard--outlinedin the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and CompetitionAct--should be changed to reflect alleged market realities, somecable TV industry lawyers confirmed.  The industry has argued, forinstance, that the 1992 Cable Act's effective competitiondefinition is arbitrary and bears no relation to economic models.     Under the current rules, a cable TV operator must prove thata local competitor is accessible to at least 50% of the operator'spotential customers and that the competitor actually has garneredat least 15% of the operator's current customer base.  The cable TVindustry has argued that DBS services such as DirecTV meet the 50%standard because they are national businesses.  It has saidcompetitive pricing pressures occur substantially before 15% of anincumbent operator's customers are lost.     The FCC has signaled that it will waive rate regulation on acase-by-case basis when the local competitive situation merits. Seth Davidson, a cable TV lawyer with the Washington firm ofFleishman and Walsh, cited Bell Atlantic Corp.'s video dial-toneactivities in Dover Township, N.J., which prompted the Commissionto propose a partial waiver of the rate rules for Adelphia CableCommunications, Inc., the incumbent cable TV operator there. AT&T's investment in DirecTV likely offers "one more fact thatpeople will point to" when cable TV operators request waivers inthe future, he said.     A spokesman at the National Cable Television Association(NCTA) said the AT&T investment does not signify a major milestonein the effective competition debate, but "it makes the argumentthat cable TV is operating in a competitive marketplace."  He saidimportant factors include the "influx of capital" that DirecTV willreceive from AT&T and the benefits of adding AT&T to its nationalbranding efforts.  He said, however, that the cable TV industryremains poised to compete with national and regional entities,noting the industry's continuing efforts to "cluster" its cable TVoperations into regional hubs capable of matching the scale of newvideo competitors.     Competition from DirecTV primarily affects the expanded basictier of cable TV services, Mr. Davidson said.  He noted that manynew DirecTV customers keep the lowest cable tier--often mostlybroadcast channels--in addition to DirecTV, which cannot offerlocal broadcast stations.  As a result, the FCC has begun torealize that "this doesn't have to be all or nothing" and thatexpanded-tier deregulation can be an adequate relaxation of therate rules, he added.  As for the 15% standard, he said, "You dorespond to competitive pressure short of that threshold."  Theproposed 1995 Telecommunications Act pending in Congress wouldrelax expanded cable TV tier regulation when there is a telephonecompany competitor, but the legislation does not contemplate thesame flexibility when there is a DBS presence, according to thedraft conference report.     Although the basics of the AT&T-DirecTV deal are set, bothcompanies said several issues remain unresolved.  Mr. Hartensteinsaid details "haven't been worked out" about possible changes inarrangements with DBS satellite dish manufacturers.  It is alsounclear whether AT&T's newly spun-off equipment division will havea manufacturing role, Mr. Nacchio said, but "we're considering it." Mr. Hartenstein said he expects nine or 10 dish brand names tosurface by mid-summer.  He said DirecTV also has not determinedwhether the transaction will lead to changes in the service'sprogramming lineup or will spur a combined effort with AT&T toprovide interactive and data services.  He said negotiations areunder way regarding an online service venture but declined to givedetails.  "We are well aware of the 30 million PC households," hesaid.     Some have speculated that DirecTV might strike a deal withNBC, Inc., which recently announced a partnership with MicrosoftCorp. to turn its America's Talking cable network into acombination news channel/online service.  Mr. Hartenstein saidDirecTV has not held "specific discussions" with NBC, but "we mostlikely will."     Cable TV industry sources said the AT&T-DirecTV announcementwill present another competitive hurdle for the industry, which hasexpressed concern over DirecTV's ability to garner 1.2 millioncustomers in only 18 months.  Others said the deal calls intoquestion the assumption that AT&T eventually will use the cable TVindustry's infrastructure to resell local telephone service.  AT&Tlong has criticized the local exchange access charges assessed bytelcos.  Mr. Nacchio said the deal is not expected to affect AT&T'sfuture relationship with the cable TV industry, which "has to dealwith the future as we have to deal with it."  He argued that AT&Tis still "an attractive partner" for cable TV companies.     New telecommunications alliances based on one-stop-shoppingbusiness models increasingly may force "competitors andcollaborators" to mingle, said Paul Glist, a cable TV industrylawyer at Cole, Raywid and Braverman in Washington.  He said thecable industry always has cited "natural alliances" with longdistance companies (although the two industries have disagreed onsignificant provisions in the telecom bill now pending inCongress).  "What does this [the AT&T-DirecTV deal] mean for thelong-term relationship?" he asked.     As the telecommunications industry becomes more consolidated,companies are bound to intertwine in some business areas whilecompeting in others, Mr. Glist said.  Another cable lawyer said theAT&T-DirecTV deal suggests that DBS competition is "quite real. . .[It has] a real competitive impact" and "further bolsters whatwe've been saying all along" about DBS as a serious competitivethreat.  DirecTV is a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., which isowned by General Motors Corp.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996NCTA Revives Customer Service Campaign As Competition from TelcosLooms     The National Cable TV Association (NCTA) has revived lastyear's "on-time" guarantee program, partly to gain ground againsttelephone companies, which are perceived widely as providing bettercustomer service as they prepare to enter video markets.  An NCTAspokesman noted "a positive movement in the needle" of publicperception concerning the cable industry's customer service recordsince the guarantee was implemented in March 1995.  He admitted,however, that the cable TV industry still lags behind telcos in thepublic's mind.  "If we were ahead, we would not be so committed toa program like 'The Future Is on Cable,'" the industry's title ofthe overall customer service campaign.  Under the program,participating cable TV operators offer to meet appointment"windows" or issue a $20 rebate to the customer.     Although the customer service campaign got off to amuch-publicized start last year and was followed by a flurry ofnational advertising, it has fizzled considerably in recent months. Not only did every broadcast network except News Corp.'s Fox refuseto run the ads, citing competitive reasons, but the cable TVindustry has had to focus its efforts on the pendingtelecommunications reform legislation.     NCTA has announced several changes in the campaign--includinga shift from national to local advertising, with more emphasis onlocal system branding to counter the greater name recognition ofthe Bell companies.  The NCTA spokesman also noted that localadvertising will allow each cable TV operator to customize itsmessage to a specific local competitive situation.     Char Beales, President and Chief Operating Officer of Cable &Telecommunications:  A Marketing Society (CTAM), said during arecent satellite teleconference that CTAM will send severalmarketing and public relations kits to local system operators inthe next few weeks.  Included will be videotapes of shortcommercials touting the campaign.  She urged systems to run theshorts at least three times daily on at least 10 channel slots. NCTA President Decker Anstrom said the industry has not yetconducted a "thorough market study" of its customer serviceperformance over the last year, but he stressed that "there's noquick fix" to the service problems of the past.  "We don't expectto win the whole game in the first year," he said, but the cable TVindustry needs "changes in behavior."  He said that is "the reasonwe're going to beat our competition in the months and years ahead."     John Hendricks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ofDiscovery Communications, Inc., noted that he once chased down acable TV maintenance truck in an attempt to receive service.  Hesaid the industry needs to leave "the truck-chasing days" behind itas competition develops.     The NCTA spokesman said that despite the public's differentperception of the cable TV and telephone industries, most telcosare "looking more toward those kinds of technologies that aresuited to cable-style infrastructures."     That means the cable TV industry is ahead in terms of networkcapabilities, he said.  He maintained that a cable TV company'shybrid fiber optic/coaxial network can handle up to about 25% ofits users on the network simultaneously, while most current coppertelco lines can handle only 10%.  Although many telcos areupgrading to fiber facilities, he said, the cable TV industry maybe able to take an early bite out of the telecom market beforetelcos are up to speed.     Mr. Hendricks said one of the first areas that cable TVoperators hope to pry from the telcos is access to online services. The industry has spent the last few months touting the faster datatransmission rates of cable modems when compared to current telcoalternatives (CTR, Jan. 12).  He said cable-related Web sites alsocan promote local cable systems by giving online users informationabout their local cable TV operators based on the users' zip codes.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Cable TV Companies Embrace Use of ATM Technology, but Not to theHomeBy Judith Freeman Mills     About two years ago, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) was anew technology, far from being well-known, standardized, or cheap. Today some major cable TV system operators are deploying ATMswitches, championing a technology developed to move vast amountsof digital data, video, and voice communications simultaneously andat extremely high speeds.  ATM networks can route and switchinformation over a large geographic area, unlike other availablesystems.     Continental Cablevision, Inc., and Time Warner Cable haveconcluded from their own experiences with ATM networks that for theforeseeable future, ATM is the preferred, cost-effective technologyfor building the backbone of a broadband digital communicationsnetwork.  But they also have concluded that ATM networks are notthe preferable connections to homes.     Key to their conclusion is the belief that one-way videochannels, such as Cable News Network or pay-per-view offerings,will continue to dominate consumer television.  This view alsoaffects their ideas about set-top boxes.       They believe that set-top units should be built first tohandle MPEG-II (Motion Picture Experts Group) digital video andlater adapted to handle interactive services, not the other (moreexpensive) way around.     Officials at Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs),the cable TV industry's research and development arm based inLouisville, Colo., are tracking the development of ATM technologyclosely.  They continue to question when it will be fully developedand economically sensible.     Time Warner has 4,000 households on its state-of-the-art FullService Network in Orlando, Fla.  The FSN was built as a laboratoryto test services that could be available on a broadband network: one-way video, impulse pay-per-view programming, home shopping andbanking, computer data transmission and Internet access, videoconferencing, distance education, and local and long distancetelephone services.  The system also features ATM switching all theway to the home.     Based on what Time Warner has learned, the company will notrepeat the architecture, says Michael Adams, Time Warner Cable'sSenior ATM Project Engineer.  Instead, he advocates the use of ATMtechnology from the headend (or "network operations center") out,but not into residential neighborhoods as MPEG-format streams on anow-standard hybrid fiber optic/coaxial cable network.  ATMtechnology would be used only for the so-called backbone.  Mr.Adams prefers the following architecture:     Interactive video service providers transmit their programmingto a network operator, where it is stored on media servers ormassive computer storage banks (media servers also store movies andother pay-per-view fare).  When needed, the programming is movedonto the operator's core ATM switched network.     From there the interactive digital programming enters anInteractive Cable Gateway (ICG), the outer or ending edge of theATM backbone where the ATM signals are converted to an MPEG-IIformat.  Separately, one-way satellite-delivered digital videochannels (such as CNN or the Discovery Channel) arrive at theoperator's headend and are sent to a Broadcast Cable Gateway. These signals would be in MPEG format.     Both gateways feed into the hybrid fiber/coax network, whichthen sends the transmissions into neighborhoods, throughneighborhood optical nodes, and into subscriber homes.  Under thisscenario, transmissions outside the ATM backbone network would bein the MPEG-II format--a digital format that is becoming standardfor compression and transmission of digital video signals.  Thehome set-top box would be MPEG-II; operators would not need to payfor set-top boxes that also are capable of reading ATM streams.     Regarding the actual architecture of the Time Warner FSN, eachinteractive service provider's programming is stored on mediaservers.  From the server the programming enters the system's coreATM network and goes through an Interactive Cable Bridge (ICB),remaining in an ATM format.  Meanwhile, satellite-delivered videochannels enter the system's Broadcast Cable Gateway.  The ICB andthe BCG pass the ATM and MPEG signals on to the fiber optic/coaxialcable network, which connects to subscriber homes.     Subscriber set-top boxes must deal with "both MPEG-II and ATMtransports and. . .switch between them when switching frominteractive to broadcast programming," Mr. Adams says.  The FSNuses AT&T Network Systems' GlobeView-2000 ATM switch, which has amaximum throughput rate of 20 gigabits per second (20 billion bitsper second).     Under either architecture, at the end user's home or office aset-top box and/or a separate cable modem handles necessary signalconversions and routing to a TV set, computer, or telephone.  "Both(architectures) can be made to work," Mr. Adams says.  "However,for near-term deployment of cable networks, the first option isbetter for economic and technical reasons."     Ending the ATM portion of the network at the gateway makessense "for the pretty long term," he adds.  "So long as we have[one-way cable TV or broadcast TV] services and lay on digitalinteractive video, which we believe is the correct order, thismakes sense."  He notes, though, that the ATM Forum of seniortelecommunications engineers has been talking about wiringindividual homes with internal ATM networks.  "Pretty spacey," hesays.     Time Warner's FSN in Orlando deploys ATM technology to thehome partly because, when the project started, MPEG-II compressionand transmission were not well defined or standardized and did notcarry data well.  "Now, it is well defined, and there is goodmapping of data," Mr. Adams notes.  "So it is pretty future-proof."     Time Warner, Tele-Communications, Inc., and other operatorsfield-testing Microsoft's ATM-based Interactive Television (MITV)system--and other network programmers and system operators as well--will begin transmitting signals in the advanced MPEG-II formatthis year.     Set-top boxes used by direct satellite TV systems DirecTV andPrimeStar are "very close, if not exactly, MPEG-II capable," Mr.Adams says.  He points out that TELE-TV, a video programmingventure involving several Bell regional holding companies, andother companies are placing big orders for MPEG-II-capable set-topboxes.     Although MPEG-I and -II were developed specifically for videostreams, technical standards have been agreed upon for MPEG-II tohandle data and voice transmissions accurately, Mr. Adams says. Therefore, his recommended architecture could handle any service anetwork operator might want to offer consumers, he notes.  (TheOrlando FSN currently is testing one-way and interactive on-demandvideo programming.  It will add telephone and computer-based dataservices as the project progresses.)     Deploying an ATM network all the way to the end user mightmake sense in a business park, where customers need majormultimedia, desktop videoconferencing, and other high-techservices, Mr. Adams continues.       Today many local area networks serving major business parks orcorporate campuses already have ATM switches installed, making iteasy for the broadband plant operator to continue the line, henotes.  Mr. Adams says he has no hesitation about deployingATM-switched backbone networks.  Today "ATM is in such good shapein terms of standardization and interoperability," he adds.     "ATM is installed, working, and stable, and we're glad" to beusing it, says David Fellows, Senior Vice President-engineering andtechnology for Continental Cablevision.  Continental installed anATM backbone network to physically interconnect its New Englandcable systems.  The 200-mile fiber optic infrastructure includesKittery, Maine; Portsmouth and Concord, N.H.; Boston, Marion,Needham, Newton, Northampton, and Reading, Mass.; and Enfield,Conn.  The engineering control center is in Reading.     What had been individual system headends are now nodes on theATM backbone.  Continental is using Lightstream-2020 ATM switches. "ATM was installed in anticipation of rolling out high-speed data,"Mr. Fellows reports.  Continental also uses its ATM network to senddigital commercials out to systems for insertion on channellineups, for inter-company data transmission and mail, for employeeInternet access, and for inter-company telephony.     Video programming for the cable systems is sent on a parallelfiber cable, not the ATM network, Mr. Fellows says.  Because thetwo fiber networks were built at the same time using the sametrenches, the economic impact of adding more fiber to carry thecable video separately was "basically not a big deal," he explains.     Unlike Time Warner's FSN, which is running MPEG video over itsATM network, "we're not contemplating running our core video on theATM network," Mr. Fellows says.  "At the moment we don't need to." But when demand arises for real-time interactive video services,then "ATM is the way we think we're going to do that," he says.     For now, Mr. Fellows agrees with Mr. Adams' conclusion that anATM network should end at a hybrid fiber/coax system and that allvideo, data, and voice communications should be sent to residentialneighborhoods via MPEG-II transport.  He questions when, and atwhat price, set-top boxes will handle both ATM and MPEG-IItransmissions.     Continental started studying such a high-speed informationhighway about two years ago.  At that time, Mr. Fellows notes, thecompany explored the use of fiber digital data interconnect (FDDI)technology, which was considered reliable.  "But it couldn't go 200miles, so we knew at some point we would need to switch to ATM," hesays.  At that time, however, ATM was not 100% ready fordeployment.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 199613th Reconsideration Order Helps--and Hinders--Cable TV RateRegulationBy Nicholas P. Miller and Rick Ellrod--Miller, Canfield, Paddockand Stone, P.L.C.     The primary goal of the FCC's 13th order on reconsideration inits cable TV rate regulation proceeding is to encourage cable TVoperators to seek rate increases annually rather than quarterly;most operators have sought quarterly increases under previousrules.  The FCC's Sept. 22, 1995, order added the new annual filingmethod as another option in the existing rules, rather thanreplacing the quarterly rules.     For cable TV operators, the benefits of the annual rateadjustment filing include the reduction of delays in recoveringcosts and the elimination of a potential loss of revenue under thecurrent rules.  Another benefit is a reduction in administrativeburdens on regulators.  The benefit to subscribers is "reducedconfusion" from multiple rate increases.     The order makes several other significant changes in ratereview, most of which appear to be favorable to cable operators. These changes affect regulatory procedures, review deadlines,franchise requirements subject to pass-through, and basic and cableprogramming service-tier increases.     The 13th reconsideration order adopts an annual rateadjustment methodology designed to permit operators to recoverprojected cost increases by filing a new FCC Form 1240.  The formwas scheduled to be released in December but has been delayedbecause of the recent government shutdown.  This method will allowrecovery of "reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable"changes in external costs, inflation, and the number of regulatedchannels that are projected for the next year.     A "true-up" mechanism will reconcile the difference betweenprojected and actual costs at the next annual filing.  But it alsowill add another layer to the already complex rate review processand could further complicate a franchising authority's ability todetermine whether the operator is charging reasonable rates.  Theprojected costs fall into the following categories:     *    Inflation projections will use an estimate issued by theFCC each September, based on the preceding 12 months' inflation.     *    External costs may be projected if they are reasonablycertain and reasonably quantifiable.  Copyright fees,retransmission consent fees, other programming costs, FCCregulatory fees, and cable-specific taxes are presumed to bereasonably certain and quantifiable.     This presumption does not affect an operator's duty to respondto reasonable requests for information from a franchisingauthority.  It also does not extend to the costs of new franchiserequirements, which may be projected only if the operator showsthat the anticipated increases are reasonably certain andquantifiable.  The cable operator has the burden of proving thatcosts are reasonably certain and quantifiable.     *    Rate increases for projected channel additions aregenerally applied once a year.  But an operator may make oneadditional adjustment at any time during the year for any number ofnew cable programming service (CPS) channels, or for basic channelsif there is only a single tier.  In addition, if channel additionsare required by federal or local law (that is, for "must-carry";local origination; public, educational and governmental [PEG]access; or leased access channels), it appears that an operator maypass through the costs of such additions immediately.     Costs projected in the annual adjustment are passed through tosubscribers in 12 equal monthly installments.  If an operatorelects not to pass through such costs, it may accrue them withinterest for a later rate increase.  Under the annual method, theFCC stipulates that cable operators retain the right to increaserates later if they do not take the increase at the beginning ofthe rate year.     Interest ceases to accrue, however, if the operatordeliberately postpones a rate increase.  The FCC has ruled inearlier proceedings that 11.25% is presumptively the cost ofcapital for cable operators, and interest will be charged at thisamount.  Curiously, the interest rate for refunds to subscribers isstill the IRS rate for tax refunds:  8%.     In addition to reconciling projected and actual costs, the"true-up" mechanism creates an opportunity for cable operators torecover lost subscriber revenues when a franchising authority hasdenied a rate increase that later is overturned by the FCC.       Until now, the FCC routinely has granted stays of local rateorders because operators might suffer irreparable harm and couldnot recover lost subscriber revenues under the current rules.  TheFCC's rationale for granting the stays has been removed, however,because the "true-up" mechanism will allow the recovery of suchrevenues.     Equipment rates will be adjusted annually on the same date asservice-tier rates are changed.  Thus, an operator using the annualmethod will file FCC Form 1205 on the same day it files Form 1240. However, actual past costs rather than projected costs still willbe used to determine equipment rates.     The date of the annual adjustment normally is chosen by thecable TV operator.  But the operator first must notify thefranchising authority of the proposed date.  If a proposedadjustment date is unacceptable, a franchising authority may rejectit for "good cause"--for example, if the review period falls withinthe period of a city council recess (a rare recognition by the FCCof the realities of local government operations).  If the operatorand the franchising authority cannot agree on a date, thefranchising authority may set the filing date up to 60 days laterthan that originally proposed by the operator.Annual Method Involves Changes in Deadlines     The annual method brings with it a number of proceduralchanges, making it more difficult for franchising authorities toensure they are complying with the right deadlines.  In general,annual rate adjustments for the basic tier are filed 90 days beforetheir planned effective date.  At the end of the 90-day period,they become effective unless the franchising authority rejects themas unreasonable, subject to later reduction and refund.     Under the annual method, the franchising authority need notissue an accounting order to preserve subscribers' rights torefunds.  On the other hand, cable operators gain two new ways toavoid refunds under the annual method:     (1)   If an operator inquires at the end of the 90-day periodwhether the franchising authority still is reviewing the ratefiling, the franchising authority must respond within 15 days orlose its ability to order future refunds or reductions.     (2)   If a final rate order is not issued within a year, thefranchising authority appears to lose its right to order refunds orrate reductions.  The FCC justifies this rule by stating that "oneyear should provide ample time for review."  But this may besurprising news to those communities still waiting, after more thantwo years, for the FCC's own review of their CPS rate complaints.     If there is a material change in the operator's circumstancesduring the 90-day period, it may amend its Form 1240 before the90-day period expires.  If such an amendment is filed less than 30days before the end of that period, the review period is extendedautomatically so that the franchising authority has at least 30days to review the amendment.  The FCC creates a number ofexceptions to the 90-day review period.  For example, franchisingauthorities' review period for the extra midyear adjustment for CPSchannel additions is the same as for the regular annual adjustment(90 days).     However, if this midyear adjustment is for a single basic tier(where there is no CPS tier), the review period shrinks to 60 days. A shortened 60-day period also applies to adjustments based onchannel additions that are required by federal or local law.  Sixtydays is also the review period for filings that create a new ratefor newly introduced equipment (submitted using a specialstreamlined filing of Form 1205).     Under current rules, if a franchising authority receives a"facially incomplete" rate filing, it can require the operator tosubmit supplemental information, and the franchising authority'sdeadlines for review are tolled.  In the 13th reconsiderationorder, however, the FCC says the franchising authority must notifythe operator of such facial incompleteness within 45 days from thedate of the rate filing, at least in the context of the annualadjustment method.CPS Rate Increases Also Affected     Under the prior rules, an operator was not supposed toincrease CPS rates for one year after an FCC-ordered ratereduction.  Under the annual method, however, the operatorapparently may take its annual increase (regardless of any earlierrate reduction) by filing Form 1240 with the FCC 30 days before theplanned increase.  The increase then goes into effect subject tolater reduction and refund.     If both basic and CPS tiers are subject to rate regulation,the operator must file so that the 90-day period for franchisingauthority review coincides with the 30-day period for FCC review. The exception is that the operator also may file with the FCC atthe same time it files with the franchising authority.Fees, Requirements Subject to Pass-through     The FCC has affirmed its earlier rule allowing operators underthe quarterly method to pass through increases in franchise fees orFCC regulatory fees within 30 days of filing.  It appears thatunder this method, the franchising authority's 30-day orderfunctions as an accounting order, allowing the new rates to go intoeffect subject to future reduction and refund.     In general, the 13th reconsideration order repeats that onlyincreases in costs for services specifically required in thefranchise documents may be passed through.  But it also adds a newcriterion:  Only increases "that the operator would not haveincurred in the absence of the franchise requirement" are passedthrough.  This rule is consistent with the FCC's notion thatexternal costs are those beyond the operator's control.  Yet, instating this criterion, the FCC is admitting that the benefitswhose costs are allowed as a pass-through exist only because oflocal franchising.     The 13th reconsideration order reiterates that capitalexpenditures required by a franchise must be amortized over theuseful life of the items.  But the order contributes a new wrinkle: Operators apparently may recover an 11.25% "return on investment"in addition to such costs.     The following categories of franchise requirement costs may bepassed through:  technical and customer service standards thatexceed minimum federal requirements; PEG access channels andprogramming; institutional networks and the provision of video,voice, and data services to governmental and educationalinstitutions; and "undergrounding," to the extent it requiresremoving existing cable from poles and placing it underground.  Butincreased costs for normal maintenance or simple line extensionswithin the franchise area are not passed through, even if suchcosts are required by the franchise documents.Franchise Fee Refund Rules Clarified     When an operator pays refunds to subscribers, the franchisingauthority must return any franchise fee amounts that already havebeen paid by the operator based on those refunds.  In the 13threconsideration order, the FCC clarifies this obligation by statingthat the franchising authority, not the cable operator, determineshow such franchise fees should be repaid--in a lump sum, or byoffsetting the overcharge against future franchise fee payments. Either method may be used as long as the overpayment is returned tothe operator within a "reasonable period of time," depending on theamount of the overcharge and its relationship to the franchisingauthority's budget.     The order also says the franchising authority must payinterest on the overpayment at the now-typical 11.25% rate.  Thisraises the prospect that the cable operator might make a profit onthe interest, since the operator must repay the franchise feeamounts to subscribers only at the 8% IRS refund interest rate.     In some ways the 13th reconsideration order may improve therate regulation process.  Most notably a return to annual ratechanges, rather than the quarterly bombardment produced by theoriginal rules, should be beneficial to both subscribers andfranchising authorities.     But the FCC has implemented these improvements in a way somebelieve is guaranteed to produce further complexity and moreloopholes and disputes.  Moreover, the introduction of several new,shorter deadlines for special situations will require franchisingauthorities to be even more careful to avoid running afoul of oneof the FCC's "sand traps," thus losing the right to overturn"unreasonable" rates.

While the first stage emphasized supportservices such as ordering, installation, and generaltroubleshooting, the second phase will concentrate on entertainmentprogramming, "basic interactive functions" (e.g., pay-per-view),and "text interactivity" (e.g., on-screen ordering of premiumservices), a Bell Atlantic spokesman said.  He clarified, however,that the second phase will not include full interactive functionssuch as video-on-demand.     FutureVision, which is the only one of seven "videoinformation providers" that have reserved capacity on the384-channel network to offer programming, will increase its channelselection and test new concepts during the second phase.      Bell Atlantic "did learn some things" about video deliveryduring the first phase, including that subscribers experienced "ashort delay" when switching channels, the spokesman said.  He saidthe company plans to fix that problem during the second phase bydistributing software upgrades to its subscribers.     In addition, he said Bell Atlantic has set up voice mail boxesthrough its local telephone operations so that subscribers can keepthe company abreast of network problems as they occur.       Bell Atlantic also has used the voice mail system to remindsubscribers when specific tests will occur (for example, if thecompany wanted to test its pay-per-view capacity by directing alarge number of people to order movies at the same time).     "We keep in close contact with the volunteers," the spokesmansaid.  "We know some of these people by name."  He claimed thatmost subscribers prefer Bell Atlantic's digital signal overincumbent cable TV operator Adelphia Communications Corp.'s currentanalog transmissions.  He also noted that many people have remainedon the waiting list to test the VDT network.     Adelphia has not made a point of questioning Bell Atlantic'sclaims of better signal quality, said Randy Fisher, AdelphiaVP-General Counsel.  But the company's interviews with subscriberstesting Bell Atlantic's network indicate "there's not muchdifference" between Adelphia's current analog signal and thetelco's digital picture, he said.  "It's a good picture, but it'snot so good as to drive a wooden stake into our heart," he said. He suggested that price, service, and network reliabilityultimately will determine which company wins customers, noting thatAdelphia still plans to vie for Bell Atlantic's telephonycustomers.     In the meantime, Mr. Fisher said, Adelphia speedily isdeploying fiber in an attempt to upgrade its network fully by thetime Bell Atlantic rolls out commercial VDT service.  The BellAtlantic spokesman said that will occur "in the near future" butdeclined to specify a date.  Mr. Fisher noted that digitaltransmission still has problems, such as its apparent inability tohandle picture-in-picture TV functions.  So it is still unclearwhether Adelphia will convert to a digital signal once it completesthe upgrade, which Mr. Fisher said is about 60% done.  Industryworking groups have not yet set a digital standard.Bell Atlantic Defends Dover VDT Tariff     Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic has filed reply comments with the FCCdefending its VDT tariff for Dover Township.  It accused the cableTV industry of a "campaign of fear and intimidation, as well asregulatory gamesmanship" that has "led many carriers to concludethat the game is not worth the candle:  Rather than pursue the opennetwork vision, they are wearily agreeing simply to be cableclones."     Ameritech Corp., for one, publicly has abandoned the VDT modeland continues to pursue cable TV franchises around the country. Bell Atlantic told the Commission that its proposed VDT rates docover the cost of providing VDT service, despite the cable TVindustry's claims that they could promote cross-subsidization.  Italso reiterated that the terms and conditions of its VDT tariff are"commercially reasonable and nondiscriminatory."  Bell Atlantic hasreceived FCC authority to deploy a VDT network in Dover Township.     GTE Corp. also has weighed into the Dover Townshipcontroversy.  GTE opposed the FCC's approval of Adelphia's requestfor a waiver of the cable rate regulation rules.  Adelphia had madethe request in light of Bell Atlantic's impending VDT deployment. GTE said the waiver may do "more to enhance and perpetuate anasymmetric scheme of regulation than to promote true competition"and urged the FCC to relax VDT rules as well "so that competitioncan flourish."Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Time Warner Steps Up Ohio Fight Over Interconnection with Ameritech     Time Warner Communications has taken a dispute overinterconnection with Ameritech-Ohio one step further, asking theOhio Public Utilities Commission to suspend the telephone company'salternative regulation plan.  Citing its unsuccessful attempt tonegotiate interconnection rates and terms with the telco, TimeWarner has asked the PUC to suspend the intrastate price cap planthat gave Ameritech broad regulatory flexibility.  Ameritechresponded by calling Time Warner's request "desperate" and"ridiculous" and accusing the cable TV company of seeking to"derail" its plans to provide competitive cable TV service.     Time Warner received authorization last year to provide localexchange telephony in the 37 counties in which it operates cable TVsystems, pending the development of comprehensive local competitionrules in the state (CTR, Sept. 8, 1995).  But Time Warner andAmeritech have disagreed on interconnection terms, prompting thecable TV company late last month to seek PUC mediation of theirnegotiations (CTR, Jan. 12).  Time Warner made that request in itssecond 60-day report to the commission on the status of thosenegotiations.     Time Warner and Ameritech representatives have met four timessince the mediation request was filed; PUC staff members attendedtwo of those meetings, Time Warner said.  It filed the motionbecause of a "distinct lack of progress despite those efforts,"said Marsha Schermer, Time Warner Vice President-regulatoryaffairs.     Ameritech was allowed to operate under the alternativeregulation plan because of the onset of local exchange competition,Ms. Schermer said.  But the telco has taken advantage of the plan,she added, acting as "virtually an unregulated monopoly, in controlof when and how they get competition."  Time Warner soughtsuspension of certain aspects of the regulation plan.     Ameritech said, however, that "substantive agreements" on manytechnical and economic issues have been reached.  But Time Warnerhas increased its demands every time the parties near agreement,said James C. Smith, VP-regulatory for the telco.  He saidAmeritech, which has reached interconnection pacts with sixcompetitors, has been a "leader" in negotiating such agreements. Time Warner has "no incentive to reach an interconnectionagreement," because its "real motive is to delay competition in themonopoly cable TV market," Mr. Smith said.     Even if an interconnection agreement is reached, Time Warner"doesn't seem to be ready to provide generally available localtelephone service in Ohio," he added.  "There are widespreadreports that Time Warner has not been able to deliver generallyavailable local telephone service in Orlando, Fla., and Rochester,N.Y."  By contrast, Ameritech is prepared to provide cable TVservices in several Ohio communities, Mr. Smith stated.     AT&T Corp. has weighed in with support of Time Warner'smotion, citing similar difficulties in negotiating interconnectionterms with Ameritech in Illinois and Michigan.     Meanwhile, Time Warner has asked the Wisconsin Public ServiceCommission for authority to provide switched local exchangeservices in that state.  The company plans initially to serve largeand small businesses but eventually will serve residential endusers.  Time Warner also plans to offer (1) video-on-demand, (2)high-speed access to on-line services and the Internet, (3) homeshopping, and (4) interactive video service.  In Wisconsin it plansto build a 15,000-mile fiber optic network featuring 24-hour"system surveillance," redundancy based on synchronous opticalnetwork (SONET) technology, and a fiber optic backbonearchitecture.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Pacific Bell Reports Video Dial-Tone Construction Delays in SomeCities     Pacific Bell has hit a snag in its attempt to build videodial-tone (VDT) networks in 24 California cities--namely, most ofthe cities themselves, said a Pacific Telesis Group spokesman. Although Pacific Bell has received construction approval in SanJose, he noted, internal disputes between city officials andconcerns over potential disruptions to the public rights-of-wayhave delayed local construction approval in most of the other 23localities.     In San Jose, Pacific Bell already has wired 200 homes for afree "technology test."  With a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial networknow passing about 315,000 homes, the company hopes to expand thetrial into a commercial rollout, he said.  "We think it'sdefinitely going to work," he said, but local "governmentponderousness" is "holding up the network. . .We're stymied."     Most of the disagreements have centered on money, the PacificTelesis spokesman said.  "Initially, they opened their arms," hesaid, but then "the dollar signs started to click in their eyes"and demands for public access channel slots, local fees, and otherforms of revenue surfaced.  The result, he said, is that somecities purposely are holding Pacific Bell up "in order to shake usdown."     The company has offered short-term fee arrangements until afinal federal telecom bill clarifies its local responsibilities,the spokesman continued.  But some cities have demanded long-termcommitments now.  He conceded, however, that cities have alegitimate concern when it comes to construction schedules, notingthat "we're not the only company that's asking to dig up thestreets."     The problem for both cities and prospective VDT serviceproviders is that VDT "is in some flux" because of the pendingfederal telecom legislation, said Eileen Huggard, ExecutiveDirector of the National Association of Telecommunications Officersand Advisors (NATOA).  She said cities want VDT construction tomesh with other local projects or construction requests in a waythat does not excessively inconvenience local residents.  Butguidelines are unclear because of the pending bill.  "That's partof why it's a difficult time right now," she said.  "It's trying toplan for something that could change in a week or two weeks or afew months."     Other telcos have reported similar snags but continue to studywhat they hope will be a lucrative video marketplace.  Aspokeswoman for U S WEST, Inc., said U S WEST Communications'ongoing VDT trial in Omaha is in "full swing," with more than 8,000customers now signed up despite "almost no promotional support." Most new customers over the last few months have surfaced becauseof favorable reports about the initial technical trial that beganlast year, she said.     U S WEST is not ready to announce any new trial locations, shesaid, but "we're definitely looking for trends" in Omaha--includingprice sensitivity and whether service usage is seasonal.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996Disney-CapCities Merger Plans Clear Department of Justice Hurdle     The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., havesurmounted a major hurdle to Disney's proposed acquisition ofCapCities (CTR, Aug. 11, 1995).  The Justice Department's AntitrustDivision has approved the merger proposal following Disney'sannouncement that it will sell KCAL-TV, its Los Angeles televisionstation.  Disney is a partner in the Americast joint videoprogramming venture with Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBCCommunications, Inc., and GTE Corp.  Some industry observers expectthe FCC to rule on the transfer of TV licenses related to theproposed CapCities deal at a tentatively scheduled Jan. 31 meeting.     The expected sale of KCAL-TV "resolves any potential antitrustconcerns that could arise from Disney's acquisition of KABC-TV, aLos Angeles television station currently owned by CapitalCities/ABC," Justice said.       The Antitrust Division had been investigating whether Disney'sownership of both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV might lead to reducedcompetition and higher TV advertising rates in Los Angeles.  Beforethat investigation concluded, however, Disney notified Justice thatit planned to sell KCAL-TV.  It also pledged to maintain KCAL-TVand KABC-TV as "separate, competing stations until the sale iscompleted," Justice said.     To help ensure that the sale of the station occurs and toprotect KCAL-TV competitors before the sale, Disney agreed to signa consent decree requiring the appointment of a trustee to carryout the sale.       The decree will be filed in court only if Disney (1) fails toenter into a definitive agreement within nine months to sellKCAL-TV, (2) fails to complete the sale of KCAL-TV in 12 months,and (3) seeks FCC authority to own both KCAL-TV and KABC-TVpermanently.     Disney originally had sought a temporary waiver of FCC rulesthat prevent broadcasters from owning two VHF stations in a singlemarket, saying that enactment of the pending telecommunicationslegislation might render such ownership of broadcast stationslegal.  Disney now wants the Commission to approve the temporarywaiver request so it can operate both stations until the planneddivestiture of KCAL-TV is complete, a Disney spokesman said.

(SNET) hasconfirmed that it will whittle from 75 to 28 the number ofemployees in its Multimedia Division as it continues to merge theremainder of the staff into its expanding publishing operations. A SNET spokeswoman said the company had "overstaffed" itsmultimedia group because of early industry predictions that adigital video standard would exist by mid-1995.  Because of thecurrent lack of a standard and uncertainty over when one willexist, she said, SNET has determined that "it's premature to beworking on digital at this time. . .We could roll out digitaltechnology tomorrow, but it likely would be throwaway technology."     Most of the displaced 47 workers will be transferred to otherareas of the company, she said, but some may be let goindefinitely.  She was quick to stress that the multimedia staffcuts are not a signal that SNET is backing away from digital videotechnology.  The staff reduction, she said, is attributablepartially to synergies realized after the division was merged withthe publishing unit, requiring fewer people to do the work.  TheSNET publishing unit, which traditionally has overseen thecompany's printed directories, has expanded into online ventures inrecent months, increasing its relevance to multimedia.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES     The cable TV industry is facing "aggressive competition" asnew digital technologies allow companies to enter traditional cableTV markets, according to a report by the Multimedia Research Group.

ATM transfer is based on moving information units, calledcells.  Digital information enters a broadband system as packets,which are much larger than cells.  The ATM switch takes all theincoming packets, mixes them up and cuts them into cells.  It thensends the cells down the fiber cable in a configuration and at abandwidth picked to gain the most efficient transmission.  TheATM-determined path is known as a virtual channel.     At the destination, another ATM switch takes the cells andrecreates the original packets of voice, video, or datainformation.  The packets then leave the ATM switch and travel downfiber and coaxial cables to their destination:  a specific homecomputer, television, or telephone.     When ATM-protocol communications enter an MPEG-II broadbandcable network, they are converted out of ATM format and the ATMsignals are mapped onto MPEG.  On an all-ATM system such as TimeWarner's Orlando FSN, ATM transmissions are decoded and routed totheir final TV, computer, or telephone by a set-top box.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE CABLE-TELCO REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 29, 1996CANADIAN V-CHIP      The Canadian Cable TV Association and major cable operatorsRogers Communications, Inc., and Shaw Communications, Inc., havepromised to make the Canadian version of the V-chip available tocable TV subscribers at cost.

Provisionsof that law, many of which withstood modifications in the 1992Cable Act, made it very difficult for cities to deny franchiserenewal requests.

Enter Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., a cellular reseller in Atlanta.Beginning last September, the name "Cellular One Atlanta" made its appearancein the Atlanta phone book.  Call the number, however, and you'll find yourselftalking to a customer service rep from Allcomm.  "We have filed (in Georgia) as'Cellular One Atlanta Corp., doing business as Cellular One,'" Allcommpresident Peter Bright told CS&M.  Why?  "Two reasons," Bright said.  "First,we are providing a public service to help roamers.  We had a perfect exampletoday.  A Cellular One customer roaming here from Cincinnati broke his antenna.He found the name Cellular One [in the phone book], called us, and we fixedit."    Second, "the name Cellular One has never been used in Atlanta and probablynever will be used.  Pactel spent multimillion dollars to promote its ownname."    But aren't you concerned that the owners of the Cellular One trademarkmight object?  "They only charge $1 a year [for a non-wireline company] to usethe name.  So we're not robbing them.  We're ready to pay our dollar, but theywon't take it.  We'll sign any document they want to provide us.  [One of theirlawyers] said we couldn't use it 'because you're a reseller and we only licensethe name to carriers.'    "Our argument is that we're a provider of cellular service.  We have a fullsales and service force that can help customers, so we decided to go ahead anduse the name....We get calls [from our phone-book listing] all the time suchas, 'I'm trying to reach a Cellular One customer roaming in Atlanta; how do Ido it?' or 'I'm roaming in Atlanta; how do I access the system?' or 'I'm havingequipment trouble; can you help me?'"    Allcomm is the company's official name.  The name Cellular One appears onlyin the phone book, not in any of the company's public advertising, itsletterheads, calling cards, etc.  "When someone calls," Bright explained, "ourreps immediately explain that, 'No, we are not Cellular One.  We're AllcommTelecommunications, a reseller for the non-wireline in Atlanta.  We providesales and service.  Can we be of assistance to you?'"    When asked about Allcomm's use of the trademark, Southwestern Bell MobileSystems (which was apparently unaware of the usage) replied, in an officialstatement issued through director of marketing communications Walter Patterson:"The Cellular One logo is the service mark of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems,and it is protected by trademark laws.  It is a violation to willingly use themark without the proper authorization from SBMS.  If anyone attempts to use itwithout authorization, we will exercise our legal rights to prevent them fromdoing so, and we have a responsibility to the companies or individuals who areusing the service mark properly.  Hand in hand with that is our responsibilityto existing and potential customers.  They should be able to feel confidentthat when they call Cellular One, they are indeed dealing with Cellular One,and not with someone else."  Patterson also added that "we haven't received awritten request from Allcomm to use the logo."  Meanwhile, Bright explainedthat the earlier request had been oral; a written request is now beingprepared.

CT-2 is "single-channel, duplex, spectrum-efficient,with frequencies that can be reused every half mile--or less," Edwards said.He believes that CT-2 "will take away the whole low end of the cellularbusiness before it starts," he told us during a recent interview.  Why?Edwards pointed out that, according to the Wall Street Journal, 70% of thehouseholds in the U.S. have no discretionary income.  The remaining 30% have anaverage of $1000 per month for discretionary income.  These figures mean thatof the nation's 78 million households, the potential cellular market is "nomore than 10 million households.

The cellular industry as a whole may not be ready for it, and penetrationrates are a long way from showing it, but cellular is rapidly becoming a retailproduct--so rapidly that the vast majority of sales (even though they may notbe "good" sales, meaning that they may be low-revenue generators for thecarriers) may soon be made at the retail level.    That opinion, in one form or another--primarily in the way themanufacturers are packaging, pricing and promoting their new lines and the waythat high-volume, discount electronic firms are getting into cellular--seemedto show up everywhere we looked at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES)in Las Vegas.    So great was cellular's influence at CES that this show (and its summerequivalent in Chicago) is the one that is seeing the introduction of more newcellular products than any other show.  Could it be that cellular is finallypenetrating through to the consumer market?    As Mark Ripley, VP-network for GTE Cellular Communications, put it in thesession entitled, "Cellular:  Not Just Another Cordless Phone":  "Cellular isaltering the way people think about communications.  Most people who usecellular become addicted to it."    Despite the addiction potential, the sale of cellular can be a tough one.Al Brotsky, president of Al & Ed's Autosound of Monterey Park, Calif., put itthis way at the same session:  "If you were to ask me to choose the mostcomplex product to sell at retail and still make a profit, it would becellular, hands down."  He stressed the importance of educating the retailsalesperson.  "Only 10% of your competition has studied the latest benefits andfeatures of cellular," he said.  "The more you know, the more you sell formore."    Indeed, we are seeing the "birth of an industry," telecommunicationsanalyst and market researcher Herschel Shosteck of Silver Spring, Md.,explained during a presentation at the Mobile Electronics Retailing andInstallation session during the convention.  He noted that even though cellularhas barely penetrated 17% of the business market, he predicted that the totalcellular users in 1995 should reach 12-22 million, an upward revision of hisearlier prediction of 12-20 million.  Particularly significant today, he said,is the increased percentage of purchases that are replacement units (8%) andadd-ons (or second unit, e.g., purchase of a second phone for the spouse)(27%).  He also noted that 48% of all portables are purchased by individualswho already own cellular phones, which means that salespeople should go aftertheir existing cellular customers and attempt to step them up to a portable."The portable market is expanding explosively," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightCELLULAR SALES & MARKETING via NewsNetJanuary 1990Manufacturers Introduce Dozens of New Phones and Peripherals at CES    More cellular phone and accessory manufacturers than ever before showed upat the show.

A unique feature is the built-in flip-up1/4-wave unity-gain antenna.  Also included with the phone is a screw-in 1/4-wave, 1.2 dB gain, rubber duck antenna for use in fringe areas.

"The time is right,"explained Melanie vanderValk, director of advertising and corporatecommunications for Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems.  "I saw our December salesfigures.  Retail sales [during the Christmas season] were significantly morethan we had been projecting....Retail is a big part of our distribution now."    This new, intense interest in and sales response at the retail level hasled Bell Atlantic to develop a new TV ad campaign aimed specifically atattracting both the business and retail customers.  The campaign will appear in2 flights, the first running through April, and the second beginning in thesummer.    "Our customer profile is shifting from 100% business to more consumerapplications," vanderValk said.  "A lot of people are starting to justifycellular from a safety and convenience point of view."  Consumer resistance tothe product is beginning to fade, she said, because the message is finallygetting through that cellular is no longer an unaffordable technology.    Why TV?  "Two reasons," she said.  "First, it's more economical now to useTV than it was in the past.  We have a broader target market to reach becausecellular is now affordable to the mass market.  Second, TV advertising is verycompelling."    The campaign consists of two 30-second commercials that spotlight thedependability of the Bell Atlantic cellular network and how important the phonecan be when, for example, your car breaks down 15 miles from the next exit.The three 10-second spots      emphasize how affordable cellular is today.  Onespot compares the cost of cellular to the cost of laundering your shirts:  "Forthe money you spend at the cleaners, you could be using a car phone on the BellAtlantic System.  And, who knows?  Maybe you could clean up."  Another comparesthe cost of cellular and gasoline:  "You can use a car phone...for less [thenthe cost of fuel], and put something in your car that can make you money."    To support its retail effort, Bell Atlantic has developed a merchandisingkit for the retailers, containing banners, coverage maps and prices, tentcards, a pocket sales guide, and so on.  The pocket sales guide, for example,is a laminated card that slips into the salesperson's pocket and providesinstant answers to the most frequently asked questions about cellular.  "We'realso in the process of testing an interactive video guide," she said, whichwould allow shoppers to get answers to commonly asked questions by accessingan easy-to-use computer data base on display at the point of purchase.

Combining the purchasing clout of 23nationwide franchisees in 9 states with special market development fundsavailable from Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA), and adding in theexcitement of a sales contest, CelluLand's outlets sold more than 1,000 MESADiamondTel phones, exceeding their combined sales quota of by more than 150%.The theme of the campaign was, "The best things in life are free."  Thesalesperson who sold the most phones during the 2-month contest received aCaribbean cruise.  Other prizes ranged from Bahamas cruises through TVs, VCRsand cellular phones.    Mark Epstein, the director of special projects for CelluLand, drew on hisexperience selling stereo/hi-fi equipment in the 1970s and computers in theearly 1980s when he concocted the idea for the special promotion.    "Market development funds, which are also called key account funds, arefunds that are...used if anybody comes up with an interesting way of promotingtheir product," Epstein said.  "Most manufacturers don't promote the fact thatthey have these funds available, but if you go to them with a good idea, theyhave the funds available.  It's a matter of knowing how to present your idea tothe manufacturer."    Epstein convinced Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA) to expendthese market development funds in a joint promotional effort.  "I came up witha promotion idea to try and stimulate sales of their product throughout ourfranchise network," he said.  "They committed the funds subject to ourpurchasing the product over a 60-day period.  We exceeded our quota by 150%.We expected to sell 400 phones; we sold more than 1,000."  Seeing that this wasthe first joint promotion, we were a bit conservative in our estimates....Fromeveryone's standpoint, it was a tremendous success."    None of the advertising mentioned the price of the product.  "We positionedourselves not as a discount-price shop but as someone who could really deliverquality and service at a higher price," he said.  One ad, for example, washeadlined:  "They say the best things in life are free."  The ad pictured MESADiamondTel portable and car phones.  The "free" benefits applied to accessoriesand services, not to the price of the phone itself, and included:  Free mountand antenna (with car phones), free carrying case (with transportables), "freetime to devote to leisure and business activities."  "Service sets us apart":free testing and tuning, free loaner phone when necessary, free one-yearextended product warranty and free lifetime installation warranty.
