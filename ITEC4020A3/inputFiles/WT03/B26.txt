The Simpson Report provided a catalyst for an EOC to finallycome into being. However, the EOC would not have progressed to its presentpoint if there were not an underlying and widely accepted desire to seesomething of this form develop. I believe that the desire existed beforethe Report was commissioned and involves much more than the data collection,storage and communication focus of MDP-19. Not withstanding this desire,the EOC can still be difficult to maintain. This will occur unless thereis a continuing level of strong commitment and support from the Organisationand from the individuals on whose skill and proud accomplishments its futuresuccess rests. Equally, with such support and commitment it cannot fail. Over those same 15 years there have developed strong centres of remote sensingexpertise in CSIRO. These have mostly had an applications focus and beenlocated in a range of different industry oriented Divisions. Decentralisationhas certainly lead to some of the difficulties listed in the Simpson Report.However, on the positive side, the period has seen remote sensing sciencein CSIRO develop soundly and productively in support of well defined applicationareas. These include atmospheric sciences, fisheries and oceans, water resources,mineral and geophysical exploration, soil survey, forestry and agriculturalapplications. The integration of the remote sensing scientists with appliedDivisions has been very fruitful in a way that their separation into a singledisciplinary Unit in the past may not have been. Australia has become verywell known for its application oriented combination of remote sensing scienceand real world applications. There has also developed strong support for a science focussed EOC fromthese groups. This has occurred in no small way because, in the words ofthe Simpson Report, "a given group's work attempts to cover instrumentationdevelopment, ground station operations, algorithm development, applicationsdevelopment, validation and product delivery. This task is too big for small,geographically isolated groups." The Simpson Report arose from a reviewof the Data Acquisition and Utilisation MDP-19. However, I believe the strongmove towards an EOC in CSIRO does not come from needs unique to the datagathering segments but from the wider truth of this statement. It appliesto the whole of the productive remote sensing and Earth Observing researchcommunity that has developed in CSIRO. The time has come when the value of focussing the skills of groups of scientistson issues common to the remote sensing science underpinning the applicationsacross many Divisions has become too great to deny. Modern remote sensingresearch has advanced from descriptive earth 'observation' through an eraof data gathering and exploratory image processing to a point where thevalue of remote sensing data as measurements is paramount. Remotely sensedmeasurements can be collected in a range of data dimensions and at timeand space scales which cannot be accessed in any other way. This has enabledgeographical applications to proceed in terms of scientific models and processunderstanding. The physical link between the data and the parameters ofinterest to users is providing the returns that previous image processingand 'correlation' based approaches could only suggest as being possible.'Making the transition' from close-range data that the end user can understandand needs to the recorded counts in a remotely sensed data stream is today'schallenge for remote sensing. This can be accomplished in a way that serves the needs of the establishedapplications areas in CSIRO and the wider Australian community. The meansis to thread together the internationally acclaimed skills of CSIRO researchersand provide them with the opportunity, support and facilities to jointlytackle common scientific themes and issues. The themes and issues tackledmust be those which underpin the applications being pursued in the individual,industry oriented Divisions and in the growing value added industry throughoutAustralia. This common base of interest includes issues relating to: sensor and instrument design and characteristics; base data processing; calibration and geometric/geographic modelling; integration with other data; atmospheric corrections; data management; the measurement models relating remotely sensed data and the targetsof applications; and the most effective computational algorithms; I believe an effective network of remote sensing scientists can be developed.It will consist of a well supported core group of scientists drawn fromcurrent CSIRO staff plus a few complementary and supporting additional staff.The core group will develop a network with remote sensing scientists inapplications areas and work in projects with them to provide their areasof applications with the means to make much greater progress. This willoccur as their efforts will not be dissipated in attempts to cover all thetasks and resolve all the problems arising between instrument deploymentand product delivery. Such activity was identified as a common problem amongthe AVHRR data collectors in the Simpson Report. The Simpson report also proposed a new focus for MDP-19 which was to develop'Level 1.5' products that could overcome the need for applications orientedgroups to solve the problems in the list above. However, I disagree withthe assumption made in the Report that "science focus areas (Level2) naturally will emerge if the Level 1.5 work is done well." The workof the Centre must be focussed on the measurement models that enable theapplications. The Level 1.5 products are the raw material on which boththe Centre and the applications research areas can work. The viewpoint of the core group and associated Divisional scientists - collectivelythe EOC - should also not be focussed on particular instruments nor theirspecialised data. Rather, the EOC should emphasise applications and themeasurement models that relate the targets to the appropriate range of availableraw data. For example, monitoring vegetation cover has applications at manyscales and finer scale data is usually needed to define cover/image relationships.If the working scale is 1:10,000 to 1:25,000 then airborne data and possiblySpot or TM data can meet the needs - but AVHRR cannot. On the other hand,at regional scale, the integration provided by AVHRR can match the scalingof the application's needs and the different platform and sensor becomesthe appropriate data. The central issue, however, is that underlying allthe choices are the radiative transfer in the coupled atmosphere and surfacelayer and its scaling behaviour. The primary activity therefore must include flexible considerations of sensorcharacteristics and scale of platforms together with the way they createmeasurements of water covered areas, complex land surfaces and the atmosphere.The specific issues (including scale and areas of application) relatingto particular instruments can be gathered productively within the measurementthemes. The priorities and emphases of the groupings must be determinedby the needs of the applications. The areas of application must reflectthe interests of the Divisions and other clients in the Australian EarthObservation industry rather than the interests of the individual scientists. Remote sensing and Earth Observation are not only about satellite data noronly about low resolution meteorological satellite data. The pressing needsfor environmental monitoring demand data with spatial scales from 1:5,000to 1:5,000,000 and time scales from daily to decadal. It would be a seriousomission to ignore the tactical monitoring and assessment issues createdby sudden or localised disturbances and natural disasters. They are as importantto respond to as the longer term environmental changes being monitored byspace observing systems. In addition, integrating the observations at anindividual site with satellite data without concern for the intermediatescales creates a disturbing gap in calibration methodology. This gap canonly be filled if there is a commitment to higher spatial, spectral andtemporal resolution earth observation in the centre. It is no accident thatthe advanced EOS instrument - MODIS - has high spectral resolution and multi-scaledata. I believe that the EOC must also from the beginning address the issues involvedwith airborne (1:5,000 to 1:10,000 scale) data and the higher spatial andspectral resolution sensors they carry. This must be done within the sameintegrated framework of measurement models and algorithms it develops todeal with satellite data and the various sensors they carry. The scalabilityof processing and the interpretation algorithms is both practical and fundamentalto creating successful operational and packaged links between sensor andtarget on any platform. Developments in instruments able to be deployedon aircraft at the present time is similar to the development of PCs inthe early 80's. Very soon the range of options will be enormous and theopportunities they create for rapid tactical earth observation must notbe neglected. The greatest opportunity lies in the potential for them tobe calibrated and have sensitive, narrow and flexibly placed spectral bands.Their needs in this case are exactly for the science and algorithms theEOC has the capacity to provide. As an example of how measurement modelscan integrate with the data processing stream, I have attached a documentdescribing some of the airborne work that has been done at CSIRO Divisionof water Resources. This work is currently being developed in a controlledcombination of commercialisation and collaborative international research. For the centre to be successful, there is a need to create strong threadsof collaboration and interaction among the excellent scientists currentlydispersed throughout CSIRO. Some should become fully part of the core EOCbut others should simply be encouraged and supported to make use of theEOC and participate in joint research. This would be ensured through makingsignificant (eg 3 or more month) visits to other laboratories and/or theEOC centres essential components of the collaboration. The EOC could consistof one primary core group in a single location plus more tempory 'satellite'groups which are developed in collaborating Divisions and centres for specificprojects and studies. Exchange and significant visits between the Australiangroups are alternatives to re-location. They may well provide the 'glue'the EOC needs in order to create open collaboration, trust and frequentcontact between the scientists that make up the strong base of skills infundamental remote sensing science. The budget of the EOC will need a veryvisible and solid allocation for this activity rather than either beingrestricted to the core group at the centre or dispersed in small allocations.The alternative provision of separate small 'grants' to geographically separatedgroups can only make the fragmentation and lack of critical mass at theseparate sites worse. The EOC should also encourage joint projects with industry. Its clientsmust potentially be inside and outside CSIRO. In the early 1980's, the CanadianCCRS pursued a policy of collaboration with industry in fundamental sciencethat involved secondment of staff from industry to CCRS for extended periodsas part of the R&D. This has created a strong science and research focusin the Canadian earth observation industry which has paid off considerably.Tasks that could be done by industry or that were desirable for industryto take on were always contracted out rather than done in-house - but withclose collaboration and staff exchange. You cannot assist industry by competingwith it. I believe this is the cooperative model the EOC should also adopt.In doing so, the Centre will also need to address the concerns of industryfor standards, economic evaluation of alternative data sources, informationthroughput and the cost-effectiveness of different levels of value adding.It is through industry contact that the Centre can contribute to these importantanalyses. It is no accident that centres such as the EOC have emerged in recent yearsin other countries and are developing a strong network between their scientists.The issues that must be tackled to realise the opportunities of an EOC areinternational by nature. They can only be successfully resolved by veryclose and collaborative contact between researchers at similar centres indifferent countries. In particular, links must be made with the US, Canada,Europe, China, Japan and the ASEAN members. Without such strong internationalcollaboration the EOC may achieve less than is being achieved now by thedispersed but internationally active groups. The EOC needs to put specialemphasis on promoting and enabling contact, collaboration and joint publicationbetween Australian and other scientists working on remote sensing sciencethroughout the world. Bringing scientists to Australia and sending Australiansoverseas are fundamental activities once the internal contacts have beenestablished. Participation in international projects and forums will pay-offsignificantly in this area and must be encouraged. It should be emphasised,however, that this cannot be achieved only through participation in internationalcommittees but by international collaboration. The EOC will succeed if it creates an environment in which the solutionto the 'Prisoner's Dilemma' is carefully encouraged to be cooperation ratherthan to take what is offered but give as little as possible. As a personwho has worked for many years to see remote sensing applied I believe theEOC can enhance the flow of applications if its focus is well directed.However, to succeed in the face of realities, I believe it will also needto have strong support from Executive level down and have a high degreeof independence, discretion and support. The Advisory Committee (for example)should not run the EOC but be like the Board of a Company with the ScienceProgram Leader as MD. The 'MD' also needs the capacity to make decisionsand make them stick. There may come times when the success or total failureof the EOC depends on the leverage that is provided to the EOC. Speakingsoftly but carrying a big stick was never more important. The next yearwill be an exciting one for all concerned with the venture but where itall ends will depend on the decisions made in the very near future.

Graetz, A.J. Prata, J.S. Wallace, and I.J. Barton PREAMBLE The compilation of this document was both a pleasure and a challenge. It was a pleasure because all the authors believe in the concept of theEarth Observation Centre and are committed to its implementation. It waschallenge to find and articulate the shared core of agreement. That wasnot easy: the debate has been spirited and detailed with independent inputsfrom many interested research staff. Even so, the four authors of this document share its vision and mission,and are committed to their implementation. However, the separate groupsof research staff represented by each author differed in their support ofthe three areas of research activity defined below. Research areas 1 &2, which will account for almost all activity (>95%) was supported everywhere,whereas area 3 was only supported by Melbourne, Hobart and Canberra. In this section of our report, we set out the argument that we developedsince being commissioned and which has shaped the research strategy proposedin the next section. Two propositions underpin all. The first is that CSIRO is a research organisation: its prime directiveis to undertake scientific research. Within CSIRO, components such as COSSAand CIRC, have different functions. Even though the concept of the EarthObservation Centre arose from a COSSA-initiated review, and COSSA has theresponsibility to create the Earth Observation Centre, the essential natureof the Earth Observation Centre will differ substantially from that of COSSA.The Earth Observation Centre will be part of main-stream CSIRO. Thereforethe prime directive and ethos of the Earth Observation Centre must be theconduct of scientific research. This is an important point that was raised in the Implementation Document(COSSASteering Committee) and we reiterate it here. The concerns that led to the concept of the Earth Observation Centre partlyarose from data issues; of these, some were related to research but mostwere not. A focus on data issues dominates the circulated vision and missiondiscussions in the 'Implementation Plan' and the draft 'Outline of StrategicPlan, etc.'. We do not accept this emphasis. We are convinced that an EarthObservation Centre within CSIRO must be based on relevant, high qualityresearch activities. Therefore, this document proposes a wider view that embraces all data issuesand integrates them within a comprehensive research strategy. This view is that in the current era of Earth observation activities,research and data are inextricably and synergistically linked. It is obvious to us that a strategy of emphasising data at the expense ofresearch has no future in the CSIRO of today or tomorrow. Conversely, astrategy of research that ignores data management will continue the emasculatedconditions of these last few years that led to the formation of MDP # 19,and its subsequent review. The second proposition is that the Earth Observation Centre should addressthe big issues: those characterised by broad spatial scales over long timeintervals to which Earth Observation data make a unique and underpinningcontribution. These are the issues that can really only be addressed withspace data. Moreover, we should address not only the current research questionsbut what is more important, consider those questions that are not presentlybeing asked. The Earth Observation Centre should become a leading and singular researchinstitution. Furthermore, we believe this can be achieved in a manner that is complementaryto activities within Divisions and without excluding any significant researchthemes. We illustrate this with a hypothetical research program in the Appendix. On the basis of on these two propositions, the central thrust of thisdocument is to propose a bold but operationally sustainable integrationof research and data management, the Research Strategy, to underpin theEarth Observation Centre over the next five years, 1995-2000. In addition, we also discuss several implementation issues that we believeare not usefully separated from the proposed Research Strategy. Like theStrategy, these implementation issues have been discussed amongst us andthe views of our colleagues that were canvassed and considered. To illustrate and support our proposals made in the next section, we herecollect some the many facets of shaping the Earth Observation Centre thatwere considered. The acceptability of the Earth Observation Centre within CSIRO managementand its attractiveness to research staff will be determined almost entirelyby the formulation and implementation of its Research Strategy. Therefore, once accepted, the Earth Observation Centre ResearchStrategy must be widely and speedily communicated within CSIRO, and implementedin the Earth Observation Centre development. Because COSSA and the Earth Observation Centre have very different rolesand responsibilities within CSIRO, the Earth Observation Centre must beindependent of COSSA in the pursuit of its role within the constraint ofits essential requirement to report to the Director of COSSA. Therefore, it is essential that the research and developmentdirections of the Earth Observation Centre be set by the Leader and staffwith input from Divisions and an Advisory Committee (see later). Now that the Earth Observation Centre is a reality, albeit still a fledgling,its identity and support needs to be indelibly confirmed. Therefore, we recommend that MDP #19 be terminated as soon asis possible and that its remaining funding be transferred to the Leaderof the Earth Observation Centre for disposition, and that this financialindependence be continued; in addition, we believe it to be critical that the Earth ObservationCentre creates and communicates its own identity, and manages its own informationaccess independently of COSSA. Two aspects of the creation of the Earth Observation Centre will enhanceremote sensing within CSIRO: by providing a disciplinary focus, and, moreinfluential, by the collocation of staff. However, if staff remain distributedacross Australia, then opportunities for productive interaction will remainlimited and thus the output of the Earth Observation Centre is unlikelyto be very different from the current output from the separate Divisions. Therefore, the collocation of staff is obviously the preferredoption wherever possible but it remains a practical problem that must befaced. The Earth Observation Centre research areas should not be traditional disciplineareas, for otherwise the overlap with Divisions will be too great and thenecessity of the Earth Observation Centre will be questioned. Therefore the Earth Observation Centre must include in its researchfocus, areas that do not rest comfortably within Divisions or cover areascommon to many Divisions. While it is important to set out the long term strategic goals of the researchand development, their creation will always risk the generation of unrealisticexpectations amongst some users. Therefore, the Earth Observation Centre should set both longterm strategic goals as well as short term objectives arising from interactionswith the user communities; the Earth Observation Centre objectives should be clear, open and achievablewith the resources available. RESEARCH STRATEGY The research strategy that we outline below is simple, general, and hasthree components; vision, mission and activities. No specific objectives are defined. We see the essential role of the Earth Observation Centre as being synergisticand facilitating for research scientists already actively engaged in theirown research and responsive their own interests, capabilities and funding.The focus of the Earth Observation Centre will enhance this research activity,and through coordinated data management, benefit a larger and more diverseclientele than before. The focus of the Earth Observation Centre is not to re-orient existing researchin the short term: rather, we want to do what we do far more effectively. Vision Statement. We begin with a succinct statement of the essential nature and directionof the Earth Observation Centre: 'To ensure that Australia gains maximum benefit from the applicationof Earth Observation data.' Mission Statement Translating the Vision statement into a broad action plan, we write: 'The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary researchand development based on remotely sensed and other data for the benefitof the Australian and global communities' We see this benefit being realised from the innovative and efficient extractionof relevant information from Earth Observation data. These three adjectiveslink research, development and application; they describe the three componentsrequired for an end-to-end approach. Research Activities The research objectives pursued within the Earth Observation Centre willbe diverse, reflecting the interests and collaboration of individual scientists.Therefore, as discussed above, it is difficult and counter-productive todefine and prioritise research objectives. It is far more useful to definethe three areas of research activity within which the spectrum of researcheffort could be managed. Continuing and potential cooperation and collaborationwith research staff from CSIRO Divisions and other organisations (DEST,DoPI&E, DSTO) is implicit throughout. While these activities are broadly defined below, they proscribe farm-leveldecision-support systems, that are increasingly being covered by other publicand private sector organisations. The three areas of research activities follow. These activities are exemplifiedin the Appendix that also illustrates the nature and extent of the potentialinteractions between the EOC and CSIRO Divisions. 1. Earth Observation Science and Data Analysis: To undertake theresearch necessary for the development of generic methods (measurement models)to relate satellite data recorded above the Earth's atmosphere to geophysicalvariables; these variables being required to address broader current andpotential research questions within the Earth Observation Centre, CSIROand the wider research community. Measurement models include scene, sensor, atmosphere and image processingsub-models that in combination, determine the accuracy and precision ofthe derived geophysical variables. Measurement models are required for the retrospective analysis of currentEarth Observation data archives, eg. AVHRR, as well as for the prospectivedatasets, eg. ADEOS, SPOT Vegetation Instrument, SeaWIFS and EOS. While it has and will continue to be applications research that createsthe need for highest quality Earth Observation datasets, it is the developmentand application of measurement models that remains the key to the productionof the value-added datasets required by the research community. As an illustration, an AVHRR Science Working Group has been established,originally within MDP #19 and now the EOC, to prescribe the processing ofa standard set of geophysical datasets to be generated by the EOC and madeavailable to CSIRO research staff: these datasets include sea surface temperature(SST), land surface temperature (LST), surface albedo (a VIS, a NIR, a SOLAR)and NDVI (a vegetation index). In addition, an analogous GMS PathfinderScience Working Group has been established in collaboration with the Universityof California, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian National University,and the University of Tasmania. 2. Calibration / Validation: To undertake the required field andlaboratory research to support the development of measurement models evaluatingeither the accuracy of sensor performance (calibration) or of derived geophysicalvariables (validation). Both measurement models, when translated to algorithms, and Calibration/ Validation activities as a source of ancillary data and process understanding,are fundamental to the generation and documentation of geophysical datasets for distribution by the CSIRO DAACs for subsequent application by thewider research community. Calibration / Validation research activities are critical to success inaddressing many contemporary scientific questions: it is not an unreasonableassertion that it is now the most critical issue in the application of spacedata. The importance of Calibration / Validation research is now widelyrecognised by organisations such as CEOS and EOS, and by individual spacecraftmissions that have sought, or are seeking CSIRO expertise in this researcharea; eg. the ATSR instrument on ERS-1/2, POLDER on ADEOS, and the VegetationInstrument on SPOT 4. Calibration / Validation research activities will ensure the highest qualitydatasets are available to the Australian and global research communities.It is anticipated that within this research activity, there will be considerablecollaboration with Divisional research staff; see Appendix. 3. Sensors and Systems: Australia has a growing aerospace industrythat has, in the past, found valuable research support for development programsfrom within CSIRO. These activities will continue to grow and CSIRO hasa vital role to play in supporting these programs. The research skills requiredfor the success of development programs in Earth Observation are currentlynot available from other Australian institutes. It is important that there is a national focus for this area of researchand, for CSIRO, the activity is far better suited to the EOC than to individualDivisions. The Earth Observation Centre can become this focus through secondment fromCSIRO or from industry, and by managing the research component only. These three research activities represent a significant change in emphasisand allocation of tasks from the Earth Observation Centre concept proposedby COSSA in the draft Implementation Plan. The emphasis has been placedon getting the research component right but not to the exclusion of datamanagement that is implicit in all that is stated above. Stated simply: Co-ordinated scientific research and development is the only sustainablelocomotive for generating useful Earth Observation value-added products; Strategic research and development first requires, and then generates EarthObservation datasets; The two key elements are co-ordinated Research and Development, and DataManagement. Both elements are critical and interactive, but for the Australian communityto benefit from Earth Observation Centre activities the nature and directionof Data Management activities must support and complement those of Researchand Development. We envisage an interactive interdependence of Research and Development andData Management within the Earth Observation Centre, and this relationshipis simplified in the following diagram. Data Management alone is a relatively simple problem to solve. It is farmore difficult to co-ordinate Research and Development with Data Managementso that end-to-end solutions are provided and the value-added datasets generatedand captured. Nonetheless, we see the solution to this problem as beingone of research-leadership rather that data-driven. Leader Because the scope of Earth Observation Centre research activities is sobroad, it is unlikely that any one person can be an effective research leader.The maintenance of research standards can be assured with the review processwithin and without the Earth Observation Centre. However, the maintenanceand co-ordination of research effort and the interaction with clients, bothactual and potential, are by far the most important tasks to keep the EarthObservation Centre on track and viable. Thus, we see the critical attributes of the Leader as being: a distinguished background in Earth Observation science; a capacity and willingness to manage the Earth Observation Centre research; a capacity to find and interact with the beneficiaries of Earth ObservationCentre activities both within and without CSIRO; a capacity and willingness to seek external funding. We also believe the next critical step in the development of the Earth ObservationCentre is the appointment of the Leader. We urge that this be urgently addressedwith the leader being appointed for an initial period of 5 years, locatedin Canberra. REFLECTION and GUIDANCE The Earth Observation Centre is a new concept within CSIRO and effectivelywithout peer within Australia; the organisations of ERIN (DEST), NRIC andAGSO, both (DoPI&E), being considered in this assessment. The role models,or at least analogues of the Earth Observation Centre are thus mostly international.Therefore, attention must be given to providing mechanisms that will providean international reflection of our direction, activities and performancein a way that will support the best possible management of the Earth ObservationCentre resources; people, funds, and time. Two mechanisms are suggested: the Earth Observation Centre Fellowships,and an Advisory Committee. Earth Observation Centre Fellowships The Earth Observation Centre Fellowships have already started with the firstand current award being to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson has played a significantrole in the concept and establishment of the Earth Observation Centre andhe has continued to contribute to research during the brief period of hisFellowship. Following in this role, Earth Observation Centre Fellowships can providea mirror to our performance and direction. To do this, the award needs tobe to a distinguished but interesting and active scientist, for a briefperiod of time. Earth Observation Centre Fellowships are different from,and in addition to, visiting research scientists to the Centre. It is recommended that the award by invitation of Earth Observation CentreFellowships be continued at an annual rate, and that they continue to becarefully selected such that the benefit to the Earth Observation Centreis clear and widely distributed. Advisory Committee We believe that the direction and functioning of the Earth Observation Centrewould benefit from interaction with a small expert committee - an AdvisoryCommittee. Because of the vision and mission of the Earth Observation Centre, we suggestthis small committee be convened annually and comprise the following: Director, COSSA Leader, Earth Observation Centre Chief of Division (one only, most relevant, rotating) Bureau of Meteorology representative (most relevant) NASA representative (eg. Martha Maiden) ESA representative (eg. equivalent to NASA representative) Research institution analogue (rotating, eg. Yann Kerr, Director of LERTS). The intent and function of this Advisory Committee are clear from our suggestedmembership. The final choice should be made by the Leader of the Earth ObservationCentre. We believe it is critical to regularly take professional advice from a widerange of sources; particularly from outside CSIRO and Australia becausethe Earth Observation Centre will become a significant functional link inthe emerging international web of Earth Observation science and data analysis.To orient our activities by the Earth Observation Centre Vision - to ensurethat Australia gains maximum benefit from the innovative and efficient applicationof Earth Observation data - we must regularly assess our performance byinternational standards. APPENDIX Research Strategy exemplified To illustrate how the research strategy would be applied in the EOC, a fictitiousexample is described which also illustrates the perceived roles of the EOCand individual Divisions and the way these groups may interact on commonresearch topics. The example given is for an application of AVHRR data, but future EOC activitieswill also include data from other earth observation instruments and platforms(e.g. SAR, SeaWiFS, OCTS, MODIS etc.). THE APPLICATION OF AVHRR DATA IN THE MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH OF LOCUST PLAGUEEVENTS Project Stages. 1. Reception (direct or indirect) of raw AVHRR data over the studyarea. 2. Routine processing of AVHRR data to provide at-satellite, navigatedbrightness temperatures in the infrared channels and radiances in the visible/nearinfrared channels. This activity requires conversion of the raw data using calibration coefficientsand navigation into earth coordinates using orbital elements, an orbitalmodel and ground control points. 3. Derivation of standard geophysical products from the brightnesstemperatures/radiances. These products include sea surface temperature, land surface temperature,surface albedo and NDVI (a vegetation index). The production of these parameters requires the detection of cloud contaminateddata, correction for atmospheric effects (absorption and scattering) andthe inclusion of surface and solar geometry. The four products mentioned above should be considered standard productsthat will be produced automatically by the EOC for use by CSIRO Divisionsin their research programs, and in applications developed by particulardivisions. 4. Standard statistical techniques for data analysis, compositingof data, production of time series, filling in missing (cloudy) values,etc. 5. Development of new parameters for highlighting locust active oraffected areas (new NDVIs?, thermal data may be useful here?). Comparisons with climatological data. Collection of ground data for validation of satellite-derived parameters. Development of task-specific analysis techniques. 6. Assessment of locust damage, forecast of locust paths, deploymentof ground based resources (aircraft spraying of insecticide etc.). Use of satellite data to forecast future areas of locust plague outbreaks. EOC activities: Actions 1, 2, 3 and 4 as described above are activitiesthat are common to any research project or application of satellite dataand these should be seen as the responsibility of the EOC. The first researchactivity described in the strategy thus includes investigations to providehigh quality standard geophysical data products from satellite data. Theseactivities will include data calibration, cloud detection and clearing,correction for atmospheric effects in the visible, infrared and microwavebands, navigation of satellite data and the development of common statisticaltechniques for data analysis. Divisional activities: Actions 5 and 6 clearly belong in individualDivisions of CSIRO as they pertain to specific research programs and applications.However, there are obviously areas here where some interaction is required.For example, the ground validation data collected by the Division shouldbe used by the EOC in the assessment of the quality of their derived standardproducts. Divisions may also WT03-B26-4IA029-000311-B014-232http://gaia.cossa.csiro.au:80/eoc/wshop1.htm 138.44.40.1 19970114162322 text/html 3898HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 16:21:34 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Fri, 17 May 1996 06:09:07 GMTContent-length: 3724 Land AVHRR Data Users Group Workshop - Towards Product Standards David L B Jupp CSIRO Earth Observation Centre 1. ABOUT THE CSIRO EOC AVHRR has provided the world community with global data and a dense timeseries of earth observation now for at least 15 years. However, it is onlyrelatively recently that the data have moved out of the research area tobe evaluated in the 'workplace' of end user needs. This has come about inAustralia from the development of operational receiving stations and programsof archiving and processing the data received over the continent and EEZ. CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications (COSSA) and Agencies suchas the Bureau of Meteorology have played a significant role in this developmentand today the availability of daily near real time and archival time seriesof data for the Australian region is unprecedented. Nevertheless, the developmentof this capability has not been without its problems. Many of these weredescribed in a review carried out on behalf of COSSA of its Data Acquisitionand Utilisation multi-Divisional Program MDP-19 . In this report (oftenreferred to as the Simpson Report from its principal author) many of theissues of fragmentation and dispersion of effort were outlined and remediessuggested. One of the outcomes of the Simpson Report has been the formation of theEarth Observation Centre (EOC) which is developing to provide a focus andidentity for CSIRO Earth Observation Research and Development as well asact to coordinate some of the activities that were identified in the SimpsonReport as limiting to the full value being obtained from CSIRO activities.In the area of Land AVHRR use there is considerable focus and activity amongCSIRO scientists who either as part of the formative EOC or from the Divisionswith which it is working closely will outline their work to you this morning.They are among scientists who have been and will in the future engage incross-Divisional projects in the fields of: Data Management [with data providers and distributors] Advanced Information Processing Calibration and Validation Advanced Measurement Models Based Products Applications Support [with Divisions and Industry] The knowledge base for the projects largely rests in the Divisions and thework will be aimed to support the Divisional needs in data and the Divisionalinterface with clients and users in the Sectors which the Divisions address.However, we see an underlying generic set of activities which are biggerin scope than can be handled by any one Division and which underpin theeventual acceptance and usefulness of the products to the real end users- people who want information about the world and the way it is changing. The EOC is an initiative that has been developing for some time and is nowfully and rapidly moving to address generic issues in the areas outlinedabove. It aims to maximise the benefit obtained from the activities of theexcellent earth observation scientists in CSIRO and see it impact effectivelyon the development of the industries that can put the information to work.In order to do this fully, however, I believe we must all (researchers,producers and users together) consider the issue of data and product standards.

INTRODUCTION The primary aim of the LAND AVHRR Workshop was to promote ideas and to breakdown any real or perceived barriers between the data acquisition, modellingand application communities. AVHRR data were viewed in the workshop as being processed to three productlevels, these are base, standard and research products. There are severaloperational environment management systems in place that rely heavily onAVHRR data. In the workshop these applications were given the opportunityto voice their concerns and hopes for future AVHRR processing at the threelevels above. From the general discussions there arose a series of common questions: What generic changes can occur to the data acquisition, base and standardproduct development which will mean improvements to all applications? What mechanisms need to be in place by the data acquisition, base andstandard product development community to ensure that the users needs areadequately meet? Are the users needs and desires realistic and achievable? How can the application community make better decisions from the currentlyavailable data sets? To provide a framework for readers who did not attend the workshop, thelisting of presenters is given later. Some additional copies of the workshopproceedings are available from Tim McVicar on a first come first servedbasis.

Reliability indicators of spectral information The use of empirical solutions using statistics Shapes of curves from different cover types Geometrical Optical models Advantages and disadvantages of different modelling approach i.e. empirical,semi empirical and physical The factor of scale in BRDF Discussion At small scan angles < 20 degrees atmospheric effects are much reducedas shown by the CASI. Scanning between range of +-20 degrees BRDF effect is fairly gentle. BRDFeffects are present but much reduced. At scan angles of +- 40 degrees BRDF is serious At scan angles of +- 60 degrees BRDF very serious The output from image scanning devices are better equiped to deal with BRDFeffects due to the line scan geometry. In photography or videograpy thecentral perspective of the viewer becomes a problem. Three aspects of BRDF: 1. 'hotspot' occlusion effects - hiding of objects 2. volume BRDF- radiative transfer, structural attributes of objects 3. Glint effects from water targets and specular effects over land Estimating the proportion of each can be difficult. For monitoring purposes, only interested in the nature of change of thelandcover - not the changes in BRDF or in extant atmospheric effects. State of the Art BRDF Correction for the MODIS satellite 1. Brightness 2. volume scattering - theory on leaves 3. shape from shadowing Models Alternatives to correct for different shapes MODIS uses four combination and finds the best fit Practical approach to predicting the mean function. Shapes are variable: tall and thin VS short and fat - where is it positionedin the landscape - a priori knowledge of shape helps Modelling Approaches 1. Empirical approach Use of image variance and extent Derivation of specific functions Fitting of data to particular functions using a statistical approach Can use empirical models based on variance and extent if you have theshape of the function and then can reduce to 1 or 2 parameters. If the functionalform of these effects is known then can start to use models. Extractionof functional form, complicated however by heterogeneity of ground cover. Implication of just changing the 'colour' of objects ie, physicallychanging the data to make it look better. 2. Semi-empirical approach Mixture modelling Combination of empirically derived functions and atmospheric correction Provision of opportunities for the inversion of surface reflectancemodels. 3. Physical Approach Atmospheric Correction to obtain reflectance of objects Need to have a very good understanding of the nature of BRDF Use of physically based models to obtain the absorption spectra of aleaf Derivation of composite functions to explain atmosphere and broad landcover effects. However, difficulties due to local mismatch - high frequencyeffects will remain. The Factor of Scale in BRDF BRDF is a broad scale averaging effect. Atmospheric effects for satellite data lead to a low level of smoothing. At high resolution (ie sub 1m pixel) fine scale images show broad trendsin BRDF Investigation of the patterns of light and shade Small pixels provide difficult issues Sunlit and shaded components at fine scale. In big pixels - statistical effect of how component proportions change.For a particular type of landcover how do shadow effects change as a functionof the BRDF. Outcomes Multidisciplinary approach to solving the problem. Funding needed for comprehensive study. Coordination of functions Use different datasets from different platforms, different scales, sun angles,spectral characteristics. Correction VS Normalisation for monitoring purposes. How do we correct BRDF, would this be a good thing? What does correction really mean? Comparison of methods. Surface property effects to look at monitoring issues. Looking for best approach as a function of imagery. Earth Observation Centre projects will be structured by recommended projects.Dr Norm Campbell recommended as CSIRO contact to identify a working groupfor interested parties in the CSIRO Investigation of the methods used for BRDF correction in the upcoming MODISlaunch.

China WORKSHOP REPORT David L B Jupp CSIRO Earth Observation Centre 1. Changchun On Friday September 13 a variety of international BRDF people met at theYouyi Binguan (Friendship Hotel) in Beijing, registered and readied themselvesfor a two-part meeting - the first International Workshop On MultiangularRemote Sensing (Measurements, Models And Applications). The Meeting was organised by members of the Institute of Remote SensingApplications (IRSA) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and of theBeijing Normal University. There was international help as well, especiallyfrom Alan Strahler's group at Boston University. The first part of the Meetingwas held in Changchun, a city to the north of Beijing in Jilin. It is knownas the Detroit of China due to its vehicle production industry and historicallyit is remembered as the Capital of Manchu Guo, the puppet state set up byJapan in 1931 with the last emperor Pu Yi as head. But neither of thesebrought us there. Near Changchun is the Jingyuetan Remote Sensing Test Site. Operated by the CAS, the Test Site has a wide range of land covers and hasbeen the site of many field experiments and validation campaigns. Since1980, an extensive laboratory facility has been developed. In particular,we came to see the indoor Solar Simulation Laboratory. This is a large scalegoniometer with an artificial source to simulate the sun and moveable positionsfor sun/sensor effects measurement. The target measured is a square metreof anything you can fit in a square meter. A small table top instrumenthas also been developed to allow multi-angular measurements of reflectanceand transmittance at the scale of leaves. We saw the site in operation and the data processed in quick time as 3Dplots. There was considerable discussion of the various edge effects andconditions that make this type of facility similar or different to insitu measurements. We were all impressed by the facility. I wish wehad one even if only to calibrate our field panels! But not all is lost,since we are welcome to define and conduct experiments at Jingyuetan. Indeed,if field campaigns were made at the general site, example patches couldbe tested for complete BRDF at the same time. It beats using a SpectronSE590 out in the weather while the sun and sky change around you. Meanwhile,a graduate student can be measuring the leaves as well! Nearby is a solar observatory on a hill top with a dome roof that opensallowing a range of continuous sun photometer and irradiance device datato be collected. Quite an investment has been made and in principle a highlevel of characterisation could be had at Jingyuetan - to a level we haveno hope of matching in Australia at this time. After a good lunch on Sunday September 15 (which by itself was probablyenough to justify further collaboration and cooperative development) weflew back to (warmer) Beijing for the next phase of the Workshop. 2. Beijing On the morning of Monday September 16 the talking and discussion part ofthe Workshop began. We were welcomed by a group of very senior and distinguishedpeople from the CAS and the State Science and Technology Commission. JuhanRoss, the 'grand old man' of radiation in plant canopies and Alan Strahler(who is still quite young) gave Keynote Addresses which set the scene forthe Meeting. There followed two days (two half days and one full day) of very intensivelypacked presentations. The program as presented, with speaker (bolded) andtopic is attached for you to read. The papers will be available in the nearfuture for you to look more carefully at talks that are especially relevantto you. In this Report, I will limit my discussion to general impressionsplus a detailed set of notes on the outcomes Discussion that occurred onWednesday September 18 Of course, a primary outcome for such meetings is for people working ina field to meet, get to know each other if that has not happened before,exchange ideas both during sessions and at any other time that is availableand jointly develop their ideas of the directions that need to be pursuedinto the future. All of these happened. 3. General Notes & Impressions 3.1 Parametric BRDF It was very comforting to see how the recent simplifications to BRDF models(the 'kernel' and similar simple models) were performing well as tools inatmospheric correction and image brightness correction at airborne, TM andAVHRR data scales. Simplified models and linearity are obviously fashionablebut also provide very practical tools to describe and use BRDF for applicationssuch as those above and others such as panel characterisation. Obviously,the scope for such techniques is about to increase with the launch of ADEOScarrying POLDER and will further increase as MODIS and MISR data start tocome on line in a more distant time frame. These developments were outlined in Talks [1-8], [2-5], [3-3], [3-5], [3-6]and [4-2] 3.2 Hospot Specific Instrumentation Sig Gerstl [1-2] provided advance notice for an innovative mission to utilisethe hotspot region from space using an active laser and tethered receivers.It is 'Bi-static Lidar' I guess and the technology is feasible. All thatis needed is for the extra value of the information to be proven over notdoing it! His ideas are not alone in that. 3.3 Field and Laboratory Instrumentation There was a strong emphasis on field and laboratory measurement. In summarisinghis session, Juhan Ross said that the main advances have been in computertechnology and in constructing measurement instruments. Instrumentationand measurement protocols are very difficult but essential components ofthe research and also of the applications. The ideas included field datafor structural characterisation as well as radiometric measurements. Inaddition to the Changchun site, there is a goniometer in Italy at the EuropeanGoniometric Observatory (EGO) which is also producing many detailed studiesof BRDF at the one square metre plot scale. It was clear, however, thatthe leaf measurements being taken at Changchun were the envy of most andwe all hope to see outcomes being published and information made availablein the future. There is still a lot to be done relative to the 'scattering phase functions'of the objects that different user models and radiative models want andcan deal with. Leaf measurements need to be linked to high spectral resolutiondata and plant physiological information (such as chlorophyll and pigments)as well. However, the tools are emerging to do this which did not previouslyexist. At the 'module' or 'branch' scale, Juhan Ross described an instrumentfor measuring scattering that is being used in Estonia (the 'Shoot Goniometer')and for short crops and other covers, the large indoor Goniometers at Changchunand ISPRA are obviously filling a need. However, in order to relate models, measurements and the objectives of theusers there is still some work to be done in describing and recording structurein the non-homogeneous canopies we mostly work with. Juhan Ross and TiitNilson were especially adamant of the need to introduce such protocols offield description and measurement and emphasised that they need to relateto the end use. Given the limited relationships between (say) traditionalforestry data and radiation data this may mean the definition of a set ofnew phytometrical measurements. The Chinese work by Xiang Yueqin and WangJindi ([1-11], [1-12]) is very interesting in this regard. Other talks covering this area were: [1-1], [1-4], [1-5], [1-9], [1-10],[2-9] and [3-1] 3.4 Modelling & Inversion The recent main advances in modelling seem to have been computational ratherthan by changes in the physics and/or mathematics. There are now a welldefined set of models that can adequately describe the BRDF of structuredland covers. What is not so common are the parameters of the component propertiesof the models (such as leaf phase functions!) and there is still scope forcomputational simplifications and more robust techniques for inversion. Andres Kuusk and others described a number of uses of parameter inversionwith Landsat TM and AVHRR data. With Landsat TM data, Kuusk was invertingchlorophyll content using relationships obtained from field and laboratorymeasurements. Inversion is obviously the aim of this work and has stillto be made simpler and more robust. As a complete test base for models and measurements associated with theEGO, Michel Verstraete described the Monte-Carlo RayTran model which hasbeen running on a supercomputer at ISPRA. Able to be linked to an L-Systemmodel of the land surface it provides a good base for model testing anddata interpretation. He also described work in which the leaf structureis modelled by simple geometric forms (cylinders, spheres and sheets). Hewas keen to form an 'Observation Protocol' for the data that will be generatedin the future. Such work obviously sits at the interface between measurement and modelling.At this advancing stage of the development of the BRDF research the twoare clearly dependent and complementary. Related Talks were: [2-1], [2-2], [2-3], [2-6], [2-7], [2-8], [3-1], [3-2],[3-3], [3-4], [3-5], [3-6], [3-8], [3-9] and [4-1]. 3.5 Remotely Sensed Data There were many data types discussed. These ranged from the use of existingdata types, such as aerial photography, Landsat TM, AVHRR and airborne data(such as Daedalus data) to simulations of the emerging data types such asPOLDER, MISR and MODIS. Quite a variety of airborne instruments exist now which can obviously beused for research as well as for their prime objective as development toolsfor space borne instruments. These include ASAS, the POLDER simulator andMISR Airborne Simulator (MAS). These can be regarded separately as toolsfor mapping just as the final spaceborne tools will be. Their advantagesare those of airborne data - flexible deployment, control over calibrationand ancillary data. Papers discussion these include: [1-6], [1-7], [1-8], [3-2], [3-3], [3-4],[3-5], [3-8] and [3-9]. 3.6 Scale There were many ranges of scale presented at the workshop. Information wasobtained and models discussed for the sub-millimetre scale of ice crystals,through soil grain, leaf, branch, crown and canopy up to AVHRR scale. Itseemed to be unquestioned that BRDF and Hotspot effects translated easilythrough these scale changes. I believe the area of BRDF and Hotspot effects is perhaps almost uniquein the way its significant invariants do transfer across scales. Yet itis not all so easy. There are many issues of scale that are as yet neglected.Relationships between phase functions for the 'grains' listed above andthose of the components making them up have no complete theory and thisis a major challenge. Not wanting to push a barrow necessarily, I wouldmention that this scaling undoubtedly involves at least spatial varianceand correlations and that the 'mean' effects we call BRDF and the Hotspotare not themselves sufficient to describe the scaling. There were papers involving many scales but none on 'scale'. There was onewhich discussed variance [2-4]. 3.7 The Hunter and the Dog Juhan Ross pointed out that in Estonia in the forestry and ecology 'hunts'it has been traditional to regard the Forester or Ecologist as the Hunterand the physicist as the Dog. However, he noted that the traditional forestryand ecology cannot handle the information our science is able to providenor cope with the scales we can encompass. He claimed that in radiationecology it is time for the physicist to become the Hunter and the Dog. I agree. In other cases we have for years been asked by climate modellersand others to provide crude summarising parameters for models whose handlingof the radiation fields would make any remote sensing specialist weep. Ourscience is moving into data spaces unknown to our 'Hunter' buddies. It istime to hunt down what we can find out about the world that no oneelse can reach and then also drop it on their clean boots with wagging tails! 4. The Closing Discussion of September 18 The following discussion is an expansion of the set of notes provided andtaken by Alan Strahler as Chair and facilitator of this important discussion.He is thanked for the privilege he gave me to use his notes but is not toblame for the [embellishments]. 4.1 Initial Discussion Starter. 4.1.1 Why Study BRDF in Remote Sensing? (i) Improve understanding of physical scattering mechanisms of surface coversand interaction with soil and atmosphere; (ii) Retrieval of surface parameters by inversion. But which parameters?See below ... [Maybe not just inversion but also by interpretation and pattern recognition] (iii) Correction of angular effects in imagery allowing users to make theirown inferences. [Users often want to apply image processing to mosaics. Image processingimplies spatial stationarity which angular variations disrupt. We need themake the data at least 'quasi-stationary] Key Problem: " ... the main limiting factor remains - obtained by remotesensing, vegetation parameters quite poorly express the main biologicalprocesses - photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, allocation etc ofgrowing vegetation." (Juhan Ross) That is, Radiation Parameters are not the same as Ecological Parameters. [However, Ross has the view that the fault is not with RS but there needsto be a re-appraisal of measurement models on both the ecological and remotesensing sides. That is, it is time the Dog became the Hunter and the Dog.This is not just the case in vegetation cover. Linking the user scene measurement/descriptivemodel with the radiative scene measurement/descriptive model is the Keyissue in most applications.] 4.1.2 What is Needed? Models: Not a problem Inversion strategies can use improvement [There was not complete agreement here. Bernard Pinty, the Modeller's Modeller(i.e. a Modeller who is such a Modeller that even Modellers call him a Modeller),felt that better models are still needed. Personally, I think the currentmodels are advanced enough and are not what is pushing the boundary. Itis a common statement in water radiation models and atmosphere radiationmodels that the current limitations are not in the models but in our knowledgeof the physical parameters and properties that are needed to run the models.Land models are not as well established but the statement is, I think, thesame. Better Inversion theory, of course, can provide many of theseproperties in addition to the scene parameters.] Data: "Point" measurements for model development and validation Lab: Leaf scattering measurements Goniometric measurements of targets Field: Goniometric measurements of real targets in the atmosphere "Area" measurements to extend information spatially Field campaigns, aircraft data Satellite data - AVHRR, POLDER, MODIS, MISR & Spot-Vegetation [Measurement and Validation issues are a major issue and provide the currentchallenge. At all stages and scales it is also important to introduce thecorrect environmental information so that the radiation scene models andthe user scene models can be related. For example, are leaf measurementsuseful without pigment and high spectral data measurements? Can fluorescencedata provide the link? In each case above there is an issue of standardisationand information cataloguing. What is the minimal data set and descriptorssuch that the data can be used by others? What standardisation is neededin measurement techniques as well as information recording? Is a field reflectanceuseful if (at least) the fraction of diffuse radiation is not recorded?Is a leaf scattering reading useful if leaf absorption spectrum and/or fluorescencespectrum is/are not recorded?] Mechanisms Sharing models? Sharing Data? [The above applies. There need to be common bases for model and data comparisonand validation. Perhaps there are standard targets which can be used totest instruments and standard scenes to test models. But how do you adequatelydefine and parametrise these? The suggestion is recorded later for someform of email discussion area. Maybe a listserver is a good start. However,perhaps a full Web Site is what is needed with pointers to data owners andsites, model owners and sites plus a compendium of proposed standards andmethods for model and field analysis. The EOC is starting such a beast.For people who are not on the internet, an HTML version could be suppliedregularly by diskette for off-line browsing!] 4.1.3 What's Next for This Workshop? Biennial Meetings? 1998 in ISPRA or Toulouse [I suggest also that the regular slot at IGARSS be maintained as a continuityplacer meeting. This plus the 'Web' site may be enough to keep the Beijingmomentum going forward.] 4.2 General Discussion The general discussion that followed was recorded in point form by AlanStrahler. I have repeated the points with some expansion but usually without[embellishment] as I remember them from the time. Where a change may changethe meaning I have recorded it in [brackets]. In addition, I have re-orderedthe points and collected them under a number of headings reflecting my viewpointand interests. [The classification arises from my way of describing what most of the modellersand measurers are going through. That is, they decide on a 'grain' for theirobjects, define a set of properties or functions attributable to the grainsand arrangement and geometric properties attributable to the collectionof grains. The complete system is the scene model. This "grain"model must be relatable to both the radiation model and the user model ofthe world if the activity is to be completely successful. When they go outto measure the world, the relationship between the measurements and thisscene model is the measurement model. If the data are to be useful theremust be a good base measurement model. For example, in plant canopies, you must decide if you are working at theleaf and stem level, the 'shoot' or 'module' level, or whether you can startat the crown level, or stand level or community level. Foresters tend tothink of forests as collections of tree trunks with aggregate basal areasand stem size distributions and make appropriately scaled measurements,but ecologists have a bit more flexibility. Crop modelling is usually bestdone at the leaf and stem level although recent data suggest the architectureof the way these group on plants is also of significance for modelling. In each case, if you are an ecologist, for example, you must ensure thedescription is rich enough in scene model grain and measurement model scaleto accommodate the outputs of interest such as CO2 flux, water flux or energybalance components. It must be powerful enough to accommodate dynamics (suchas succession) if this is the objective. For the remote sensor, it mustbe equally flexible and sufficient if these outputs are the objectives butit must particularly be sufficient to describe the radiation measurementmodel and link to the sensor measurement model. The relationship between the user scene model and the radiation scene modelinvolves measurement scale. The measurement scale may be finer or coarserthan the user scene model and this relationship is important for choiceof analytical approach. In the Strahler et al. terminology, the radiationmeasurement model may be (Low) L- or (High) H-resolution relative to thescene model. Using these ideas, the points people have made are collected under fourheadings: 1. Relationships Between User and Radiation Models 2. Tools for Measurement of Properties & Structure 3. Radiation Measurement Models & Inversion 4. Infrastructure Issues The collection 1. is of special significance and is the longest. It includeshow to describe the scene as well as the issues of Standards, User Viewpointsand User Attitudes. Typical management views in some of the programs mayreflect user views and question whether BRDF based methods really work,whether there are too many models and too few products and complain thatthere are too few standards and less quality control. What are the products? Bernard Pinty made the suggestion that it is too early for standards. Ifear that if it is too early then it is already too late. As a final category I have listed Infrastructure Issues. These are thingswe can do as a "BRDF Community" to take things forward.] 4.2.1 Relationships Between User and Radiation Models Sig Gerstl: Parameter match must be made. Ecologists see the [same] "sun"for their applications. We need to locate the same phenomena that give thebiological effect and the radiation effect. Canopy architecture is an overlaparea. We need structure-based vegetation classifications. Andres Kuusk: Chemical composition of leaves from spectral measurementsis [an] overlap area. [An optical classification exists based on pigments. Is it as discriminatingas the optical classification for algae in water quality modelling and measurement?] Tiit Nilson: The ground [model] has plant communities involving spatialdistributions and patterns which depend on scale. At small scales they maybe regular and at large scales clumped. Also, the mutual influences of plantsare important but rarely used in models. [Tiit suggested that these relationshipswould help the over-parameterised models.] DLBJ: In ecology there are a range of models for succession called 'GapModels' which are based on an effectively continuous canopy with 'holes'.These should be able to be modelled and used to interpret broad scale images.The individual trees are not actually considered. Xiang Yueqin: It is important to develop descriptions of structure of thedifferent types of crop such as wheat and corn. We need to work out howto scale structure. There is a problem in measurement at points due to differenttypes, times of planting etc. Need to characterise the variance for agriculturalapplications. Bernard Pinty: Connecting radiation with ecology. For example, with LAIit has been mostly done from spectral data. There is [apparently] no needfor angular data. But what is the error in LAI? We can get LAI by inversion[of BRDF] but in the end this will only reduce error which may not be veryinteresting to the end users. We need to develop more [unique outputs].Eg LAI+Structure+... For combined wavelength we have the same [structural]parameters, the same state variables so there is a lot more informationbut a more difficult inference. DLBJ: Sophisticated scene and measurement models for remote sensing haveoften had to deliver simple products for less sophisticated biophysicalmodels - eg SEB. But this is changing. The demands from modellers are becomingmore sophisticated and spatial variation in CO2, water and energy fluxesare being tackled by modellers. Demands for better products will come. Wemust anticipate these requests for structural data and have the answersready. Wolfgang Wanner: About the "gap". Remote sensing provides a hugeknowledge [base] about the Earth's vegetation and spatial structure. Somaybe RS can help extend ecologists thinking to scales they cannot reachwith plot data. For example, a new LC classification based on BRDF and theway large areas green up etc. Phillip Lewis: Remotely sensed information may often be at the wrong scale.Ecologists often need fine scale information. Don Deering: Scale is a problem. Now ecologists are interested in detailedinformation such as process studies, stomatal closure for CO2 etc. [Why is everyone forgetting airborne data? Multi-spectral, multi-angle datawith pixels < 1 metre is no problem!] Sig Gerstl: Why do we limit ourselves? We should be extending the ecologistspoint of view. This is the "Pretty Picture" syndrome. We shouldnow be extending the view using polarisation and detecting stress at a globalscale. First signs of stress are not spectral but wilting - structural changes. Alfred Chang: Microwave may be more sensitive to such stress. Physics unitesall our science. The same equations but different approximations. We needto study detection efficiency. Juhan Ross: Ecologists cannot help us. We need to educate ourselves as towhat is needed and how to get it. [We must be both Hunter and Dog]. Don Deering: Do we need any more models? DLBJ: Maybe we have enough models and what we really need are some standards? Sig Gerstl: We need a 'super-model' of the standard models structured byapplication. Bernard Pinty: Maybe we need more data. It is too early for standards. Don Deering: We are not focussed clearly on a product. LAI at a global scalehas a focus which BRDF does not have yet. Even then different models areneeded for different areas. 4.2.2 Tools for Measurement of Properties & Structure Don Deering: Need to make use of the forward scattered light to increasespectral information. [Maybe it is almost mandatory to measure reflectance and transmittance oftranslucent materials. It is certainly the case that only measuring leafreflectance of Australian trees misses more than half the information] Juhan Ross: Need to add other regions of the spectrum - microwave, thermaletc. In microwave the is information about [the same] leaves, stems etc.and no cloud problem. We need medium sized goniometric apparatus for Shootmeasurements and bridge the gap between leaf and canopy. This could usea laser beam. Maybe this would cost about $300K. Prof. Kawata: Polarised light is important now that scanning polarised sensorsare becoming available. Need ground and vegetation measurements to supportPOLDER. Shunlin Liang: Canopy polarisation is 2-3% but soils polarise to 10-15%so may be more important than vegetation as an opportunity for POLDER. 4.2.3 Radiation Measurement Models & Inversion Juhan Ross: For architecture, the use of fractals and L-Systems should beincreased. Shunlin Liang: Can BRDF help in remote sensing of water and soils? DLBJ: In remote sensing of water the angular distribution of the emergingradiation field is highly indicative of water properties - especially inmore turbid waters. Clumps of algae or other particles have a strong effectknown as the 'Packet' effect in water literature. Xu Xiru: Need to use thermal infrared data. The question is how to use it?Need Effective Emissivity (thermal BRDF) models [the models need to be effectiveas well!]. This is significant in CO2 flux. Juhan Ross: Need to connect TIR data to the heat balance and surface energybalance. 4.2.5 Infrastructure Issues Juhan Ross: Next meeting we should invite microwave specialist[s]. Alan Strahler: Lets invite water people to the next meeting. Don Deering: Being pragmatic - lets get people from the ecological communityhere to talk about structure - perhaps a "Tutorial". Don Deering: There is an email based "Plant Canopy Network". Dowe want to develop an internet network? May need special funding for someoneto manage it. Can start with a User Group on the internet. [The issues raised are clearly ones we must cooperate to resolve. We allneed to consider the end users and 'markets' as a common area to developand we must all display the quality we know our work can provide. When thedemand is there we can all compete as to who can meet it best or most efficientlyor for the lowest cost - but until it exists our competition is probablydestructive. The development of a network for the BRDF community is a veryimportant step and regular meetings are an equally important step. A lotof ground was covered in this Meeting and quite a lot was turned over aswell. I look forward to the next.] Agenda INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MULTIANGULAR REMOTE SENSING: MEASUREMENTS,MODELS AND APPLICATIONS. September 16-18, 1996 Beijing, P.R.

Funding for the1km project has not been affected as NASA & IGBP are highly supportiveof the project. The pathfinder program provides stability. Alessandra Buongiorno, representing the ESA stations described their currentoperation. ESA is using LAS/ADAPS and providing stitched orbit data to theUSGS, and vice versa. Archiving on optical tape. Kevin Gallo - NOAA 's contribution is to ensure the recorders are scheduled.This data is free to the USGS now. Project Status Reports & Data Acquisition (USGS) Data comes from Tokyo university via ftp now, ~3 scenes per day. Possibilityof faster link from Australia to USA via Japan? Data from October 1993 to September 1994 will not be used for global compositesdue to the Southern hemisphere being in darkness. The passes are, however,stitched & archived. All of the 10 day composites for April 92 - September 93 should be finishedby the end of September this year. The data will be circulated, approximately200 tapes worth. Stitching of NOAA14 orbits will begin also in September,using data as of 1 February 1995. New atmospheric corrections have been published by John R Townshend, "A version 2 AVHRR multi-resolution land pathfinder data set ". NOAA 14 status: - correct calibration coefficients from NOASIS web site - thermal channels affected by seeing sunlight in the calibrating "space-look", gain calculations affected.

Rest of ESA stations represented by Alessandra Buongiorno. Science Requirements & Extension of Project Martha Maiden stated that NASA envisioned the project continuing indefinitely,perhaps becoming more stabilised with time. The EROS Data Centre has strongsupport for the project as part of Mission to Planet Earth. All partiesagreed to continue until September 1998 ( by which time the 1996 data shouldbe processed ). Information on anyone using the global product, or any otherscience requirements should be fed back to NASA or EDC. Data Processing / Product Distribution EDC intends to get a global data set of control points due to errorsin the DCW. Interest in Australia's MSS mosaic. NOAA provides quality assessment of the Global product by comparing NDVIwith 8km NDVI. Information re the global composites is currently taking 4 to 7 months togo online (IMS limitations). NOAA Update (Dan Tarpley) Dan outlined the changes with the NOAA K, L, M series: additional / replacement sensors calibration changes in reflectance channels 1.6 & 3.7 micron channel (1km group should vote in the time-sharing) new launch policy (on failure of previous satellite) better launch rocket by NOAA L NPOESS to take over ~ 2008 1-KM Data Set Projects, Applications, and Related Platforms SPOT VEGETATION Update (Gilbert Saint, JRC) The products from the Vegetation instruments (Veg-1 & Veg-2) will bedistributed by SPOT at a minimal cost. Veg-1 should begin operation in 1997,Veg-2 in 2002. L-band reception may be free, with some charge for correctionparameters. National Snow & Ice Data Centre (Ted Scambos & Todd Hutchinson) NSIDC collects & composites data over the poles to create products suchas albedo, surface temperature, sea-ice movement. Discussed the problemsof rapid local time changes across the poles. AVHRR Calibration (Eric Vermote, University of Maryland) Near real-time calibration using ocean and cloud views. Ratio of ch1/ch2over the pacific ocean, where aerosol contribution is negligible, in thepresence of high altitude thick cloud (considered spectrally flat). Ozonecan be accurately measured (TOVS, SeaWIFs) thus effects due to Rayleighscattering can be isolated. The process currently has a 9 day turnaround. AVHRR Global Fire Product (Jackie Kendal, NASA) Fire Algorithm Working Group, NGSFC. See IGBP-DIS home page. The objective is to provide a standard global fire product. So far haveproduced a prototype data set from Global AVHRR 1km product (June 25 1992)and are validating it against DMSP & GOES data, high resolution satellitedata, and results from field experiments (SAFARI, SCAR(s), EXPRESSO, Firescan).Hope to publish the first product March 97, on cdrom. NOAA Urban Heat Island Project (Kevin Gallo, NOAA) Using NDVI and DMSP OLS. Results: a heat island bias is likely to be presentin the observed temperatures for stations with a lower NDVI than their surroundinglandscapes. Discussion All present reaffirmed continuation of the project. Another meetingis expected to be held before next (Northern) summer. Kevin Gallo advised of the next NOAA meeting, on satellite applications,March 4 - 6, North Carolina. Details at NOAA's website ( http://www.noaa.gov).

Annapolis, Md, USA June 10 - 12 1996 Symposium Themes To inform users of current and future plans of US and internationalpolar satellite systems To discuss the changes in NOAA's upcoming satellites (NOAA K, L &M), including changes in their direct broadcast systems. The U.S. Congress has reaffirmed "free access" to the data.There has been a significant increase in the number of amateur users ofthe data. Currently NOAA 14 is the primary afternoon satellite & NOAA 12 is theprimary morning satellite. The Search & Rescue Processor (SARP) on NOAA 14 has been inoperativesince launch. The backup computer failed. The next series of satellites, NOAA K to N will be the fifth generationof NOAA satellites. The changes include: the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and Stratospheric Sounding Unit(SSU) will be discontinued the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, AMSU-A & AMSU-B will beadded the AVHRR/2 has been updated (to AVHRR/3) by adding a sixth channelat 1.6 microns. It will be known as channel 3A; channel 3B corresponds toch3 of the AVHRR/2 instrument. These two channels will be operated alternately,3A during the day & 3B at night, although there was much discussionof this during the meeting. Due to limited bandwidth A & B cannot beoperated simultaneously. The use of data compression is being examined. additional sunshield for calibration, more solar panels, extra instruments= increased weight of satellite HIRS/2 replaced by HIRS/3 - a change in the calibration sequence. increased data transmission rate (1200 to 2560 bits/sec). after NOAA K, command encryption will be used. With these changes the stored and real-time data formats have changed. Fordetails see http://psbsgi1.nesdis.noaa.gov:8080/noaasis.html NOAA K may be launched sometime in 1997, but could be much later. Launchdates will be dependent on failure of operating satellite for this series.Some discussion of what "failure" meant, as in the case of NOAA11 where the decayed orbit rendered much of the Earth observation data unusable. NOAA & Eumetsat plan a joint polar program beginning 2001. NOAA to provideafternoon spacecraft (NOAA N & N'), Eumetsat to provide morning spacecraft(METOP-1 & -2). The METOP satellites will carry the same instrumentsas the NOAA series, with additional European instruments. Eumetsat is developing a standard software package (EARP - Eumetsat ATOVSRetrieval System) for processing locally received ATOVS & AVHRR datafrom the HRPT stream of the NOAA K, L, M satellites, and the future METOPs.It is a combined effort between Meteo France, KNMI, UK Met Office, DWD,ECMWF and ARA/LMD. This software will be freely available. There is a planned convergence of the NOAA POES program and DMSP, to becomethe National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).It will be a co-operative effort between the Dept of Commerce, the Deptof Defence, and NASA. This has been prompted by US budget savings, and wasdirected by the President in 1994. The increased use of radio frequencies is creating interference betweenthe metsats & other users. The World Radio Administrative Conference(WRAC) in 1992 allocated two bands used by APT & HRPT to the MobileSatellite Service (MSS). NOAA is monitoring the situation. Applications of POES data were presented at the symposium, including biomassburning and aerosol detection, snow applications, coastal zone hazards andthe Global 1km project. Some educational programs in earth observation systems and satellite technologywere described.

The collaborationwith Iwate University at Mutsu Bay in North Japan had suffered from persistentcloud cover and some logistic problems. Chris was also taking over fromI Barton as the Chairman of the CEOS IVOS sub-group (see below) and detailsof the hand-over were arranged. Phil Watts - Phil is planning to spend some time at DAR inthe near future and possible research programs were investigated. Thesemust fit in with his responsibilities and research activities at RAL aswell as with the programs at DAR. Fred Prata is the point of contact atDAR. Myles Allen - Discussions on the applications of altimeterdata in oceanography including techniques for combining ATSR and ALT data.We also talked about future techniques for the best analysis of ATSR data.It was agreed that the best techniques were probably those detailed in myrecent paper just submitted to JGR. Copies of this paper were left at RAL. Ryuzo Yokoyama - While I was at RAL Professor Yokoyama wasalso visiting so we talked about the Mutsu Bay campaigns as well as thepossibility of Yokoyama attending the series of meetings being set up forTownsville in April 1997. If he attended these meeting he would try andbring a high resolution infrared camera to obtain some coincident measurementswith the AIMS radiometer installed on the wave-piercing ferry. Tim Nightingale - Tim has built a new infrared radiometerfor SST validation and had used it at Mutsu Bay. The new radiometer wasinspected and provided some possible modifications to the CSIRO models. Data requests ATSR-2 data were requested for Fred Prata to cover two volcanic eruptionsas well as the data for the DC-8 campaign over the Hay and Amburla testsites. A request was lodged for full mission Australian continental coverage forATSR-1 data. This request would be forwarded to NERC and we are waitingfor a response. It is likely that this request will be filled when ESA andRAL start their full ATSR reprocessing program. RAL also agreed to forward some ABT files as soon as they were available.These files are required to enable continuation of the ATSR water vapourderivation studies. Other contacts David Llewellyn-Jones (Leicester Uni) - Phone discussions regardingplans for AATSR meetings in Townsville during April 1997. A draft noticewas formulated and has been circulated to likely attendees. The notice isincluded as Attachment 1. Cathy Johnson (UK DoE) - Cathy is replacing Peter Mallaburnas the DoE person in charge of the AATSR program. A courtesy phone callwas made to introduce myself and to discuss the status of the AATSR ScienceAgreement between CSIRO and DoE. Changes are required to the document sincethe demise of the ASO and these would be finalised at the Townsville meetingin April. CEOS MEETINGS - DLR, OBERPFAFFENHOFEN, GERMANY NOTE: CEOS = International Committee on Earth Observation Satellites WGCV = Working Group on Calibration and Validation IVOS = Infrared and Visible Optical Sensors Sub-group CEOS WGCV IVOS meeting The two day meeting was chaired by Ian Barton. The minutes of this meetingare included as attachment 2. Twelfth CEOS WGCV meeting This meeting was attended as the Australian representative on this WorkingGroup. The minutes of this meeting will be available in due course. Significant Items Two significant actions were discussed at the CEOS meetings involving theintercomparison of data from different satellite instruments using a particularground test site. These activities could extend to other test sites in thefuture. The Libyan Desert was selected as the land-based test site and Chris Mutlowat RAL was to coordinate the collection of data over this site for a selectedtime period. The results of this activity would be discussed at the nextIVOS meeting. Ian Barton suggested the Townsville wave-piercing ferry transect as an oceanbased test site. This has now (Jan. 1997) been agreed with William Skirvingat AIMS and Chris Mutlow at RAL. A fixed time period would be selected tocollect data over this site - probably in mid-1997 to provide cloud-freeconditions and time to ensure that the collection of good ground-truth datawas possible. ATTACHMENT 1 DRAFT PLAN FOR TOWNSVILLE MEETINGS - APRIL 1997 Dear All Herewith is a draft plan for meetings in Townsville next April. Can youplease let me know if you can make these meetings and whether there areothers who should be invited (David, Should you pass this on to all theAATSR SAG, - especially the ESA members?). William Skirving has agreed tolook after some of the local arrangements and we will advise of hotels andmeeting places when we have an idea of the number of participants. I hope you can all make it! Regards, Ian. Draft Plan for AATSR-Related Meetings in Townsville - April 1997 Below is a list of possible attendees at a series of meetings to be heldin Townsville during the week of 7 - 11 April 1997. Any comments on theproposed meetings, the list of attendees and the times allowed will be mostwelcome. The meeting schedule will allow for travel to Townsville on Monday afternoonto give a full day for meetings on the first 2 days.

Introductions went round the room and the Chairman passed on regrets andapologies from Karl Staenz, Allan Hollinger, Wayne Boncyk (who was representedby Dennis Helder), Masanobu Shimada and Zhimin Zhang. The Chairman noted that it was unfortunate that no one from NASA was attendingas the dossier is a key component in IVOS plans and activities. Objectives/Agenda The Chairman outlined the agenda items and suggested that an important componentof the day's activities was to ensure that the Dossier compilation and maintenancewas progressing well. The second day's sessions would include presentationsfrom the National Physics Lab. in the UK and a special session on the validationof future satellite instruments. The agenda was accepted without modification. The Chairman informed the meeting that he was standing down as Chair andthat Chris Mutlow had accepted the offer to become the new Chair. The Chairmanthanked all the IVOS participants for their contributions over the pastfive years and seven meetings and wished Chris all the best in his new role. Review of Minutes from Previous Meeting The Chairman reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. He noted thatthe two recommendations presented to the plenary were accepted with modificationand some discussion. The recommendation that ``satellite operators providereliable on-board calibration'' was discussed and Plenary asked for therecommendation to be more specific with a definition of on-board calibration.For test sites the action is on WGCV members to go back to their agenciesand propose international test sites and to foster the use of the proposedtest sites. Much discussion about this topic centred on the fact that CEOS doesn't provideany funds for activities and thus, what kind of recommendations WGCV canmake? Alan Belward noted that if IVOS developed recommendations with greaterspecificity then the plenary and sponsoring agencies may be more likelyto accept and support the recommendations. Kumar asked what the criteriafor a CEOS-endorsed test site is? Garth Morgan suggested that the siteslisted in the dossier should be considered CEOS- endorsed, although fundingto maintain the sites (e.g. collection and archiving of ground data, etc)will have to come from each agency. Mike Rast suggested that the dossieris compiled for information purposes and that some effort needs to go intoselecting test sites and developing cross-calibration plans, etc. Review of Action Items IVOS-3-1. Still open - but will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-1with a reminder that all IVOS members should notify the WGCV Secretariatwith information on new campaigns and instruments. Alan Belward says thatwhen the information is available it should be emailed and hosted on orlinked to the CEOS-WGCV web page. IVOS-4-6. Outstanding. Will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-6. IVOS-6-1. Closed. The Chairman commented that he welcomed the attendanceof Guiseppe Zibordi and other Ocean Colour folks as this will help withthe co-ordination of their activities. He also suggested that it was unrealisticfor agencies to send more than one or two representatives to IVOS meetingsand it was thus the responsibility of those attending to represent theiragencies interests in a wider range of cal/val activities than their ownspecial areas of interest. IVOS-6-2. Outstanding. Will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-2. At presentthere is a limited number of test sites on the Dossier and a special effortwould be made to ensure that this component of the Dossier was expanded. IVOS-6-3. Outstanding. Replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-2. IVOS-6-4. Closed. IVOS-6-5. Closed. IVOS-6-6. Closed. Report from Plenary The new Chairman of WGCV (Alan Belward) briefly reviewed the results ofthe plenary meeting. A key item is that the affiliates now have a mandatefor greater participation in CEOS working groups. The plenary wants to knowwhat the consequences of the recommendations will be on the working groups.WGCV is encouraged to address cal/val recommendations emanating from theSept 96 In-situ Observations for Global Observing Systems, Geneva. Theserecommendations were directed towards the end user and geophysical (derived)data sets, and contained fundamental cal/val issues. Rao stated that weshould stay away from algorithm specifications and focus more on basic sensorcalibration and radiance. Phil Teillet however noted that the funding realityis that the focus needs to be on end-user product validation. Rao arguedthat only operational algorithms should be considered for validation - experimentalalgorithms being too unbounded. Agency/Country Reports Chris Mutlow - RAL, UK. ATSR-2 has been resurrected and has been operationalfor some time. ATSR-2 calibration has been confirmed and validated usingseveral methods including: on-board calibration vicarious calibration - desert sites vicarious calibration - deep convective clouds GOME comparisons sunglint All methods confirmed ATSR-2 pre-flight calibration except 1.6 micron channelwhich was off by a factor of 1.4 An error was discovered in the pre-flightcalibration calculations and the following correction results were verygood. Chris discussed the ATSR-2 instrument characterisation. They use anon-board visible calibration which views the sun each orbit for calibration.Using both White Sands and the Libyan desert sites has resulted in consistentresults and they have also done some cross-calibration with AVHRR measurementsover the Libyan desert sites with good results. In addition, comparisonswith aircraft underflights have been very good in the IR and good in thevis/near IR. Rao - NOAA, USA. The new AVHRR/3 instrument will have a new channel3a (1.58-1.64 micron) for aerosol products. This will change the basic dataformats which will impact operational processing and calibration. AVHRR/3will also have a sun shield to limit stray light contamination. Rao reviewedthe AVHRR Libyan desert calibration noting that the values are tied to U2aircraft underflights which minimise atmospheric contamination. All of thisinformation is available and kept current on the NOAA web site. Rao is alsolooking at test sites in Nevada USA and the Gobi desert. Ross Mitchell fromCSIRO will be looking at desert sites in Australia. In ensuing discussion it was noted that spatial homogeneity, temporal andseasonal consistency, consistent elevation, access to the site for ground-basedcollaborative measurements and no BRDF contamination are important for anyvicarious calibration test site. Phil Teillet - CCRS and IGBP. The Canadian report had been submittedin hardcopy. Phil did discuss one urgent topical issue. He noted that someBOREAS sites may be maintained for 3 years and will be available to cal/valactivities, however others are being closed. A final decision will be madein December and IVOS members should immediately notify Phil of any interestin these sites. Guiseppe Zibordi - EU. Guiseppe discussed the CoASTS project - CoastalAtmosphere and Sea Time Series project. This involved the collection ofmeasurements over the north Adriatic Sea to support SeaWiFS and OCTS. Thishas also involved evaluating bio-fouling of underwater radiometers as wellas intercomparison of atmospheric and marine radiometers. Oaku - NASDA, Japan. ADEOS cal/val briefing. Much work is being doneon detector normalisation and characterisation. For OCTS, the on-board calibrationis being used for trend analysis only at this time; users will need to usepre-launch information until vicarious and buoy data are available. Mike Rast - ESA. ERS; GOME cal/val is nominally complete though morework is being done now that algorithms are changing. ENVISAT; MERIS calibrationwork ongoing; they have had two additional diffuser plates developed andwill be shipped to GSFC for comparison. MERIS is also looking into optionsfor vicarious calibration test sites. Mike noted that a recent issue ofRemote Sensing of the Environment includes a paper of desert test sitesfor optical satellites and Mike circulated a good reference book (by Kramer).Ian noted that these should be added to the proposed CEOS WGCV bibliography. Action: Mike to circulate the study on cal/val strategies to theIVOS group pending review of the study. Lasse Pettersson - Norway. Lasse described ALOMAR; a lidar facilityat 69N which collects year round ground-based atmospheric parameters tostudy the arctic atmosphere including thermal and chemical parameters fortrend measurements. ALOMAR is collecting a long-term baseline data set aswell as campaign-specific measurements. An ALOMAR and GOME calibration exerciseis underway. They would like to use OCTS data in this work since SEAWIFSwill not be available for some time. Dennis Helder - SDSU / EROS Data Center. EROS are characterisingTM through the internal calibrator. They are looking within an orbit, ina 30 day outgassing cycle, and through the instrument life. They have alsolooked at several night scenes to identify and correct the ``memory effect''of the calibration pulse (memory effect being up to 2 DN). EROS is alsolooking at pulse decay effects. Lifetime degradation of the calibrationlamps is being investigated. Landsat 5 has lost forward scan calibrationpulses. LSAT 7 is similar to LSAT 4-5 and is scheduled for May 98 launch.The Enhanced (?) Thematic Mapper (ETM) has a 5 % absolute radiometric accuracywhich should be double earlier TM sensors. ETM will collect sun view dataonce per day and will have a full solar calibration once a month. LSAT7processing will correct for affects identified in the earlier satellites.A Landsat TM Radiometry page has been prototyped at http://iplab2out.sdstate.edu/tmcal Stephen Tjemkes - Eumetsat Operational calibration of Meteosat: Currentlyhere is no onboard calibration performed for Meteosat. Since the blackbodycannot be used. In future (Meteosat 7) the onboard blackbody calibrationcan be utilised, however it is inserted into the optical path with a mirrorsuch that not the whole optical path can be calibrated. For the calibrationof the VIS channel aircraft observations and model calculations are used.Since the spectral response function of the VIS channel is rather wide,the calibration is scene dependent. Therefore, clouds, sea, vegetation anddesert (Tunisia) targets are used for the vicarious calibration. The estimatederror in the aircraft observations are 5 %. The independent calculationsby the Matrix Operator Method also shows 5 % uncertainty. Analysis of the calibration coefficient of the two infrared channels depictsminor problems with the current adopted cloud detection method. The calibrationof the IR window channel relates digital counts over clear ocean areas toradiances calculated using a radiative transfer model with SST analysis,and ECMWF forecast data. The uncertainty in the calibration coefficientis estimated to be 1% with a possible 1K bias in the radiance. The WV channelcalibration relates the clear sky area digital counts to radiances calculatedusing a radiative transfer model adopting collocated radiosondes. Thereforein addition to the problems with the cloud detection method, the vicariouscalibration of this channel is also dependent on the quality of the radiosondeobservations. The precision of the current calibration coefficient is about3% with a possible 5% bias. Eumetsat is planning satellite intercalibration for all three channels.For the VIS channel this involves the Meteosat 5, Meteosat 6 and where possiblethe AVHRR. For the two infrared channels this involves the HIRS instrumentand AVHRR. Calibration Test Sites and Dossier Status Several members noted that information that had been supplied for inclusionon the WWW was not there. Alan Belward thus suggested that we make a specificrecommendation that specific information which we have submitted be madeavailable on the web. Ian suggested that 10 or so sites could be identifiedfor immediate inclusion on the web. These should be vicarious calibrationsites. Validation sites such as Hapex, Sahel and Boreas will be addressedlater. Phil Slater suggested that vicarious calibration sites such as thesebe considered level 1 sites, and product validation sites be consideredlevel 2. The following sites were identified along with those persons to be responsiblefor supplying the test site information to the NASA representative who maintainsthe WWW site. LAND SITES White Sands US (Slater,Biggar) Lunar Lake US (Slater,Biggar) Railroad Playa US (Slater,Biggar) Lake Tahoe US (Slater,Biggar) Ivanpah Playa US (Slater,Biggar) Dun Huang China (Z.Zhang] Qing Hai Lake China (Z.Zhang) Hay Amburla Australia (Prata, Mitchell, Barton) Strezlecki Australia (Prata, Mitchell, Barton) La Crau France [Adragna) Spanish Sites? Spain (Adragna) Libyan Desert Egypt (N.Rao) OCEAN COLOUR MOBY Hawaii (DennisClark) Venice Tower Italy (Zibordi) PlyMBODy UK (Zibordi) Japan Sea Japan (Oaku) IR/TEMP SITES Mutsu Bay Japan (Mutlow) Ocean Sites Australia (Barton) Sudofex UK (Mutlow) Action: For these sites, the identified folks will get a copy ofthe form off the web, send to J Butler, with a copy to Alan Belward andthe WGCV Secretariat by 1 March. These will be updated on CEOS web site(by 1 July) and the progress of the dossier site will be monitored. PhilSlater noted that it's important to advertise campaigns to better utiliseresources. There was some discussion about the applicability of some ofthe ocean sites. Discussion on Future Special Sessions and Activities An IVOS Data Set The Chairman proposed that IVOS could select 2 sites and a time period andcollect all the data available from all sensors. Kumar noted that if CEOS takes it up, all data should be provided free. The Chairman suggested that we could start collecting data now and Indiainvestigate the possibility of doing the work as part of taking the secretariatin a year's time. There was then some discussion about data availability.Alan suggests that we should identify the level of effort it would takefor compiling and analysing the data. All agreed that this should be undertaken. Specialist Sessions Rao suggested a special session on on-board calibration systems for thenext meeting. The Airborne RS conference in Copenhagen in July 97 has aspecial session/short course on imaging spectrometer calibration and correction.Phil Teillet suggested that hyperspectral calibration in general shouldbe considered for a future session. Phil Teillet's New Paradigm in Cal/Val Phil started his presentation by stating that users will only use data productsif the calibration was transparent to their application. He then discussedthe spectral and spatial resolution of various instruments. For instrumentcalibration there are only a few operational cases. Generally atmosphericcorrection is non-operational, but requires well calibrated data and timely,ready access to atmospheric parameters. In the past little attention hasbeen paid to spectral characterisation but this is required to generategeophysical parameters from different instruments. Phil also discussed geometriceffects, viewing directions, topography, scan angle, resampling, etc. Theseall have a big effect on information content. Users: Special users do their own preprocessing and require high accuracy.Operational users need good cal/val for further work, but don't want toknow abut cal/val. The majority of users need stability and quality butdon't really know about cal/val. Existing algorithms do not meet the needsof operational users. To get to the majority of users it is necessary tobe clear about what is being offered. For Remote Sensing, one needs reliabilityof supply, plug and play, and data quality (consistency, quantitative andcomparable). A future strategy should take account of research, reference sites, demonstration,QA focus, standardisation, accreditation and communication. Phil also suggestedthat we think laterally; e.g., recommend that all future instruments includespecific common channels. Ground truth areas of 10KM x 10KM area are neededto compensate for current problems in calibration. Data should be hyperspectral,measured from a low altitude aircraft. Phil also introduced the QuantitativeStability Reference (QUASAR) Concept in which hyperspectral data ($10-$15Kper flight) are collected. This would be followed by radiometric, spectraland geometric processing of the data. Phil hopes to begin some flights in97 and expand his activities in 98. He would then generate products (surfacereflectance and at-sensor radiance, and NDVI and biophysical) and distributesite statistics on a CCRS web site one week post-flight. The results wouldalso be available as wall-to-wall data sets on CD-ROM one month post-flight. For this activity the site considerations are; uniformity, flatness, andsize (10x10km). Primary sites would be in prairie grasslands in Canada andNevada. With this New Paradigm the immediate action should be on the communicationaspects. In particular web sites and the dossier should be improved andkept current. Important questions to be considered are: error budget, site selection,spatial resolution, imaging calibration, etc. Infrastructure questions are:availability of instrument, turn-around time, who participates. Phil thenshowed several images to illustrate potential sites and highlighted subtledifferences in and among sites. Discussion: Phil Slater endorsed this new idea as he believes the fundingfor on-board calibration will soon be drying up. Chris Mutlow noted that many instrument characteristics will not be identifiablewithout on-board calibration. Specifically, build up of condensation duringoutgassing cycles can't be observed by campaigns. Phil Slater then asked about a joint field campaign in Nevada and severalexpressed interest in participating including UK/RAL, CCRS, NASDA, and possiblyNOAA. A meeting to discuss this would be held in February next. 3rd December 1996 Country/Agency Reports (contd China. The Chairman read the highlights of the China countryreport which was submitted by Zhimin Zhang who was unable to attend dueto problems with getting a Visa. The full report would be placed on theWGCV site on the WWW. Presentations by NPL, UK David Robinson and Nigel Fox - UK National Standards Laboratory. David Robinson gave an introduction to NPL - it is the UK's NMI (NationalMeasurement Institute - any country's official measurements institute).NPL has about 600 scientists, more than 95 years in operation and maintainsall 7 SI units (Kg Mt Sec K Amp Candela Mole). NMIs establish internationalequivalence of standards as well as R &D contracting and technologytransfer. Scope of NPL's space measurement activities: Optical thermal instruments, RF/microwave/millimetre wave, time and frequency, problem solving and other measurement services. Importance of space standards; continuity, traceability, and terrestrialequivalence. Nigel Fox started his presentation by discussing Accuracy vs Precision;accuracy is how well a measurement is known compared to an internationallyagreed standard or scale while precision is how well a measurement can berepeated. Accuracy is less than precision but accuracy enables differentinstrument measurements to be compared, allows long term validity of datasets, and enables compatibility with other terrestrial data (e.g. ground-based radiometers equivalent to space-based, and finally reduces room forargument. E.g. fibre optic power showing that calibration efforts have resultedin much higher accuracy. Nigel explained the standards verification andtraceability process and how the measurements are filtered out to the usercommunity. Limitations to accuracy are that the NSL does not understand user-specificrequirements,, and space scientist don't understand options available fromNSL and of course time and budgets are always limited. The various assumptionsmade in the interpretation of optical measurements from space using pre-flightand in-flight calibration (TIR black body, VIS/NIR Lamp & Diffuser)were listed. Solar calibration and vicarious methods were then discussed.Steps to obtaining a calibration baseline from a National Standards Laband the sources of error in this calibration information from irradiancescales, BRDF, etc were then described. NPL have developed a new techniqueto reduce errors and improve dissemination of calibration to the community.This involved reducing uncertainty using a new radiance standard (usinga new cryogenic radiometer) and reducing the length of the calibration chain.Nigel provided details on current calibration methods in use. Direct radiance measurements using filter radiometers for both VIS/NIR andTIR have been shown to reduce measurement errors. These transfer radiometersare portable, robust, vacuum compatible, quick and cheap, and highly accurate.One drawback is that the number of channels available can be limited. Thiswas followed by a discussion of accuracy of field calibration and optionsfor field calibration. Discussion: Availability; the portable calibration standard for visibleis available now, depending on the specific channels requested. NRL canalso calibrate participant's own radiometers as needed. Action: Nigel and David to forward a list of relevant referencesand the Chairman encouraged them to publish details of their new techniquein a scientific journal. Phil Slater(EOS Calibration Scientist) is also planning to form an EOS CalibrationPanel sub-group to co-ordinate and oversee all EOS-related vicarious calibrationactivities. The Chairman thanked both David and Nigel for their presentations and wassure that the new technique would soon be adopted by those using transferstandards to assess the performance of space instruments. Special Session on Future Validation Plans Phil Slater - MODIS calibration Phil gave details of the plans in place for EOS instrument cal/val. In particularhe discussed the calibration of the short-wave channels of the MODIS instrument.Two techniques will be used - reflectance-based calibration and radiance-basedcalibration. He described the errors involved in the calibration proceduresand detailed the traceability of the measurements using transfer standards.A list of proposed intensive field campaigns was given along with plansfor pre-launch cal/val activities using ground-based test sites in the westernUS. Hard copies of the presentation "Validation of MODIS-derived top-of-atmospherespectral radiances by means of vicarious calibration" were made availableat the meeting. Mike Rast - MERIS Cal/Val Activities Mike reviewed the 15-band MERIS instrument characteristics, the System PerformanceParameters, and the operational characteristics. The MERIS Cal/Val RequirementsReport and plan is now complete. This includes calibration requirements,validation of atmospheric correction requirements and the validation ofwater constituents algorithms. Mike reviewed the following MERIS plans priorto launch. 1997 Identify and select vicarious calibration test sites, detailed planfor VC, prepare airborne campaign, prepare data sets from MOS/OCTS/ in-situ,and simulation studies for Case 1 and 2 waters. 1998 analysis of variability of optical properties and aircraft campaignfor case 2 waters, cloud, vegetation, and VC sites. 1999 evaluate campaign results and fine-tune calibration algorithms. Major questions for the IVOS groups to consider: 1. Where do we stand with respect to the design/definition ofa coordinated cal/val strategy for large scale optical sensors? 2. What is the most commonly atmospheric transfer procedure used and whatcould be the means of translating different correction procedures (betweendifferent sensor data sets and consequently make products from differentsensors compatible? 3. What Solar Irradiance profile shall we use? There are currently differentvalues being used in the community. Chris asked if the atmospheric correction issue can't be addressed by theInternational Radiation Commission? Rao says not, due in part to the proliferationof available RT programs. The key seems to be that investigators shouldclearly document what RT code was used and, and importantly, what inputparameters (spectra etc) are used. Mike also presented information from the Atmospheric Chemistry ValidationTeam (ACTV) (E. Attema). They have been working with GOME, MIPAS, GOMOSand Sciamachy. They currently have actions to compile an inventory of validationmethods, select a data centre and informatics infrastructure, and to identifylikely participants. Plans include: Feb 97 identification of ACTV members Summer 97 plenary ACTV meeting Summer 98 rehearsal campaign Autumn 99 Envisat commissioning Chris Mutlow noted that MERIS/ATSR-2 and AATSR should be included as significantparts of the cal/val plans. Giancarlo Maracci - Vegetation Programme Giancarlo presented an overview of the VEGETATION instrument characteristicsincluding a brief description of the on-board calibration for the vegetationmonitor. Additional general information is available at http://www-vegetation.cst.cnes.fr:8050/.A launch is scheduled for the second half of 1998. Chris Mutlow - AATSR validation AATSR will be tied to the same calibration sources as the earlier instruments(ATSR and ATSR-2). The AATSR would be going into the Thermal-Vacuum testchamber soon. Strategy for Cal/Val of Large Scale Optical Sensors The chairman suggested that one option to follow would be the method ofIOCCG as the inclusion of this activity in IVOS may be too big a task tohandle efficiently. Alan Belward stated that this should stay in IVOS becausethe people who are key to this coordination should be involved in IVOS.Chris Mutlow indicated that the list of attendees may be slightly different,but the work could take place in conjunction with IVOS. Several people agreedthat a good first step would be to work on an intercomparison and a coordinatedcalibration effort over a selected site and the Egyptian (Libyan) desertappeared to be a good candidate. Participants would be asked to bring datasamples and actually work through the intercomparison during the next IVOSmeeting; this may preempt work on an IVOS data set. It was also noted that two geostationary satellites cover the Libyan DesertTest Site. Chris will identify people who need to be contacted in orderto select a time period, and set up the task. The assumption is that thesite will be the Libyan Desert (21-23N and 28-29E) and TOA radiances willbe investigated. Guiseppe Zibordi offered to gather a coincident MOS, OCTS,and in-situ data for a coordinated validation effort. Mike Rast noted thatthis exercise (pilot project) should be viewed as a first step in developinga coordinated cal/val strategy. In addition, the information about RT proceduresshould be spelled out clearly and used in the intercalibration exercisein order to better identify the specific information which should be requestedin the future. Klaus-Dieter Rockwitz noted that an atmospheric instrumentgroup (in ESA) could be asked to develop a strategic plan for calibrationand validation and report provide this as input to IVOS. Strategic Plan IVOS plans: these should be updated before the next meeting. Alan notedthat some other mechanism may be used for the ``living document'' whichdescribes the WGCV activities. Recommendations to WGCV Recommendations will be held over until the next subgroup meeting as thiswill take place before the next plenary.

IVOS members unanimously expressed the wish to holdthe next IVOS meeting during the two days preceding this meeting. Therewere two time constraints that should be considered in setting these dates. 1. The IGARSS meeting - Aug 4-8 in Singapore. 2. NOAA-K will be launched in mid-August which may impact the NASA and NOAAfolks' ability to participate. The new IVOS Chair would circulate the dates and details of the next meetingas soon as they were available. Close The chairman thanked DLR and DARA for co-hosting the meeting and thoughtthat it had been a good meeting. He was hopeful that by the next meetingthere would be a substantial increase in the information on test sites thatwas available on the WWW and that the Libyan Desert exercise would be astart in developing closer collaboration between space agencies in cal/valactivities. The meeting closed at 5 pm.

PRIMARY THREAD: EARTH OBSERVATION DATA CONSISTENCY & STANDARDISATION The development and demonstration of 'best practice' base data streamsand value added products from Earth Observation data forms a primary issuefor both research scientists and end users. As defined in the Simpson Report(Simpson et al., 1995), the data streams available today vary considerablyin level of processing and usefulness from raw information from sensors(Level 0) through various degrees of reformatting and sensor correctionor formatting (Level 1 and 1.5) to scientifically and applicable data streams(Levels 2 and 3). The effective use of Earth Observation data for research or commerce tomap and monitor the Earth retrospectively or prospectively requires a baselevel of consistency & standardisation of both the geophysical data(Level 2) and Value Added Product (Level 3) type. By 'geophysical' data(Level 2) are generally meant time series of geolocated (and possibly mosaicked)images of derived physical parameters such as surface temperature, wavelengthdependent emissivity, wavelength dependent reflectance and possibly someintegrated and derived products such as albedo or BRDF. A useful distinction can also be made between 'primary' geophysical data(Level 2) and 'secondary' geophysical data (Level 2.5) according to whetherthe parameter is derived only from the remotely sensed data or uses ancillary(eg meteorological or GIS) data. By Value Added (or Level 3) Products are generally meant products that addressthe applications products that are driving the user end of the process.Products such landcover attributes, soil moisture or evaporation, oceanproductivity and phytoplankton distribution and dynamics, cropping stress,fertiliser levels and potential yield are such examples. Sometimes the productsare quantitative physical measures but as often they are indices or nominalcategories. The time series of consistent and standardised geophysical (Level2) data plus appropriate ancillary data are the material on which they depend. The methods that produce consistent and validated series of either baseLevel 2 or value added Level 3 products will be the nominated 'best practice'methods. They are a base for researchers and users alike to start from eventhough researchers and users often emphasise different aspects of the series.Realising consistent, standardised and accurate data streams involves acombination of operational calibration and validation activities as wellas the establishment of effective base algorithms and processing pathways. All methods and products involved in producing these series require definableand reachable standards as well as estimates of reliability if they areto serve the more sophisticated needs of the researchers and users in thegrowing Earth Observation area. But users often emphasise consistency whereresearchers emphasise accuracy (Jupp, 1996a). In the Thread being definedhere, we will demand that the consistency be applicable to the base of existingdata and the accuracy be sufficient for the information to be combined withmodels. The Thread consists of: 1. A base of well managed field and laboratory instrumentation 2. Instrumented and established calibration sites and field campaigns 3. Well established sensor, atmosphere & scene models 4. Well defined validation processes for the methods 5. A data base of satellite and ancillary data 6. Data management for the data volumes entailed 7. Effective algorithms and processing tools 8. A delivery mechanism for standardised, quality output products The need for such an end-to-end system has been often stated by end users.For example, see McVicar (1996). The reason can be illustrated by consideringthe following apparently simple 'requirements': 1. The same top of the atmosphere radiance should give the same'value' - that is the data should be consistently calibrated and Level 1.5calibrated data should therefore be consistent. 2. If the actual geophysical parameters associated with a scene target donot change the Level 2 data do not change - that is the processing shouldbe consistent It is a measure of the need for focused EOC activity that these very basicrequirements generally cannot be met using the available data streams. Tomeet the first requirement involves maintaining calibration of the particularspace borne instrument by 'vicarious' means for most satellite systems.The second involves the specification and validation of intermediate processingmethods. The process may involve empirical reference sites as briefly describedbelow or it may involve more complex atmospheric correction but whatevermethod is used, in order to be useful it needs to be consistent and to meeta standard against which the products can be assessed. The objective of the set of EOC Tasks outlined here is to demonstrate themeans to establish these and other requirements in a way that ensures qualityLevel 2 products in a selected set of cases and implies a generic approachto ensuring quality is available in future data streams. Initial EOC Threads in Jupp (1996c) which are being addressed through thisinitial integrated Thread are: EnvSat Standardisation Thread (except for Software Tools) Cal& Val Thread Surface/Atmosphere Measurement Models Thread GMS Pathfinder Thread Data Management [& Integration] Thread In the following, the component Task are outlined. To start this integratedset of Tasks, the 'blue touchpaper' is to decide the candidate geophyisicalparameters and value added products and to decide the actual data sets thatare the grist to the process. This topic will be high on the agenda at thesecond Task Definition Meeting in Hobart on August 29/30.

The Seattle meeting, formally titled the 'Ad Hoc Meeting on Space Componentfor an Integrated Global Observing Strategy', was convened by the Committeeon Earth Observation Satellites, CEOS (see Box), and hosted by the U.S.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA). Dr Brian Embleton, Head of CSIRO Officeof Space Science & Applications/Earth Observation Centre, was the chairthroughout the 3-day meeting. The main aim of the gathering was to consider how the international communitymight best meet future needs for global measurements of natural phenomena.In particular, the meeting considered how space-based observations mightbe better planned and co-ordinated, in order to meet the research and operationalneeds of international programs such as the Global Ocean Observing System(GOOS), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the InternationalGeosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Amongst other items, the meeting paid special attention to how user requirementsmight be specified and incorporated into the Earth observation activitiesof CEOS members; the potential role of CEOS in a future Integrated GlobalObserving Strategy; and the interdependencies of satellite operators; serviceusers; and space-based and local measurement. Later in the year, in September at Geneva, a related ad hoc meeting willconsider the co-ordination of local or 'in situ' measurements, for similarpurposes. This meeting will be convened by GCOS. For continuity and integration,the organising committee will share several members with the group whichorganised the Seattle meeting. About CEOS ... The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites was formed in 1984, and isdedicated to optimising the benefits of Earth observation, acting as a focalpoint for mission co-ordination; and exchanging policy and technical informationabout Earth observation programs, missions, and data systems. Further informationabout CEOS can be found on the CEOS Information System, at http://gds.esrin.esa.it/Cceosinfo NASDA and CSIRO renew agreement During the Seattle meeting, CSIRO and the National Space Development Agencyof Japan (NASDA) finalised an amendment to their agreement on the directreception and distribution of MOS-1 data. The initial agreement, signedin 1987 and subsequently amended twice, allows for commercial distributionof the Marine Observation Satellite (MOS) data, received on behalf of CSIROin Australia by the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing. The new amendment, effective from 1 April 1996, moves the emphasis of theco-operative project towards non-commercial research use.

Europe's SPOT was the first remote sensingsatellite system designed to operate commercially, and has grown to becomea versatile and successful global commercial service. France's space agency, CNES, designed SPOT's satellite and ground stationsystem. In 1984, France unsuccessfully sought partnership arrangements withthe European Space Agency and US Government. The international scientificcommunity has also from time to time expressed doubts about SPOT's commercialfocus, although today the scientific community is a frequent user of SPOTdata. France in 1984 took a long term view of the development of commercial Earthobservation systems, constructing the system with support from Belgium andSweden. SPOT uniquely offered high resolution, frequently resampled colour images,available in stereo (see "SPOT Images").The images compared in quality and resolution to aerial photography, thoughcosting much less, with a global coverage. SPOT weathered the initial critical response, gradually entering traditionalremote sensing markets (cartography, coastal monitoring, agricultural forecasting)and establishing new ones. After a few years, SPOT was in profit, and untilthe launch of IRS-1C in 1995, was regarded as the best civilian technologyavailable in terms of spatial resolution. In 1994, SPOT earned approximatelyA$60 million. Now, SPOT is used more for public-interest resource management, and lessfor private commercial gain, than predicted. The world's many governmentresource-management agencies, SPOT's largest market, use the images in diverseways (see "Some SPOT Applications"). SPOT data also contribute to international research programs, includingglobal change monitoring. For example, COSSA/EOC purchased a number of SPOTscenes under a special arrangement with SPOT Imaging Services, in conjunctionwith a High Resolution Data Set Pilot Project within the Committee on EarthObservation Satellites. These scenes provided cover of the Northern Australian Tropical Transect(NATT); scientists around the world use these data to study climate variabilityand its interaction with agriculture and pastoralism. SPOT's onboard recording system can be programmed to acquire data fromvirtually of anywhere on Earth (See "SPOT Satellites").Program requests can be arranged through SPOT Image or any of its agents,and are then ordered from SPOT Imaging Services. The Data Acquisition Facilityof the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing (ACRES) receives and distributesAustralasian SPOT data. SPOT has utilised three identical satellites since 1986. SPOT-1 is dormant in a holding pattern. SPOT-2, launched in 1990, and SPOT-3,launched in 1993, operate simultaneously, partly to meet demand for SPOTimagery of the Northern Hemisphere growing season. Customers may quicklyobtain any of the 4 million archived images. SPOT-4 is under construction, scheduled for launch in early 1998. Whileearlier satellites were identical for image continuity, SPOT-4 offers severalimprovements. Its lifetime will be 5 years, not 3, and it will carry twicethe previous payload. Both HRV instruments ("SPOTSatellites") will be programmable for independent acquisition,greatly increasing imaging opportunities. Other improvements include a precision positioning system, 10 m colour pixels,simultaneous high/low resolution, and a new detector receiving infraredin the 1.5&shyp;1.7 micron band. Atmospheric water does not reflect thesewavelengths, but plant-tissue water does. The detector will enable measurementof plant water stress, providing harvest estimates and many other uses. Beyond that, SPOT-5A and 5B, due for launch after 2000, will further thesensor and tracking improvements. SPOT should be around well into the 21stCentury; users will continue to benefit from detailed high quality images,made to order.

The report details CEOS (Committee onEarth Observation Satellites) member bodies' successful use of satellitedata, and the resulting civil, scientific and other benefits. Members includeall civil agencies managing Earth Observation (EO) satellites and thosereceiving or processing the data. The report outlines EO projects with applications to: agriculture; resource management and surveying; hazard monitoring and disaster assessment; civil mapping and planning; ice monitoring; coastal zone management; and oceanography. Climate change and meteorological applications are excluded, as these usesare documented elsewhere. All CEOS bodies and related organisations supplied project details, butthe report includes only mature, operational applications showing practicalresults. The thirty-six described projects employ a variety of passive and activesensors, covering a large spectral range. Most are imaging sensors, eitheroptical or radar. Optical instruments, such as carried on SPOT and LANDSAT,are best established, though radar detectors offer sensing advantages andare developing rapidly. In addition to project successes, the report examines technological problemsand deficiencies, exploring the future of remote sensing. It concludes withannexes about member organisations, project details, and sensing instruments. COSSA is currently preparing, with assistance from NASDA, a CD&shyp;ROMcontaining case studies and data sets in Earth observation. This disk willinclude extended versions of some of the applications featured in the CEOSSpecial Report.

Professor Runcorn,aged 73, disturbed a thief in his motel room. Professor Runcorn pioneered studying the Earth through physics and mathematics.In particular, he used palaeomagnetic records to clarify the Earth's history. Runcorn was born in Southport, Lancashire, in 1922, then educated at a localgrammar school and Cambridge. During World War II he studied mechanicalsciences, and in 1943 started work at the Radar Research and DevelopmentEstablishment. In 1946 Runcorn joined Manchester University staff and collaborated withProfessor Patrick Blackett, then working on the origin of the Earth's magneticfield. Over successive appointments, at Cambridge in 1950 then the Universityof Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in 1955, Runcorn developed Blackett's magnetometer,applying it to studying fossil magnetism. Runcorn and colleagues later turnedtheir new geophysical techniques to the question of continental drift. Several eminent scientists 'proved' this then-unpopular theory 'impossible'.Runcorn himself did not initially support the idea. But after further investigation,Runcorn countered, using American and European rocks of varying geologicalages to establish that continents had moved relative to each other and theEarth's axis. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Runcorn conducted conferences under theauspices of the NATO Advanced Study Institute. This annual series of geophysicalmeetings furthered the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne's scientific standing.Also in the 1960s, NASA appointed Runcorn principal investigator to itsApollo lunar program, where he greatly developed understanding of the moon'smagnetic field. His honours include the highest prizes offered to Earth scientists: theVetlesen Prize (1971); the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society(1984); and the John Adams Fleming Medal of the American Geophysical Union.He was also a member of the prestigious Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Runcorn lectured widely on his other areas of interest: architecture, plusart-, national- and religious-history. A sincere and caring man, Professor Runcorn is survived by his sister andmother, and many friends and colleagues with whom he kept in touch despitehis frenetic lecture and travel schedule. A colleague recently wrote that his reputation as one of the foremost geophysicistsof his generation will persist long after his death, as will memories ofhis warmth and sincerity. B.J.J.

In the period between now and the year 2000, Australia is set to bepart of a rapid development of Earth Observation technology and opportunities.The application of Earth observing technologies throughout our region andthe world will be a major activity as resource and environmental assessmentand monitoring is done at many scales and over vast areas of the land andocean. Australia will certainly be a developer of advanced methods and technologiesfor Earth Observation, surveillance and monitoring from satellite and aircraftplatforms and may have a developing satellite launch, sensors, and servicesindustry. In addition, in an era of data encryption and 'closeable' skies,Australia will need to gather, process and interpret a significant amountof its own resource and environmental data and information. Taking charge of innovation In order to show leadership in this area, Australian scientists and industrymust decide that we are to be more than a launch site provider, data consumerand user of other nations' technology. We must 'take charge' of the innovationthat is needed to own the advances that will emerge. Industry and scientistsmust work together to make the results of research create competitive advantagesthrough products having the highest quality and meeting the strictest internationalstandards. Showing national leadership in this task is a role CSIRO canand should take. The need for a CSIRO Earth Observation Centre (EOC) has developed as thevalue of focusing the skills of CSIRO scientists in Earth Observation Sciencehas become clear and the disadvantages of dispersed activities have becomepatent. Modern Earth observing research has advanced from description, datagathering and exploratory image processing to a point where the value ofremote sensing data as measurements is paramount. Remotely sensed measurementscan be collected in a range of data dimensions and at time and space scaleswhich cannot be accessed in any other way. This has enabled geographical applications of Earth Observation to proceedin terms of scientific models and process understanding. The physical linkbetween the data and the parameters of interest to users is providing thereturns that previous image processing and 'correlation' based approachescould only suggest as being possible. In the generic development of thisopportunity, the CSIRO EOC can create a base of knowledge that will underpinremote sensing applications in CSIRO Divisions, and build competitive advantagefor value-adding industry. Focus on generic Earth Observation science In 1994&shyp;95, an extended review of CSIRO's efforts in Earth observationdata use was carried out under the chairmanship of Dr James Simpson of theUniversity of California in San Diego (COSSA Publication 034). This reviewrecommended greater collaboration and rationalisation plus much greateremphasis on algorithm development and value adding. In the pursuit of theReport's primary recommendation, to form an EOC, it was realised that theneed for focus and collaboration extended well beyond data acquisition-whichis, in the end, primarily an Agency responsibility. The development of anEOC founded on generic, multi-disciplinary and cross-Divisional issues includingscene and atmospheric measurement models and algorithms was perceived asa basis for developing collaboration and rationalisation throughout theEarth Observation activities of CSIRO. EOC projects will be outcome orientatedand collaborative, with the outcomes owned by all of the participating groups.The move to form an EOC has recognised that there are issues of Earth Observationscience that are common to many groups and that focusing teams on resolvingthese issues was vital to the needs of all, but beyond the capacity of anyone current group. In particular, the need for special focus on generic Earth Observation scienceis paramount to the successful development of clients and markets addressedby CSIRO Divisions and the Australian product delivery industry. These developmentsand client acceptance of the products are currently highly sensitive tothe quality of the data products and value adding and hence to focused inputfrom the base of excellent scientists that CSIRO has in Earth Observation.The 'delivery ratio' of generic research to market satisfaction can be veryhigh. CSIRO has an opportunity for niche development in generic Earth Observationscience and the provision of Best Practice methods which have immediatepayoffs in environmental and resource applications and to the developingspace and aircraft based mapping and monitoring industries. Science Plan A Science Plan has been developed and has been discussed widely in CSIRO.The Plan has taken the input material and the responses of scientists andgroups interested in the EOC. The Plan seeks to help Australia's efforts in the field of Earth Observationfrom space and aircraft platforms. One of the Centre's objectives is forthe associated services industries to be recognised and successful throughoutour region and a leader in worldwide applications. It provides a means forCSIRO excellence becoming standard practice in the industries addressedby CSIRO Divisions and in the information delivery industry that Australiawill continue to develop in the coming years.

Electronic maps aid Bosnian peace Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian delegates to the recent peace conferencein Dayton, Ohio, were able to negotiate border changes quickly, thanks tothe Imagine software from ERDAS. Imagine, a sophisticated Geographic Information System, allowed delegatesto visualise how proposed border changes would affect roads, towns, anduse of natural resources. Delegates drew boundaries on acetate maps, and technicians from the US DefenceMapping Agency applied the changes to maps already loaded in the US ArmyMultispectral Imagery Production System (MSIP). MSIP is a terrain visualisationtool, using ERDAS Imagine for image analysis and map updating. Changing the borders took minutes, requiring only drawing lines on a screen,then printing the new maps. Maps were printed using the DMA's Remote ReplicationSystem (RRS), a mapping package also based on Imagine. During the three-week negotiations, the Imagine systems created, revisedand printed over 3000 maps. The final Bosnian peace agreement included over100 computer-produced maps, initialled and officially sealed by the Presidentsof the three countries. Imagine technology, having aided in negotiating the agreement, is also helpingin its maintenance. US pilots and troops rehearse and plan for missionslong before they arrive in the region. Early in the NATO operation, few maps were available for even the simplestnavigations. But within days, field troops could make their own maps usingMSIP computers equipped with Imagine. Global Positioning Systems Summit The Global Positioning Systems Asia '96 Summit and Exhibition will be heldin Singapore's Marina Mandarin Hotel, 18&shyp;21 June 1996.

This electronic document reports a scientific assessment of thecurrent state of the landcover of the Australian continent undertakenby CSIRO. Through this study, we wanted to establish a continentalpicture of the extent and severity of landcover disturbance, thechanges in the vegetation and soils, as of the beginning of thisdecade. We undertook this study to provide a contemporary understandingand to relate the findings to the continuing problem of the lossof biodiversity. We publish the findings in this format to makethem accessible to all who are interested. How you proceed through this publication is entirely up to you. We want to communicate to you four messages: Why we studied landcover disturbance for the continent How we did it; What we found; What it all means. We tell this story in two different formats, and in one of theseformats, this compact disk, we tell the story in two differentways. Our story is told in printed format as a report entitled 'Landcover disturbance over the Australian continent: A contemporaryassessment'. by R.D. Graetz, M.A. Wilson and S.K. Campbell, 1995. Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 7. A copy of the printed report can be obtained from the Biodiversity Unit of DEST. When you see highlighted text (as in the last sentence), youmay click on it to link to further or related information on theCDROM. NB: Throughout this report you may click on small pictureslike this to see a larger version. The second format of our story is the one you are using now. With an electronic document such as this you may navigate atwill through the sections using the "go forward" or"go back" facilities of your browsing software, andby clicking on highlighted words or phrases. Additionally youmay use other features of your browsing software to, for example,print a section of interest. At the bottom of each electronic page you will see three buttons.One button returns you to the "Contents" page, the othertwo enable you to step forwards or backwards through the wholedocument just as you would with a paper book. Apart from the electronic document, the CDROM version containscopies of the actual data used to arrive at our conclusions. Thissummary of the project is a critical component of the scientificculture. Science is a process of testable inquiry and it is importantthat the findings of a research project are available for scrutinyby others. However, this data-only version of the story is unlikely to interestthe majority of readers. For more information about the datasetsprovided on the CDROM refer to the general readme fileand the readme file in the datasets directory. The complete, and therefore longest way, is the narrative pathby which the project will unfold in a logical sequence. At theend, you will have the best overview of what we did, why we didit, what we found, and what it all means. However, with this format of electronic document, the reader isfree to move to whatever section desired. Before you continue with Looking Around, we raise a number ofpoints. Whatever path you take through this electronic publication, youare reading a document prepared by scientists. This is a scientificdocument prepared and reviewed in the traditions of applied scientificresearch - to provide the best answers possible to the significantquestions of our time. The second point is that it is not common for scientific researchto be reported in a widely accessible format like compact disk.It is not common, but it is not impossible to do so. Dramaticchanges in technology over the last three years now facilitatecommunication between all sectors of society that was previouslynot possible. We believe that all the components of this story,objectives, methods and results, may be of interest to a wideaudience. Therefore, we have embraced the technologies necessaryto tell the story of this project in this enduring format. Lastly, the style in which we write is personal and direct andin contrast to the majority of science writing. This contrastis not because scientists are all dull and boring, without passionand character. Far from it. Scientists nearly always write forother scientists: both parties know and understand the personalcommitment to scientific research and the agonies and ecstasiesin conducting it so they concentrate on only the objective details. In this publication, we are communicating with non-scientists(we think) so we have included details of the strengths and weaknessesof the methods that were used and the difficulties that were encountered. Moreover, we write in a personal and direct style because we wantyou to be aware of how important we think this issue is, and howgood or bad a job we have made of the study. Does a passion for your subject diminish the objectivity withwhich you can conduct research? It can; but we believe it hasn't.If you are interested in thinking about this further, then readthe small section called A Personal Note . Finally, this document contains many images. They are not includedjust for cosmetic reasons. Each image reinforces points that weremade in the text. Consider each image carefully and make a systematiceffort to interpret what you see. If you do this, we are certainit will increase your enjoyment of this electronic document.

Itbegins to answer the question of why we did what we did by statingthe nature of the problem that we addressed. It is a reflection upon both the maturity of Australian societyand on the nature of the principal issues that there is substantialand persistent public interest in the state of the environment:the well being of the entire Australian continent. Three issues dominate contemporary public debate about the stateof the nation's environment. They are: sustainable landuse, theloss of biodiversity, and the potential for climate change drivenby the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect (EGE). All three issues are perceived by the public and by policy-makersto be intimately related to the quality of life enjoyed by Australiansociety; see, for example Bridgewater (1994),Broome (1992), Cocks (1992),Roberts (1995). All three issues contain considerable uncertainty: What is the nature of the problem?; How serious is it?; What can be done about it? Our basic proposition is that there is a thread that links allthree issues. That thread is landcover; the cover of vegetationand soils. Changes in landcover, in vegetation and in soils, usually havesignificant consequences for biodiversity, sustainable landuse,and for changing the greenhouse gas composition of the globalatmosphere. Therefore, a focus on landcover can contribute understanding toall three issues. Landcover is another name for the land surface that is theboundary between the atmosphere and the lithosphere. For the Australiancontinent, it is predominantly vegetation and soils with a minorpercentage of dry salt lakes. The landcover of very large areasof other continents consists only of snow and ice. In this document we report the strategy and findings of an assessmentthat we made of landcover disturbance for the entire Australiancontinent. The assessment had two objectives: to use contemporary (1990-1992) satellite image data to mapthe type, severity and extent of landcover disturbance; to integrate these data with existing understanding to explorethe implications of the landcover disturbance for biotic impoverishment,the loss of biodiversity. We believe the findings presented here will interest a wide audiencebecause of their continental scope and currency: this is whatthe nation's landscapes are like, now. What was achieved here was built on earlier efforts. In the sameway, while we hope our undertaking will contribute to increasedoverall understanding, it is far from the last word and will alsoserve as a stepping stone for future efforts. For example, within two years, we will publish our next step:a more finely detailed assessment of the landcover clearing rateover the last decade. Until these and other studies are completed,we offer this document as a contemporary mapping of the disturbancelevel of continental landcover, and an assessment of its consequencesfor biotic impoverishment, both existing and potential. Something To Think About We have set ourselves the goal of undertaking a survey of theentire continent to examine the big picture. For the reader tobegin to appreciate the spatial scales of this report we recommendthat you examine this image of Australia and navigate your wayaround it using the geographic knowledge that you have. This is a contemporary image of the nature and condition ofthe landcover of the entire continent. The ecological informationthat can be extracted from this image is both empowering and unique.For a continental assessment - the big picture - space data isa critical prerequisite.

The followingsections establish those links. We begin the argument with thisimage. We present an uncommon view of biodiversity. It is a landscapescaled view, an overview like this image, that seeks understandingof general trends rather than detail. Concern for biodiversityis sometimes disparagingly called biological stamp collecting.Using this metaphor, our concern is to understand the workingsof the postal system.

The integrity of each part and its synergy withthe other two is critical to the credibility of the assessment.Therefore, the strategy, ie what we did, is outlined below. The island state of Tasmania resolved with a ground resolutionof 0.005 x 0.005°; or approximately 25 ha. Tasmania is aland of forests that apparently are relatively little disturbed.

For the ILZ, which is 39% of the continent, computer processingof satellite data compiled a high resolution image of clearing. For the ELZ, based on expert interpretation of satellite images,the remaining 61% of the continent was allocated into three levelsof landcover disturbance resulting from grazing and, to a muchlesser extent, burning. In this chapter, these two primary datasets are brought togetherto provide a national overview, the big picture. These data arepresented according to a sequence of questions that might flowfrom the generic one - what did we find?

This section is a preparation for the next on Case Studies.Both of these sections report in detail on individual landcovertypes. Before doing so, we remind the reader that the primary focus ofthis project was the entire continent: we systematically soughtto derive a consistent overall view. This objective required thatwe worked at coarse spatial scales and what is particularly relevanthere, paid equal attention to all landcover types. As a consequence, the results may be puzzling. Some of the landcovertypes that are the subject of frequent public debate do not occupya central place, or even seem important. One such example is the closed forests of the tropical coasts(xTML4 - the closed forests), which cover only a few percent ofthe area of the continent; see Table 3 and the following imageof Townsville. The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet TOWNSVILLE covering thetropical Queensland coast and inland; total area approximately120, 000 km2. A very large proportion of the tropical rainforestswas located in this region. A moment's interpretation of the coloursand patterns in this image results in the conclusion that thelandscapes are now significantly modified. Landuse has, and continues,to influence this landcover type. We also remind the reader that we have no index of biodiversityimportance with which to sensitise or further stratify our analysis. No doubt, because of their intrinsically high biodiversity complement,the tropical rainforests have high conservation value. Unfortunately,the equivalent data and understanding are lacking whereby theremaining landcover types can be ranked for biodiversity significanceor even conservation status. At present, importance for biodiversity is most commonly assignedsimply on the basis of the presence of small populations of arare species, usually fauna. We would prefer to assign importanceand stratify our study on the basis of continental datasets ofthe level of endemism, and on the nature and level of threat.We believe this report contributes to the latter approach. Unfortunately, there is no continental assessment of endemism. The remainder of this chapter details how and what will be reportedin Case Studies. If you are interested in the Case Studies, then it is worth yourwhile to continue with this section. Reporting Methodology The current level of landcover disturbance and vulnerability tofurther disturbance were separately assessed for each of the 33landcover types within both the ILZ and ELZ. From this complete list, a subset of 16 types is presented indetail with this common format of reporting and scoring. Description Each landcover type is identified with its number and symbol,described in terms of the structural and floristic grouping, andillustrated with a landscape photograph. To convey an overall impression of where a particular landcovertype is found in a regional landscape, a pair of satellite imagesis provided. The first image of the pair shows the entire regionallandscape: the second shows just the landcover type. Size And Location A tabular summary of the absolute and relative aggregate areawithin the ILZ and ELZ is provided along with an image of therelative size and distribution of all locations of this landcovertype for the following: Disturbance By Clearing Disturbance By Grazing Vulnerability To Future Disturbance Disturbance By Habitat Invasion Disturbance By Fire Report Card WT03-B26-53IA029-000311-B019-239http://gaia.cossa.csiro.au:80/pubs/dest_la/www/content5.htm 138.44.40.1 19970114164333 text/html 1630HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 16:41:08 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wed, 14 Feb 1996 00:25:23 GMTContent-length: 1456 Case Studies Disturbance Summaries For Selected Landcover Types Closed forests xTML4 Forests eTML3 wTML3 Open forests eM2 eL2 wL2 xL2 Sparse forests eM1 eL1 Tall shrublands eS3 wS3 Tall open shrublands eS2 xS2 Tall sparse shrublands eS1 Low open shrublands xZ2 Grasslands xG3 WT03-B26-54IA029-000311-B019-268http://gaia.cossa.csiro.au:80/pubs/dest_la/www/chap6a.htm 138.44.40.1 19970114164413 text/html 11326HTTP/1.0 200 Document followsDate: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 16:42:25 GMTServer: NCSA/1.5Content-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 04:39:52 GMTContent-length: 11151 Looking Forward This project was the result of two separate activities: the interpretationof landcover disturbance from satellite data and the integrationof these interpretations with ancillary data. A satellite data-set was used because it was contemporary, objectivelyacquired, and digitally malleable. The ancillary data-sets were used to interpret (landcover, tenure),enhance (feral animals and fire), and report (ILZ, ELZ, Statesand Territories) the interpreted satellite data. The objective was to present an assessment of the landcover disturbancefor the continent, and to interpret this assessment in terms ofpresent and potential loss of biodiversity. The acceptance of the findings presented here is largely determinedby the credibility of the interpretation of landcover disturbancefrom satellite data because it underpins all else. The interpretationthat was finally used was one of many that were exhaustively testedduring the lifetime of this project. Errors of commission and omission were unavoidable. We stroveto minimise both. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains: most criticallywith the assessment of clearing. Where possible, we tested ourfindings against other estimates to indicate the direction andmagnitude of error. The results are presented in a pragmatic spirit of applied science- to present the best continental picture possible at this time.This is the same spirit and intent that motivated the publicationof the Atlas of Australian Resources series; in particular, themost recent Vegetation volume; AUSLIG (1990).Australia is, as the result of considerable effort, a well-mappedcontinent. This raft of resource knowledge supports not only governmentpolicies but also public debate about those policies. We hopethat this work will also contribute to a better understandingof the Australian continent. Five significant points emerged at the end of this study. Thefirst was that the level of thinning and clearing was high. Evenallowing for an omission error as high as 20%, the area was muchlarger than has been generally appreciated. Most of this unrecognisedclearing was in the traditional pastoral areas of Queensland andNorthern NSW where areas of sown pastures have expanded at theexpense of open eucalypt and acacia woodlands. Also, to a muchsmaller extent, we suspect that there has been a loss of largeremnants within the core areas of the croplands. This speculationwill only be tested by a continental study of the rate of changeover the last few decades. The aggregate tables of clearing and the graphics illustratingfragmentation of clearing do not convey the same impact as theview from space. The established cereal cropping areas of southernAustralia present a particularly bleak panorama: especially thoseof Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. They are extensivelycleared. As habitats, they are irreversibly altered. Those remnantsremaining are both small and isolated. The second point was that the ELZ was, in contrast to the ILZ,much less disturbed by grazing landuse on a continental scale.This reduced level of disturbance owes more to the intrinsic resilienceof the more extensive landcover types, the grasslands and lowshrublands, than to the conservative management of pastoral landuse,past and present. Considered together, the disturbance of clearing and grazing musthave been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of theprocess of biotic erosion. The landcovers that have been mostdisturbed are the best country; those that enjoy the highest rainfalland therefore have the highest productivity. While we do not yethave the quantitative functional relationships to support thisconclusion, we believe it must be so. Between them, the landusesof agriculture and pastoralism have 'taken the eyes of the land'.The case studies support this view. The third point was the exacerbating impact of feral animals.Where landuse disturbance was high, so also was the density offeral animals. The next point was not illustrated by data in this report butit bears heavily on any conclusions that can be drawn from it.Simply: Of the two drivers of future biotic erosion, the contributionof landuse, from clearing and poor grazing management is manageablewhile that from feral animals is not; or not yet, although concertedefforts are underway to achieve this goal. Finally, the basic premise of this project - that there is a relationshipbetween disturbance and biodiversity - remains qualitative andthe limiting factor in translating this or any other measure oflandcover disturbance into quantitative estimates of biotic erosion.While we hold that habitat destruction by clearing or grazing,and habitat invasion by feral species are the two most significantdrivers of biotic erosion, we cannot translate the assessmentswe have compiled here into any action. Why not? Two key relationships are missing. These are for any landcovertype, the relationship between species abundance and disturbance,and between the level of endemism and the level of disturbancethreat. These two relationships are considered sequentially. The firstrelationship, displays species abundance within a landcovertype as a function of its use of landcover geography; ie in spaceand time (x, y, z, t). While this relationship is strictly a multidimensionalsurface, and not necessarily continuous, three hypothetical responsesare presented. Whatever the shape of the curve, it representsa means of evaluating the current level of Threat. That is, giventhis general relationship and actual measures of the current stateof landscape disturbance dimensioned in (x, y, z, t), then thespecies response to Threat, in terms of its abundance in timeand space, can then be estimated. An idealised framework for relating species abundance in timeand space to the time and space dimensions of habitat disturbance.Three plausible response relationships are presented: a speciesdeclines in linear proportion to the degree of disturbance (1);a species shows resilience, then catastrophe (2); a species ishighly sensitive to disturbance (3). The second relationship is between threat to a landcovertype and the level of endemism within that species complement.We presume that endemism is the ultimate measure of irreplaceability.Landcover types will be distributed within this two dimensionalspace as indicated by hypothetical examples. The purpose of mappingthis relationship is to determine priority for action. Even thesimplest partition of this space into two levels, low and high,would be more informative than our current understanding. Hypothetical relationships between the overall level of speciesendemism for landcover types and the level of Threat to whicheach landcover type is exposed. By partitioning this space intohigh and low, priorities for management can be rationally determined.For example, landcover types 2 and 7 score the highest priorityfor conservation management. In closing, we bring attention to the issue of the location andrate of landcover change; the dynamics of disturbance that wasoutside the scope of this project. Obviously, clearing was an essential part of agricultural development.However, land degradation is an unnecessary consequence of poorpastoral management. The expansion of these two agents of landcover disturbance hasbeen driven and controlled by social forces, both local and international. These forces are dynamic. Highly favourable commodity export pricesfor wool, grain and beef come and go: those for the first twoare unlikely to ever be quite so favourable as in the past. In the last two decades, changes in the values society attachesto all the resources that land has to offer have found politicalexpression with most State Governments altering legislation, orits management expression, relating to clearing and to pastoralmanagement. The motivation has been a long-term concern aboutsustainability, and the expensive experience that the past approacheswere not perfect. Given these changes, what are the dynamics of landcover change? It is surprising, given the pivotal role of this question, thatit cannot be accurately answered; see Biodiversity Unit (1995). An aggregate, non-spatial summary from data held by the ABS hasbeen compiled but not yet published by Bullen (F. Bullen, personalcommunication). This time series shows the great expansion ofclearing post-World War II. This clearing was both for cerealcrops (WA, SA, NSW and Qld) and for pastures (principally Qld). Noting that these ABS figures report less than 50% of the areathat we have found to be thinned and cleared, they also suggestthat clearing is slowing. However, non-systematic sampling surveysusing satellite data show the loss of uncleared remnants withinthe core agricultural land continues; Graetz et al (1992), Sivertsen (1994).In terms of biotic erosion, the loss of these remnants is farmore critical than indicated by their small areas. The historical time course of clearing for crops and pastures.Since the beginning of this century, the area cleared for pastureshas exceeded that for crops culminating in a marked expansionfrom 1950 onwards. Land management decisions at the level of the individual and ofgovernments will continue to influence the rate and directionof the process of biotic erosion. The objective of this projectwas to provide a contemporary assessment of the landcover conditionof the continent. This assessment in a small way will supportthat decision making.

Of that team, one of us,Dean Graetz, did all the writing. Therefore, the style and motivationthat shaped this electronic document largely reflect the interestsand passions of one person, me, the writer of the words you read. I conceived and ran with this project. I did so because I believedthe issue of landcover disturbance to be important; not just tothe continuing loss of biodiversity but also to climate changeand the issue closest to my heart, sustainable landuse. How this nation addresses these three issues over the next fewyears will be determined by society through the normal processesof political representation and debate. As a scientist employed to contribute through research to thewell-being of all Australians, I can contribute in a small wayto this process of change through the conduct of research suchas we report here. My role is to inform the debate by undertakingthis type of research and disseminating its findings as widelyas I can to all who are interested. As an ecological patriot with wide experience of Australia bothfrom on the ground and the view from space, I can try to persuadeall who read what I write that the long term well-being of theland is important to all Australians, no matter where they liveor what they do. My colleagues and I began this process with twopublications several years ago; see Graetz et al (1992) and Wilson et al (1993). As an individual I can share with you the endless delight andenjoyment that I derive from the Australian environment. I aminterested in and experience pleasure from any part of my country,but most especially from the bush, the outback. The desire toshare these experiences and to conserve the source for all futureAustralians is my personal motivation. Poetry is the most succinct way to communicate emotions. Considerthis poem about a very common tree in eastern Australia, the poplaror bimble box (Eucalyptus populnea) BIMBLE BOX (an Australian eucalypt) The girl with English eyes said, 'Cautious tree,Leaves waxed and edge-on to the sun'She saw the sky part-broken by the limbsAnd felt the shade was dappled sunlight. Look to the ground - see cracks that tear the roots.Read of earthquakes and know the treacheryOf a seeming solid that will gape and swallow.These cracks are a slow shrinkage. They do not close.Thrust down an arm and feel the dryness. DropA pebble, hear it rattle fifteen feet.What would your English tree transpire but life -Its umbrella of flat leaves searing? This tree will live. Most surface roots will dieTorn by the crazed earth or exposed.Desperate then the tree will reject its leavesAnd dry earth receive them unawareOf this pretence at mulching much too late.Deep down the roots will prod in clay for sapTo support the few stiff leaves the tree retained.This tree will live and when it rainsThere'll be no burst of growth above the ground.The healed earth will be laced with unseen roots.There'll be an immeasurable swelling of the trunkAnd a handful of new leaves edgewise to the sunEric C. Rolls I have long admired this poem (used with kind permission of EricRolls). With a clarity I envy, it expresses observations of theliving characteristics of a common rural gum tree. The poet'sinterpretation of the behaviour of this tree through the seasons,obviously based on patient observation, is scientifically sound.I know of no better description of the adaptation of a nativetree to the unpredictable Australian environment. The irony is that no matter how well adapted to the infertilesoils and harsh climate bimble box may be, fine tuned by evolutionover tens of thousands of years, this tree together with manyother tree species has suffered its greatest decline in the pastcentury as the direct result of clearing by European man for farming.And Eric Rolls is a farmer. We cannot live without agriculture. We will not survive withouttransforming our environment to suit the well-being of human species.That is not the question. The question is about balance: how muchdo we change and how much do we use in other ways; how much ischanged now for the short term benefit of individuals comparedwith that which is left for the collective benefit of societyin the long term? The future of the biodiversity of Australia will be determinedby the Australians that inhabit this landcover type, the builtenvironment of our cities. Through strong feedbacks, the conditionof the continent far away from the cities will determine the well-beingof the urban Australia. This situation offers both opportunities and threats.

The assessment had two objectives: to use contemporary (1990-1992)satellite image data to map the type, severity and extent of landcoverdisturbance across the continent; and to integrate these datawith existing understanding to explore the implications of thelandcover disturbance for biotic impoverishment, the loss of biodiversity. In the formulation of these two goals, it was argued that landcoveris a tangible surrogate for habitat for all terrestrial life,and that disturbed landcover represents a change in habitat suitabilitythat was usually a deleterious change. The principal findings were three. First, within the intensivelanduse zone of the continent, we found that as of 1990, a totalof 1, 550, 000 km2 of forests and woodlands have been clearedor thinned over the preceding 200 years. This represents 52% ofthis landuse zone and 20% of the entire continent. These figures are unexpectedly high, but nevertheless plausible.Assuming a worst-case error analysis, the minimum figure was atleast 1, 240, 000 km2. Either of these two values revise the currentestimates of clearing upwards. Within this landuse zone, individuallandcover types have levels of clearing that range between 30%and 99%, with an overall mean value of 47%. Almost everywherewithin this landuse zone, the degree of fragmentation of the remaininglandcover was high. Second, within the remaining 4, 708, 000 km2 of the continent,the extensive landuse zone, 37% of the continental area was assessedto be slightly disturbed, 9% was substantially disturbed, with15% interpreted as significantly disturbed. This distributionof disturbance more strongly reflects the resilience of differentlandcover types than the standard of pastoral management. Combining these figures indicates that more than one third (35%)of the continent was significantly disturbed out of the total81% that was subject to active landuse. The remainder was allocatedto unused (12%) or conservation reserves (7%). Thus almost halfof the landcover subject to landuse was significantly disturbed.A global comparison indicates that Australasia and South Americahave equal lowest proportions of significantly disturbed landcover(38%), with Europe containing the highest (86%). While the landscapes of Australia are not as disturbed as thoseof Europe, the extent of clearing is pervasive. The view fromspace of the agricultural areas of this continent reveals thelittle native vegetation that is left with which to conserve theremnant biodiversity for the future. By comparison, in the extensive landuse zone, the Australian Outback,the prospect is far less daunting. Though disturbed, the landcoverremains relatively intact, and the standard of land managementcan always be improved. Considered together, the disturbance of clearing and grazing hasbeen, and will continue to be, a significant driver of the processof biotic erosion; perhaps the most significant driver. The landcoversthat have been most disturbed were the richest country; thosethat enjoy the highest rainfall and therefore have the highestproductivity. Between them, the landuses of agriculture and pastoralismhave 'taken the eyes of the land'. While we do not yet have thequantitative functional relationships to support this conclusion,we speculate that it must be so. The case studies, which coverthe bulk of the continent, support this view. Third, by examining the protection offered by the different tenuretypes across the continent, we conclude that the vulnerabilityto future disturbance is high for all landcover types. Lookingto the future from the landscapes of today, it is evident thatconservation management by means of tenure protection, ie thededication of land in reserves or parks to preserve biodiversity,is a limited strategy. Effective, off-park conservation strategiesare required to integrate the conservation of biodiversity withother present and future landuses. While it will be difficult, the broad scale integration of conservationand landuse in the future is possible. Landuse is a social activityand is therefore manageable by social means. Unfortunately, onesignificant threat to the success of future conservation effortsremains. Analysis of the distribution of four feral species (rabbit,cat, fox, pig) thought to be significant drivers of biotic erosionsuggests that their presence exacerbates the effects of landcoverdisturbance. While cats were mostly evenly distributed acrossthe continent, the highest densities of rabbits, foxes and pigscoincide with the most severe and extensive landcover disturbance,clearing. The acceptance of the findings presented here is largely determinedby the credibility of the interpretation of landcover disturbancefrom satellite and its linkage with biodiversity. The interpretationthat was finally used was one of many that were exhaustively testedduring this project. We strove to minimise errors of both commissionand omission, and where possible, we tested our findings againstother estimates to indicate the direction and magnitude of error.Nonetheless, uncertainty remains; most critically with the assessmentof clearing. . The results are presented in a pragmatic spirit of applied scientificresearch - to present the best understanding possible at thistime. This was the same spirit and intent that motivated the publicationof the Atlas of Australian Resources series; in particular, themost recent Vegetation volume (AUSLIG 1990). Australia is, asthe result of considerable past efforts, a well-mapped continent.This raft of resource knowledge supports not only government policiesbut also public debate about those policies. We hope that thiscompact disk, and its summary in printed format, Graetz et al,(1995), will also contribute to a better understanding of theAustralian continent.

This section is an extract from "Looking back" by Graetz et al 1992. It is an overview of some of the principles of interpeting satelliteimagery. What is special about satellite images? My answer is everything. Satellite images are really something different: They are uniqueand immensely powerful in conveying information about the environment. Satellite images are powerful not in themselves but in the waythat they empower every one of us who has the opportunity to usethem. To examine a satellite image of your own city, town or farm,is to experience something that virtually no one else has done.You become one of the very few; a genuine minority member. Youhave experienced a new and potent view of your country. Genuine hands-on access to satellite images was very limited untilquite recently. This restricted access is the consequence of alack of awareness and easy public availability. I believe thelack of access to satellite images by the Australian public hascrippled contemporary environmental debate. What is the best way to describe the view of life on Earth thatsatellite images can provide? It is difficult to find the words to convey my enthusiasm andexcitement for satellite images because so many of the powerfulwords that were once reserved for special occasions are now usedfor the ordinary and the commonplace. Let me start by admitting that each time I examine a satelliteimage, I am excited by and engrossed in what I see. No matterwhat part of Earth is captured by the image, I am enthralled bythe information that space images convey to me, and captivatedby their novelty and magnificence. My response to space images is not only from my head. It is notjust the information content of space images that excites me.My sense of delight is also involved because the view of Earthfrom space is intrinsically beautiful and enchanting. I have had this affair with satellite images for two decades.It began with love at first sight in 1972. My passion remainsas strong as ever. I still can recall the excitement of the firstencounter, and the feeling of disbelief at what was captured bya lifeless machine onboard a spacecraft 900 km out in space thatwas (and still is) ceaselessly circling the planet. I know that I am not alone in my feelings. I know of many otherswho also appreciate the beauty of space images or who use theirpower to communicate ideas and information. I am very confidentthat I can convey at least some of my enthusiasm for the spaceview of Earth and convince you of its potential. Let me begin to infect you with this excitement and sense of wonderby examining the following satellite image. This is a marvellous image of part of the Simpson Desert, NT.This space image is approximately 30 000 km2 in area and it captureshow this remote part of Australia looked from 900 km out in spaceon June 7, 1981. There is spectacular and intriguing pattern withinthis image. The patterns of colour and texture are the consequenceof natural processes that have been operating in these landscapesover the last million years or so. To me, the most eye catchingpatterns are those which are the most recent; they were generatedin only the last ten years or so. Are you able to interpret theimage and identify these patterns as well as speculate on theircauses? This image was deliberately chosen to be strange and mysterious,although the details of the landscape are still discernible. Details: The image identification is WRS 107-077, 22328-00052,07/06/81. The image size is 91.5 km by 86.2 km, or ~7, 890 km2. The next image does not offer quite such a synoptic view , butit is spectacular nonetheless, and instantly recognisable. It is an image of a Dry Season wildfire in Arnhem Land, NT, asrecorded by an imaging system called the Multi-Spectral Scanner(MSS) onboard spacecraft number 5 of the Landsat satellite seriesat 0930 hours AEST on September 2, 1986. This looks just likea fire viewed from an aircraft. Remember, this image was recorded900 km above the surface of Australia. Details: The image identification is WRS 104-069, ID 58267-00414,02/09/86. If you examine the image closely, you can discern a great dealof detail about the fire: the actively burning fire front, themany smoke plumes, and the colours and shapes of the unburnedlandscape as well as the fire footprint (scar) left behind asthe fire advances. I still find it an amazing realisation that this scene was recordedby an imaging device onboard the Landsat spacecraft, which isthe size of a Volkswagen sedan car, orbiting the Earth some 900kilometres above that fire. The steps in the process were these. First, sunlight was reflectedfrom the fire through the atmosphere to the spacecraft where itwas optically captured and converted to a coded electrical signal.This signal was in turn converted to a radio signal that was transmittedback to Earth, received at Alice Springs and converted back toan electrical signal. The very long sequence of electrical signalsthat comprise this image was stored as numbers on a magnetic tape.I purchased a copy of that magnetic tape and, using a computerand other hardware, converted the electronically coded numbersinto light signals that were focussed onto optical film. The resultis the image you have just examined. By using relatively simple technology we can in effect put ourselvesinto the Landsat spacecraft to obtain this remarkable view ofthe Earth. This view is an awe inspiring panorama, the like of which is entirelyunobtainable on Earth. What is more, the image that we are analysing will never die. What was happening on the ground in Kakadu National Park on themorning of September 2, 1986 is stored on magnetic tape in severallocations. Forever into the future, this image can be recalledand reanalysed whenever and wherever anyone is interested. With these thoughts in mind, what else can be interpreted fromthe wildfire image? What other information can be extracted? With a little thought and no specialised knowledge, it is possibleto infer other details of this wildfire and of the environmentalconditions at 0930 hours AEST on September 2, 1986. For example,it is possible to determine which direction is North and thendecide the direction as well as the speed of the prevailing windon that morning. The second answer follows from the first. Thefirst answer can be arrived at by recalling the time of Landsatoverpass, then deducing where in the sky the sun will be. Thelocation of the shadows of the smoke plumes is useful here. After answering these questions, at least two others become obvious:What size is this fire or what is the scale of the image and whyis the smoke grey-white while the land surface is yellow-red? To satisfactorily answer these and other questions about the natureof satellite images, it is useful to step back from the detailand think about this topic in a general way. What is special aboutthe view of Earth from space? This question began this section; the title of which suggeststhat the view from space is a new view.That is correct. It is a new view but it is new in two ways: itis new in time and it is new in experience. The novelty to thehuman experience is the more important. The view from space is above all; an un-human view. It representsa perspective of planet Earth that was until 1972 absolutely externalto the human experience throughout our entire existence as a species. Besides the attribute of newness, in what other ways does theview of Earth from space differ from the everyday one of humanexperience? Four differences are particularly significant andcritical to developing an appreciation of, and familiarity withsatellite images. The first and most obvious of the differences between the viewfrom space and our view of planet Earth is in perspective. Thespacecraft imaging devices look straight down at the surface froma great height with monoscopic vision. They use only one eye,so to speak. This perspective is in sharp contrast to our viewof Earth that is oblique, from a very low level and in stereo.This oblique, stereoscopic view is processed by our brains toprovide (relative) distance and context information. This is howwe judge distance and height. Using stereo pairs of aerial photographs,this human capability has proved remarkably useful and accuratein assessing apparent height. Over the last 50 years, much ofthe topography of the land surface of the Earth has been laboriouslymapped in this way. The second important difference between the view from space andour view of planet Earth is in spatial resolution. With our imagingsystem the human eye we capture the world as a dense array ofpoints, each of which is infinitely small. This array is combinedby our brain to form an image with considerable detail. In addition,we have used our brains in other ways to enhance the spatial resolutionof the eye with microscopes, telescopes and spectacles. In contrastto the array of infinitely small points resolved by the humaneye, the spatial resolution of the satellite sensor discussedhere resolves the Earth's surface into points that are about 60x 80 metres in size. This means that all the spatial detail withinthat 60 x 80 metres area is lost because it is represented onlyin an averaged way. This smearing or averaging of spatial detailis a new way of thinking about what you are seeing. With experience,this concept will becomes less disquieting. The third important difference between the view from space andour view of planet Earth, is its spectral characteristics. Satelliteimaging systems are designed to record the world in spectral wavebands,or colours, that are very different from our visual system. Thereforean obvious and correct conclusion to draw is that the coloursof satellite images must be 'false'. The colours in the satelliteimages used in this book are not 'true' in human terms even thoughthey are natural. The fourth, last, and most un-human characteristic of satellitedata is that it is acquired by machines: machines that are designedto acquire data objectively and repetitively.These two adjectives, objectively and repetitively, say it allbecause they describe the two characteristics of satellite imagedata that contribute the most to assessing or monitoring the environment. It is the two characteristics of objectivity and repetition thathave encouraged me to devote my research career to encouragingthe use of satellite data for monitoring the Australian environmentand for renewable resource management. Of the four characteristics of satellite data discussed, by farthe most critical to us are the spectral and spatial properties.It is these two features that underpin the obvious questions askedof the wildfire image above: what size is this fire or what isthe scale of the image and why is the smoke grey-white while theland surface is yellow-red? The first of these two questions is the easiest to answer andit will help introduce the more difficult answer to the secondquestion. The size of the fire and the scale of the wildfire can be calculatedby looking at the whole satellite image, of which the fire areawas but a small part. An entire image from the MSS imaging deviceof the Landsat satellite series measures 185 x 185 kilometresand is therefore about 34, 000 square kilometres in area. The entire image of the Dry Season wildfire in Arnhem Land, NT,as recorded by Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) at 0930 hoursAustralian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) on September 2, 1986.The centre of this scene is 13° 2' South, 133° 29' East. Details: The image identification is WRS104-069, ID = 58267-00414,02/09/86. The image size is 185 km by 185 km, or ~34,225 km2. Obviously this wildfire was not the only one burning in this partof the Northern Territory on this date. Several smaller firesare visible, and you can easily detect the footprints of others.A close examination of the surface shows it criss-crossed withenormous cracks or fissures. Each of these fissures is filledwith a crimson ribbon of rainforest. The view from space showsus the bones of the country. This image gives us an insight intothe geological forces that shape the Arnhem Land plateau. It isnot difficult to speculate as to the how and why of these hugecracks. Also, if I tell you that the eastern edge of this imagecovers part of Kakadu National Park, then you will be able tointerpret the nature and location of one of this Park's most spectacularattractions. Even though the image was acquired in September, The Dry seasonin the NT, it is not unreasonable to expect that at least partof the landcover, the vegetation would be green. If the colourof the smoke plumes in these two images is white and that of thefire footprint is black, both of which are natural colours, whyis the landcover yellow-red and not green? The colours that wesee in this image are not the same as we experience on the ground. Very simply, the answer to all these questions is the same. Thecolours of this image are false. There are good reasons why it is necessary to use false coloursin space images. It is necessary now to include a little moredetail of the process by which space images are acquired and displayed.The principal issues are the spatial and spectral representationsof the surface of the Earth. The sensors onboard satellites image the Earth's surface by opticallycapturing the sunlight reflected from the surface through theatmosphere. This imaging process is not the same as a camera thatrecords all the scene (field of view) at the instant the shutteris activated. Rather, the imaging device samples the reflectedsunlight continuously by scanning across the direction (path)of the satellite's movement. As the satellite moves in its orbit, so the imaging device scansthe land surface 900 km or so below. Each scanning unit is a pixel(picture element). In the Landsat satellite series this scanningis effected by a moving mirror. The overall process is not verydifferent from that used in digital 35 mm cameras. It is justthat the satellite imaging systems operating at the height theydo must be uncommonly accurate and precise. All satellite imaging devices do not record the reflected solarradiation from the Earth's surface in all wavelengths (colours).Rather, they are designed to filter the incoming light into alimited number of groups of wavelengths (wavebands) to reducethe amount of data that have to be recorded to that which is ofmost interest. For example the Landsat MSS instrument that providedalmost all the images in this book records the reflected lightfrom the surface in just four wavebands. The four channels of data created by the MSS device are mysteriouslynamed MSS#4 - MSS#7, rather than MSS#1 - MSS#4, because thereonce was an associated imaging device called the Return Beam Vidicon(RBV) that generated the absent channels #1 - #3. The four wavebands are describedby the range of wavelengths of light that the filtering deviceslet through. As an example, the MSS#4 waveband includes all wavelengthsof light from 500 - 600 nanometres (nm), where a nanometre isone billionth (0.000000001) of a metre. The wildfire scene that we examined earlier is presented hereas four black & white images: one for each of the four MSSwavebands. The grey tone in each image is a linear measure ofthe reflectance of the landscape: the brighter the tone, the greateris the reflectance (brightness) of the landscape in that waveband.The information in these four images is contained in the differencesbetween images. For example, check out how the brightness of therainforests within the fissures changes between MSS wavebands. MSS Band 4 GREEN (500-600 nm) MSS Band 5 RED (600-700 nm) MSS Band 6 Near Infrared (700-800 nm) MSS Band 7 Near Infrared (800-1100 nm) I have associated a colour with each of the first two MSS wavebands(MSS#4 = green, MSS#5 = red), but it is important to rememberthat colour is a psycho-physical phenomenon. It is a human definitionand a concept derived from the structure and functioning of oureyes combined with the processing of this information by our brains. Colour is not an objective physical phenomenon. The wavelengths of radiation perceived by human eyes (400 - 700nm) are collectively called visible light. Human eyes have theirpeak sensitivities in the yellow-green, this is most probablya consequence of the evolutionary history of hominids that beganin canopies of rainforest trees. The important point is that visible light is not in any physicalway different from those wavelengths that we cannot see, eg. thenear-infra red channels MSS#6 and MSS#7, nor from the thermalwavelengths that we can feel as heat but are also unable to see. Why are wavelengths that we cannot see imaged by satellites? There are two explanations. The first is related to the scatteringproperties of the atmosphere that is always in between the spacecraftand the earth's surface. The scattering of light by the atmospheregenerates fuzzy images of little value. The smaller wavelengths,MSS#4 and MSS#5, are more affected by this atmospheric scatteringthan the longer ones, MSS#6 & MSS#7. Thus one explanationfor recording reflected radiation outside the visible wavebandsis the provision of images least affected by atmospheric haze. The second and more important explanation why satellite imagingdevices record wavelengths to which the human eye is not sensitiveis that outside our visible world some really interesting thingsoccur. Various parts of the landscape are very reflective (bright)or poorly reflective (dull) in different wavelengths. These differencesin the reflectance characteristics of soil, plants, water, shadows,etc, in the non-visible wavebands are a little difficult to comprehendat first contact because they are outside our experience. It is helpful to begin with an example: vegetation. Actively growing vigorous plant leaves are quite familiar in thevisible: they appear green because they are very reflective (bright)in the green wavelengths (ie. MSS#4) and poorly reflective (dull)in the red (MSS#5). Outside our visible world, instruments tellus that these plant leaves are very bright in the near infraredwavebands, MSS#6 & MSS#7. As leaves become older and lessvigorous, they lose their high reflectivity in the near infrared. On the basis of this information on the spectral attributes ofvegetation in the MSS wavebands, we could design a test for greenvegetation. If a target was dull (poorly reflective) in the red(MSS#5) as well as being bright (highly reflective) in the nearinfrared (MSS#6 or MSS#7), then that target is actively growingvegetation. This test for vegetation is straightforward reasoning from whatwe know about reflectance. Note that the test did not use the one characteristic that wehumans use to decide whether vegetation is green or not, its colour.The green waveband (MSS#4) was not used at all. The high reflectance in the near infrared of growing vegetationis not apparent to the human eye in any way; this has been exploitedin military activities involving camouflage. Camouflage is non-living plant material, eg. canvas, colouredand shaped to resemble foliage, used to cover equipment from hostileattack. Well-made camouflage can mislead the trained but unaidedeye. So the unaided human eye was assisted by a special photographicfilm with dyes sensitive in the near-infrared wavelengths. Thephotographic image collected on this camouflage-detection filmclearly showed real vegetation as bright and false vegetationas dull. The near infrared wavebands of spacecraft imaging devices aredesigned for the same reasons but for a very different purpose.The non-colour wavebands are included to provide information aboutthe condition or vigour of vegetation. The spectral characteristicsof landscape components other than vegetation will be discussedas they occur in later images. There is one remaining step to answer the most puzzling questionthat flowed from our wildfire image: given that the colours arefalse, why is the land surface yellow-red? This step completes the loop from sunlight reflected from thesurface of the Earth, its electronic capture by the imaging deviceonboard the satellite to the coloured prints in this book. The MSS imaging device electronically records a scene as an arrayof numbers which represent the brightness values of the Earth'ssurface in each of the four wavebands for every pixel. This array,about 28 000 000, was relayed to a ground receiving station. Herethese numbers were archived onmagnetic tape, carefully preserving their spatial pattern. A useful analogy at this point is to think of an image as beinga mosaic or jigsaw puzzle of very tiny identically shaped tiles.The brightness value of each tile, in each of four colours, isrecorded as a digital number (DN) between 0 and 255. The imagemosaic will only retain its information content if the spatialpattern of the four brightness numbers is preserved absolutely,that is the spatial correspondence between the brightness valuesfor each of the four wavebands is retained for every one of the28 000 000 pixels. The next procedure is to take the array of numbers stored on magnetictape which has no meaning for the human eye, and faithfully recreatean image. This image must be an exact spatial and spectral copyof the original scene. The human eye and brain are superbly efficientat analysing the spatial patterns of colours that make up an image.In a few ways, the human capacity for image analysis still cannotbe matched by a computer. If the spatial pattern of the pixels can be preserved and displayed,what options are there to display the spectral information? The most common method of colouring the image is to combine thecolours in an additive way. That is, the primary colours of blue,green and red are combined on a black background to generate thecolour spectrum. The additive mixing process is controlled bythe recorded intensities, the DN values, of the reflected lightin three channels of the satellite image. In recreating an image,the DNs control the intensities of spots of blue, green and redlight focussed onto a photographic film in a hardcopy output device. With four original channels of data in the original MSS imageand only three primary colours available, a choice in the assignmentof colour to waveband must be made. For Landsat MSS, the most frequent assignment of colours to MSSwaveband intensities is blue to MSS#4, green to MSS#5 and redto MSS#7. The data in MSS#6 are thus ignored. For any one of themillions of pixels in the output image, the recorded brightness(DN) of the land surface in MSS#4 (green) controls the amountof blue colour added. The DN for MSS#5 (red) controls the amountof green added to each pixel in the image and the MSS#7 (nearinfrared) DN controls the amount of red. Recreating an image by using colour additive mixing and this colourassignment results in a traditional False Colour Composite (FCC)image. It is not the only way of recreating an MSS image. It is possibleto use a subtractive rather than additive colour mixing processin which the yellow, magenta and cyan primaries subtract froma white background to generate the colour spectrum. In addition,the colour assignment between MSS channels is variable becausethere are 22 different possible ways of combining three channelsfrom four. All of the 22 combinations will produce a false colourcomposite image. The choice finally depends on the gamut of coloursthe interpreter prefers. Finally, let's complete the loop that we challenged ourselveswith after examining the wildfire image. Why, in that image isthe land surface yellow-red? The explanation now seems simple. If we had an area of landscapein the NT on the morning of September 2, 1986 that had a coverof green vigorous vegetation, it would have been recorded as brightin the near infrared wavebands (MSS#6 and MSS#7). Therefore when we come to translate this digital record back intohardcopy and colours, green, vigorous vegetation will appear redin the output FCC image. The Landsat image archive for Australiabegan in late 1972 with the launch of Landsat-1. As I write, Landsat-5is the operational satellite that is still steadily and systematicallyobserving the Earth using both the MSS and the Thematic Mapper(TM) imaging systems. The MSS imaging system will eventually be replaced by the ThematicMapper (TM) imaging system that has higher spatial resolution,30 x 30 metre pixel size rather than the 60 x 80 metres of MSS,and higher spectral resolution, operating with seven spectralwavebands rather than the four of the MSS system. The MSS systemhas acquired data that now form an enormous image archive of theEarth. The total number of images is not precisely known, butit is more than 2 million. The principal imaging device aboard Landsat 1-5 has been the MSS.With the launch of Landsat-4 in 1983, the Thematic Mapper (TM)was added to the payload with higher spectral and spatial resolutionbut with the same swathe width and revisit time. In summary: Satellite images are unique and extremely powerfulin conveying information about the environment. They are unusualand unfamiliar because the view that they provide is new and challenging.We can use that view to provide an objective assessment of thestate of environment twenty years ago and as it is today. Satellitedata are a new truth and a new history.We can use it to detect the changes that have taken place overthat time span and to determine whether those changes were forthe better, benign, or for the worse. We can objectively determinethe rates of change, the spatial location of change and, mostimportantly, who was responsible for that change. The managementof the Earth has never had such a powerful tool at its disposal,yet that tool resides 900 kilometres out in space. Additional reading Calder, N., 1991., 'Spaceship Earth'.

INTRODUCTION The work done at CSIRO Division of Water Resources (DWR), based on the Itres(Canada) CASI airborne spectral imaging instrument, is an Applications Basedsystems development. This development is a package consisting of an IntegratedAirborne (spectral) Sensing (IAS) instrument, ancillary instrumentationand processing modules. Together, these can provide high resolution informationfor environmental resource assessment in a form immediately useful to endusers of the products. The Applications area defined for this IAS involvesintegrating models and methods based on CSIRO DWR core knowledge and skillswith a general system comprising data collection instruments, processingmethodologies and processing hardware and software systems. 2. APPLICATIONS AREA MODEL The outputs of the Applications system are final products that users wantand are prepared to contract commercially to a processing service bureau.The necessary Application template for an imaging spectrometer such as (butnot limited to) the CASI, takes into account the special circumstances providedby a fully calibrated spectral instrument. It integrates its output witha range of other airborne and ground based measurements and has nine maincomponents. Figure 1. Simplified Applications AreaStructure Schematic The subcomponents (primary processes) of this system have been studied ina detailed form as a cost/time and work/duration processing model throughapplications carried out by the established processing group at CSIRO DWR.That model and possible extensions based on queuing theory have been investigatedat CSIRO DWR and by CSIRO DWR's commercial product developers as part ofthe Applications model. This model has been set up to help manage and monitorthe progress of actual Applications projects. Figure 1 shows the main structureof the model: 2.1 Flight Mission (Planning and Execution) Every application will have special considerations with respect to channelschosen for targeting user needs, environmental conditions, data scale andresolution. CSIRO DWR uses a set of software items which implement the flightplanning and measurement models. These can be used to plan prior to flightsand during the mission. 2.2 Lab and Field Data Collection & Processing Some field data are collected at the time of each mission and some at othertimes. Data which must be taken at the time of flights is environmental(such as atmospheric data). Data such as characteristic spectra can be collectedat other times. Separation of field and laboratory from flying missionsis a key development in the measurement model approach being discussed here.Software to analyse the Lab and Field data for each measurement model forthe analyses have been developed to implement this area. 2.3 Base Data Processing CASI Suppliers (Itres, Canada) software is used to take image, attitude(roll and pitch) and GPS data from the aircraft and process them to calibratedand (by single run) geometrically resampled images in a form ready for imageprocessing. There is a future need to develop software to use the GPS datato more effectively and accurately model the attitude of the aircraft forIAS applications. This is under development by CSIRO DWR in combinationwith Itres and the CSIRO DWR commercial product developers. 2.4 Mosaicking and Normalisation The Base Processed airborne sensor data are assembled into mosaicks andatmospherically corrected in this component. Atmospheric correction meansthe data from different runs and times become normalised to surface reflectance.Only real differences in surface reflectance are left. At the heart of thisprocess is an integrated spectral and geometric model for the data. Thismodel is also the basis for fusion of the data with other data types - suchas satellite data, other airborne data and GIS data at various scales. 2.5 Image Processing The necessary functions of the image processing system can be fully describedby function rather than by options in any single image processing system.At present, microBRIAN (MPA and CSIRO developed software) is being usedfor the CASI based prototype Projects. The use of this specific softwarefor an advanced IAS is sufficient but not necessary. CSIRO DWR supervisingsoftware exists for the current system which makes processing tasks quickerand minimises operator action. 2.6 Measurement Models The primary taxonomy of 'applications' from the Application system pointof view is by measurement model. At present there are an atmospheric andsix main surface measurement models: n water bodies and water covered targets (eg sea grass, reefs, water quality) n dense woody vegetation (eg forests & mangroves) n open forests & woodlands (eg woody weeds) n short grass and crops (eg crops and grasslands) n bare targets (eg soils) n (modulated by) flat and sloping ground effects The measurement models provide the link between the parameters of interestand concern to the user and those of direct significance in forming thesignal measured by the instrument. The CASI measures radiance in the visibleand near infrared so that CASI measurement models involve primarily radiativetransfer and scattering in the surface layer and atmosphere. However, userswant to know parameters of the surface such as canopy cover and structure,soil moisture, water use, levels of phytoplankton in water bodies, benthiccommunity type or suspended sediments concentration. The measurement modelsprovide the scale and physical basis for these transfers from CASI datato the information required by the end user. 2.7 Measurement Model Knowledge Base This area includes a Spectral Library and associated environmental information.The data structure and methodology for the Spectral Data Base has been developedat CSIRO DWR. The Measurement Model Knowledge Base, together with softwarecalled the 'Data Calculator', form base tools for the measurement modelsand applications. In particular, a spectral library is a primary tool fortemplate matching and data modelling. 2.8 GIS Integration The system needs two-way access to GIS data and tools. The image processingcomponent must also have adequate data integration tools to do this. Currently,CASI based Projects interface to ArcInfo and GRASS. This component can,however, be any adequate commercial GIS system. There is benefit in it beingoff-the-shelf. In land operations, this area of the Applications Model mustalso provide the best current DTM system data as well as cadastral information. 2.9 Interpretation Interpretation is the action of merging the information and products ofmodelling and image processing to derive the final products in the termsthe end user needs. It involves skilled and experienced scientists labellingclasses, attaching numerical levels and statistics and generating keys andsummaries. The interpretation depends on the Application and on the typeof models that have been employed. This area is a key component in the Applicationsbased approach and the accumulated experience here will grow as an assetof any commercial implementation of the model. Final results will normallybe included in a developing GIS and build a base of decision support forfuture missions to use. 2.10 Applications Products This area involves Report Generation, product generation and annotationand product delivery and presentation. This area can use existing hardwareand software, the tools in the Image Processing System and the GIS systemas well as new software. In the current CASI based prototype, most of thesefunctions are provided by the microBRIAN image processing system, CorelDrawand standard publication tools such as Microsoft Word, Chartist and MathType. We can itemise the current set of specialised product areas for the Applicationsunder five headings. These are: Coastal zone monitoring and mapping Reef and seagrass mapping and monitoring Water quality mapping and monitoring Forest monitoring and mapping Plant community determination and monitoring. 3. IMPLEMENTATION In projects undertaken at CSIRO DWR, the system described above has beenimplemented by a well equipped and trained team of remote sensing specialists.The cost structures have been analysed as well as processing managementand potential efficiencies identified. There is now a very good processingmanagement and planning model which can be keyed into a commercial businessplan to provide effective commercial planning and management. This establishedteam and its commercial product developers are equipped to work togetherwith other service groups throughout our region. The current systems implementation and structure is under review with thecommercial product developers and has a number of efficiency and throughputgoals which will improve commercial operations.

THE ISSUE OF STANDARDS IN AVHRR DATA USE From the scientific viewpoint, there has been a significant progressionfrom the type of research paper presented in the inaugural ARSC1 in 1979to the present ARSC8 in 1996. The mass centre of such presentations hasmoved from descriptive work through exploratory research to a point whereadvanced measurement based models are being effectively used with remotelysensed data and widely reported. Remote Sensing is truly becoming a measurementbased activity. Among the international scientific community this progressis well in train as you will hear from a number of the scientists speakingtoday. However, at the user end, is there evidence of as much progress? If thereis, then it would be seen in a progression from the research question of"What might AVHRR do for me?" to the operational issueof "What does AVHRR do for me?". This last question involvesthe development of well defined products and standards as well as well establishedmethods for creating products of value to specific end users. This is notso much an issue for research as for specification. Nevertheless, researchers cannot ignore the issue of standards. Standardsare needed if the AVHRR user industry is to leave R&D 'school' and jointhe much more engineering oriented 'workplace'. Engineering based standardsdefine what levels of processed data product are needed and what methodsof value added processing ensure a product with a guaranteed accuracy orutility can be delivered. Such standard specifications are needed to protectdata and product suppliers and users. They are also essential tools withwhich end users can cost the use of remotely sensed data and value addinginto major projects. I claim that the lack of these is the biggest hurdleto acceptance of our efforts at this time and more vital to us than theneed to do more advanced research. Ideally, standard data products, data processing and interpretation methodsshould be: specifiable repeatable consistent testable by well defined measures, and [not data or situation dependent] The last of these is desirable rather than essential. The standard procedures with such characteristics that are needed in ourindustry are also of two basic kinds. The first is for data delivery suchas from an operational receiving station. These are typically set in a 'Levels'framework and for each level there are a set of specifications and measuresof performance. Perhaps these are not as well developed and consistentlydeliverable in Australia as they should be. The second are for value addedproducts. These may need manuals of standard practice which, if followed,provide products of a proven standard. Of course, the standard may seemquite low to many scientists but I believe the current lack of them is causingproblems for researchers and users alike.

ATMOSPHERIC & SCENE BRIGHTNESS VARIATIONS Optical, shortwave and thermal image data from airborne and satellite platformshave varying degrees of angle dependent brightness variation which changewith the sun position, atmospheric conditions, land surface type and sensorcharacteristics. If left uncorrected, these broad level variations can makeit difficult to use the data with standard image processing and interpretationmethods. For example, a Daedalus airborne scanner has a scan angle of ±38°and if flown with the sun at an azimuth away from 'in front' or 'behind'(i.e. away from the Principal Plane) this will result in significant imagebrightness variations created by the atmospheric component phase functionsand any surface angle dependent reflectance effects. The reflectance functiondescribing the surface effects is the Bi-Directional Reflectance DistributionFunction, or BRDF. These atmospheric and surface effects are present inall satellite data as well as aerial photography and video data to a greateror lesser degree depending on the variation in the phase angle between thesun, target and sensor among the pixels in the resulting image. Topographyenters into the equation in a way that depends on scale (or pixel size)leading to quite complex variations in an image being scanned as illustratedin Figure 1 even if the surface type werehomogeneous. The atmosphere contributes to the total effect partly due to the varyingpath length at different parts of the scan and partly to the atmosphericscattering phase variation described by the composite phase function ofthe atmospheric constituents. This describes the way radiation is scatteredout of a volume relative to the direction it enters. In optical remote sensing,air molecules and aerosols account for much of the scattering and the effectsare greatest at shorter wavelengths. Hence, if the aerosol atmospheric turbidityis high, the atmospheric brightening in (say) the blue-green will be visibleand significant in most remotely sensed data. In the thermal bands, theangular variation is almost all due to the changing path length and themajor atmospheric effect is due to water vapour on the path. The land surface contributes to the broad level brightness variations commonto all remotely sensed images. The base 'colour' and brightness is a functionof the spectral properties of the material types making up the scene (e.g.leaf reflectances and transmittances or soil grain mineralogy) plus structuraleffects which give rise to the angular variations. The angular effects canbe ascribed to three main factors - the volume effect, the occlusion (orhotspot) effect and the specular or glint effect: Volume Effect: Because of the changes in path lengths and extinctionin complex surfaces as the relative sun and look angles change, there isa volume BRDF which has some similarity to the atmospheric phase functioninduced variations. It will depend on surface structure and in vegetationit depends on factors like leaf density variations and angle distributionsas well as total leaf area. Occlusion Effect: The occlusion effect is a more specific effectinduced by the fact that the shadows cast by the sun represent parts ofthe surface that are not 'seen' by the sun. The areas that are not 'seen'by the sensor which are also not 'seen' by the sun are the common areasbetween shadow cast by the sun if it were in the two positions. The varyingoverlap induces a brightness variation as when the sun and sensor are aligned,no shadows are 'seen' and the scene seems bright and when the look angleis opposite to the sun many shadows are 'seen' leading to lower brightness. Specular (or Glint) Effect: The specular or glint effect is mostpronounced on water surfaces. It refers to the surface 'mirror' (or Fresnel)reflectance in which the radiation is usually unaltered by the surface materialfrom which it is reflected. On land surfaces it is a composite of reflectionsdiffused from facets of varying angular positions and specularity. In Australia,Eucalypt leaves are especially specularly reflective due to their waxy coating.On water, glint is probably the major component of the BRDF and the hotspoteffect does not occur. The sum of these effects in remotely sensed data is an image brightnessvariation that is a sum of the atmospheric brightness and the scene brightness.The atmospheric and surface effects also interact to provide a compositeeffect that varies with sun, target & sensor geometry. The effects aremore obvious in aerial photography and video images where the central perspectivemeans that at high sun angles the hotspot and specular points are withinthe angular radius of the frame. For airborne scanners and satellite bornescanners it is possible to avoid the brightest hotspot and glint pointsby careful consideration of the scan geometry but since the variations aresignificant for all angles the effects cannot be ignored in any image. The scene and atmospheric brightness variations are all minimised for ascanner if the sensor data are scanned at right angles to the 'principalplane'. The principal plane is the plane formed by the vectors joining theearths centre to the sensor and to the sun. For an airborne scanner, thismeans flying level, with the sun in front or behind the flight line. Ifthe hotspot or specular points need to be avoided at high sun times, thescanning sensor is sometimes tilted forward or back to ensure it. These'avoiding' strategies are not easily used with photography or video images.

APPLICATIONS DEMANDING ATTENTION Applications using images which have wide scan angles or are captured whenthe sun and observer positions are such that these angular variations aresignificant must take them into account or correct the images for them insome way. Examples are: Single scenes where classification and other image processing is predicatedon consistent values from similar target land or water types; Mosaics of images which are intended to produce a consistent compositeimage on which spectral (location independent) image processing can be done;and Multiple images, such as time series where the data must be comparedfor change in the surface that must be detectable over changes due to imagebrightness differences within and/or between images. In a sense, the objective is to ensure a spatial and temporal 'stationarity'in which a given target with given unchanging reflectance will be the sameat all locations and in all images over the time series. Obviously, thedegree to which this needs to be accomplished depends on the application,and the value of spending time and effort on image correction depends onthe value put on the final product by the client. From the economic perspective, there will always be 1. project planning and management costs; 2. image and ancillary data acquisition costs; 3. data base processing costs; 4. value adding costs; 5. data integration costs; and 6. product presentation costs. The total cost must reflect the value of the product to the end user. Ifthe emphasis is on low costs the effort justified by correcting for, orusing, effects like image brightness variations may be small. On the otherhand, if the accuracy of the product is crucial and the value of the informationis high then extra effort in correcting for image brightness may be fullyjustified. In the face of this, there are a range of approaches and methodsthat can be used to model or correct the type of brightness variations describedabove. Which among them is 'best' will depend on the application and valueof the data.

TYPOLOGY OF APPROACHES The general approach to image brightness is to 'correct' it in some way.Correction means changing a pixel spectrum so that it is what would havebeen measured if the sun and sensor geometry were a fixed standard pairrather than a varying pair of angles over the image extent. As discussedlater, this action may be valid as an average over a spatial area but canbe a difficult concept at the scale of a single tree crown or soil clump. We will outline three main approaches to scene brightness modelling and'correction'. They are the empirical methods, the measurement modellingmethods and the semi-empirical methods. 3.1 Empirical Methods Empirical methods involve fitting the variation in general brightness ascribedto the atmosphere and BRDF effects by a parametric function (using leastsquares or some other criterion) and then normalising by some combinationof additive and multiplicative image transformation. The simplest methodsinvolve fitting polynomials to average variations over scanlines or framesand subtracting or dividing out the general level to 'flatten' the data.These methods are well known and have been used with single frame photographsor scanner runs prior to other image processing operations. For mosaics, brightness normalisation has a strict analogy with geometricmosiacking where images are geometrically matched to the ground by groundcontrol points (ie GCPs) and to other images by tie points. At tie points,in geometric mosaicking, the constraint is that the same feature must belocated at the same point in the geometric frame model. In the same way,in brightness normalisation, there may be targets in some frames of knownreflectance. These are sometimes called 'invariant targets'. When theirreflectance is only assumed from previous work they are sometimes called'pseudo-invariant' targets. These are analogous to GCPs. In the overlapbetween frames, the analogy to tie points are patches or features that areassumed to have the same corrected spectra. For a given functional formof brightness model, the estimation reduces to a linear 'bundle adjustment'. The greatest problems with the simple empirical approach are image varianceand heterogeneity. It is often extremely difficult to determine which componentsof the variation are atmospheric or BRDF brightening and which are differencesin surface type. The high image spatial variance that is most obvious inhigh resolution images also makes fitting functions very difficult. Anotherproblem is to decide which effects are additive and which are multiplicative.As long as the variation is not too great, the additive approximation isnot too bad but when raw uncalibrated data are used, the interaction betweenadditive and multiplicative effects can be a problem. For example, calibration and atmospheric correction are linear effects butthe atmospheric terms are angle dependent and vary with incident () and view () directions. That is, even if the surface werelambertian (with a flat BRDF) the digital data recorded by a scanner inwaveband j () will be related to the reflectance () by: hence: where is the radiance recorded in waveband j; is the sun or 'incident' radiation direction; is the total irradiance at the target; and is the radiation scattered into the sensor from the atmosphere. The brightness variation described here (which has no surface BRDF effectin that is not dependent on sun or view angles) obviously hasboth additive and multiplicative terms which are complex functions of theincident and view angles. When the surface target itself has a strong BRDFeffect the variability will compound. In the face of this, the empirical methods are generally constrained tobe of low order functional forms that still have the structure of the variationbeing fitted. In this way, it is hoped that variance and image heterogeneityare 'orthogonal' to the function being fitted. In addition, the fittingis best done in the physical framework of the brightness variation - thatis in terms of the phase angles between sun and sensor view angle and betweensensor view angle and the specular vector. There have been many functionsof this type developed such as Walthall, Hapke, Roujean and others. Thesewill be addressed below in the section of semi-empirical methods. For the purely empirical approach and for small frames such as occur withaerial photography and video data (or even single scanner runs) the mainproblem is scene heterogeneity. There will be scene variations that occurat spatial scales near to or greater than the image and it is very difficultto separate these effects from atmospheric and broad BRDF effects. To illustratethis you can consider an image to be roughly approximated by: where is the high spatial frequency component, is the low frequencycomponent and is the angular brightness variation. In manyimages, over the extent of a single frame, the low frequency and angularcomponents are not in any way orthogonal. Hence it is near impossible toestimate the angular function from the single frame data. Moving to modelsbased on view geometry and semi-empirical functions can help (Pickup etal., 1995) but essentially some way to bring in the wider spatial contextis needed. Among empirical methods are also 'referencing' methods. In the case of imagedigitising, a reference approach is to scan an image and scan a reference(white lambertian) standard sheet with the same illumination. The imageis then 'normalised' by subtracting or dividing the reference from the imageto remove lighting based view angle effects. In reconnaissance image datathis is not possible unless a large reference target were to exist and sceneBRDF effects would still remain. Hick and Ong (Ong et al., 1995) have used a referencing method to extractbrightness variations from video frames by referencing against the backgroundof a Landsat TM image. It may be possible to fit empirical functions tothe residual between the individual frame and the reference image. In thisway, the problem of heterogeneity and correlated spatial frequencies describedabove could be reduced significantly. It is worth mentioning here that as soon as the empirical methods extendfrom simple functional forms to ones involving image and sun geometry, theprocessing methods start to become more costly. The cost is in extra workregistering images and/or in extra costs associated with collecting attitudeand position (eg INS and GPS) information for the platform. If it is worththis extra cost then it may be worth some extra modelling as discussed below.

The added value would be the link this gives to physicalmodels of the relationship between earth parameters of interest and themeasured reflectance. Obviously, a reflectance is closer to a material propertyand therefore resolves the problem of monitoring. If reference targets in the image have measured reflectances (ie the invariantor pseudo-invariant targets) it is possible to get close to reflectancesfrom the empirical approach. However, it will never be clear how much residualatmosphere and BDRF effect remains. Obviously, most natural targets chosenas 'invariant' will have some BRDF which may not be known and that effectwill be folded into the final image data. Assuming the data are accurately calibrated to radiances, there are differentways to describe the process of correction. One is as follows: An equation relating the recorded radiance sensed at altitude h above thetarget to the target reflectance factor is: where: is the radiance observed by the instrument fromaltitude h, with look (or view) direction and sun directionat wavelength ; is the effective irradiance at the target, or where: is the irradiance at the target for a 'black'earth; s is the sky hemispherical albedo; and * is the background earth albedo. is the beam transmittance through the layer between the surface andaltitude h in direction mv; is the target directional reflectance factor; is the environmental reflectance due to the background albedo or: is the diffuse transmittance for a layer of thickness h and for initialbeam direction mv. is the path radiance of light which did not interact with the surface;and is the glint term that is most significantly present over water coveredtargets and is sometimes present over land targets. If the atmosphere is characterised then it is possible to retrieve the directionalreflectance factor () for each pixel. This term needs careful definitionas there are many different types of 'reflectance' used. The directional reflectance factor () as used here is defined as: in which the irradiance () is the sum of diffuse and directterms and the fraction of diffuse (fd) is included as a parameter. The assumptionthat the irradiance can be characterised in this context by the sun positionand the fraction of diffuse radiation is one that needs evaluation. Thevalue of using this form of reflectance is that it corresponds to what ismeasured in the field using an irradiance radiometer or a reference standard. The physical approach depends on two steps. The first is to determine thisreflectance factor for a surface by atmospheric correction. In atmosphericcorrection, the atmospheric terms are modelled and measured from image andancillary data. The reflectance factor in an image may be obtained iterativelyif the atmospheric turbidity makes the adjacency and other atmosphere/surfaceinteractions significant. The second step is to normalise the reflectancefactor in some way to account for its BRDF variation. In order to go from the reflectance factor to such a corrected value, however,we effectively need to assume that: where is the angular variation function that is assumed tocharacterise the land surface type and be normalised to 1.0 at a referencepair of sun and view angles and standard atmosphere. Then 'corrected' dataare reachable as: The value of getting to this point is that both and can be interfacedwith radiative transfer models to obtain parameters for the earth's surfaceby inversion. The inversion may be simple (such as end member methods) orsophisticated (such as complete nonlinear modelling). This physical approach is obviously highly sophisticated but demands a levelof data quality and time in value adding that sometimes cannot economicallybe committed. However, if the end products are of high information valueand valued by the client it is clearly an approach that could be pursued.

Among the many models for the volume effect are the Suits and Sail modelsas well as many more sophisticated ones such as the hotspot based modeldescribed (as an example) in Qin and Jupp (1993). The literature is vast(Myneni and Ross, 1990 provides a very good review although it is becomingdated!). The hotspot effect is a geometric or occlusion effect and from among themany papers that exist describing it the following text has been editiedand extracted from Jupp and Walker (1996). "A simple model for the remote sensing of a canopy is the GeometricOptical (GO) model. The simple GO (or hotspot) model for scenes which describeopen forest or woodland areas is based on the one described in Jupp et al.(1986), Strahler and Jupp (1991a&b) and Li and Strahler (1992). In thismodel, there are four kinds of ground cover 'visible' from a given direction.These are referred to as scene components and consist of sunlit canopy (symbolsc), shaded canopy (shc), sunlit background (sb), and shaded background(shb). Each component is assumed to have a characteristic radiance and theradiance of a pixel is modelled as the area weighted combination (or linearmixture) of the characteristic component radiances. That is, the observedradiance of a single pixel (rs) is modelled as: where the subscripts sc, shc, sb, and shb indicate the radiances of thefour components as named above, Rj represents the (mean) radiance of component'j' and k indicates the sensed proportion of each component within the pixelfrom the given view direction. The mean radiance over the scene (Rs), assuming the view and sun directionsare constant, can be written as: where, capital Kj represents the mean or expected value of the varyingproportions kj over the scene for j as the components sc, shc, sb or shb.The mean value (Rs), as a function of sun and observer position, definesthe BRDF of the scene. In order for the scene BRDF model to be computed, a description of the sizeand shapes of the objects, their density and how they are distributed overthe background is needed and the geometrical relationships between the objectsand the expected values of the four components must be established. Juppet al. (1986), Strahler and Jupp (1991a&b) and Li and Strahler (1992)describe such a model for spheroidal crown (not necessarily opaque) volumeswhich is valid for any view or illumination angles using the 'Boolean' modelof Serra (1982). In the Boolean model, the object 'centres' are assumedto be randomly distributed in a 'Poisson' distribution. By defining thegeometry and the distributions, expressions for Kj may be derived. Strahlerand Jupp (1991a&b) use a simple model for spheroids which is adequatefor moderate sun and view zenith angles and Li and Strahler (1992) providesome more general alternative models for resolving the Kj. These basic sceneBRDF models are quite simple and are easily implemented in various formssuch as mathematical packages or spreadsheets. In the woodlands and open forest areas typical of the area of Australiawhere the model studies have been made, the pixel to pixel behaviour ofthe image is conveniently (if not as accurately) described by a simplerform of the model in which the shaded background, sunlit (but still relativelydark) tree and shaded tree components are combined into one so that: where X is a composite component combining sunlit and shaded tree andshaded background and RX. is computed as: The simpler model has the advantage for this discussion that it showsclearly how, in many woodlands, the image pixel to pixel variation is drivenprimarily by the variation in the proportion of sunlit background whichis visible in the pixels and the contrast between this sunlit backgroundand the other components. It also provides a simple estimate for ksb fromimages where Rsb and RX are known for an appropriate image channel, or channelcombination, as: For such a model, the mean radiance (ie BRDF) over all pixels in a patchwith the same basic underlying type of cover and structure is therefore: where Ksb is the mean value of ksb, or the expected proportion of visiblesunlit background for the particular sun and view positions. Figure 2. DATM Hotspot effect and models This simple model has been found to be adequate to describe the dataobtained by a Daedalus scanner over woodlands, Figure 2 shows the data averagedover many scanlines for the aircraft scanning in and across the principalplane. The models shown vary the ratio of tree crown diameter to tree height.As can be seen, the models are very sensitive to this ratio which has beenindependently confirmed at the site by ground measurements. Linear end-member analysis is similar to the estimation of components describedabove. It has been the subject of useful research and application in Australia(Pech et al. 1986, Pickup and Foran 1987) and at regional scales where allpixels are mixtures of land covers of interest (Cross et al., 1991). End-memberanalysis assumes each pixel to be a composition, or mixing, of a few basecomponents or 'end-members'. The pixel signature is assumed to be a linearsum of reflectances from each of n end-members weighted in proportion toits cover (kj) in the pixel: End-member analysis seeks to invert this mixing by deriving the proportions(kj) of each component in the pixel signature. This can feasibly be derivedfrom the remotely sensed data provided that if there are n components (trees,shrubs, grass etc) then there are at least (n-1) channels of data that separatethe end-members spectrally. The key assumptions built into the end-membermethod are that: a) The end-members (pure examples of total cover by trees, shrubs,grass and background) are spectrally consistent between sites and b) Reflectance values for end members (Rj) are available from remotely senseddata or can be accurately derived by other means (such as field spectralmeasurements). There has been considerable work aimed at deriving end-members from thedata (a form of principal components analysis, see Boardman, 1990) and employinghigh spectral resolution data to effect separation of more than a few components(Adams et al., 1989). However, with a lack of available high resolutionspectral data, this linear approach suffers from several significant limitationsto its applicability in Australia: 1. Available broad band signatures of the tree and shrub crownsover much of Australia whilst different, are not markedly spectrally distinct. 2. Even if spectrally distinct crowns did exist for the available bands,their distinction is confounded by the effects of shadowing within crownsand cast shadow on the background (with bigger plants shading smaller plants).This makes the signature of the end-members difficult to estimate as thesignature depends on the proportions of crowns and shadows present and variationsin sun and look angles. 3. Relatively low covers of trees and shrubs, together with shadowing, introducesuch high spectral variance into the data relative to the spectral contrastsbetween end-members that the numerical methods used in the end member analysisbecome highly unstable. Shadow effects obviously depend primarily on the sun angle. Although thecrown cover is the same, lower sun angles clearly decrease image brightness.Differences due to shadowing can be taken into account in end-member analysis,provided the end-member values are recalculated for each temporal imageand one or more components labelled 'shade' are added to the list. However,its successful application still depends on an assumption of linear scalingalong cover gradients due to sun positional and sensor view angle changes.These assumptions in practice are erroneous in structured vegetation (e.g.vegetation with discontinuous cover of trees or shrubs), and this limitsthe application of such methods to general synoptic estimates of changein cover. It is therefore better to model vegetation cover directly as an assemblageof various sizes and shapes of 3-dimensional objects (trees, shrubs, grasstussocks, herbs, etc.) scattered on a background that may be uniform orheterogeneous (Li and Strahler 1985, Jupp et al. 1986). The GO model maythen be used to model the bidirectional reflectance of the canopies. Inthis approach, the effects due to shadowing on the overall reflectance (orinfrared temperature) from a scene become important and useful featuresand the correlated interactions between shaded and sunlit components arebuilt into the analysis - although it now becomes nonlinear. The directionalradiance of the vegetation is then a mixture of four components (sunlitand shaded tree crowns, and sunlit and shaded backgrounds) that is seenfrom a given viewing angle. The areal proportions of these four components,for given illumination and viewing directions (which can be off-nadir),will be a function of the sizes, shapes, orientations and placements ofthe objects (i.e. individual plants) within the scenes. A GO model is most appropriate to woodlands or vegetation in which the vegetativecover is discontinuous, that is, where tree and shadowed background interactionsaccount for a large proportion of the variance in the image. The furtheradvantage of these models is that they are also potentially invertible toprovide structural as well as cover information. The invertibility of GOmodels was demonstrated by Strahler et al. (1988), Franklin and Strahler(1988) and Wu and Strahler (1993) in which tree size and density were estimatedfrom reflectance data. When size, shape and orientation are fixed or characterisedby distributions of known parameters, and the object centres are randomlydistributed, then the proportions of the four components can be estimatedusing the Boolean model of Serra (1982). This GO model is termed the Booleanversion (Strahler and Jupp, 1991a&b; Li and Strahler, 1992). It accountsfor the changes in proportions that occur with random overlapping objectsas the density of objects increases and can easily model scale effects andchanging sun and view directions. The GO aspect of the model implies thatmultiple scattering of radiation in the vegetation layer is neglected. Whilethe evidence of our eyes supports this, there are wavelengths (in particularthe near infrared) where multiple scattering is very significant. This hasbeen recently addressed by Li et al. (1995)."

They offer the means of using the mosaic approach and 'empirical'model fitting but also enable surface parameters to be extracted. The methodsare called 'semi-empirical' because they generally assume atmospheric correctioncan be done and also often have forms that involve earth surface parameters.The main class of these models is that of the 'kernel' models. The following text describing the kernel approach was extracted from theMODIS-Land ATBD (Strahler et al., 1995; or at the following web site: http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/modistables.html). 3.3.1 Theoretical Description Kernel-driven models for the bidirectional reflectance distribution functionof vegetated land surfaces attempt to describe the BRDF as a linear superpositionof a set of kernels that describe basic BRDF shapes, with the coefficientsor weights chosen to adapt the sum of the kernels to the given case. Typically,semiempirical kernels are based either on one of several possible approximationsto a radiative transfer scenario of light scattering in a horizontally homogeneousplant canopy (e.g., a crop canopy), or on one of several approximationsfeasible in a geometric-optical model of light scattering from a surfacecovered with vertical projections that cast shadows (e.g., a forest canopy).Deriving a kernel of this nature requires simplifying and manipulating amodel for the BRDF until it reaches the form: in which k is a function only of view and illumination geometry, c1 andc2 are constants containing physical parameters, and R is the modeled valueof the true BRDF, . Semiempirical kernels can be of two types. First, they may contain onlygeometric terms, but no physical parameters. The complete model then islinear, and may be scaled to arbitrary scales even for mixed scenes; neglectingadjacency effects, the weights of the kernels will be linear functions ofthe areal proportions of the subpixel weights. The so-called Ross-kernels,which are approximations to the radiative transfer theory in plant canopiesof Ross (1981) described below, belong to this class, as does the so-calledRoujean geometric-optical kernel (Roujean et al., 1992). In the second case,kernels contain one or very few physical parameters and thus instead ofhaving one kernel, provide a family of kernels depending on these parameters.The geometric-optical Li-kernels (Wanner et al., 1995) belong to this type.In order to reduce them to the form given in (5), the kernel-internal parametersare fixed to a selection of a few values each. The following discussionpresents each of the kernels used in the BRDF/Albedo algorithm. For morecomplete information on the theory and derivation of the kernels, see Wanneret al. (1995).

(1992).It is based on an approximation for large LAI values: In the kernel, and are zenith angles forillumination and view, respectively; is the relative azimuthof illumination and view directions; and is the phase angleof scattering, . In the constants, s is leaf reflectance (= leaf transmittance; is the (assumed isotropic) surface reflectance of the soil or understory;LAI is the leaf area index; and B is the average of secantsof possible view and illumination zenith angles. For this formulation, aspherical leaf angle distribution is assumed. The Ross-thin kernel simplifies Ross's equation based on an approximationfor small LAI values: Although this kernel applies primarily to the case of a thin canopy ofscatterers over a uniform background, it can also be appropriate for a verydense, uniform canopy of high leaf area, since in that case the leaf layersbelow the uppermost can act like a uniform background (Strahler et al.,1995). The derivation of the Roujean geometric-optical kernel is presented in theappendix to the paper of Roujean et al. (1992). The kernel may be regardedas accounting for the scattering of a random arrangement of three-dimensionalrectangular solids ("bricks") with isotropic scattering surfaces.Shadows are taken as perfectly black. Mutual shadowing, in which the shadowof one object falls on another object, is not taken into account. The bricksare long with respect to their height h and width b. The kernelis: The Li kernels are derived from the modeling approach of Li and Strahler(1986, 1992). In this approach, the surface is taken as covered by randomly-placedprojections (e.g., tree crowns) that are taken to be spheroidal in shapeand centered randomly within a layer above the surface. The BRDF is modeledas a function of the relative areas of sunlit and shaded, crown and backgroundthat are visible from the viewing position in the hemisphere. For the Li-sparsekernel, it is assumed that shaded crown and shaded background are black,and that sunlit crown and background are equally bright. Under these circumstances,and with some further approximations in the way that view and illuminationshadows overlap, the Li-sparse kernel is: where In these expressions, b is the vertical radius of the spheroid;r is the horizontal radius of the spheroid; and h is the heightof the center of the spheroid. For this model, Here, C is the brightness of sunlit surface, and is the count densityof spheroids (number of spheroids per unit area). The Li-dense kernel differs from the Li-sparse kernel in that it accommodatesmutual shadowing. It assumes a random distribution of crown heights to maximizethe geometric-optical effect in a dense ensemble of canopies. These kernels are not yet linear in that they still contain two parameters,namely the ratios b/r and h/b , describing crown shape andrelative height. The kernels therefore actually represent two families ofkernels, governed by the values of these two internal parameters. For thepresent, we provide two choices for each parameter, thus providing fourkernels within each family. For the b/r ratio, the values 2.5 (prolateshape) and 0.75 (oblate shape) are used; for h/b the ratio, we usevalues of 2.5 (tall) and 1.5 (short).

Most suitably it has the form which is derived from adding appropriate choices of geometric-opticalsurface-scattering and radiative-transfer volume-scattering kernels, eachmultiplied by a proportion or that weights thecontribution of each model. These proportions may be regarded as the arealproportions of land cover types exhibiting each type of scattering (neglectingmultiple scattering between the two components), or as mixing proportionsfor land cover types that display both a volume-scattering and a geometric-opticalcontribution to the BRDF. The quantities kgeo and kvol arethe respective kernels; the factors fgeo and fvol are theirrespective weights; and the term fiso is the isotropic contribution.Using the kernels presented above, there will be two choices for kvoland three for kgeo, providing six possible models (disregarding herethe four sets of internal parameters used for the Li kernels). The formulaefor fiso, fgeo, and fvol are shown in Table4. In the inversion and fitting of a semiempirical model to data, estimatesof the weights f are retrieved from bidirectional reflectances andspecification of viewing and illumination positions. Although this objectivesatisfies many of the goals of the BRDF/Albedo product, the existence offormulae for the weights f in terms of physical parameters couldprovide for direct inference of physical parameters from the weight valuesfitted (see Section 3.3.5). This possibilitywill be explored in the postlaunch phase as a research topic. 3.3.4 The Modified Walthall Model Empirical models can be understood as being of the kernel-driven model typeas well, where the kernels are empirical functions. An example is the modifiedWalthall model, derived by Walthall et al. (1985) and improved by Nilsonand Kuusk (1989). It has the form Note that this is the same form as the semiempirical models discussedabove-it is comprised of a weighted superposition of functions of angles,and the weights are the parameters of the model. As a consequence,models like the modified Walthall model can be processed along with linearsemiempirical models by the same linear inversion scheme. 3.3.5 Advantages of Linear Models Linear models have a number of advantages in the context of global dataprocessing. Linearity in BRDF models is comprehensively discussed by Lewis(in preparation) and demonstrated with the modified Walthall model. A firstadvantage is that any linear model can be inverted analytically throughmatrix inversion for the system of equations obtained by setting the derivativeof the error function to zero (see Section3.2.1). This provides direct estimates of the parameters fiso, fgeoand fvol while avoiding numerical inversion problems. Second, both the directional-hemispherical and bihemispherical integralsof the BRDF (black-sky and white-sky albedos) may be precalculated for eachkernel individually. The albedo of a model then is simply the sum of thekernel albedos, weighted by f values. By using a look-up table, numericalintegration of the models can thus be avoided. Third, linear BRDF models scale linearly in space if adjacency effects areassumed to be small. This allows for mixed pixel cases, as indicated bythe areal proportion parameter in the model factors listedabove. This feature also allows scaling BRDF and albedo from one spatialresolution up to a coarser one, e.g., to a particular resolution neededfor a climate model. Finally, since some of the parameters driving the modelsare dependent on wavelength while others are not (e.g., structural parameters),it may be possible to extract all or some of them from multiband analysis,making assumptions about the others.

THE ISSUE OF SCALE The BRDF models mentioned above and used to develop the kernels are general'average' scene models that apply to spatially averaged data over homogeneoustarget areas. They do not model the image variance (which is also angledependent) nor do they apply to a single object in a scene. The BRDF ofa single tree is different from that of a stand of trees and the BRDF ofa stand of trees is different from that of an open soil area. Scaling affects the basis for image stratification. The tree and gap structureat one scale provides different functions for a stand and bare area delineation.At a broad scale, the composite of tree and gap merges into stands and atanother stands and clearings merge in a 'woodland' category. At each level,th BRDF of the separated components will be different from each other andthe composite land cover. This leads to the consideration of some issues most important in an approachto correcting high resolution images for BRDF effects. The atmospheric effectis very smooth having been 'filtered' by an MTF with a size of about 200metres in most cases. However, the BRDF is highly variable. Consider a photographwith a wide field of view and the solar hotspot near to its centre. A treenear the nadir view and a similar one near the edge will have differentbrightnesses but the difference will not be as great as the overall brighteningdue to volume and hotspot effects. In particular, there will be much moreshadow at the edges reached away from the hotspot direction and path lengthsfor volume scattering will be longer through the canopy than at the geometriccentre of the frame. The 'colour' of shadow near the edges will also beslightly darker than at the nadir but not very different. In this case,applying an overall BRDF correction function will tend to change the colourof shadows and tree crowns at the edge in a way that may be quite wrong- even though the overall area average may be 'balanced'. Obviously, whatworks at one scale may not help at another. Even if an H-resolution (high resolution) approach is taken in which theBRDF of the objects is modelled (trees for example), the fact will stillbe that the image contains different geometric proportions of scene objectsand components in a way that depends on the phase angles between the sun,the target object(s) and the view. Perhaps the only perfect way to resolvethe issue is by 3D stereo modelling. This is unlikely to be cost-effectivewith video or digitised aerial photograph data.

SCOPE FOR AN EOC WORKING GROUP A Working Group is defined as described in the following (edited) excerptfrom the EOC Science Plan: "An EOC Working Group is the essential initial step in developing genericTasks from the applications oriented Threads and is the entry point forall approved Tasks. The results of the Working Groups form the basis forpriority setting. Working Groups identify and help rank issues and (followingprioritisation) lead to the selected focus activities of the EOC. Theseare Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. Science Projects resolvethe scientific issues and publish results. Implementation Teams may takethe results from the Science Project and implement then (for example) assoftware or develop a technology transfer strategy. The outcomes of thescience teams will be formal scientific publications but those of the implementationteams may not be. For example, Implementation Teams may involve commercialsoftware houses working with scientists to provide products that are documented,quality controlled and work correctly. The Working Groups offer an opportunity for scientists in different Divisions,the EOC and from other groups to develop collaboration and locate majorcentres of expertise and interest. The projects selected will seek the bestteams and be subject to approval in competition with other Working Groupoutcomes. The priority setting and approval process for the Science Projectsand Implementation Teams that arise from this activity will be explicitand include specific identification of deliverables and milestones. Whilethe EOC has a central location in Canberra where a critical mass of scientistswill tackle generic science issues and algorithm development, locationsof EOC project and implementation activities can also be decided by infrastructureand core staff locations and be potentially at any location with adequateresearch support among CSIRO sites. The key characteristics of EOC projectsare collocation of scientists, efficient use of resources, inter-Divisionalcollaboration, support for the goals of the EOC and a generic Earth ObservationScience focus that provides support across different applications and/orinvolves a range of tools. Science Projects and Implementation Teams will be formed according to specificguide-lines and will be monitored for progress within the EOC structureand evaluated against criteria defined at the outset of the activity. Theoutcomes of an EOC Task will emphasise quality of product and excellenceof production. A primary role of and criterion for EOC activities includesmaking the findings accessible and useful to areas of CSIRO and industrynot currently exploiting Earth Observation to its fullest extent." A Scene Brightness Working Group needs to consider these as guidelines anddevelop Science Project(s) and/or Implementation Team(s) to resolve issuesidentified. In particular, the WG will need to establish effective datasets to provide objective tests of the methods and allocate cases whereonly empirical models and field measurements are appropriate and those wheremeasurement models are appropriate to the teams. Standard data sets thatare needed to evaluate the alternative models must be carefully consideredas well the end uses and the means to evaluate methods against the valueof the product. The best methods could be implemented in software by an implementation team.During development and testing a standard language such as IDL could beused for easy exchange. Other than such general statements as these, aninitial meeting is needed to plan actions and delineate the scopes of theWorking Group and expected times until when Project objectives are in place.

The multispectral mode uses three bands (green, 0.50&shyp;0.59 micron; red,0.61&shyp;0.68 micron; and near infrared, 0.79 to 0.89 micron), each withits own reflectance properties, to create coloured images. Numerous landscapefeatures can be interpreted from the composite images. Images are split at the telescope's focal plane. Part of the image is sentto a line of 6000 photodetectors which emit electrical charges when struckby light. These build the panchromatic image. Each detector correspondsto 10 m pixels, giving images 60 km wide. Images are constructed line byline as the satellite moves. The rest of the image goes to a dichroic beam splitter. This glass devicedirects each band to another detector strip. But these detectors receiveinsufficient light to fire, so Charged Coupled Devices generate a signalfrom two adjacent detectors, hence multispectral mode's 20 m colour resolution. SPOT encodes the images for transmission to Earth. The satellite may downloadthe image to a Direct Receiving Station in real time if within range, otherwisethe image is recorded and downloaded later. SPOT can observe the same zone from different angles over a number of orbits. Images of large areas may be built up over several passes. Captured images must be preprocessed: corrected for perspective and atmosphericdistortion. Images at various levels of preprocessing are available forpurchase. Higher levels provide precise geometric alignment with groundcheckpoints and existing maps, in addition to the corrections for viewingangle, reflectance characteristics and detector sensitivity offered at lowerlevels. SPOT''s sideways viewing allows capture of images of the same site takenfrom different angles, using parallax to create stereopairs. These are usedfor stereoplotting, topographic mapping, and automatic stereocorrelation,from which Digital Elevation Models (3D computer landscape images) can bederived. Processed images, typically 30&shyp;100 Mb, are available on CD ROM, magnetictape or printed form. These diagrams show the types of observation possible using SPOT's two HighResolution Visual (HRV) scanners.

SPOT satellites orbit in a polar, sun-synchronous circle; they maintainthe same angle to the sun above any given ground point. Passing overheadat the same local time each day, SPOT satellites always see ground sitesin the same conditions of light and shade, allowing comparison of subsequentimages. SPOT overflies every point on the Earth's surface at least every 26 days,but can resample locations more often, utilising the telescopes' sidewaysviewing ability (SPOT Images). Resample frequencyvaries with latitude: at the equator, a given area can be imaged 7 timesduring the 26 day cycle; sites at latitude 45° can be imaged 11 times. All SPOT satellites are in the same orbit, though in different phases, sothey can be tracked and monitored in sequence by the same network of groundstations. SPOT carries two identical HRV (High Resolution Visible) instruments, eachattached to telescopes capable of 770,000x magnification. Mirrors at themouths of each telescope swivel according to programmed ground instructions,giving viewing angles of 27 from the vertical, and a 950 km viewing windoweach orbit.

However, for the general public, biodiversity has come to assumea focus, a banner, for political action. Biodiversity is replacingthe older watchwords of conservation, preservation, environment,and natural heritage that gave meaning to widespread concern overthe consequences of our way of life. The cumulative consequences of our national economic activitiesand value systems have resulted in widespread decline in the abundanceand range of many organisms, with the extinction of a smallerbut appreciable number of species that were present two centuriesago; eg Saunders et al (in preparation), Short and Smith (1994). Biodiversity is valued by Australian society for many reasons.The three reasons most often cited are that biodiversity providesa sense of unique national identity, place and responsibility;it offers significant potential economic benefits if exploitedin a sustainable way; and, irrespective of its value to society,it has an intrinsic right to exist; eg Biodiversity Unit (1993). We offer no judgement on any of these three viewpoints other thanto summarise that for contemporary Australian society, biodiversityis perceived to be a significant component of the individual andcollective quality of life. Biodiversity matters to us; eg Cocks (1992). As public and scientific interest in biodiversity has grown, soalso have the number of definitions and descriptions. We do notintend to add to these but rather to link two emphases that characterisethe perspective of biodiversity that underpinned this project. The first emphasis was that biodiversity includes all species:plants and animals, both common and rare. This emphasis was anecessary alternative to the more restricted and unfortunatelycommon view that biodiversity is only about rare animals, andthat plants are just habitat for fauna. Every organism captured in this image is a component of Australia'sbiodiversity - not just the bird in centre frame. The second emphasis was on the direction and rate of change inthe size of the species pool. This was the operational theme andprincipal focus of this project; not on inventory and not on determiningthe biodiversity complement. Furthermore, it is the consensusview that the predominant direction of that change, however poorlyquantified, is negative. That is, we currently preside over asituation of general loss of biodiversity, with the rates of lossranging from very slight to rapid depending on circumstance; egMoritz and Kikkawa (1994), Saunders, Hopkins, and How (1990).This situation is not unique to Australia; eg Hannah et al (1994, 1995). To stress the emphasis on rate of change of biodiversity awayfrom biodiversity itself, we use the terms biotic impoverishmentor biotic erosion to capture the process of species diminutionand extinction. Biotic erosion is evocative as both a metaphor and an analoguebecause species extinction was often unspectacular and delayedin time but nonetheless relentless and irreversible; eg Bridgewater (1994), Recher (1994), Recher and Lim (1992).An emphasis on biotic erosion was operational because it is nowpublic policy to manage the loss of biodiversity by detectingit, and where possible, preventing, slowing or and reversing thatdecline.

Itis a way of thinking about vegetation and soils on very broadlandscape scales. The use of the term landcover implies the spatial scales of landscapesand regions, ie areas of tens to hundreds of square kilometres.It is very different from the human-scaled experience of vegetationpatches that can be measured in tens to hundreds of square metres.The domain of this project was the entire continent, 7, 692, 000km2. Therefore, equivalently large sample sizes were used to characteriselandcover and its disturbance status. Most figures quoted in thisreport are in thousands of square kilometres: we focus on theoverall view. Using the above definition, landcover plus fauna represents thetotal biodiversity complement, or the terrestrial component ofthe global biosphere. Because vegetation is the largest and mostobvious (above ground) component of the biodiversity complementof any landscape, it is far easier to detect, quantify and interpretchanges in vegetation than it is for fauna. Therefore, given robust relationships between vegetation, soiland fauna, changes in vegetation were used to infer changes inthe other two. The remainder of this section pursues the consequencesof this proposition: what are the relationships between landcoverand fauna, and how can landcover be used to stratify the continent? A landscape view of three possible landcover changes. The undisturbedlandscape (background) is progressively modified by vegetationchange (midground), and then by soil change (foreground). The concepts of habitat and ecosystem are central to modern ecologicaltheory and conservation management practice. However, they areconcepts, and thus abstractions. An ecosystem can be all the rainforestsof North Queensland or just a single decaying leaf. The term ecosystembecomes tangible only when it is spatially defined. For example,it is equally legitimate to define and discuss the spinifex ecosystemof Central Australia that extends over millions of square kilometresas it is to focus on just the mangroves of Moreton Bay. Ecosystemshave no implicit spatial scales; they are explicitly and externallydefined. Habitat is a similarly ill-defined and ill-used word, especiallybetween scientific disciplines. To animal ecologists, plants arehabitat. Conversely plant ecologists routinely ignore animalsas part of a plant's habitat; eg Bell et al (1991).In this project, habitat was simply taken to be a particular landcovertype with the co-location and implied interaction of plants andanimals over landscape scales; ie over areas of size 10-100 km2. Thus, we have made habitat and ecosystems tangible by equatingthem to landcover at landscape scales. At the level of generalisationused in this study, a particular landcover type and its associatedfauna was equated to an ecosystem. Similarly, the type and conditionof one particular landcover was equated to a habitat. We recognisethat this equivalence requires quantitative biological understandingover landscape scales that is currently absent; eg Pressey and Logan (1994).Therefore, we have continued with qualitative relations alone. An agricultural landcover type captured at landscape scale.This is a widespread (eco)system in southern Australia and containsthe habitats of a diverse range of native and exotic species.The total area visible in this scene represents but a few samplepoints in a continental survey. How then to progress with a continental overview? We proceed on the basis of this qualitative argument. Given that we have made the abstraction of biodiversity tangibleand operational by focusing on its loss, biotic erosion, ratherthan the absolute, and made habitat tangible by equating it tolandcover types at landscape scales, it follows then that disturbedlandcover represents a change in habitat structure, compositionand function, and thus in habitat suitability. Detrimental change in habitat suitability, ie a deleterious changein structure, composition and functioning, will result, over time,in the decline of species abundance and richness, or ultimatelyin local or global extinction; eg Recher (1994). Three qualifications to this argument are necessary. The firstis that disturbance as used here is restricted to that which isanthropogenic; ie that imposed on the natural or background disturbanceof climate (wet or dry periods) or weather events (wildfire, storm)and is traceable to human action collectively called landuse.Landcover can be disturbed by landuse to result in one or moreof three conditions: fragmentation, replacement, and by invasionby feral plants and animals. These are the only disturbance consequencesconsidered in this project. The second qualification is the presumption that all disturbancewill result in a decline in species abundance and distribution.We assert that generally this was the result but note that thereare examples where landcover disturbance has resulted in a localincrease in population size of a few species; eg the increasein abundance of the red kangaroo with the establishment of pastoralismin the arid areas of the continent. The last qualification is an important reiteration: the relationshipbetween landcover disturbance and biotic erosion is completelyqualitative. It must remain so because the quantitative alternative- how much disturbance results in how much loss of biodiversity- is currently lacking. Robust relationships that have any generalityare likely to take decades to establish and to wait for this is,in our opinion, both hazardous and unnecessary. It is hazardous because what is already known about the extentand rate of biotic erosion is far from encouraging; eg Noble et al (in preparation), Saunders et al (in preparation).It is unnecessary because advances to our understanding can bemade based on what is known, now. We hold that a substantial improvement in the national assessmentof the extent and severity of biotic erosion can be achieved immediatelyby an assessment of landcover disturbance combined with an integrationand modelling of existing datasets. This was the pragmatic visionthat motivated the establishment and conduct of this project. The ecology of this one species, the red kangaroo, the mostabundant large mammal in the world, has been the subject of asubstantial research effort spanning some thirty years. The resultsof that effort now underpin the conservative management of thisspecies across the continent even though there is a great dealwe do not yet know about its population ecology. Compared withthe red kangaroo, understanding of the remaining biodiversitycomplement is essentially non-existent. Nevertheless, this shouldnot be a paralysing realisation. Perfect understanding is a desirableprerequisite for management; not necessarily a critical one. Wecan learn as much by doing as we can by studying. Management ofthe problem of biotic erosion is required now. Attempts must bemade now.

Besides satisfying these requirements, the view from space wasthe only view to satisfy the above constraints. It has significantadditional appeal because it is a view that can be readily shared.Satellite data in image format is an attractive and engaging methodof communication. Images were used where possible within thisdocument. Significantly, the view from space is a powerful view. It is powerfulbecause it is both synoptic and fine grained. The original sourcedataset resolved the entire continental landcover to the levelof 0.001 x 0.001°, approximately 100 x 100 m or one hectarein area. Unfortunately, with that resolution the data volume becameintractable so a coarser, defocused view, twenty-five times largerin area (0.005 x 0.005°, 500 x 500 m), was used for mostof the analyses. This, and most other details of the methods used in digitallyprocessing the Landsat MSS are critical to the interpretationand credibility of the results reported here. The nature and sizeof errors detected during data processing and their influenceson the results are discussed next.

The most intensive landuses arelocated in the south of the continent: those in the centre andnorth of the continent are extensive rather than intensive. Therefore, to achieve the greatest sensitivity in assessment,it was necessary to stratify the continent into regions basedon the importance of one or more disturbance factors. Then, basedon this stratification, the quantification stage using satelliteimage data can be customised to maximise the detection of thelandcover disturbance characteristic of that particular landusetype. Landuse Zones - Intensive And Extensive The most severe and extensive disturbance to landcover has been,and remains that provided by landuse: the direct result of humanactivities. By comparison, the perturbations generated by climate and weatherare either so gradual to be imperceptible even over centuries(climate), or rapid but very localised in occurrence (weather- storms, etc.). In contrast, the agents of ancient and modernlanduse, fire and mechanical or chemical clearing, are far moreinfluential. There seems little doubt that Aboriginal Australians significantlydisturbed the landcover (and the fauna) of the continent throughtheir use of fire throughout the millennia of their occupationof this continent. They shaped the face of much of Australia ina way that was separable from the very large climatic changesof the last 30, 000 years; see Pyne (1991). The landcover consequences of an early Dry Season burn in anorthern Australian savanna. Fire is a landuse tool with poorlyunderstood long-term consequences for biodiversity; millenniaof its application by Aboriginal Australians notwithstanding. There is no doubt that in the last two centuries European Australianshave also changed the landcover of the continent, both extensivelyand substantially through agricultural and pastoral landuse. Therefore,we primarily stratified the continent by landuse. Because we wereinterested only in the landcover consequences of landuse, we useda simple two-level stratification. The first and most important decision was which landcover consequenceof landuse is the most significant disturbance for biotic erosion?That we took to be habitat destruction by the clearing of naturalvegetation and its replacement by crops and pastures; eg see reviewsby Caughley (1994), Noble et al (in preparation), Saunders et al (in preparation). As a consequence, the principal stratification of the continentwas based on the location of clearing; where clearing of nativevegetation for replacement with (exotic) crops, pasture and forestvegetation has been and remains the principal disturbance. Withinthis area of the continent, the impact of landuse on landcoveris principally one of replacement. The consequences for the biodiversitythat was originally characteristic of the native vegetation areobvious and severe. Much, but certainly not all, of the biotic erosion of the lasttwo centuries was concentrated in the areas of replacement landuse.It follows then that the continued expansion of this landuse offersthe largest threat of accelerating biotic erosion; eg Saunders et al (1994); Hobbs and Saunders (1994). Urbanisation and mining, like agriculture, are also replacementlanduse types. On a continental scale, the direct landuse consequencesof mining are trivial and not considered in this study. Whileurbanisation is perhaps a hundred-fold more extensive than mining,its direct landcover consequences are also not significant ona continental scale. However, the indirect influence of urbanisationon landcover change is substantial. Urban populations are growingand need to be fed and clothed. Urban political values concerningthe conservation of biodiversity are also changing. The dividing lines between the areas of the continent where landcoverclearing was the most significant disturbance factor were drawnafter searching the satellite image data by eye. Expert interpretation,rather than machine decision, was used because in the detectionof the irregular and diffuse boundaries of clearing, the formercannot yet be matched by the latter. The boundary was finalised by allowing a generous geographic marginbeyond the edge of the clearing, approximately 100 km, and aligningit with the national grid of the 1:250,000 scale topographic mapsheet series. Using this criterion, the continent was dividedroughly into one third and two thirds as in Table 1. Stratification of the continent by the landcover consequenceof landuse. The outermost region (red) encompasses those areaswhere the principal landcover disturbance threat was clearingfor crops, pastures and forests. However, not all of this areawas cleared. In the innermost region (green), the principal landcoverdisturbance results from grazing and burning.

Rather it was based on the threat ofclearing, both actual and potential. Therefore, we have not usedthe obvious names of cleared and uncleared for fear of generatingmisunderstanding. Rather, we have coined the names Extensive Landuse Zone (ELZ)for the central core of the continent and Intensive Landuse Zone(ILZ) for the remaining coastal strips. As defined and illustratedabove, the Intensive Landuse Zone is approximately 39% (2, 984,000 km2) of the continent and contains perhaps more than 90% ofthe national population. In contrast, the Extensive Landuse Zoneis almost twice as large, 4, 708, 000 km2 in size (61%) but carriesas little as 5% of the national population. Not all the ELZ is used on a permanent basis. Within this areaof the continent, the most common landuse is extensive pastoralismthat in terms of landcover consequences is a harvesting landuse.Like forestry based on native forests and woodlands, it is notionallysustainable where the offtake is small and irregularly patternedin time and space. Nonetheless, most surveys of the impact ofextensive pastoralism, past and present, show that considerablelandcover change has occurred and because of it, or at least insynergy with the arrival of domestic stock and establishment offeral animals initially released in the ILZ, substantial bioticerosion has occurred also; James et al (In Press), Newsome (1994), Pickard (1994). Besides extensive pastoralism, there are two other landuses withinthe Extensive Landuse Zone; Traditional Use and Unused. These are Aboriginal Australians on Aboriginal land. They areTraditional Owners but this is not Traditional Landuse. Unused land, or unallocated crown land, most of it in WesternAustralia, is not completely without the impact of human activitybut here it is patchy and episodic. For the landuses of Traditional and Unused, it was difficult,for understandable reasons, to assess the level of landcover disturbanceusing satellite data. The partitioning and distribution of finerdivisions of landuse within the Intensive and Extensive LanduseZones is discussed in Adding What Is Known. Landcover Type A second and independent stratification of the continent was neededby which to aggregate the detected landcover disturbance. The type of stratification chosen was largely determined by thepurpose and scale of the analysis. Possible choices for the basicarea unit (strata) could be the (relatively) small area of a farmor a local government area (LGA), or the much larger area of astate, if the purpose of the analysis was landcover managementresponsibility. However, in this study the principal focus isbiodiversity. Therefore, an ecologically relevant stratification has been used.As argued earlier, with a continental perspective, issues of scaleand ecological understanding decide that the most relevant stratificationwas by landcover types; ie a typology based on vegetation andsoil attributes. The task of deriving a tractable set of consistently defined,landcover types was difficult. Considerable effort was made toevaluate a wide range of alternatives. The final choice was basedon two simple and pragmatic reasons. Because the objective ofthe project was to quantify landcover disturbance, the basic stratificationshould be on landcover attributes; ie vegetation and soil variables. Continental datasets of vegetation structural type exist, eg AUSLIG (1990),as does one for soils, Northcote et al (1975).Because attempts to reconcile and integrate these two datasetswere unsuccessful, the dataset of Natural Vegetation, AUSLIG (1990),became the source typology for landcover. It was assumed that considerable climate, soil and topographicinformation was implicit in this continentally consistent mappingof vegetation at landscape scales. Use of this dataset was notwithout difficulty and error. Nonetheless, the dataset NaturalVegetation, the vegetation as of 1788, was taken to be the basicecological divisions of the continent. Two conditions on the use of the Natural Vegetation dataset werenoted. The first was that it was taken to be the truth: the boundariesand descriptions of its 230 categories were not disputed eventhough they occasionally appeared to be doubtful. The second wasthat the large number of primary categories of Natural Vegetationwas reduced to a smaller set (34) by concentrating on overstoreystructural and floristic attributes (height, cover, genus), andignoring the understorey. Pragmatic reasons required that alloverstorey genera other than Eucalyptus and Acacia be pooled,and within these three genera, the tall (T), medium (M), and low(L) height categories also be pooled; Table 2. The nomenclaturewas derived from that used in AUSLIG (1990).

Space data was the only data type that met the requirements forconducting this assessment within the resources available; asargued earlier in The View From Space . A commercially available, geocoded digital mosaic of Landsat MSSdata for the entire continent formed the primary dataset for quantifyingthe location, severity and extent of landcover disturbance. Thestrategy and associated methodology are now described. The principal dimensions of this dataset were two - spectral andspatial. There was no temporal dimension. This dataset was takenas a time slice of the continental landcover conditions as ofapproximately 1991. No change detection was applied to imagesof different dates. The only time dimension in this analysis wasan implied one: all (significant) change detected using the 1991dataset was assumed to have occurred in the last 200 years. Exactlywhen this change occurred cannot be directly inferred from thissatellite dataset alone. The project set out to answer one question - what is the currentstate of the continental landcover? This we hold, makes a small but significant contribution to anational understanding of the severity and location of bioticerosion. Another significant contribution will come from quantifyingthe dynamics of landcover change; the rate and location of habitatdisturbance across the continent. There are limits to this secondquestion. The high spatial and temporal resolution of landcoverchange is only possible using satellite data since 1972; eg seeGraetz et al (1992), Sivertsen (1994), Wilson et al (1993).The rates of clearing can be determined further into the pastusing archived aerial photography and surveyor's maps; eg Hobbs et al (1993). The spatial dimension of this dataset was determined by its resolution;ie by the size of the ultimate unit of data capture and representation,or pixel. The pixel size of the supplied dataset was 0.001 x 0.001°,or approximately 1 hectare. Thus the continental aggregate representeda very large data volume to process. What is more important, thisfine spatial resolution was far, far greater than that of theNatural Vegetation dataset. The latter was published at a scaleof 1:5,000,000 and appears to have an intrinsic resolution of,at best, 1 km2, or more realistically 25 km2. Thus, this basicdataset was 2500 times more coarse than the Landsat source dataset.Therefore, the Landsat MSS dataset was resampled to 0.005 x 0.005°(˜500 x 500 m or 25 ha) for the analysis and further resampledto exactly 1 x 1 km for reporting. The de-focusing of the satellite dataset may, at a superficialglance, seem to reduce the acceptance of the findings. Hectare-sizedpatches of landscape are human-scaled and easily experienced.An area twenty-five times larger is less easily imagined in themind's eye, and therefore commands less validity. Nonetheless,the use of coarse (25 ha) rather than a finer-grained (1 ha) pixelsize introduces insignificant error in the overall assessment. The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet BRISBANE covering the cityof Brisbane, the nearby coast and inland; total area approximately120, 000 km2. Even with a pixel size of 25 ha, there is an abundanceof detail in the image. Fine details of the dunes and sand blowoutson Fraser Island are detectable, as are subtle and obvious patternswithin the landscape as a whole. Overall, a visual appreciationof the extent of clearing and fragmentation of the original vegetationis easily obtained. If you can do this, then you have instinctivelylearned to assimilate both the spectral (colour) and spatial (grain)dimensions of satellite images. The computer techniques used inthis project imitate the analysis and assessment that you havejust made. The final dimension of the satellite dataset - the spectral dimension- was the most critical because it determines what informationcan be derived. MSS data has four spectral channels, traditionallylabelled from #4 to #7, each giving four values for the reflectedlight from each pixel regardless of its size. For most landcovertypes, these four wavebands are highly correlated and can be reducedto two: a measure of cover and of greenness. Cover includes boththe cover of dark foliage over the brighter soils and the shadowswithin a canopy. Greenness is a measure of the abundance of youngand vigorous leaves within the canopy, be they trees, shrubs orthe herbaceous understorey. Under dry conditions, ie with no preceding rainfall, the coverof live vegetation is linearly but inversely related to the brightnessof one channel, the reflected red radiation recorded as MSS #5.In this waveband, the intact woody canopy is dark whereas thatof the replacement crop, pasture, or even bare soil, is bright.In addition, for the interpreter digitally interacting with thisimage, there are both spectral and spatial clues to what is cleared,and what is uncleared woody vegetation. It is remarkably easyfor a human to correctly interpret a complex image. It is considerablymore difficult to achieve the same result using a computer. Theconcepts discussed above are illustrated using an image of theArmidale area of eastern Australia. The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet ARMIDALE; total area approximately120, 000 km2. Setting aside the unnatural or false colours ofthe image, just using the clues of tone (light to dark) and thespatial pattern or texture within the image makes a rapid interpretationof what is undisturbed natural vegetation, and what has been clearedfor pastures and crops. Much of the remnant natural vegetationis restricted to areas of significant topographic relief: herein the ILZ, relief is the most frequent protection against futureclearing. The intensity of the red colour indicates the levelof greenness in the landcover. In this scene, both remnant naturalvegetation and some of the pastures were green on the ground andwere thus portrayed as red in this image. The several smoke plumesand their location indicate the continuing nature of landcoverdisturbance. Clearing All spectral channels of the satellite dataset were used to understandand interpret the images for all vegetation types. For the IntensiveLanduse Zone, the objective of the assessment was to allocateeach pixel into one of five disturbance classes; uncleared, thinned,cleared, indeterminate, and other. The uncleared class was characterised by having an intact canopy;this being determined relative to all the remnants of any landcovertype. The uncleared class may be disturbed by grazing but withinthe ILZ, this was disturbance that could not be separated fromclearing. For the landcover types with an open and sparse canopy, ie projectedfoliage cover (pfc) < 30%, it was difficult to separate clearing,the loss of the overstorey, from the effects of acute overgrazing,the loss of the understorey. This difficulty was one of the twoprincipal sources of error; see below. The cleared class was characterised by the effective replacementof the canopy with a herbaceous layer of crop or pasture plants.Here the overstorey cover was assessed to be reduced to < 5%;ie scattered or no trees. The thinned class was determined tobe an intermediate class of tree cover between uncleared and cleared.It was included to increase understanding of the severity of clearing.It is our contention that, in terms of biotic erosion, thinnedand cleared are effectively equivalent. The indeterminate class was assigned by the analyst to two situations.The most common was where an allocation to clearing was not ecologicallymeaningful; eg for a naturally occurring grassland. More rarely,it was used to indicate that isolated clearing could be detectedby the interpreter but not consistently detected by computer analysis.This occurred principally in the Northern Territory where whatlittle clearing has occurred was scattered within a very seasonallydynamic landscape. The other class was reserved for lakes mappedwithin the Natural Vegetation dataset. Overall the procedure was straightforward. The allocation decisionrules were based on the expert judgement of the analyst (Graetz)after intensive examination of the satellite data in digital format.Decisions were made only after a visual reconnaissance of thescene and a consultation of ancillary data (maps, etc.). After prolonged exploration of the image data for any one vegetationtype, the analyst selected MSS #5 values that separated unclearedfrom thinned, and thinned from cleared. Those values and thischannel alone were used to allocate each pixel into one of thesethree disturbance classes. Since the Landsat MSS #5 data werecontinuous in nature with no obvious thresholds, the choice ofMSS #5 values varied by landcover type and by climatic region.Thus expert judgement was critical in assigning values to classes.The allocation process was then computerised. We reiterate the point that even at the finest spatial resolutionof 0.001 x 0.001°, a pixel contains a mixture of landscapeelements - tree canopies, shadows, understorey and so forth. Thiswas particularly so with the pixel size used here, 0.005 x 0.005°,where the full spectra of mixtures of overstorey and understoreyare possible. The category thinned was created to capture themost uncleared part of this spectrum where the canopy was approximatelyhalf that of the uncleared state. The category of cleared willalso comprise spectrum mixtures from totally treeless to sparsescattered trees. The broad classification was adequate for thefocus of this project; ie quantifying that area of landcover thatwas uncleared. Because of the nature of the number of decision classes and artefactswithin the MSS dataset, there are uncertainties associated withthe assessment values derived. These errors are most usefullydiscussed in relation to the uncleared category as being eithererrors of commission, where the true value for the uncleared categoryis inflated, or omission, where actual value for this categoryis diminished. Both error types were unavoidably included in theanalyses reported here. A large and consistently occurring error of commission resultsfrom the cleared grassy landscapes often being green and activelygrowing at the time of image acquisition. This tends to darkenthem towards the signature of cleared woody canopies with theresult that a proportion of the cleared class was allocated touncleared. One example of this error of commission is in Armidaleimage where green actively growing pasture (reddish in colour)occurs in a N-S strip just to the west of the Great Dividing Range.This landcover is obviously non-woody canopy, being quite distinctto the eye from the neighbouring forested upland remnants. Nonetheless,it was impossible to set decision rules that consistently separatedthis green pasture from the surrounding forest remnants becausethose to the east were also green and actively growing (reddishin colour) while those remnants to the west were not. This source of uncertainty was inherent in the dataset and intensiveand systematic efforts to remove it failed. Moreover, carefulselection of decision rules to minimise this error lead to theconverse omission error in the drier, less dense canopies. Overall,a strategy was followed to minimise the size of the error andto stabilise its sign; ie consistently to one of commission oromission. The decision rules for the uncleared category were alwaysset not only to achieve the smallest uncertainty possible in thesituation, but also to keep the error consistently one of commission.Furthermore, the emphasis was on getting the values correct forthe more mesic landcover types, the forests and woodlands. Thisstrategy was hampered by significant variation within the datasetthat was not related to the surface. The net result was that therewere both errors of commission and omission in the results reportedhere. The difficulty is illustrated by the Albany image. The south-west of Western Australia. This area experiencesboth high rainfall and cloud cover almost all the year. As a consequence,the cleared areas of crops and pastures, are usually green. Underthese conditions, it was far more difficult to separate unclearedfrom cleared for landcovers near the coast than it was in thedrier inland. Significant errors of commission and omission werepossible with small changes in the decision rules set for thisscene that is a spectacular example of loss and fragmentationof natural vegetation. Grazing And Burning The objective for the Extensive Landuse Zone of the continentwas to use satellite data to allocate part or whole of each vegetationtype to one of the following disturbance categories: slight, substantial,significant, indeterminate, and other. The allocation was to reflect the contemporary level of disturbanceimposed by the two principal agents of landuse; grazing by domesticstock, and to a much smaller extent, repeated burning. The impactof grazing is by far the most influential in generating both systemicand cumulative landcover changes. The temporary and cumulative impacts of grazing on the landcovercan be detected and interpreted using satellite data for mostvegetation types. Similarly, even though the dataset used wasuni-temporal, some appreciation of the nature of the fire regimescan be interpreted, but this was far less certain than that forgrazing. The critical difference between the assessment of grazing andburning, and that for clearing, was that the former cannot beimplemented by computer. The assessment of the disturbance levelcan only be based on expert decision and opinion; a decision thatwas reached only after detailed interpretation of the spectraland spatial patterns within the image, and the integration ofancillary data. The subjective component of this assessment was thus higher thanthat involved in the assessment of clearing. To maintain a highlevel of transparency, the source document contains example imagesthat explain and support the decision taken for each vegetationtype. The nature of the evidence and its interpretation is exemplifiedby the Rawlinna image. The Nullarbor Plain near Rawlinna, Western Australia, pastorallyoccupied and a part of the ELZ. The predominant landcover typeis a low open chenopod shrubland - bluebush and saltbush country- with sparse mulga inland. The landcover consequences of pastoralismare quite obvious from 900 km in space and with a coarse groundresolution of 25 ha. The landcover change within whole paddocksand around watering points can easily be detected and assessedby eye. The level of disturbance here ranges from substantialto significant. However, when this relatively small area of thislandcover type was considered along with the all the others notwithin this scene, the disturbance level was assessed overallas substantial. Where natural grasslands (xG) were designated by the Natural Vegetationdataset within the ILZ, they were allocated to the indeterminateclass for the clearing assessment and manually interpreted forthe ELZ. Finally, there is no category for undisturbed. There is no vegetationtype that was absolutely undisturbed by the direct (landuse) orindirect (feral animal) effects of human activity. Therefore weused a relative scale: by definition landcover types that weredesignated unused or protected by tenure were used as benchmarksfor the assessment and were always set to disturbance category1, slight. Furthermore, the disturbance rating that was finally assignedtook into account local variations in disturbance level, suchas shown in the Rawlinna image above, as well as the conditionof the landcover type that occurred within the ILZ but was notactually cleared. Doing It Yourself At this point, the reader may be less than convinced that allof this interpretation and assessment of landcover disturbanceis possible using satellite data. It is not easy to illustrate this without drowning the argumentwith images. Therefore we have included a set of images coveringthe continent in a section called Exploring Your Country.Each image covers one sheet of the excellent 1:1, 000, 000 mapsheet series and are named accordingly. We recommend that youexplore your country using each of these images (5° x 6°in size) and try to interpret the type and level of landcoverdisturbance that you can detect. For the ILZ, the interesting areas are in the south-western cornerof Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. For theELZ, the interesting areas are South Australia, the Northern Territory,Queensland and Western Australia. If you have a particular interest in the state of the nationalforests, then examine New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

However,ancillary datasets were equally important in the interpretation,quantification, and enhancement of that disturbance assessment.In this section, these ancillary datasets are listed and discussedin order of importance. Tenure Tenure is a key factor in any assessment of landuse and landcoverbecause tenure is a licence that prescribes or proscribes variouslanduses, and thus various types of landcover disturbance. Moreover,the tenure type is a strong guide to future landuse and landcoverchange. For example, there is far more certainty about the futurelanduse activities on land held under public tenure than thatfor private tenure. Thus, tenure can indicate actual and potentiallanduse as well as its consequences for landcover disturbance. The basic dataset used was that compiled by AUSLIG (1994). Thisdigital dataset contains an initial 16 categories that were aggregatedinto a smaller set of 6 to indicate the probability of futurelandcover disturbance by grouping by differing levels of tenureprotection. The protection is principally against the threat of clearing butalso includes grazing. We created classes of tenure protectionthat range from 0 with freehold tenure to 5 with existing dedicatedconservation reserve tenure; Table 4 and the Tenure image. Thisassigned rank was used to rate and score the tenure protectionfor each landcover type. Table 4: The aggregation of the AUSLIGtenures into six groups that offer different levels of protectionagainst future landcover disturbance.

The protection rankingsand colour codes are: 0, red; 1, brown; 2, purple; 3, light blue;4, blue; 5, green. Feral Animals After landuse-driven landcover disturbance, the next most significantcontributor to the process of biotic erosion is habitat invasionby feral (exotic) animals; eg Newsome (1994), Short and Smith (1994), Short and Turner (1994). By comparison, the significance of habitat invasion by feral plantsis much less well understood or documented on a continental scale;eg Humphries et al (1994). Thus, exoticplants were not included in this project. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the impactof feral animals on the flora and fauna of this continent. Muchhas been made of the relentless influence two predators, the feralcat and fox, on the small-sized fauna, particularly in the ELZ.However, the rabbit cannot be ignored in the overall assessmentof the driving forces of animal extinction. Its arrival and establishmentin the more arid parts of the ELZ led to the destruction of entirelandscapes as captured in this image of the Strzelecki Track inSouth Australia. Continental datasets of density distribution for a range of pestmammals have been compiled; Wilson et al (1992).From this larger set, four were selected as being the most influentialin the process of biotic impoverishment on continental scales;the rabbit, cat, fox and pig. Other feral species (camel, goat,horse) are not as widespread or as influential as the chosen species. The feral density datasets are of relative rather than absolute,and overall their quality is relatively poor. Nevertheless, theyare unique and were used to assess the spatial patterns of intensityof each feral species' current threat to biodiversity. The density distributions of the four feral animal speciesused in the project. Clockwise from the top left the distributionsare rabbit, cat, fox, and pig. The density codes are None (white);low (yellow); moderate (blue); high (red). Fire Season And Frequency The best available datasets of fire season and fire frequencyfor the continent known to the authors were digitised and usedto assess the current level of landuse disturbance from this facetof landuse. The continental distribution of fire season. The categoriesand codes are: Winter-Spring (purple), Spring (blue); Spring-Summer(light blue); Summer (brown); Summer-Autumn (red). This datasetwas derived from that published by Luke and McArthur (1978). The continental distribution of fire frequency aggregated intojust three classes: 1-3 years (red); 5-10 years (blue); > 10years (brown). This dataset was derived from that published byWalker (1981) These two datasets were used to express their influence on theprocess of biotic erosion. In doing so we question the conventionalwisdom: not that fire has always been a part of the environmentof all biota on this continent, but whether the fire regimes whichwe see today differ significantly from pre-European times. Whilewildfires occur from lightning ignition, particularly in the hummockgrasslands of Central and Western Australia, and are constrainedby climatically controlled fuel production and curing, we assertthat the predominant source of ignition is increasingly from landuse;that is deliberate ignition. The ancillary datasets discussed above were used at 0.01 x 0.01°(approximately 1 x 1 km) resolution; a much finer scale than atwhich any of them were compiled. This is not as serious a problemas is the veracity of the data itself. Nevertheless, these datarepresent the best continentally consistent sets available andthey were used to derive the best continentally consistent assessmentsof landcover disturbance possible now.

We summariseour findings for the continent under the following four headings Aggregate Area Within the ILZ, we assessed that 1,547,863 km2, or 51.9% of thearea was either cleared or thinned. This in turn translates to approximately 20% of the whole continent.

There is no single dataset to test the validity of this estimate.There were however two national estimates that allow us to examineits plausibility. The first of these is the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)estimates for the total area of crops and pastures in 1990; ABS (1994).The ABS figure is 475, 000 km2; roughly one third of the figurederived in this study. However, the areas reported by the ABShave two important qualifications: they do not equate to the totalarea cleared, and the figures were derived by survey samplingnot census sampling as in this study. The figure published bythe ABS is the area used for crops in that year. In cereal croppingareas with a 2-3 year crop rotation, it suggests that the totalarea cleared for cropping may be three times that used in anyone year. Since the ABS reports that the area of crops peakedat approximately 220, 000 km2 in 1983-84, then the total areacleared for cropping alone may be 660, 000 km2. The area cleared for the establishment of pastures was more difficultto separately identify. Undoubtedly, in some agricultural areasthere is a reciprocal substitution of pasture and crop dependingon commodity prices. Nonetheless, there has been an expansionof clearing for the establishment of sown pastures alone. Thisclearing and establishment have been most marked in northern NSW,and especially Queensland. Here the second set of figures addsplausibility to the total figure derived in this study. The estimates of landcover change published by AUSLIG (1990)were based on the manual interpretation of satellite data acquireda decade ago. That survey recorded extensive thinning as wellas clearing of woodlands for the establishment or enhancementof pastures. The aggregate figures produced by the AUSLIG surveysuggest that in the last 200 years, there has been a net increaseby thinning of 400, 000 km2 of open woodlands, and by clearing,a net increase in grassland and pasture areas of 710, 000 km2.The sum of these two AUSLIG estimates is markedly less than thearea of thinning and clearing that we measured, indicating analarming increase of those activities over the last decade. No doubt there were uncertainties associated with both estimatesbut it is unlikely that the agreement between the two census assessmentsbased on satellite data was fortuitous. Distribution Where is the clearing? The distribution of the ILZ and the extent of clearing and thinningwithin it, is shown in this ILZ disturbance image. The continental distribution of disturbance by clearing. Theclasses and colour codes are: uncleared (green); thinned (brown);cleared (white); indeterminate (blue); lakes (black). Clearing and thinning extends across the southern areas of thecontinent, including the central area of Tasmania, and northwardsthrough Central Queensland. The most southerly areas of clearingwere associated with cereal cropping and improved pastures; thatin northern NSW and Central Queensland was mostly for the establishmentof pastures. How to interpret the four disturbance classes displayed in thisimage? The three key classes are uncleared, thinned and cleared. Thesewere allocated as progressive steps from uncleared, where thevegetation canopy was intact, to cleared, where the spectral signatureof the intact canopy was replaced by that of understorey. Thethinned class was an intermediate step within these two extremesbased solely on spectral signature; it was not primarily basedon the measurements of the degree of thinning, such as tree densities,but the two are closely related. The decision rules for the allocationof each pixel in this image to one of these three classes wereformulated after exacting expert interpretation, and consistentlyapplied. The image depicts our assessment of the extent and locationof vegetation disturbance by clearing as of approximately 1990. The indeterminate class displayed in the image illustratesthe landcover types within the ILZ for which an assessment ofclearing disturbance could not be made. The largest area was in the Northern Territory where localisedclearing, almost entirely for pastures, could be detected butnot reliably mapped. The areas involved, including the Ord Riverirrigation development, were trivial compared with the clearingin southern Australia. The indeterminate areas outside the Northern Territory were thelandcover types without a woody overstorey, the grasslands, forwhich the classification of clearing was inappropriate. This is not to say that these landcover types are undisturbed.Cultivation was detectable within the cleared grasslands (xG4)on the west coast of Tasmania and within the most mesic grasslandsof the other States and Territories; see, for example, TASMANIA.The grasslands at the drier edges of the ILZ (xG3, xG2) are alsodisturbed, principally by grazing. This display of the clearing data-set also illustrates the natureand strength of the uncertainties associated with the assessmentsreported in this document. The error here is misclassification:uncleared was classified as thinned or cleared, and the converse.As explained earlier, because of the intrinsic nature of the sourcesatellite data-set and the fallibility of the expert process,such errors can never be eliminated. Rather, in this project, the uncertainty has been managed by minimisingand systematising the error by consistently biasing it in onedirection. With a focus on the uncleared class, a bias towardsthe error of commission was preferred. That is, the unclearedclass decision rules were set to optimistic values, to err towarda high value. Generally we achieved that so that the actual undisturbedareas with the ILZ were less that the values reported here. Errors of commission concerning the uncleared class are difficultto demonstrate in the image. However, the converse, error of omissionwhere uncleared vegetation was labelled as thinned or clearedcan be illustrated. Along the clearing boundaries of parts of Western Australia, SouthAustralia, Tasmania and northern Queensland, there are areas labelledas cleared that are not. We encourage you to examine the imagesof these areas provided in Exploring Your Country.In particular, you will find the images of TOWNSVILLE,CLERMONT, CHARLEVILLE,BOURKE, BROKEN HILL,ADELAIDE, PORT AUGUSTA,TASMANIA, ESPERANCE,ALBANY, PERTHand MEEKATHARRA are of particularinterest. This error could not be avoided, only minimised. There are twoprincipal sources of this error: problems intrinsic to the satellitedataset, and limitations to separating clearing from significantdisturbance by grazing. Nevertheless, the nature and size of theseerrors were small compared with the information content of thisdataset that is summarised in the remainder of this section. Landcover Type Is the clearing and thinning evenly distributed across all landcovertypes? Considering the entire ILZ, the distribution of disturbance byclearing between landcover types is summarised in Table 6. A simpleindex of Loss (thinned and cleared) was also calculated reflectingthe view that for the process of biotic erosion, there is littledifference between thinned and cleared.

As might be expected, the highest Loss values are for the smallestlandcover types as is illustrated in the following Loss of Areagraph. The relationship between the Loss index (thinned and cleared)and area for the ILZ landcover types. The highest Lossvalues are for the smallest, and most likely restricted, landcovertypes. To appreciate which landcover types have experienced the greatestdisturbance in absolute terms, the aggregate contribution of thecleared and thinned areas was plotted in the following descendingsize rank graph. Landcover types arranged in descending order of the total absolutearea disturbed (thinned and cleared classes). The landcover type with the largest disturbed area was theopen eucalypt forests (eM2), which combined with the next largestlandcover type (eS2) account for 45% of the total area. By far the largest clearing has taken place in the open eucalyptforests (eM2), followed by the open eucalypt shrublands (eS2),forests (eTML3), sparse forests (eM1) and so forth. The area clearedwithin the first two landcover types accounts for 45% of the totalarea cleared. Tenure Tenure is a land management tool; a type of landuse licence issuedby state governments. Landuse activities are prescribed and proscribedby certain tenures, and clearing is one such activity. Thus, thedistribution of the landcover disturbance classes between varioustenure types reflects the management of clearing by state governments.All six tenure types defined in Table 4are represented within the ILZ and their relative sizes are illustratedby the following tenure pie chart. The relative area of the six tenure types within the ILZ. Tenure type 1 (Freehold, Mining leasehold) and type 2 (Pastoralleasehold, Defence tenure) between them account for 81% of theILZ. What is the proportional area of each tenure type that is eithercleared or thinned? The relative size of the area that was thinned and cleared relativeto the total area of that tenure type is displayed as the followingtenure-clearing pie chart. For tenure type 1 (Freehold, Mining),this proportion was high (74%) and less so for tenure type 2 (35%)the Pastoral (and Defence) tenures. The relative area of thinned and cleared landcover within eachof the six tenure types. Tenure type 1 (Freehold) and type 2 (Pastoral)dominate; this is where the clearing is mostly found. In absolute terms, these are the two tenures that contain thecleared and thinned landcovers as would be expected. All of agriculture,a replacement landuse, is held under Freehold tenure while mostpastoral activity, a harvesting landuse, is conducted mostly underPastoral tenure with some under Freehold. Can we use this finding to check on the overall validity of ourassessment of clearing and thinning? The tenure-clearing pie chart revealed that there was a smalloccurrence of cleared and thinned classes within the tenure typesthat offer high protection against clearing; types 4, 5 and 6.Type 6 is dedicated conservation reserve. These occurrences areobviously a misclassification and an error of omission; unclearedlandcover classified as cleared.

However, in absoluteterms, it is less damaging. If we assume that there should beno clearing at all in tenure types 3 to 6, then the proportionof misclassified pixels was 108454 from a total of 549014; anomission error rate of 20%. This is a worst case error analysis which if continentally applicable,reduces the total area thinned and cleared from 1, 550, 000 km2to 1, 240, 000 km2. We are confident that the error detected by this check was notcontinentally applicable but we are unable to substantiate thisopinion. Nevertheless, this calculation is a measure of the uncertaintyassociated with all aggregate measurements reported in this project.

Accepting these limitations, what were the findings for this typeof landcover within the ELZ? This question is answered in three parts: how much?; where?; andwhich landcover type was most affected? Aggregate Area The relative distribution of disturbance classes across all landcovertypes aggregated indicates the largest area of the ELZ (62%) tobe only slightly or not disturbed, approximately 15% to be substantiallydisturbed, and some 26% to be significantly disturbed. The latterclass was allocated only to landcover types within tenure types1 (Freehold) and 2 (Pastoral). This was not an entirely surprisingresult given the large proportion of the ELZ that is subject tolittle or no grazing landuse. Table 8: The distribution of the areaof the ELZ among the four landcover disturbance classes. Whereno valid interpretation could be made, the indeterminate classwas assigned.

The area of significantly disturbed landcover was approximatelythe same as the area cleared (See Table 5). In terms of the management of biotic erosion, the figures arenot as daunting as those for clearing because clearing representsa far more severe and permanent impact than do the landcover impactsof grazing Distribution Where is the landcover disturbance? The spatial patterns are displayed in this ELZ disturbance image. ELZ disturbance image The pattern of assessed disturbance for all landcover typeswithin the ELZ. The colour code is: slight (dark green); substantial(brown); significant (white); indeterminate (blue). The indeterminateclass was allocated where no valid assessment could be made. These patterns are the result of the interaction of irregularlandcover boundaries with the geometric tenure boundaries. Recallthat the assessment of landcover disturbance was based on landcovertype within tenure types. Landcover Type Which landcover types are most disturbed?

Most landcover types were only slightly disturbed. The significantlydisturbed landcover types were the open grasslands (xG2), andthe open and sparse Acacia forests and shrublands. The disturbancestatus of many of these landcover types is presented in greaterdetail in Case Studies.

The controls of landuse associated with each tenure type are setby state governments and as a consequence, there is slight variationbetween States and Territories. The extent and location of clearing within a state as measuredin this project are thus a reflection of the history of land managementby individual States and Territories. Thus it is informative to summarise clearing by state boundaries. Beginning with clearing, Table 10 sets out the proportion of eachState of the ILZ, and within that, the relative distribution ofthe three principal landcover disturbance classes. Table 10: The proportion of the ILZof each state in the three critical disturbance classes. The firstcolumn is the proportion of each state within the ILZ.

New South Wales and Queensland both have the largest proportionof their ELZ areas in the significant disturbance class. In contrast,South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territoryhave the largest proportion of their ELZ areas in the class ofleast disturbance. However, with absolute area this assessment was largely reversed:the smallest area of landcover significantly disturbed by grazingwas in the ELZ of NSW (43, 000 km2), followed by South Australia(160, 000 km2), Northern Territory (196, 000 km2), Queensland(271, 000 km2), and Western Australia (482, 000 km2). The two sets of figures above do not convey an overall assessmentof the status of landcover disturbance within each of the Statesand Territories with the same power as does the view from space. This view communicates the extent of landcover change as wellas its spatial patterning. Even though we cannot quantify the relationship between the lossof biodiversity and the extent and severity of landcover disturbance,the view from space does give an overall appreciation of the taskconfronting conservation efforts, especially within the ILZ. Therefore we provide images of the ILZ for Queensland, New Southwales (incorporating the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria,South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territoryfor the reader to interpret and contemplate. Don't forget there is also an image of Australia torefresh your understanding of the whole picture; both ILZand ELZ. In addition there is an image of the island state ofTasmania. The ILZ of Queensland is presented at a spatial resolutionof 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection. The extent of the clearingbecomes most obvious when you realise how much of the image isremnants of the original landcover. The ILZ of New South Wales displayed at a spatial resolutionof 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection. Almost all the forest remnantsare restricted to the uplands of the Great Dividing Range. The ILZ of Victoria, in this case the whole state, presentedat a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection.In terms of relative areas, this is the most cleared of all states.As for New South Wales, the forest remnants are restricted tothe uplands of the Great Dividing Range. The ILZ of South Australia, a part of a large state,at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection.If you spend time interpreting this image, it is not hard to seewhy in this state, there have been several attempts to determinethe limits to sustainable agriculture, the margins of the goodearth. The ILZ of Western Australia, a small fraction of thislargest state, at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albersprojection. The wheatbelt of this state is almost devoid of anynative vegetation. The ILZ of the Northern Territory displayed at a spatialresolution of 1 x 1 km, and in Albers projection. There has beensmall and scattered clearing within this region but we could notsystematically map changes against a dynamic background of burningand seasonal contrast. These are fascinating landscapes to interpret.

The distribution of feral animal densityvaries across the continent. In broad terms, the simplest questionto ask of the feral animal distribution data is whether therewas a significant contrast between the ILZ and ELZ? The answer to this question was not surprising and is presentedin graphical form. The greatest presence of rabbits (low, moderate and high densities)was found in the ILZ rather than the ELZ. The same can be saidfor both foxes and pigs. Conversely, the density of feral cats was evenly distributed betweenthe two landuse zones. The conclusion that we draw from the graphs is that the highestdensities, and thus probable impacts on biodiversity, of rabbits,foxes and pigs are coincident with the most significant landcoverdisturbance, clearing.

The disturbance assessments applied to the ILZ and ELZ are qualitativelydistinct and thus have been separately reported as Table 5and Table 8. The two sets of figures cannot be simply aggregated. Nonetheless, we present the following argument to support a combinationof these two sets of figures to produce a systematic continentalassessment. Further, we then use these figures to compare thestatus of the Australian continent with global assessments compiledby Hannah et al (1994, 1995). For the ILZ, we have argued that with impact on biodiversity,the thinned and cleared classes should be aggregated. By far thelargest proportion of the indeterminate class area was grasslandsor shrublands; disturbed by grazing but not cleared. This classcannot be ignored but it should not be equated to uncleared. In our opinion, compared with the impact on biodiversity of clearing,the three levels of grazing disturbance assigned for the ELZ arefar less severe or permanent. The indeterminate class can by defaultbe added to the slightly disturbed class. Therefore, we create a combined scale of landcover disturbancewith three levels: undisturbed (uncleared, slight), partiallydisturbed (indeterminate clearing, substantial grazing), and significantlydisturbed (thinned and cleared, significant grazing). We stressthat this aggregation is based on personal judgement. What ismore important, it ignores the threat of feral animals.

The remainder is allocated to unused(12%) or in conservation reserves (7%). From this we can conclude that almost half of the landcover subjectto landuse was assessed by us as significantly disturbed. How should we to interpret Table 12 interms of biotic erosion? Many concerned individuals regard the land reserved by conservationtenure as the only area worth considering in the difficult taskof preventing or slowing biotic erosion: only the National Parksand nature reserves matter, the rest is lost. In contrast, Pressey (1995), proposes a wider and more usefulplan for effective conservation to which we subscribe. We believe the critical areas to be those which are significantlydisturbed. These are the areas most in need of remedial management. In addition, we propose that for conservation management, thepartially and undisturbed areas are equivalent and deserve a lowerpriority for action than the significantly disturbed areas. However,we note that we are here ignoring the relentless impact of feralspecies. Lastly, how do the overall figures for Australia compare withthe other continents? The most recent global figures on disturbance are those compiledby Hannah et al (1994, 1995). Using different techniques, theyproduce a three-level classification of disturbance that was overallmore severe than reported here. In our opinion, their most disturbedcategory, human dominated, represents a greater level of disturbanceand irreversibility than used here. This was shown by their assessmentof Australasia being 62% undisturbed, 26% partially disturbed,and 12% human dominated; Table 2 of Hannah et al 1994. The aggregateof their last two categories (38%) was comparable with our mostdisturbed category (35%). Using this relationship, we recalculate Table 2 of Hannah et al(1994) to produce a disturbance ranking of all the continents.In relative terms, Australasia and South America have equal lowestproportions of significantly disturbed landcover (38%), with Europecontaining the highest (86%). Disturbance ranking of all the continents A comparison of the proportion of five continents that is significantlydisturbed. The data were recalculated from Table 2 of Hannah etal (1994). Note these figures are for Australasia.

Where all one landcover was classified as indeterminate,such as for the grasslands (xG), its disturbance rating was determinedby visual interpretation and reported in Disturbance by Grazing. For each type, the simplest index of Loss was calculated as theaggregate area that was either thinned or cleared. This indexwas arbitrarily rated and scored thus: < 10% was low (* );10-30% was moderate (** ); > 30% was substantial ( ***). A second index of habitat loss was derived from a measure of thefragmentation of the remaining uncleared landcover patches. Thereare many published indices of landscape pattern and fragmentation;eg Turner (1990). However, since robustrelationships between the rate of biotic erosion and landcovertype and degree of fragmentation are lacking, there was littlepoint in computing complicated measures of landscape pattern;eg Cale and Hobbs (1994), Hobbs (1994), Murcia (1995). The calculation of the index of fragmentation comprised both objectiveand subjective parts. The objective basis was, for each landcovertype, a graphical comparison of the cumulative distribution ofpatch size between that mapped in Natural Vegetation, by definitionuncleared, with its contemporary fragmented condition measuredby satellite. This specimen fragmentation chart illustrates theprinciples involved. A comparison of the cumulative distribution of proportionaluncleared patch size for the baseline (undisturbed) and contemporary(fragmented) states. The degree of fragmentation was rated andscored by the comparison of three curve attributes: ordinate,slope and asymptote. This example is for the closed forests. For this landcover type, there are 40 separate occurrences withinthe ILZ. These patches are sorted by size, converted to a proportionof the total area and plotted as a cumulative baseline curve.The largest patch size alone constituted approximately 25% ofthe total area (the ordinate); the next largest patch adds approximately10% and so forth until the asymptote of 100% is reached with thelast and smallest patch. The ordinate (proportion occupied by the largest patch) and theshape of the curve as it approaches the asymptote express thesize ranks within the ILZ. In this example there are many smallpatches; the last twenty patches accounting for just the remaining20% of the total area. The process was repeated for the contemporary uncleared patches.With clearing, there will be more patches of smaller size thanthe baseline set. Sorting these by size and plotting only thefirst 40 patches, the same as the undisturbed yields a very differentshaped curve. Three comparisons of the two curves indicate the degree of lossand fragmentation: the ordinate (comparative size of the largestuncleared patch); the shape of the curve; and the difference inasymptotes, in this example 70% compared with 100%. This simple objective comparison was quite insightful. A highlycleared and fragmented landcover type will show large ordinatedifferences; a flat curve generated by many small patches; anda large disparity between the endpoints of the two curves. Conversely,a little fragmented landcover type would return a curve similarto the baseline. The first three case studies in the Case Studiesare good illustrations of the nature of fragmentation. The graphicalcomparison was subjectively rated and scored as either low ( *),moderate (** ) or substantial (*** ).

However within the ILZ, and particularly along the boundariesof the two zones, grazing, and to a much lesser extent, burning,assume dominance over clearing as disturbance agents. Thereforeeven though the assessment was notionally reported only for theELZ, the condition of the uncleared grazing land on the outermargins of the ILZ was taken into account. Tenure as well as landcover type boundaries were used in the assessment.By definition, the disturbance status of all Unused land was assessedas the lowest class, slight. This assessment was reported simply as a table of the absoluteand relative areas in the four disturbance classes: slight (littleor no detectable impact); substantial (detectable but localisedimpact); significant (widespread significant landscape change);indeterminate (unable to interpret). These four classes were assigned disturbance ratings of 0, 1,2, and 0, respectively. A numeric measure was calculated as thesum of the products of the proportional distribution of areasand the respective disturbance ratings above and has a potentialrange of 0-200. The rating and score were then assigned thus:0-50 was low (*); 50-100 was moderate (**); >100 was high (***).

Equally important are the constraints to landuse change; suchas the intrinsic and static nature of the landscape itself, thesoils and topography, and the social dynamic of tenure. All factors have, are, and will continue to interact, changingboth rapidly and slowly over decades. Only tenure, the criticalsocial control of landuse, was considered here; and for both theILZ and ELZ combined. The assessment was focused on tenure vulnerability and was basedon the relative distribution of the area of each landcover typebetween the tenure types set out in Table 4.The six tenures listed in this Table offer different levels ofprotection against future disturbance ranging from none, withFreehold, to total protection with Conservation tenure. A numericmeasure was computed as the mean of the sum of the products ofthe percentage area in each of the six tenure classes of Table 4and their protection ratings (0-5). Based on this value, a vulnerabilityrating and score was arbitrarily but plausibly set as low (* ,> 50% protected), moderate (** , 25-50% protected), and high(*** , < 25% protected). Table 15: The distribution of relativearea (%) of the six tenure levels for all landcover types withinthe ILZ and ELZ. The score was based on the mean sum of the productsof the percentage areas and the tenure protection ratings thatare lowest with tenure type 1 and highest with tenure type 6.

Only four species were considered; rabbits, foxes, cats and pigs.Nonetheless, these four are regarded as the most significant contributorsto biotic impoverishment mediated through habitat destruction,competition and predation; eg Newsome (1994). The assessment of the current and future threat of all four specieswas based on determining the relative distribution of each landcovertype within four mapped levels of feral animal density: none,low, medium, high. In a similar manner to tenure vulnerabilitydiscussed above, the three levels of feral vulnerability werebased on the mean of the sum of the products of proportional area(%) and density class (0-3).

Two simple descriptive statistics were derived for each landcovertype: the relative distribution of area among the five fire seasons(Winter + Spring, Spring, Spring + Summer, Summer, Summer + Autumn)and among the three fire frequencies (1-3 years, 5-10 years, and> 10 years). The translation of these statistics into indices of disturbancewas based on the following reasoning that however plausible, isnot yet supported by detailed evidence. We argue that for fireseason, the greatest biodiversity disturbance is likely to resultfrom fires in the hottest time of the year. Therefore the fireseasons were weighted for disturbance from Winter + Spring (0)to Summer and Autumn (4). A three-class rating and score of disturbancewas then calculated as for feral density; low (0-25,*), moderate(25-50**) and high (> 50, ***). For fire frequency, it was argued that the most frequent firesoffer the largest disturbance to biodiversity. Therefore, thedisturbance value of fire frequency classes was weighted as thefrequency; from high (2) for the highest frequency to low (0)for the lowest frequency. In a similar manner, a numeric measurewas calculated from the mean aggregate product of proportionalareas and the disturbance rating; range 0-100. From this measurea three-class rating and score of disturbance was then calculated;low (0-25,*), moderate (25-50**) and high (> 50, ***). Therespective fire disturbance scores are set out in Table 17.

It is to be read and interpreted like a report cardwith the exception that the score for each disturbance factoris relative only for that factor. It was meant to compare betweenlandcover types and not across disturbance factors. Because the relative importance of the individual disturbancefactors was large, eg clearing and fragmentation was judged tobe of far greater consequence than fire season, comparisons betweenlandcover types based on the total at the bottom of the tablewill be misleading. Thus, these scores are relative and not absolute numbers; therecan be no simple bottom line of the report card. Furthermore,unlike traditional report cards, the lower the score (*) the better:that is, the lower the score, the lower the actual and potentiallandcover disturbance, and thus the lower the threat to impoverishment. The Scoreboard The purpose of generating Tables 13 - 17was to bring all the disturbance factors together simplified toscores. These scores for each landcover type are relative withinthat disturbance factor. Nonetheless, these five summaries canbe examined as a scoreboard and some interesting conclusions made. From Table 13, it is apparent that ahigh clearing score is usually matched by a high fragmentationscore. This is not an entirely surprising conclusion but it doesindicate the pervasiveness of the disturbance offered by clearingto all landcover types within the ILZ. In contrast, within the ELZ, Table 14,only five of the thirty-one landcover types assessed were significantlydisturbed, five were substantially disturbed, and the remainingnineteen were rated as slight. These large differences are generatedby the interaction of the relative areas subject to grazing andthe resilience of the landcover type to disturbance. Some landcovertypes, such as the grasslands (xG), are resilient compared withthe mulga country (wS2). Furthermore, for all landcover types,there is no correlation between the ILZ and ELZ disturbance scores. The range of scores for tenure vulnerability is both limited andhigh; Table 15. No landcover type iswell protected by tenure. This may be a somewhat surprising conclusiongiven that 7% of the continent is within conservation reserves;Table 4. The density distribution of the four feral animal species variesnotably between landcover types; Table 16.No single landcover type has a low or high score for all fourspecies. Little comfort can be taken from this. We suspect that relationshipbetween feral animal density and the rate of biotic erosion isnon-linear with a low threshold; low densities are sufficientto cause disproportionately high rates of other species loss. Finally, the scoreboard for fire disturbance presents a contrastbetween the two factors; Table 17. Forfire season, only seven landcover types have a low disturbancescore, with the majority being assessed as moderate. In contrast,the fire frequency score is assessed as low for the majority oftypes. The extremes of these two disturbance factors are not correlated:no landcover type has a low or high score for both fire seasonand fire frequency.

The image of what was happening on theground in Kakadu National Park on the morning of September 2,1986 will never die! That is an interesting thought! Not onlydo we have an enormously powerful tool at our disposal that hasprovided a unique view of our environment, we also have powerfulway of exactly recording the state of that environment at thattime. Never before in human history has there been such a powerfulmechanism with which to assess and monitor the condition of ourliving environment. What is more, the same imaging device thatcaptured this wildfire on September 2, 1986 is still operating10 years later. In the intervening period, it has captured anadditional 200 images of this exact area of Kakadu National Park.Like the image that we have used, these newly acquired imageswill also never die. The data that constitute these images arepainstakingly archived and await analysis by those who want tolook backwards to better understand what awaits us.

In the last twenty years, frequent exposure to satellite images,such as the cloud images used in TV weather segments, has generateda familiarity with space images that disguises just how modernthis technology is. Three thousand years ago, Greek natural philosophers(scientists) deduced from its shadow on the Moon that the shapeof planet Earth was a sphere. That deduction was not completelyconfirmed until 1969 when a small and privileged group of UnitedStates astronauts en route to the Moon observed that the Earthis truly a globe. The most revealing views of Earth are not to be had on its surface.An individual standing on top of Mt Everest with the best telescopeavailable and under the best viewing conditions, might be ableto see about 0.000025% of the total surface of the Earth. It isdifficult to appreciate and describe the curved surface of a spherewith surface observations only. Cartography was crude and inaccurateuntil aerial photography provided a new perspective from 10 kmsor so above the surface of the Earth. Now observations from heightsof 1000 kms, or in the case of the TV weather cloud images, 30000 km are routine. Nonetheless it is notable to remember thatuntil remote sensing technology became routinely available, itwas easier to draw maps of the Moon than of the Earth.

A ground resolution unit of 60 m x 80 m is human scale becauseit is approximately the area of a football field. It is somethingwe can visualise and comprehend. But this cognisance becomes moredifficult as the unit of ground resolution or pixel, increasesin size. For example, another type of satellite, the NOAA AVHRRsystem, has a pixel size of 1000 m x 1000 m. That is, this imaging system averages the landscapes into pointsor pixels that are 1 kilometre on a side; a unit of resolutionthat is difficult to visualise or comprehend. It is the same resolutionused for reporting the findings of this project. If you standat any point, in the city or the country, and imagine that thedifferent brightness of every component within a square pixel1 x 1 kilometre in size is averaged to just one value, you wouldeasily be persuaded that the result will be meaningless or ofvery little value. It is a difficult concept to grasp! Nevertheless,when we view a NOAA AVHRR image, the patterns and colours makesense. We can interpret what we see. We have no difficulty withthe whole, only with the component parts, the pixels. This difficultywill pass!

Satellite data are objective. Satellite data are acquired, transmittedand archived by machines. No human editing, biasing or censorshipis involved in the data acquisition stage. Each pixel is an objectivemeasurement of the condition of the surface of the Earth. Thedata coding the relative brightness in each waveband for eachpixel are collected systematically in space as well as in timewith a census sample; ie. complete coverage of the surface ofthe Earth. It is only in the final stage of interpretation thatsubjective interpretation occurs. That presents no problems. Ifyou and I disagree about the interpretation of a satellite imagein this book, that is healthy and good for science. We can differonly about our interpretation and not about the data. The datathat we both use, the image, remain the same. Satellite data areobjectively acquired and there are enormous volumes of it. Withinthe national satellite archives in Canberra, there are approximately250 Landsat MSS images of every pixel of the Australian continentsince mid-1972. There is a very great contrast between the systematic, objectivemeasurement systems onboard satellites and the assessment andmonitoring of our environment that people do. Our assessment issubjective rather than objective and it is based on a very smallsample in comparison with the complete 'wall-to-wall' coverageof satellite imaging systems. The greatest disparity is in theway in which we humans monitor the world around us compared withwhat can be achieved using satellite data. Our archive of whatthe world was like is our memory. Our memory, our operationalarchive, is, unfortunately seriously flawed in its creation andfallible in its retrieval. We selectively remember things in thefirst instance and then do not always recall all relevant information.As an archive, we are biased and forgetful. These failings shapeour lives because we are what we remember. That is the natureof human beings; a nature that is the product of the way we haveevolved during the last million years or so. It is a characteristic of our behaviour to react to rapid or episodicchange in preference to slow and monotonous change. It's far easierto occupy ourselves with the daily micro-hassles of life thanwith changes occurring over the longer term. Our social, politicaland economic lives are dominated by the now rather than the criticallyimportant future. This domination is largely dictated by our mediathat, with words, images and skill, force our concentration ondaily trivia, eg. a knee operation for a football player, whilecompletely ignoring the long term changes, such as the relentlessincrease in the atmospheric concentration of chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs) and greenhouse gases. Now, bearing all of these points in mind, we can ask a simpleyet important question: If you wanted to discover what was reallyhappening to your world, which archive would you tap? Would youuse the collective human memory? This archive we know to be familiarbut neither objective, complete or systematically updated. Orwould you rather access a database that has it all there? A databaseof objective measurements, not subjective impressions, that wasmade systematically in space and in time?

Because satellites work above the atmosphere, satellite sensorsystems must completely ignore the blue part of the visible spectrumbecause blue light is scattered by the atmosphere. This phenomenon,called Rayleigh scattering, explains why the sky is blue and whysunsets are orange to red in colour. An image of the Earth's surfacein the blue wavelengths would usually be fuzzy and blurred. However,the colour blue is always used in displaying the information inthese images.

Any involvement with satellite data rapidly generates a realisationof the immense volumes of data that are required to create, store,and then recreate images. Let's work through an example usingthe full Landsat MSS scene that contained the introductory wildfire. This image comprised ~2 600 lines, each of which was made up of~2 600 pixels. This image is best visualised as an array of 2600 columns and 2 600 rows giving a total of ~7 000 000 locationsor cells in the array. For Landsat MSS with 4 wavebands, thisgives a total of 28 000 000 numbers to represent one image.

This satellite, like most Earth observing satellites, orbitsthe planet from pole to pole with each orbit taking about 100minutes. That orbit is fixed and the Earth rotates below the orbitingsatellite. The instruments onboard each spacecraft image the Earth'ssurface directly below, usually in a continuous strip. If youimagine the reverse process - that the satellite is wrapping theglobe with a continuous strip of bandage - Landsat-5 completelycovers the Earth every 16 days. Thus every 16 days, Landsat-5can acquire a fresh image of every part of the planet, cloud coverpermitting. In Australia, the Data Access Facility (DAF) or ReceivingStation at Alice Springs systematically tracks and records datafor the Australian continent and its surrounds every day of theyear. The orbit of Landsat, like most other satellites, is sun synchronous;ie. the satellite passes over any location at the same local timeof day. For Australia this time is approximately 0930 hours AESTand Landsat passes North to South. The orbital paths are inclinedabout 12 degrees from geographic north.

STANDARD PRACTICE AND RESEARCH EXCELLENCE If there are well defined standards, it places research and developmentinto context and protects it from being confused with operational production.Research is needed in cases where the standard processing is inadequate,where it does not solve the user's problems and also needed to create newproducts which may eventually become standard processes. The important advancefor researchers in this situation is that when users ask researchers totry new methods because the standard ones are inadequate it is they, andnot the researchers, who take on the risk that the result may not be anybetter. Having a solid base of established standards also puts into context thedifficult issue of "Best Practice". I think the name is the problem!It is always better to use "Best Current Practice" and even betterjust to say "Standard Practice". I think that 'best practice'is actually what the 'best people' do and always will be. It is impossibleto specify the 'best' or create it by documentation and imposition of measuresof success. What it is possible to specify is the currently acceptable standardsand it is in everyone's interest that these standards exist and providea measure against which new methods can prove their worth. The area where research lives is in the quest for the best but it may notbe that current research really is better. The measure of 'better' to theuser lies as much in repeatability and consistency as it does in the incorporationof more 'realistic' components or complex physics. However, the researcherneeds to have room to explore and can move the horisons to create what maybe tommorrow's standards. An example of such a slow but sure process can be seen in evaporation methodsas practiced in Irrigation Engineering. In evaporation standard practicethe scientifically superior Penman-Monteith method has taken many years(more than 30) to become included in the standard manuals. It has had tobe proven in operational practice to be simply applicable, reliable, consistentand even conservative so that it could replace tried although maybe notvery true methods in use for many years in operational calculations of "Consumptive"Water Use.

OUTCOMES AND DISCUSSIONS FROM THE LAND AVHRR WORKSHOP Data receiving stations should process data so that the base and standardproducts are both correct and repeatable within and between stations. Thatis, for the same region observed by two stations during a single overpassboth the base and standard product digital counts must be the same. 1. Accurate and quantifiable measures of correctness should be definedjointly and then adhered to. 2. Geometric accuracy was suggested to be at RMS of 1pixel. This qualityspecification can be determined by a number of GCP's being selected in eachimage to ensure that the geometric accuracy is being meet. 3. Absolute radiometric correction was suggested to be specifiable to5%. The main issue for such a specification is how to provide the supportingmeasures. Options include a combination of ground based or remotely senseddata collected from other satellite systems to enable radiometric qualityto be documented for both base and standard products. 4. Additional data quality levels to the receiving stations standardsshould be produced and monitored by appropriate groups. There needs to be understanding of the complexities involved by all membersof the AVHRR community. For example, all members would like a correct, accurateand fast cloud detection and cloud contamination algorithm in place in allreceiving stations. Some initial research has been undertaken on this topic.However, due to computational demands few if any algorithms have been operationallyimplemented. There still exists the opportunity that research will be ofbenefit due to a combination of algorithm development and faster processingcomputers. We would all like the AVHRR data to be physically correct andobtainable in a timely fashion to predefined standards. To do this, we mustdefine the problems and offer solutions to them. There is an important opportunityand obligation for CSIRO to engage some basic research. Solutions shouldbe scientifically correct and also operationally implementable. This hasobvious advantages to all members of the AVHRR community. Several issues were raised about how to ensure that present data archivesare made consistent and correct. Such archives will form a baseline forfuture environmental monitoring projects and the need to ensure correctnessand consistency is paramount. It was decided that rather then reprocessall images based on the notion that someone may want to use such data inthe future, what is required is the knowledge, and specifications to beclearly, completely and correctly documented to allow reprocessing of specialdata archives. Is all this information known and documented? It is thought that CSIRO Marine Labs, CSIRO DAR, AIMS, WASTAC and the BofMetneed to get their systems all consistent and meeting the same common setof standards. Operational running of receiving stations and base data archivingalso needs to be eventually transferred from CSIRO to BofMet. There is currentlyan agreement being discussed between the two organisations and greater discussionsneed to be undertaken not only between these two but also include ACRESand the AIMS/Townsville facility. Data standards need to address the needs of the user community. Most importantis the operational data user community, those agencies who are currentlyusing AVHRR data to make management decisions. Any changes to data formats,standards etc need to be documented and feedback from the user communityobtained before they take place. This needs to be rigorously planned andimplemented on predetermined known dates and not undertaken in an ad hocway. There were also concerns about data availability expressed by some membersof the user community. Management systems have been developed in which AVHRRdata are the central element and continuity, both of geometrically and radiometricallycorrect data must be ensured to the level of control that the data acquisition,base and standard product community have. Also, issues of CSIRO data gatherersproviding data to research applications internal to CSIRO must be addressed.This is an issue for CSIRO to address possibly under the banner of the recentlyformed EOC. People must be willing to accept that some changes in the Australian AVHRRreception and subsequent processing pathways will occur. The changes willallow for a better consistent national set of standards to be met. All membersof the remote sensing community that receive, process and use AVHRR datamust be taken into account before any changes are made.

Teamconsists of Professor De Maria; Dr J Krige, European University Institute;and Professor Russo, University of Palermo. Book describes the four yearswhich "..were the most important in the history of European cooperationin space. They marked the end of the illusion that ESRO's sister organizationELDO could ever build an all European heavy satellite launcher, and thetransformation of ESRO itself from an organization solely devoted to scientificresearch to one mainly engaged in the domain of application satellites.Facing the growing political and economic importance of space activities,European governments were involved in long and painful discussions aboutthe possible definition of a coherent space policy for the Old Continent,trying to find a compromise between conflicting national interests. In 1973this compromise was finally agreed on, starting a process which led in 1975to the birth of the European Space Agency (ESA), out of the ashes of ELDOand the wealth of ESRO.

Teamconsists of Professor De Maria; Dr J Krige, European University Institute;and Professor Russo, University of Palermo. Book describes origins (includingbackground in political, military and industrial development theory) ofthe European Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organization, establishedin 30 April 1962 (signing of ELDO Convention by Italy, Britain, France,Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia). The Convention came intoforce on 29 February 1964. Emphasises role of Blue Streak project; "ELDO then was a child of political, not technical parentage. In particular,it was a child of the Macmillan government, which saw the rocket [Blue Streak]as at once enabling it to achieve a measure of independence from the UnitedStates and to draw closer to its continental partners, and indeed to thenewly-fledged European Economic Community. There were other arguments ofcourse for continuing with the project - but it was these political concernsthat dominated the thinking of Macmillan and Thorneycroft from the timethe Blue Streak missile was cancelled."

BRINGING PRODUCERS AND USERS TOGETHER In order to bring about these standards, it is important that Australiawork closely with any moves or existing progress in these directions inthe international community. However, there is a need for Australian usersand data or value added product producers to get together and define whatthe needs of Australian users are - whatever the progress or lack of progressinternationally. In the case of Land AVHRR Data I think the need is critical.This Workshop is an ideal place to start the process as there are researchers,data providers, value adders and some end users all meeting together todiscuss the issues facing the 'industry'. Let's not waste the opportunity. In any transaction of the kind we are discussing, involving a producer anda user, there are two risks that must be minimised or at least balancedif the transaction is to be fair and even for it to keep occurring. Theseare the "Producer's Risk" and the "User's Risk". Theyassume there is a measure of quality available for the product and a strategyof testing. In this case, the producers risk is the probability that a perfectlygood product will be rejected as poor and the consumer's risk is the probabilitythat a product called acceptable is poor. Clearly, standards, measures andstrategies of testing must all be developed by users and producers togetherto create a situation everyone can live with. In practice, the financialviability of a product to the producers may be an important component inthe definition of a standard. In our area of AVHRR data and products there are two forums for standards.These are the interface between data producers and data users (or valueadders) and the interface between value adders and the end users. In theend, the two will form part of the same 'sentence' and need to be compatible: "With data produced at certified Level x, using processing methodsoutlined in manual y, with staff and infrastructure of capability z it ispossible to produce specified product p with accuracy q." Perhaps this Workshop, with its useful blend of researchers, data managers,data suppliers, value adders and users, can outline the cases where Australianusers can fill in the gaps in sentences like this one and help define whatLevel x is for the benefit of the data producers. Perhaps there is no existingsentence of this type of which we can be confident. In either case, whatare the base standards, what can reliably and consistently be achieved andwhat measures can we put into place to ensure in the future (to the benefitof producers and users alike) that they are being met? I claim that althoughthe answers to these questions do not always involve scientific issues ofinterest to leading edge researchers it is in their interest and essentialfor their long term survival that some answers be found.

RECOMMENDATIONS Out of the wide ranging discussions and issues addressed there were threewhich were agreed as of particular importance for the AVHRR community toachieve as soon as possible. These are: Data receiving stations should process data so that the base and standardproducts are consistent and to a specifiable and repeatable standard withinand between stations; Geometric accuracy should aim to be RMS of 1pixel with recommended algorithmsand processing plus measures of quality to be developed and implementedas the next step; Absolute radiometric correction should aim to 5% with measures of qualityto be developed and implemented as the next step. The resonsibility for taking steps to achieve these recommendations restsjointly with CSIRO, BofMet, WASTAC, AIMS as well as the prime data usersin the State and Commonwealth Departments. Therefore a fourth recommendationis: CSIRO EOC should convene a group consisting of data receivers and datausers to establish the workable solutions for these goals.

As you can see,it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates enormousprofits when followed correctly and with proper discipline. Our research and computer analysis are designed to select andchoose mutual funds for at least a four-week period. Our systemis not designed to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, allthe funds on our Top 50 list are technically very strong. Wedon't sell a fund based solely on a few good or bad days oftrading. However, we will send you a SPECIAL FLASH UPDATEanytime our Best intermediate Term Timing System (BITS) signals amajor change in stock market direction. We also have a telephone hotline that is updated everyMonday by 9:00 am eastern time. This hotline will give you thecurrent position of BITS and any portfolio changes. The Mutual Fund Bulletin features 4 Model Portfolios. The firstportfolio uses the Rydex Family Of Funds (1-800-820-0888) inconjunction with our BITS market timing system. This is known asour INDEX FUNDS PORTFOLIO. By using these funds (Nova, OTC andUrsa) we can go both long and short depending on the signal fromthe market timing system. Rydex Nova is an S&P500 index fund.Rydex OTC is a NASDAQ index fund. Rydex Ursa is an index fundthat is short the S&P500. BITS was developed in late 1988 and was tested on historicaldata from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and the S&P500 index wereused to generate the buy/sell signals and compute the returns. Since 1989,BITS has been in use real-time and it has proven itself in bothbacktesting and actual trading. On average it signals a tradeevery 4 months. The accuracy rating is over 80%, with every 4 outof 5 winning trades. The compounded annualized return is over 24%per year. There are a number of reasons why we are using the Rydexfamily of funds for trading BITS signals. Rydex Nova is an S&P500index fund with a beta of 1.5. This means when BITS is correct inits long signal, you make 50% more than the S&P500index itself. Rydex OTC is the an index fund that tracks theNasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Nova and OTC lets usparticipate in both the large and the small-cap stocks. Rydex is the only family that offers a fund that is short theS&P500. This makes Rydex Ursa a rather unique fund. It goesup when the S&P500 goes down and vice-versa. This means when BITSis correct in its cash/short signal you can make money as theS&P goes down. If you are able to find other similar funds,you may be able to substitute them for the Rydex funds. JackWhite & Company (1-800-233-3411) offers all three Rydex fundswhile Charles Schwab offers only the Nova fund. The second portfolio consists of no-load funds that canbe bought and sold through Charles Schwab (1-800-2-NO-LOAD) orJack White (1-800-233-3411). This is known as our NO-LOAD FUNDS PORTFOLIO andit consists of funds from excellent families like Twentieth Century,Janus, Invesco, Berger, Oakmark, Strong, Steinroe, Founders,Montgomery, Lexington, Cappiello-Rushmore, IAI, Dreyfus, Kaufmannand many others. These funds are also available through theFidelity Funds Network (1-800-544-7777). The third portfolio is called the FIDELITY GROWTHPORTFOLIO and it consists of 4 diversified Fidelity funds. The fourthportfolio is called the FIDELITY SECTOR PORTFOLIO and itconsists of 4 Fidelity Select sector funds. FidelitySelect funds have a one time 3% sales load. Afterthat you may switch to other funds within the family without anyloads. There is also a $7.50 redemption charge which can beavoided by using their automated telephone touch-tone tradingsystem. Fidelity can be reached at 1-800-544-8888. How To Get Started 1. Choose One Or More Model Portfolios 2. Invest In Those Mutual Funds That Have A BuyRating. 3. Sell When A Sell Signal Is Given Once you have decided on a portfolio to follow, you can decidewhat to buy. For each portfolio, an allocation percentage islisted next to each fund. Use this allocation to decide how manyshares to buy depending on your personal portfolio/accountsize. Every portfolio gives you a specific percentage for eachmutual fund. Just multiply this percentage by the total amountof money you have to invest. This way any size investment can beaccommodated. You'll then see the individual funds in every issue of theMutual Fund Bulletin. You simply invest in the mutual funds that arein your selected portfolio. Whenever there is a change, just callyour broker or mutual fund and ask them to switch your money tothe recommended fund. By keeping your money in a winning fund,you automatically win. When you get the next issue of the Mutual Fund Bulletin, checkyour selected model portfolio and look at the Status of yourfund. Sell your fund when a sell signal is given. Then purchasethe new recommendation. It is as simple as that. Please remember ... patience and discipline arethe two most important cornerstones of successful investing.Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs botheryou. That is all part of investing in the stock market. Focuson the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where youwant to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now. Jumping around from one investment program to the next can bedetrimental to your wealth building efforts.

Asyou can see, it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet itgenerates enormous profits when followed correctly and withproper discipline. Our Alpha()-RSM System is designed toferret out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high relativestrength & momentum. Alpha is that measure of the return thatis not explained by the general market. For example, if the S&P500has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock has an averagemonthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of 7%. This7% is the excess return that the stock generates over the generalmarket. Once we have selected our list of 400 highalpha stocks, we run them through our proprietary mathematicalmodels that rank them based on their relative strength andmomentum. We want to buy only those high alpha stocks that alsohave high relative strength and are going up at the present time. Wehave no interest in stocks that are going sideways, or worse, aregoing down. The top 100 stocks are then presented in eachissue of the Growth Stocks Report. Their percent change over thepast 1, 3 , 6 and 12 months is also shown. Stocks from the top ofthe list are added to the model portfolios as space becomesavailable in them, i.e., when we sell some stocks. We do not necessarilysell a stock in the model portfolio when it falls out of the top100. Our research and computer analysis are designedto select and choose growth stocks for at least a one monthperiod. Our system is not designed to trade intra-week orinter-day. Remember, all the stocks on our Top 100 list are technicallyvery strong. We don't sell a stock based solely on a fewgood or bad days of trading. Therefore, we will not issue a buyor sell signal on individual stocks between issues. How Do I Start? Each portfolio is designed to provide adifferent level of diversification ranging from 10 stocks to 40. Onceyou have decided which level of diversification you wish tofollow, you can decide what to buy. As a new subscriber you have threeoptions when you start building your portfolio. 1. The aggressive option is to go aheadand buy all stocks in your selected model portfolio at their currentprices. This way you'll be fully invested instantly. Even thoughsome of these stocks may be up 100-200% since we bought them, it doesn'tmean that they cannot go up another 100% or more from theselevels. 2. The more conservative option is tobuy only those stocks that have a new buy recommendation for thatmonth and leave the rest of your portfolio in cash. This way,it'll take you a few months to get fully invested, but you'll bebuying each stock at the most appropriate time and price. 3. If you decide not to follow one ofour model portfolios, you may use this list of 100 most attractive stocksto pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. Onestrategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top ofthat list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 100. When a stockdrops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top ofthe list. This is just one way of using the list. You mayprefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal taste. For each portfolio, the number of shares islisted next to each stock. Because we are perpetuating a portfolio,you should adjust the number of shares to accommodate yourpersonal portfolio. When first starting, is preferable to invest equaldollar amounts into each of your new buys rather than overweightingany one particular issue. When you get the next issue of the GrowthStocks Report, check your selected model portfolio. You'llnotice that the new sells and new buys in each issue are highlightedin italics. Sell a stock when a sell signal is given. Thenpurchase the new recommendation. It is as simple as that. Set Realistic Expectations -Discipline Is Your Key To Success Can we expect 100% plus returns every year. Itwould be great, but it just isn't realistic. In fact 100% returnshappen once only 4 or 5 years. We don't know when that is goingto happen. That is why we need to fully invested in the best high-alpha,high-RSM growth stocks. Many investors, particularly those with lessthan 5 years experience with their own money in the market, have unrealisticallyhigh expectations regarding returns. This is perhaps the biggestsource of frustration for newer investors. Over a 10-year period,stocks will be up only about 65 percent of the time on average.The rest of the days are spent drifting sideways or falling.These negative periods can last months or even years. The goodnews is that our Alpha()-RSM System can find the best stocks evenwhen the general stock is going down. Successful investing requires a mentaldetermination and emotional commitment to stay invested for at leastone market cycle, which usually lasts four to six years. Ofteninvestors lack the stamina to hold out through high period ofvolatility. They bail out, usually at the worst possible moment, forgettingthat the extraordinary returns generated by small-cap stocks willeventually compensate them for the risk or volatility. Please remember ... patience and disciplineare the two most important cornerstones of successful investing.Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs botheryou. That is all part of investing in the stock market. Focus onthe longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where you wantto be 3, 5 or 10 years from now. Generally, the longer you can leave your moneyin the market, the more risk you should be willing to take. Youalso need a proven investment strategy. Without a plan, investorsoften jump from one idea or philosophy to another. Jumping around from one investment program tothe next can be detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Onceyou have found a good system, like the Growth Stocks Report,try it for at least 2-3 years before passing judgment on it. Don't expect to make money each and everymonth. When faced with the inevitable down periods, don't losepatience and throw in the towel. Hang in there. Wait for theright opportunities, because sooner or later, they will surelycome. We at Growth Stocks Report hope to make your investing profitableand enjoyable. Frequently Asked Questionsabout the Growth Stocks Report Q. When is the newsletter published? A. The Growth Stocks Report is published by the5th of every month. The prices in the newsletter are as of thelast business day of the previous month. We finish our analysisby the 4th of the month, and then the newsletter is faxed or mailedby the 5th. Like any other monthly service, there will always bea lag of 4-5 days from last months close. In fact, some of thetime this lag may work in your favor. Q. Is there a telephone hotline? A. Yes, we have a telephone hotline that isupdated by the 5th of every month. This hotline was establishedso that we may be able to bypass mail delays. It contains ourlist of top 10 stocks for the month and any new buys or sells foreach of the model portfolio. A second hotline has been added to provideinformational updates on stocks that have had significant moveseither up or down. This second hotline is updated weekly by 9 amevery Monday. Both hotlines were included on a brightly coloredcard included with your kit and are available 24 hours a day,seven days a week. Q. Do I buy at the market or at the pricelisted in the newsletter? A. When you get the newsletter via mail or FAX,and decide to buy a stock, just buy it at the market. In somecases you will get a worse fill than the price listed in thenewsletter and in other cases you will get a better fill. Overtime, your fills should average out. A good rule of thumb to followis to not purchase a stock 30% higher than our buy price and to notbuy it 30% lower than our buy price. Q. Do you use stops or time the market? A. No market timing or stops are used in theGrowth Stocks Report. All portfolios remain fully invested 100%of the time. If you wish to use stops, you must be responsiblefor determining at what price you wish to implement them. Thesestops would be based upon your own personal tolerance for risk. Q. How do you select stocks? A. Our stock selection process incorporatesboth fundamental and technical criteria. Every month, we screenthousands of stocks looking for the handful that have thepotential for spectacular stock price increases. We are welooking for emerging companies poised for enormous growth or established onesthat are about to make major advances. We want companies whoseproducts are in such demand that they can't make them fastenough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking advantageof technological breakthroughs to create new, super-fast growingbusinesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered bythe financial media and hordes of investors. So we can buy them aheadof the pack and take full advantage of the run-up in theirstocks. We set very strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle thepossibilities down to a handful of companies with superior balancesheets and liquidity and little or no debt. Then we take thisshort list and subject it to a rigorous proprietary system basedon cutting-edge computerized technical analysis. This system ranksthe stocks according to their short-term momentum and relativestrength. We list the top 100 in every issue of the Growth StocksReport and when there is space, we add the ones at the top of thislist to our model portfolios. Q. Are these stocks risky? A. On an individual stock basis, thesesmall-cap stocks are quite volatile and most people would characterizethem as being very risky. That is why you must diversify overat least 10-15 stocks, preferably more. If you have 15 stocksin your portfolio and if four of them lose 25% each, your total portfolioloss is only 6.66%. Furthermore, its quite possible that some ofthe other stocks in the portfolio will go up thereby making upfor the small loss. That is why it is imperative that you diversify yourholdings over a number a stocks. Q. My stock is down 5 points in 2 days. Areyou going to sell the stock? A. We don't sell a stock based solely on a fewgood or bad days of trading. Therefore, we will not issue a buyor sell signal on individual stocks between issues. Our researchand computer analysis are designed to select and choose growthstocks for at least a one month period. Our system is not designedto trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, all the stocks on ourTop 100 list are technically very strong. Q. My stock is up 250%. Should I takeprofits and sell? A. No. Wait till the next issue comes out. Ifwe deem it to be a sell, it'll be sold. But till we ask you to sellit, don't sell just because it is up substantially. Q. A certain stock is down 4 points. Are youstill recommending it? A. Yes. Recommendations on a stock can onlychange once a month. If a stock is not rated a sell, then it israted a buy. Q. As a new subscriber, should I buy all thestocks in my chosen portfolio, or should I go with only the new buys? A. Either strategy if fine. The aggressiveoption is to go ahead and buy all stocks in your selected modelportfolio at their current prices. This way you'll be fullyinvested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may be up100-200% since we bought them, it doesn't mean that they cannotgo up another 100% or more from these levels. The more conservativeoption is to buy only those stocks that have a new buyrecommendation for that month and leave the rest of yourportfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few months to getfully invested. Just make sure that you divide your portfolio in theright proportion. For example, if you are following the $75000model portfolio and there are 3 new buys this month, then youwill buy $5000 worth of each of these stocks (total $15000) and leavethe rest of the $60000 in cash. Q. Why are you recommending or buying XYZstock? A. The answer to a question like this is alwaysthe same -- "because our computer models rank it as anexcellent buy at this time". Q. How do I use the list of top 100 stocksranked in order of attractiveness based on relative strength? A. If you decide not to follow one ofour model portfolios, you may use the list of 100 most attractive stocksto pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. Onestrategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of thatlist. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 100. When a stockdrops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of thelist. This is just one way of using the list. You mayprefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personaltaste. Q. A stock does not appear in the list oftop 100. Why are you are still holding it in the model portfolio? A. We do not necessarily sell a stock in themodel portfolio when it falls out of the top 100. Our sell disciplineis such that we only sell a stock when it falls into the lowerhalf of our rankings. Remember, the ranking provided in the newsletteris only a partial listing of approximately 400 stocks we rank. Q. The 1, 3, 6 and 12 month % change in thelist of top 100 stocks is projected or actual? A. That is the actual % change for each stockin the last 21, 63, 126 and 252 trading days. Q. I expect the market to have a correction.Should I sell my stocks? A. Since we are not trying to time the marketand have a long-term time horizon (5 years or more), we intend toremain fully invested at all times. The stocks in our rankingsand model portfolios are very strong both fundamentally and technically.Even if they do go down with the general market, they are alsolikely to rebound faster. Q. What other services do you provide? A. We provide newsletter services with the GrowthStocks Report and Mutual Fund Bulletin (MFB). The MFB seeksto provide magnificent market timing to dramatically reduce riskwhile earning spectacular returns with mutual funds. Our sistercompanies, Select Sector Research Management (SSRM) and SaxenaCapital Management (SCM), offer professional money managementservices. SSRM manages individual commodities accounts and SCM managesa hedge fund called the Index Timing Fund, LP. Please call if youhave an interest in any of the above services. Q. Can I call you with questions? We are not in a position to give individualized investment advice. Everything you need to know is contained in the newsletter. The purpose of the newsletter is tell you what to buy, when to buy and when to sell. The newsletter subscription price does not include telephone consultation. We would like to spend our time researching new investment opportunities rather than answering questions that pertain to just one individual. You should consult a financial planner for your specific needs. However, if you have a question of a general nature that other people may also be interested in, please write or fax it to us and we will try to answer it in subsequent issues of the newsletter.

As you can see, itis clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates enormousprofits when followed correctly and with proper discipline. Our research and computer analysis are designed to select andchoose mutual funds for at least a four-week period. Our systemis not designed to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, allthe funds on our Top 50 list are technically very strong. Wedon't sell a fund based solely on a few good or bad days oftrading. However, we will send you a SPECIAL FLASH UPDATEanytime our Best intermediate Term Timing System (BITS) signals amajor change in stock market direction. We also have a telephone hotline that is updated everyMonday by 9:00 am eastern time. This hotline will give you thecurrent position of BITS and any portfolio changes. The Hot Funds Analyst features 4 Model Portfolios. The firstportfolio uses the Rydex Family Of Funds (1-800-820-0888) inconjunction with our BITS market timing system. This is known asour INDEX FUNDS PORTFOLIO. By using these funds (Nova, OTC andUrsa) we can go both long and short depending on the signal fromthe market timing system. Rydex Nova is an S&P500 index fund.Rydex OTC is a NASDAQ index fund. Rydex Ursa is an index fundthat is short the S&P500. BITS was developed in late 1988 and was tested on historicaldata from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and the S&P500 index wereused to generate the buy/sell signals and compute the returns. Since 1989,BITS has been in use real-time and it has proven itself in bothbacktesting and actual trading. On average it signals a tradeevery 4 months. The accuracy rating is over 80%, with every 4 outof 5 winning trades. The compounded annualized return is over 24%per year. There are a number of reasons why we are using the Rydexfamily of funds for trading BITS signals. Rydex Nova is an S&P500index fund with a beta of 1.5. This means when BITS is correct inits long signal, you make 50% more than the S&P500index itself. Rydex OTC is the an index fund that tracks theNasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Nova and OTC lets usparticipate in both the large and the small-cap stocks. Rydex is the only family that offers a fund that is short theS&P500. This makes Rydex Ursa a rather unique fund. It goesup when the S&P500 goes down and vice-versa. This means when BITSis correct in its cash/short signal you can make money as theS&P goes down. If you are able to find other similar funds,you may be able to substitute them for the Rydex funds. JackWhite & Company (1-800-233-3411) offers all three Rydex fundswhile Charles Schwab offers only the Nova fund. The second portfolio consists of no-load funds that canbe bought and sold through Charles Schwab (1-800-2-NO-LOAD) orJack White (1-800-233-3411). This is known as our NO-LOAD FUNDS PORTFOLIO andit consists of funds from excellent families like Twentieth Century,Janus, Invesco, Berger, Oakmark, Strong, Steinroe, Founders,Montgomery, Lexington, Cappiello-Rushmore, IAI, Dreyfus, Kaufmannand many others. These funds are also available through theFidelity Funds Network (1-800-544-7777). The third portfolio is called the FIDELITY GROWTHPORTFOLIO and it consists of 4 diversified Fidelity funds. The fourthportfolio is called the FIDELITY SECTOR PORTFOLIO and itconsists of 4 Fidelity Select sector funds. FidelitySelect funds have a one time 3% sales load.

Sell When A Sell Signal Is Given Once you have decided on a portfolio to follow, you can decidewhat to buy. For each portfolio, an allocation percentage islisted next to each fund. Use this allocation to decide how manyshares to buy depending on your personal portfolio/accountsize. Every portfolio gives you a specific percentage for eachmutual fund. Just multiply this percentage by the total amountof money you have to invest. This way any size investment can beaccommodated. You'll then see the individual funds in every issue of the HotFunds Analyst. You simply invest in the mutual funds that are inyour selected portfolio. Whenever there is a change, just callyour broker or mutual fund and ask them to switch your money tothe recommended fund. By keeping your money in a winning fund,you automatically win. When you get the next issue of the Hot Funds Analyst, checkyour selected model portfolio and look at the Status of yourfund. Sell your fund when a sell signal is given. Then purchasethe new recommendation. It is as simple as that. Please remember ... patience and discipline arethe two most important cornerstones of successful investing.Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs botheryou. That is all part of investing in the stock market. Focuson the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where youwant to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now. Jumping around from one investment program to the next can bedetrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have founda good system, like the Hot Funds Analyst, try it for at least2-3 years before passing judgment on it. We at the Hot Funds Analyst hope to make your investingprofitable and enjoyable. VITALINFORMATION 107 EDINBURGH SOUTH, SUITE 207, CARY, NC 27511,TEL: 919-461-3960, FAX: 919-461-3964.

Better yet, if you join our exclusivegroup of readers, you can reap similar gains in outstandinggrowth stocks which 99% of investors have never even heard about. In this letter, I'll show you how you can use my C-A-N-S-L-I-M based Alpha-RSMSystem, the best stock-picking system on theplanet, to turn $5000 into $10,000, even $20,000 and over time, into $100,000or more. I have developed, tested and fine-tuned this system overthe last eight years with remarkable success. You're invited to learn about the growth stock newsletter thatturned a $25,000 investment into $73,857, a gain of 195.43%, in1995-96 -- easily outdistancing all other stock investmentletters. PLUS : Get Our Fax or E-Mail Service and Weekly Telephone Hotline & the 7-Part "Stock Investor Wealth Kit" -- FREE! In 1995, my Growth Stocks Reportmodel portfolios were up a whopping 143.73%.So far in 8 months of 1996, even after the sharp mid-yearcorrection, they are up another 21.17%. If you'd invested $10,000 in Accustaff (ASTF) in November 95,as I advised, you'd have turned your initial investment into$42,510. Your $10,000 investment in US Robotics (USRX), which I pickedin January last year, would have turned into $60,594 by July 96. And in just 17 months, a $10,000 investment in AscendCommunications (ASND) would have put $91,762 in your pocket. How have I been able to do this, particularly when mostadvisors and mutual funds are having such a tough time just keepingup with the broad market averages like the S&P 500 and theNasdaq. And how can I make my systems yield speedy, significantgrowth of your capital? Let me tell you... In a moment, I am going to reveal a remarkable, time-tested,system I've developed that will : Keep you invested at all times in the best performing Growth Stocks. Give you the discipline to stay invested for double, triple digit profits. Let your profits keep running, while immediately cutting your losses. Signal when to sell your weaker stocks and replace them with the strongest. Make your stock investing easier and more successful than you ever imagined possible. How successful? Here are some of my most recent winningrecommendations : Dura Pharmaceutical (DURA) grew by 96.12% in 12 months Iomega Corp. (IOMG) appreciated 104.92% in 4 months Jones Medical (JMED) ballooned 64.71% in 6 months Uniphase (UNPH) gained 46.10% in 10 months Zytec (ZTEC) rocketed 60.53% in just 4 months MOST STOCK MARKETINVESTMENT ADVISORS DON'TMAKE YOUR MONEY GROW FAST ENOUGH My name is Jay Saxena, and I, like you, enjoy makingmoney. I mean big money. Not 10 or 20 %. But 50% or more - and Ican help you achieve this goal, too. Ever since I first became fascinated with the stock market,I've made it a habit to study every conceivable method for pickingwinning stocks. Like most new investors, when I first got interested in tryingto increase my wealth, I looked at the results professional advisorsand newsletters were getting with their stock and mutual funds portfolios. You've probably done much the same thing I did. I checked outvirtually all the stock investment newsletters. Zweig and TheMoneyletter. Value Line, The Chartist, Standard & Poors.Dozens and dozens of them. I wasn't impressed. The vast majority of them either lostmoney or posted gains that didn't even keep up with inflation. That'snot the way to make money grow. If you want to achieve the goodlife and the financial security that lets you do what you want todo, you've got to find a better way. THERE HAD TO BE ABETTER METHOD THAN WHAT THEY WEREUSING... So, being an engineer by training (I have a Master's Degree inComputer Science), and having an analytical mind, I thought Icould do better on my own. And I was sure I could improve uponwhat were then state-of-the-art computer trading systems. So I started developing a stock selection methodology thatwould find the stocks with the highest probability of explosivegains in the shortest time. And I very quickly realized that the blue-chip stocks likeXerox, GM, GE, IBM and AT&T were not going to put me -- oryou, or anyone else -- on the fast track to wealth. The really big gains that can turnyour small investment capital into a large fortune come fromthe small cap growth stocks. So that's where I concentrated my efforts. And they've paidoff handsomely. In fact, in 1995-96 the average gain of the 6stock model portfolios featured in our Growth Stocks Report is anastounding 262.82%. WHY SHOULD YOU INVESTIN SMALL COMPANY GROWTHSTOCKS Quite simply, you should invest in small company growth stocksbecause they are hands down the mostsuccessful investment category in the 20th century.They offer an excellent way to grow a portfolio faster than moretraditional methods. In 1940 , $1000 invested in the stocks of the large-cap stocksof the S&P500 would have turned into about $330,300 by 1991,with all interest and dividends reinvested. But the same $1,000put into small company stocks would have netted a total of $1,965,000. That is almost 6 times better than the S&P500. These figures are based on investing in all publiclytraded small firms listed on the exchanges or the over-the-counter market.If you had carefully researched the most promising smallcompanies and placed your capital only with them, you wouldalmost certainly have done even better -- a great deal better. In my newsletter, the Growth Stocks Report, I will share my expertise with you onthe growth stocks market and show you how to best profit from it.With this newsletter, you can set yourself apart from themajority of other investors, and your willingness to walk adifferent path can result in much greater gains. You're probably also going to have a more interesting,exciting, and involving time than you would with a portfolio composedonly of blue chips, bonds, and mutual funds. INVESTMENT RETURNS:1940 - 1991 ASSET CATEGORY ANNUAL RETURN VALUE OF $1000 Small-Cap Stocks 15.7% $1,965,000 Large-Cap Stocks 11.8% $330,300 Corporate Bonds 5.1% $13,300 Government Bonds 4.8% $11,400 Treasury Bills 4.3% $8,900 Source: Roger G. Ibbotson and Rex Sinquefield, Stocks,Bonds, Bills and Inflation: 1992 Yearbook. (Chicago: IbbotsonAssociates). 4 POWERFUL REASONS :THE FACTS VS. MYTHS Here are 4 powerful reasons why small cap stocks are such bigwinners... 1. SIZE! "Small cap" companies are those with low (usuallyunder $500 million) capitalization. They have only a limitedamount of common and preferred stock outstanding." And right there is the major reason why they have so muchpotential to make explosive gains -- they're small. Let's face it: a company with $200million in sales has a much better chance of doubling to $400 millionthan a $2 billion company has of doubling to $4 billion in sales. And a small cap stock priced at $10 a share can much moreeasily go to $20 than a blue chip stock at $100 a share can go to$200. Hey -- just look at the recent performance of some of thesmall cap stocks I've picked in my newsletter, the Growth StocksReport, and you can easily see this principle in action : Brooktrout Technology (BRKT) up 101.72% in just 5 months Cascade Communications (CSCC) up 134.28% in 10 months PMT Services (PMTS) up 123.21% in 11 months Wet Seal, Inc. (WTSLA) up 182.35% in just 5 months Zoltek Companies (ZOLT) up 179.59% in just 4 months What are the chances of GE or AT&T or other blue chips ever showing gains like that? 2. SPEED! Small Cap Companies Can Move Fast! Small cap companies are flexible, nimble. They represent thebest of the American entrepreneurial spirit. They find and quicklyexploit niches in the marketplace. And they can shift directions fast to take advantage of newopportunities, unlike some lumbering giant of a corporation filledwith bureaucrats and super-conservative accountants. The best small companies have aggressive management andmotivated employee teams. They are hungry and quick to capitalizeon technological change. Quick to adapt to changing markets.Quick to seize the day! That means that if you're in the rightplace -- where my stock selection system in the Growth Stocks Reportwill put you - you can capture gains of 20%... 30%... 50%... even100%-plus! in a very short time. If we have periods of higher inflation, the share prices ofsmall stocks will rise much faster than blue chips. That means a $10stock can quickly jump to $20, or even $50 in a matter of months.That's the beauty of the small stocks. The best ones can hand youa small fortune practically overnight. But that's not all : 3. EARNINGS! These Stocks Are Earnings-Driven! When you look at historical growth rates, you quickly see thatsmall cap companies' earnings rise much faster than largercompanies'. Earnings of small cap companies with less than $500 million insales, in fact, typically grow 10 to 12 times faster than bluechip stocks. Think about it -- there's not much room for thelikes of GM and IBM to grow, and they certainly can't growrapidly. On the other hand, there is plenty of room for smallcompanies to grow -- and they will grow rapidly! According to Ibbotson &Associates, a market research firm, thesmallest 10 percent of the NYSE stocks outperformed the largest10 percent by more than 30 times over the past 67 years. And this translatesinto explosive stock price increases. In fact, in 1993 the NASDAQcomposite of small cap growth stocks had better than 2 times the growthrate of the DOW and S&P 500 for that year! Plus, They've Got 1 More Advantage : 4. GREAT LEVERAGE! When a small cap company's earnings grow, the earnings-per-share aren't diluted... and that makes the stock more attractiveand more valuable. Then the basic laws of supply and demandtake over: with a limited number of shares available, a relativelysmall amount of stock purchased can quickly push up the price ofthe rest. Small-cap stocks provide you with true ground flooropportunities. By now, I'm sure you understand why I look to the smallcap stocks to build my wealth -- and why they can build your wealth,too! ONLY SMALL CAP STOCKSCAN GENERATE GAINS LIKE THESE If you're truly interested in making your money multiplyquickly, my Growth Stocks Reportis just what you're looking for. I make no bones about it. My growth stock recommendations notfor everyone. If you are happy to see your money grow at lessthan 10% per year, there's no need to venture into growth stocks. But if you are seeking dramatic, even spectacular growth onyour stock investments... if you are seeking relentless gains ontop quality stocks... you need the Growth Stocks Report and myproven Alpha-RSM System.I am talking about gains like, ABR Information Services (ABRX) up 71.33% APAC Teleservices (APAC) up 149.84% California Amplifier (CAMP) up 70.37% Employee Solutions (ESOL) up 86.76% Applix, Inc. (APLX) up 90.80% You would have learned about all those stocks -- plusrecommended buy points and exit timing -- in my Growth StocksReport. And in upcoming weeks andmonths, you'll find a lot more -- and they could make youextremely wealthy. By using your Growth Stocks Report over the last 10 months, I've made up for all of my mistakes from the prior 5 years of investing. - G.B. of Stuart, FL I must admit, I am thoroughly impressed with your ability to pick stocks. - C. H. of Bethesda, MD May I take this opportunity to inform you that your Growth Stocks Report is the most accurate and profitable one among over 60 different stock newsletters I have subscribed since early fifties, almost forty five years. Congratulations and best wishes for your continued success. - Dr. S.W.Y., San Francisco, CA THE REVOLUTIONARYALPHA - RSM SYSTEM I mentioned earlier that my method uses a proprietary systemI've developed for identifying high-potential small cap stocksthat will yield explosive gains in a short time. Let me tell youmore about this... I've already explained why I look to the small cap stocks formy winners. Every week, my staff and I screen thousands of them,looking for the handful that have the potential for spectacularstock price increases. I want to invest only in the top 1% of allgrowth stocks. To me, the other 99% are simply not acceptable. Iknow from experience that only the top 1% will beat the market by100% or more. That's where I want to put my money, and I imagineyou'd want to do the same. What are we looking for?Emerging companies poised for enormous growth. Or establishedones that are about to make major advances. We want companieswhose products are in such demand that they can't make them fastenough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is takingadvantage of technological breakthroughs to create new,super-fast growing businesses. And we want to find them beforethey're discovered by the financial media and hordes ofinvestors. So we can buy them ahead of the pack and take fulladvantage of the run-up in their stocks. I employ a combination of fundamental and technical approachesto investing and have a rigid risk management system to keep myreward to risk ratio high. I determine my trading ideas based on fundamentalanalysis and time my purchases using technical analysis torecommend the most promising small-cap growth stocks that showstrong technical patterns and evidence of accumulation. Some of the fundamental and technical characteristics I lookfor are accelerating earnings, positive earnings surprises, acceleratingrevenues, high relative strength, high relative industrystrength, a low PE relative to the projected earnings growthrate, innovative products in a market that is rapidly expanding,rising order backlogs, and expanding profit margins. I sell whena stock breaks down technically or violates my screening rules. Part of this stock selection process uses the C-A-N-S-L-I-M methodology developed byWilliam O'Neil, which has proven highly successful. We set verystrict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the possibilities downto a handful of companies with superior balance sheets andliquidity, and little or no debt. Then we take this short list and subject it to a rigorousproprietary system based on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis.This incorporates both fundamental and technical factorslike : Valuation Indicators -- P/E Ratio, Relative P/E Ratio,Projected P/E Ratio, Price/Book Value Ratio, Price/Cash FlowRatio, Price/Capital Spending Ratio, Price/Sales Ratio Earnings Indicators -- Earnings Per Share, EarningsGrowth Rate, Projected Earnings, Earnings Velocity, EPS Increase,EPS Consistency, Return on Assets, Return on Equity Debt Risk Indicators -- Current Ratio, Debt/EquityRatio, Interest Coverage, Debt Service/EPS Balance Sheet Indicators -- Book Value Growth Rate,Capital Spending Growth Rate, Cash/Price Ratio, Inventory Turnover,Receivables Turnover, Asset Turnover Volume Indicators -- Volume/Share, 30-Day AverageVolume, Vol/30-Day Average Volume Ratio, 5-Day/30-Day AverageVolume Ratio, Short Interest Performance Indicators -- Relative Strength, PriceGrowth Rates, Least Squares Deviation, EPS Rank, Price Rank, GroupRank, Accumulation Distribution Background Indicators -- Number and Percentage ofInstitutional Holdings, Number of Outstanding Shares, Market Capitalization,Insider Trading and Exercise of Options Technical Indicators -- Moving Averages, MACD,Momentum, Stochastics, Wilder's RSI, Daily Range, High/Low, Beta,Volatility, McClellan Oscillator and many more Forecasting Indicators -- Next 5 Weeks, Next 4 Months,Next 1 Year and Next 3 Year % Probability of Increase and % Gain I realize that's a staggering number of factors to take intoaccount. It's only possible because of the advanced computer systemI've developed. The bottom line is that the Alpha-RSMSystem works. It works like crazy! Here are afew more examples of the gains this system has won : Asyst Technologies (ASYT) up 79.21% Boca Research (BOCI) up 93.88% Electronics for Imaging (EFII) up 69.92% Madge NV (MADGF) up 83.85 Prins Recycling (PRNS) up 74.03% Now, my approach may be simple, but making sure my recommendedstocks are truly the top 1% takes a great deal of work. But don'tlet that scare you. If you take advantage of my service, my staff andI will do all the hard work for you. Your job will be to simply duplicate my model portfolio, ormake up your own custom portfolio from my TOP 100 list. I'llprovide guidelines on how to construct a balanced portfolio foryour objectives. But whichever stocks you choose, you can be surethey're among the top 1% of all growth stocks. Once you make the investments, you'll just sit tight untilit's time to take your profits. Each month I'll give you buy orsell advice on every recommendation in our model portfolios. Wehold a stock anywhere from a few months to a couple of years.Today's market is one of rapidly changing conditions, ofopportunities coming and going, of fortunes rising and falling ina fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace. Today, a growth stock may do very well for a one, two, orsometimes three years, but after a while its performance fallsoff. That's when we take our profits and move on. The idea is toown the best growth companies during their greatest growthperiods. EIGHT UNIQUE BENEFITSTHAT CAN LEAD YOU TO SPECTACULAR,LONG-TERM PROFITS WHY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER USING MY ALPHA-RSMSYSTEM? You'll only invest in the strongest stocks, even in weak markets. My system screens thousands of stocks, rejecting most of them, even so-called popular stocks. I am really only interested in stocks that can bring 100%, 200%, 500%, even 1000% gains over the long term. You'll be in an enviable position, letting your profits run on stocks with virtually unlimited growth potential. At the same time you will be able to ruthlessly eliminate the weaker stocks, immediately cutting your losses. By doing just these two things, you would rise far above the average investor, who typically does just the opposite. You'll know exactly what to do -- buy, hold or sell, and when to do it. No need to even worry about the stock market on a day-to-day basis. You can relax peacefully, comfortable with the fact that since your money is invested in the best possible stocks, you'll make money over the long term, regardless of what the market does. You'll discover relatively unknown companies, with spectacular growth patterns. These are the kind of stocks that most people hear about only after they have gone up 2000%. But you'll be able to get in early and reap substantial profits. You'll have the revolutionary Alpha-RSM System on your side -- by following recommendations generated by our breakthrough stock selection techniques, you'll be racking up profits in virtually any kind of market. Our system is able to find good stocks even in tough markets. For example, our portfolio was up almost 110% in 1994, when the S&P500 gained barely 1.3% and the Nasdaq actually lost money. You'll know exactly when to sell your stocks -- This is one of the most critical things that some newsletters neglect. They tell you when to buy, but forget to tell you when to sell. While I firmly believe in a patient, disciplined approach to stock investing, I also believe in selling when it's time to sell. There's no place for emotion here. You'll NOT be required to trade extensively -- I believe that long-term investors make money for themselves while short-term traders just make money for their brokers. In fact, the Alpha-RSM System is so easy to use that you probably won't have to devote more than 15 minutes a month to your investments. You'll have a choice of 6 model portfolios to help you properly diversify your investment dollars. All you have to do is select the portfolio that's right for you and then each month just follow your lead, adding a few new stocks and selling those that have reached their peak. Please accept my compliments for your wonderful and practical approach to stock selection. At present time I am receiving four advisory newsletters, but I must be honest with you. Although I just subscribed to your Growth Stocks Report, I find it very helpful and promising. - P.E. of New York, NY Thank you for faxing your recommendations for this month's Growth Stocks Report. I have indeed made enough in returns for November and so far in December to pay for your service. Keep up the good work!! - Dr. J.S. of Reedsburg, WI Your Growth Stocks Report newsletter is one of the best on the market today. I say this simply not because of the stock picks (although that's a big part of it) but also because of the fantastic customer support. Keep up the good work and thanks for your help with my investing. - M.C. of Ellicott City, MD NO OTHER STOCKADVISORY LETTER EVEN COMES CLOSE TO MYGAINS! 143.73% IN 1995, 21.17% YTDIN 1996! There is a real difference between the GrowthStocks Report and all the other stock investment advisories.I don't waste your time. My letter is just six pages long -- you can read it and getthe information you need in a matter of minutes. I don't believe youwant a lot of wordy explanations for my recommendations, or "philosophy"about the markets and the general economic climate, or carefullyhedged predictions. You know the type: "such and such a stock may climb ifthis happens, but could also decline under this other scenario, etc.,etc." You won't find that in the Growth Stocks Report. Instead, you'll find a no-nonsense listing of recommendedinvestments. Specific BUY or SELL recommendations.A running tally of current returns for each and every stock inthe portfolio. And cumulative model portfolio returns. While every complete investment strategy contains a number ofconservative vehicles, one that hopes to build wealth quicklymust take advantage of the opportunities in small cap stocks. And that'swhere The Growth Stocks Report excels. Itis a well researched and easy-to-follow newsletter devoted exclusivelyto the best growth stocks in America today. Each month, we'll give you a list of "100 Most AttractiveGrowth Stocks." Out of those 100, we'll tell you which ones tobuy in the model portfolios.

The best newsletter I've seen in my 30 years of investing. - J. P. of Scottsdale, AZ Your FAX letter is very good. I have subscribed to a good number of financial newsletters.

I have reviewed and followed the performance of dozens of newsletters. The Growth Stocks Reports is by far the best. My portfolio is up 41% in just the last two months. Keep up the good work!

No other investmentswill do nearly as well in the next few years. These super stockshave all passed my rigorous analysis. They all have explosivegrowth potential! If you are retired, I suggest you allocate a portion of yournest egg -- 20% or 25% -- to as many of these future blockbustersas you can buy, since no other stocks will grow so quickly. Thatcould mean a much bigger nest egg for you in just a couple ofyears. If you are 5 years from retirement, using these stocks is thebest way to triple, and even quadruple, your nest egg in just thisshort time. Imagine what a difference that can make for you. Ofcourse if you're 10, 15, 20, or even 25 years away fromretirement, you can't afford not to take advantage of these veryprofitable small-cap growth stocks. You'll get the Growth Stocks Reportby FAX or E-mail on the first business day of every month.If you don't have a fax machine or Internet e-mail, you'llreceive your Growth Stocks Report by first class mail, usually bythe 7th of every month. You will also have 24-hour access to ourtwo telephone hotlines -- one is updated monthly for new buys andsells while the other is updated weekly to bring you the latestnews about the stocks in our model portfolios. Thesenumbers are changes periodically to prevent any unauthorized use. Whether you take delivery by fax, e-mail or first class mail,you'll discover the Growth Stocks Report gives you greater controlover your profits. SMALL RISE IN SHAREPRICE EQUALS HUGE GAIN This is your chance to dramatically increase your wealth in avery short period of time. Again, that's the beauty of small stocks-- the share price can climb dramatically, so fast. Remember, a$5 jump on a $10 stock can give you a much higher percentage gainthan a $5 increase on a $100 stock. Let's see how this works. If you buy a stock selling at $10,and it climbs $5, to $15 a share, you have a 50% gain. But thesame $5 upmove in a stock selling at $100 is just a 5% gain. Andof course for the same investment, you can buy a lot more sharesof the $10 stock than you can of a $100 stock. If you invest $5,000 in a stock selling at $10, you can buy500 shares. Then if the share price climbs $5, your profit is $2500(5 x 500 = 2500). That's a 50% gain on your original investment. On the other hand, if you invest $5,000 in a stock selling at$100, you can buy just 50 shares. Here, a $5 gain gives a profitof just $250 (5 x 50 = 250). SAFETY FIRST -- GOWITH QUALITY You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormousadvantage in small stocks. That's why I am so excited. For thenext several years, these explosive investments will post thebiggest gains! But again, you have to know which ones to buy. Not every smallstock is going to do well. In fact, most of them aren't worthyour trouble. I can't stress this point too much. To achieve bothhigh gains and safety, you must invest only in the highest-qualitysmall stocks. The problem is, you can't get timely and reliable informationon quality small-cap growth stocks. And yet, without such information,you will not know which growth stocks to buy, nor when to sell themfor the highest profit. You need The GrowthStocks Report...

Let mecongratulate you on your wise decision to become a chartersubscriber. Don't be fooled by the elegant simplicity of the Hot Stocks Digest. As youcan see, it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generatesenormous profits when followed correctly and with properdiscipline. Our Alpha-RSM Systemincorporates the C-A-N-S-L-I-Mapproach developed by William O'Neil. It is designed to ferretout those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high relativestrength & momentum. Alpha is that measure of the return thatis not explained by the general market. For example, if theS&P500 has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock hasan average monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of7%. This 7% is the excess return that the stock generates overthe general market. Once we have selected our list of 500+ high alpha stocks,we run them through our proprietary mathematical models that rankthem based on their relative strength and momentum. We want tobuy only those high alpha stocks that also have high relativestrength and are going up at the present time. We have nointerest in stocks that are going sideways, or worse, are goingdown. The "200 Most Attractive HotStocks" are then presented in each issue of the Hot Stocks Digest.Their percent change over the past 21 and 50 days is also shown.Since we are not day traders or very short-term traders, the 21and 50 day % change and the 21 and 50 day moving average numbersgive us a better feel for each stock. Intermediate-term tradesusually last from 2 weeks to 6 months. For these kind of trades,the 50 day moving average serves as an excellent support level.If it is penetrated and the stock decisively closes below it, thestock becomes an outright sell. Our $100,000 model portfolio can have between 0 and 30 stocks.The allocation in the portfolio is dependent upon prevailingmarket conditions and the buy/sell signals from our market timingand asset allocation models. A 50% invested position will have 10stocks and a 150% invested position (using margin) will have 30stocks. That is the maximum leverage we'll be using in thisportfolio. You can also use the list of the 200 most attractive hotstocks to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. Onestrategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of thatlist. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 200. When a stockdrops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top ofthe list. This is just one way of using the list. You may prefer to useit differently and tailor it to suit your personal taste. Anotherway to use the list is to buy any stock that makes it to the top20. To make room in your portfolio, you may have to sell somestocks. We recommend you sell the lowest ranked stocks and buythe top ranked ones. This way you will be rotating out of weakerstocks into stronger ones. As a new subscriber you have two options when you startbuilding your portfolio. The aggressive option is to go ahead andbuy all stocks in the model portfolio. This way you'll be fullyinvested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may be up50-100%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another 100% ormore from these levels. The conservative option is to buy onlythe new stocks added to the portfolio each week and leave therest of your portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a fewmonths to become fully invested. You'll get the Hot Stocks Digestevery Sunday via fax, e-mail or on our internet world wide website. When you start trading using our recommendations,you'll discover the Hot Stocks Digestgives you greater control over your profits. And triple-digitgains are NOT rare! Time and time again, I've selected stocksthat have realized over-100% gains in just a few short months You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormousadvantage in small stocks. That's why I am so excited. For thenext several years, these explosiveinvestments will post the biggest gains! But again, you have toknow which ones to buy. Not every small stock is going to dowell. In fact, most of them aren't worth your trouble. I can'tstress this point too much. To achieve both high gains andsafety, you must invest only in the highest-quality small stocks. SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS Can we expect 100% plus returns every year. It would be great,but it just isn't realistic. In fact 100% returns happen onceonly 4 or 5 years. We don't know when that is going to happen.That is why we need to fully invested in the best high-alpha,high-RSM growth stocks. Many investors, particularly those with less than 5 yearsexperience with their own money in the market, haveunrealistically high expectations regarding returns. This isperhaps the biggest source of frustration for newer investors. Over a 10-year period, stocks will be up only about 65 percentof the time on average. The rest of the days are spent driftingsideways or falling. These negative periods can last months oreven years. The good news is that our Alpha-RSMSystem can find the best stocks even when thegeneral stock is going down. Successful investing requires a mental determination andemotional commitment to stay invested for at least one marketcycle, which usually lasts four to six years. Often investors lack the stamina to hold out through highperiod of volatility. They bail out, usually at the worstpossible moment, forgetting that the extraordinary returnsgenerated by small-cap stocks will eventually compensate them forthe risk or volatility. Please remember ... patience anddiscipline are the two most important cornerstones ofsuccessful investing. Don't expect miracles or think you'll getrich overnight. Also, don't let the day to day market volatilityand ups and downs bother you. That is all part of investing inthe stock market. Focus on the longer-term. Look at the biggerpicture. Think where you want to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now. Generally, the longer you can leave your money in the market,the more risk you should be willing to take. You also need aproven investment strategy. Without a plan, investors often jumpfrom one idea or philosophy to another. Jumping around from one investment program to the next can bedetrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have founda good system, like the Hot StocksDigest, try it for at least 12-18 months beforepassing judgment on it. Don't expect to make money each and every week. When facedwith the inevitable down periods, don't lose patience and throwin the towel. Hang in there. Wait for the right opportunities,because sooner or later, they will surely come. We at HotStocks Digest hope to make your investing profitable andenjoyable. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q. When is the newsletter published? A. The Hot Stocks Digest is published everySunday and is available on our web site by 6:00 p.m. easterntime. The fax is usually sent around the same time. The prices inthe newsletter are as of the last business day of the previousweek, usually a Friday. Q. Is there a telephone hotline? A. No. Since this is exclusively an on-line and faxnewsletter, there is no telephone hotline. Q. Do I buy at the market or at the price listed in thenewsletter? A. When you get the newsletter and decide to buy a stock, justbuy it at the market or at the bid price. In some cases you willget a worse fill than the price listed in the newsletter and inother cases you will get a better fill. Over time, your fillsshould average out. Q. How do I use the list of top 200 stocks ranked in orderof attractiveness based on relative strength? A. You may use the list of 200 most attractive stocks to pickand choose and build your own personal portfolio. Onestrategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of thatlist. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 200. When a stockdrops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top ofthe list. This is just one way of using the list. You mayprefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personaltaste. Another way to use the list is to buy any stock that makes itto the top 20. To make room in your portfolio, you may have tosell some stocks. We recommend you sell the lowest ranked stocksand buy the top ranked ones. This way you will be rotating out ofweaker stocks into stronger ones. Q. How do you select stocks? A. Our stock selection process incorporates both fundamentaland technical criteria. Every month, we screen thousands ofstocks looking for the handful that have the potential forspectacular stock price increases. We are we looking for emergingcompanies poised for enormous growth or established ones that areabout to make major advances. We want companies whose productsare in such demand that they can't make them fast enough. Oneswith entrepreneurial leadership that is taking advantage oftechnological breakthroughs to create new, super-fast growingbusinesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered bythe financial media and hordes of investors. So we can buy themahead of the pack and take full advantage of the run-up in theirstocks. We set very strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle thepossibilities down to a handful of companies with superiorbalance sheets and liquidity and little or no debt. Then we takethis short list and subject it to a rigorous proprietary systembased on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis. Thissystem ranks the stocks according to their short-term momentumand relative strength. We list the top 200 in every issue of the HotStocks Digest. Q. Are these stocks risky? A. On an individual stock basis, these small-cap stocks arequite volatile and most people would characterize them as beingvery risky. That is why you must diversify over at least 15-20stocks, preferably more. If you have 15 stocks in your portfolioand if four of them lose 25% each, your total portfolio loss isonly 6.66%. Furthermore, its quite possible that some of theother stocks in the portfolio will go up thereby making up forthe small loss. That is why it is imperative that youdiversify your holdings over a number a stocks. Q. My stock is up 250%. Should I sell? A. That depends on your sell strategy. We, however, believe inletting our profits run while cutting our losses short. Q. A certain stock is down 4 points. Are you stillrecommending it? A. Yes. Recommendations on a stock can only change once aweek. If a stock is still in the top 25, then it is rated a buy. Q. As a new subscriber, should I get fully investedimmediately or should I invest gradually? A. Either strategy if fine. The aggressive option is to goahead and buy all stocks in the model portfolio. This way you'llbe fully invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks maybe up 50-100%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another100% or more from these levels.

Justmake sure that you divide your portfolio in the right proportion.For example, if you have $75000 to invest and you buy 5 newstocks this month, then you will buy $5000 worth of each of thesestocks (total $25000) and leave the rest of the $50000 in cash.
