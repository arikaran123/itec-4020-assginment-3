True, small and large specialized mobile radio(SMR) operators seemed irreconcilable in 1995, as they clashed overhow the FCC should change the regulatory landscape at 800 MHz (LMRN,Dec. 22).     But SMRs big and small should be able to see eye to eye on manyregulatory issues that the commission will address this year, Foosanersaid.       "We [in] the SMR industry are going to become common carriers onAug. 10, 1996," said Foosaner.  "And there are eight to 10 outstandingrulemakings that can ... either allow us to move our businessesforward or adversely impact our businesses.  We should have commoninterests in these proceedings, which may hurt the law firms, butwould help the industry."       It is in the interest of all SMRs, for example, to get anexemption from the requirement of having to offer enhanced "911"service (LMRN, Oct. 13).      Among the other questions the commission has yet to decide:       *  Should all CMRS providers be required to resell airtime, ascellular companies must do today (LMRN, Sept. 29)?     *  How should local exchange carriers and CMRS providers becompensated for terminating one another's calls (LMRN, Dec. 22)?     *  Should CMRS providers be required to provide interconnectionsto one another (LMRN, Sept. 29)?                                        ...SMR Operators Drop Interconnect Service     Depending on the rules the FCC imposes on CMRS providers, someSMR operators may find it too onerous to offer interconnect service,said Alan Shark, president and CEO of the American MobileTelecommunications Association (AMTA).  Shark pointed to the possiblerequirement that CMRS providers may have to offer enhanced 911services--as well as pay fees to help subsidize telephone service inunderserved areas.  In addition, they may have to modify theirnetworks to allow for wiretapping by the FBI, he said.     "If you're interconnected, you may find that there are certainresponsibi-lities that come with that ... that may not be worth it."     Another story still unfolding, Shark said, is how the commissionwill define CMRS providers.  Such providers will be subject to certaincommon carrier rules, unlike private mobile radio service providers,which will be exempt.  ...Commission Begins Licensing New Narrowband Channels     This story is about the hope of private land mobile radio (PLMR)users below 512 MHz, who face an ongoing freeze on new narrowbandchannels created by the commission's June refarming decision (LMRN,June 16).     "We're waiting for the development of technical standards," saidFred Day, executive director, government relations of the IndustrialTelecommunications Association (ITA).  Such standards, underdevelopment by the Telecommunications Industry Association (WorkingGroup 8.8), should be available before March 1.  The standards are oneof three requirements for a successful refarming effort, according tothe Land Mobile Communications Council, a confederation of frequencycoordinators and other associations, including ITA.       The second requirement is that the FCC protect low-power offsetsystems at 450-470 MHz from full-power systems.  The third is that theFCC establish deadlines for the transition to more efficienttechnologies.  ...FCC Allocates New Spectrum for Public Safety     The work of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committeepromises to be the major story for public safety radio users thisyear, according to Bob Gurss, legal counsel, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International Inc.  The committee, ajoint venture of the FCC and the National Telecommunications andInformation Administration, is charged with determining the spectrumrequirements of public safety users through the year 2010.       "We feel that it is important that the FCC take some action inthe very near term before all the spectrum gets auctioned off," saidGurss.  "That's our biggest concern."   The committee plans to issue afinal report by September.  Gurss said the FCC may adopt a rulemakingproposal allocating new public safety spectrum and then fold in thereport as comments on the rulemaking.     Another headline to watch for, "FCC Creates New Public SafetyDivision."  Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Chief Michelle Farquharmentioned this possibility in a speech last month.  ...Strong Partnerships Separate Winners and Losers in Paging     It is not enough to be able to sell one-way pagers on your ownanymore, said Scott Baradell, director, corporate communications,Paging Network Inc.. New services that carriers are offering to breakout of the pack require that they invest in alliances to succeed, hesaid.  Voice paging, two-way paging, wireless e-mail:  all requirestrong support from software and hardware developers, such asmanufacturers of personal organizers.  Carriers also will need to findresellers with the expertise to market these products.  Back to Headline List CopyrightLAND MOBILE RADIO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996MOTOROLA SYSTEM OUTAGE LEADS TO STORM OF BAD PUBLICITYVendor Tried To Warn Portland of Potential Problem     A failure by a 3-year-old public safety radio system promoted asa showcase by Motorola Inc. whipped up resentment last month inPortland, Ore., and generated press that is every publicist'snightmare.     Motorola had tried to warn the city:  Two months before theoutage, it sent a bulletin explaining how to reset the SmartZonemanager of the 800 MHz trunked system to prevent overloading.  ButDennis Quail, communications services division director, said hisstaff has no record of receiving it.       He added, "My question is, why wasn't [this parameter] set byMotorola to start with? ... And if Motorola was aware of [the problem]and they've got engineers locally in town, why didn't they come overand make sure it was set [properly]?"     LMRN was unable to contact Motorola executives in time to commenton this article.       But one of Motorola's largest customers said that public safetyagencies must take a measure of responsibility for system failures.       "I would be less critical of the vendor [than Portland is]," saidDavid Held, deputy director-communications division of the MichiganState Police.  "[That's] because a vendor, we must remember, is inbusiness to make money. ... A lot of people put their complete trustin them and figure they'll do everything for them, not thinking whattheir motives are."     Quail responded:  "It's interesting that he might say that.  Wereceived the system from Motorola. ...[The setting] was something that was supposed to have been in place. It's [wrong] that the customer had to find out about it the hard way."     Regardless of who was responsible for the five-hour outage onDec. 12, city public safety officials put Motorola on the grill,speaking out through the city's daily newspaper, The Oregonian.       "Here we have this multimillion-dollar system that allows us totalk to everyone but the Lord himself, and when we need it most, it'sgone," Sgt. Bob Baxter of the Portland Police Bureau was quoted sayingin the Dec. 20 article.  Oregonian reporters were not able to get adetailed response from Motorola.     The Oregonian's editorial page took its own shot:  "Portlandought to be the most cantankerous customer in the country untilIllinois-based Motorola delivers on the city's $8.5 million investmentin an emergency radio system that failed for 5-1/2 hours during lastweek's big windstorm."                                                  ...Director Calls Motorola Responsive     But in an interview this week, David Kish, Portland generalservices director, said that "to be fair, [Motorola] has worked veryhard in the past couple of weeks to fix the problem."  He said thatMotorola has sent roughly a dozen top corporate and engineering staffto investigate the failure, and has placed an engineer on call.       Kish said Motorola believes it has fixed the problem (see sidebar, page 2); later this month, the company plans to test the systemto make sure.       Motorola also plans to upgrade the system's software, whichshould eliminate some "mysterious events" that occurred last summer. One of these caused a "minor outage," Kish said.  "We've had minorproblems from time to time, but Motorola has been reasonablyresponsive," Kish said.       "In any new system like this, you go though a period where youhave bugs."  But, he added, "This was the first big test of thesystem, and it didn't do what it was supposed to do.  It was the firstcitywide emergency that would create this kind of traffic."  The cityplans to run a disaster drill in February to try to rebuild confidenceamong users.     Kish confirmed that the city is withholding $500,000 of the $8.5million system until the city is happy with the system.  The city alsohas suspended visits by prospective customers; more than 100 agenciesfrom China, Japan, Spain, New York City and elsewhere have seen thePortland system.    ...Should Portland Have Taken More Responsibility?     Portland and Motorola collaborated on system design andconstruction, and the city handles ongoing maintenance, according toQuail.  He said the city devotes six full-time technicians to the 800MHz trunked radio system.     Michigan State Police's Held, also a Motorola customer, wasunaware of how much expertise Portland devotes to the system.  But hebelieves that at least some agencies do "fail to have a residentelectrical engineer ... to design and look out for their own needs orto hire a consultant."     When LMRN described Portland's outage, Held said, "I would not betoo critical of Motorola in the scenario you described. ... It'spretty standard in the industry, for example, that you don't mix dataand voice on the same channel.  I would say that that's more theresponsibility of the customer."  Quail responded that there was noway for the city to have realized that the control channel was set forboth voice and data.  "My thinking is, if [Motorola] knew that, whydidn't they come over here, as we still have not accepted the system. And until we believe everything is performing properly, we will not doa final sign-off."  (Dennis Quail, 503/823-6971; David Kish, 503/823-5252; David Held, 517/336-6616; Pat Shod, Motorola, 708/576-6612.) Back to Headline List CopyrightLAND MOBILE RADIO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996WHAT HAPPENED     During a windstorm in Portland, Ore., on Dec. 12, roughly half ofthe emergency workers using a Motorola 800 MHz trunking system wereunable to hear their dispatchers, according to David Kish, Portlandgeneral services director.  The system failure lasted roughly fivehours.  Kish said the problem has been traced to a control channelthat was set for both voice and data, when it should have been setonly for data.       When the system was flooded with calls during the windstorm, itwas unable to assign channels quickly enough.  According to Kish, theproblem was exasperated by workers who kept clicking their units,rather than clicking them once, then waiting for a call-back.      Kish said that nothing bad happened as a result of the outage. Emergency workers were able to talk to one another using simplexchannels, and they improvised communications with the dispatchersusing data channels and cellular phones.  Some police and firefightersalso used a backup land mobile radio system.     Communications services division Director Dennis Quail said thatMotorola plans to rewrite the link protocol between the SmartZonemanager and the 6809 controller to permanently fix the setting ondata.**********************************************************************     At press time, the FCC announced that round 14 of the 900 MHz SMRauction took in $61.7 million, excluding withdrawal payments.  Therewere 81 new bids placed, down from 86 in the previous round.**********************************************************************Back to Headline List CopyrightLAND MOBILE RADIO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996TOP 10 STORIES OF 19951. FCC Begins Refarming of Private Land Mobile Radio Spectrum Below512 MHz: The commission adopted the latest in a series of refarmingorders to increase spectrum efficiency.  The fallout in equipmentchoices, channel availability and frequency coordination will be feltfor years (LMRN, June 16, Oct. 20, Dec. 1).2. FCC Tries To Please Big and Small With 800 MHz SMR Order:  Thecommission walked a narrow tightrope--some might call it a plank--intrying to balance the interests of large and small specialized mobileradio companies in its December order.  Barring delays, look forauctions in late spring or early summer.  Small companies mounted oneof the largest land mobile lobbying campaigns in recent memory toprotect their interests (LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 22). 3. AT&T, MCI and Sprint Enter the Paging Marketplace:  The big-threelong-distance companies all got into paging this year in a big way: MCI Communications Corp. through resale agreements with SkyTel Corp.and Paging Network Inc.; Sprint Corp. through a resale agreement withPaging Network Inc.; and AT&T through its purchase of McCaw CellularCommunications Inc. (LMRN, Jan. 6, Sept. 29, Dec. 15).4. FCC Issues 'Wish List' To Improve FCC Procedures:  A 32-page FCCreport on reinventing government provided the foundation for severalfar-reaching initiatives, including the proposed expansion of theFCC's auction authority--now proposed as part of the 1996 budget bill--and the simplifying of application procedures (LMRN, Feb. 3).5. SMR Industry Growth Kept on Ice:  MTA-EMCI Inc. this fall predictedthat the number of specialized mobile radio (SMR) subscribers wouldgrow 13 percent this year.  Observers blamed part of the lacklustergrowth on regulatory uncertainty at 800 MHz, including an applicationfreeze dating from the summer of 1994.6. Public Safety Advisory Committee Formed: The Public Safety WirelessAdvisory Committee was formed this summer to determine public safetyspectrum requirements to the year 2010.  Hearing complaints that theFCC and National Telecommunications and Information Administrationsometimes worked at cross-purposes, the House Subcommittee onAppropriations (Commerce) asked the two to jointly sponsor the publicsafety committee (LMRN, Aug. 4).7. Congress Proposes Uniform Antenna Tower Rules:  The House versionof the telecommunications deregulation bill (H.R. 1555) would directthe FCC to adopt policies regarding state and local regulation oftowers for commercial mobile radio services providers.  A compromiseversion between the House and Senate versions of the bill still isbeing worked out (LMRN, May 19).8. 220 MHz Players May Be Forced To Return Money to Arizona Investors:Specialized mobile radio (SMR) companies sat up this summer when wereported that the Arizona Corporation Commission had accused SMRAdvisory Group, L. C. and several affiliated companies and executivesof running afoul of securities laws.  The case reflects efforts tocrack down on the sale of unregistered securities to ill-informedinvestors (LMRN, July 21).  The case may be decided in early 1996.9. APCO 25 Celebrates Incomplete Standard:  Although the Associationof Public Safety Communications Officials International Inc.celebrated completion of the APCO 25 digital standard, critics werequick to point out that the association still had work to do on thetrunking protocols (LMRN, Aug. 18).10. SkyTel Launches Two-way Paging:  SkyTel Corp. got the jump onrival paging carriers this fall by becoming the first company tolaunch two-way paging service over narrowband personal communicationsservices (PCS) channels.  Although Motorola Inc. was forced to takeback an early batch of defective units, by December SkyTel executivessaid that several thousand units were in the hands of paying customers(LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 1).Back to Headline List CopyrightLAND MOBILE RADIO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996NEW DEFINITIONS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC SERVICES     The next meeting of the Public Safety Wireless AdvisoryCommittee-slated for Jan. 7-9 in Berkeley, Calif.--will take place,even if the FCC and National Telecommunications and InformationAdministration remain shut down.

The request likely will be filed by mid-February in a petition for reconsideration and clarification.  Theassociation also plans to ask for an extension of the 800 MHzrulemaking proposal's comment period.     AMTA will decide what else to ask for in a meeting of its smallbusiness council, regulatory forum and board of directors later thismonth, Lyon said.       Along with bidding credits, AMTA likely willask the FCC to reconsider its plan to partly base the upfront paymenton how incumbered a license is.  Lyon called this equation burdensomeboth for the commission and for bidders.  AMTA also will ask the FCCto clarify how it plans to allow early nego-tiations betweenincumbents and prospective auction winners.  What if these companiesdo not win? asked Lyon.  Will they still have to pay the costs ofretuning the incumbents?

A Motorolaspokesperson said that supply is expected to catch up with demand inthe next couple of months.  She attributed the shortfall to the fastgrowth of the U.S. paging market, which took Motorola by surprise.     During an analysts' teleconference Jan. 3, Steven Jacoby, chiefoperating officer of Metrocall Inc., said that since the beginning ofAugust, Motorola has not been able to fill its pager orders on time.       The situation has improved "tremendously" in the last few weeks,to the point where Motorola fills roughly 90 percent of any particularMetrocall order on time, he said.  On time means four to six weeks,Jacoby said.      However, Metrocall still is having difficulty getting enoughUltra Express and Encore numeric pagers and Advisor alphanumericpagers to meet demand.       Jacoby said that the entire industry has felt the pagershortfall.  Indeed, a spokesman for Paging Network Inc., the country'slargest paging carrier, acknowledged "periodic" shortages at Motorola. However, they have had no impact on the company's subscriber growth,he said.     Vincent Kelly, Metrocall chief financial officer, told analyststhat the company logged its strongest subscriber growth ever in thefourth quarter ended Dec. 31.  It added more than 60,000 paging unitsin service.  That is a leap over the third quarter's 42,000 gain, whenpager delays were at their worst.       "The problem that we had [that] quarter ... was [that] wecouldn't get our hands on product--period," said Kelly.        Metrocall's stock had dropped 39 percent from $29 on Sept. 21 to$17.75 the day of the conference (Jan. 3).  Yesterday (Jan. 4), thestock fell another $1.25 to $16.50.  Here are some other facts thatemerged in the analysts's meeting, in which company officialsattempted to shore up investor confidence.       *  Metrocall has its eye on several possible acquisition targets,which together have more than 700,000 subscribers.  Currently thecompany, the country's sixth-largest carrier, has an estimated 940,000subscribers.     *  Metrocall is talking with five paging carriers about resellingtheir advanced paging services over narrowband PCS channels.       *  More than 41 percent of the company's subscriber base has beenwon by indirect distribution channels.  Metrocall recently signeddistribution agreements with nationwide retailer Ritz Camera CentersInc., Beltsville, Md., and catalog sales company Crutchfield Corp.,Charlottesville, Va.     *  The company recently increased its direct sales force by 100people.  Back to Headline List CopyrightLAND MOBILE RADIO NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996IN BRIEF     Glenayre Technologies Inc.  has introduced new network standardsdesigned to increase paging network capacity by nearly 100 times.  Thenew protocols are called Wireless Messaging transfer protocol (WMtp)and the Wireless Messaging application programming interface (WMapi). WMtp, which can coexist with the Telocator Network Paging Protocol(TNPP).  It is based on the Transmission Control Protocol/InternetProtocol (TCP/IP) used in the Internet and allows operators totransmit Internet mail to pagers.  WMapi lets service providers createtwo-way messaging applications for narrowband personal communicationsservices (PCS) networks, including those supporting Telocator MessageEntry (TME) standard.

Well over half of theFCC's backlog of 8,000 931-MHz paging applications are mutuallyexclusive, and those applications are likely to be awarded byauctions, industry sources said.       According to Don Vasek, senior issues manager-industry affairsfor the Personal Communications Industry Association, the commissionsince June 1995 has talked about adopting a rulemaking proposal toresolve the mutually exclusive licenses.  However, we were unable tocontact FCC officials to comment on an expected release date due tothe partial government shutdown.       Vasek's talks with FCC officials suggest that the commission willselect major trading areas (MTAs) and basic trading areas (BTAs) asthe geographic boundaries for the licenses.  It also will chooseauctions to award them, he believes.  ...Other Applications Also Pending      The FCC essentially has had an application freeze in place at 931MHz since December 1994, Vasek said.  Part of the holdup stems fromthe lack of a spectrum-sharing treaty with Mexico.       The commission had planned to meet with Mexican officials latelast month to decide how to share paging frequencies in border areas. At press time, we were unable to find out whether an agreement hadbeen reached.  The commission has been reluctant to grant newapplications for fear that the treaty--or lack of one--would have a"daisy-chain" effect on existing and pending licenses, Vasek said.     In addition, over the past six months the FCC has been developingsoftware and improving its data base to automate the processing of 931MHz applications.  That software has just been completed, Vasek said.      According to Vasek, several dozen paging carriers, from smalllocal operators up to nationwide carriers, have 931 MHz applicationspending.  He said the expected rulemaking may ask the industry tocomment on whether the new regulatory framework at 931 MHz should alsobe applied to 929 MHz, UHF and VHF bands.       Vasek said that there is "probably little chance of thathappening," however, because those frequencies have been used heavilyfor "years and years and years."

But money must be spent wisely so that returnson investment improve and profits grow.Federal legislation - if it indeed passes - as well as numberportability and universal service trials, will play a key rolein hastening local competition's development.  But if a federallaw doesn't make it onto the books this year, and permanentsolutions for the technical details are not resolved, then itcould take almost two years for competition to becomewidespread.Pundits have said that if federal legislation doesn't pass thisyear, it may not have another shot until 1997 or 1998 because'96 is a politically charged presidential election year.But as long as key congressional legislators make it known tothe industry that reform will come to the forefront again, it'sexpected development of competitive markets will continue,albeit slowly."As long as we have the impending threat, it will forcecompanies to strategize and negotiate a market position that isgood for us all," D.

Things are happening so quickly in the statesand gaining momentum."But without federal legislation, competitive providers will haveto continue fighting a state-by-state legislative and regulatorybattle.States, however, will continue to advance telecom competition.Even less progressive states, such as North Dakota and Montana,may get caught up in the reform momentum.States also will play a key role in developing permanentinterconnection rules and number portability, and will work toestablish a universal service funding mechanism appropriate forcompetitive markets.There are several active trials for number portability and apermanent solution should be decided on by year's end."Policies may be in place [by '96], but implementation will takeuntil 1997," said Rick Kozak, president and COO of AmericanCommunications Services Inc. (ACSI).There will be a domino effect for instituting number portabilitywhen permanent solutions exist."Once we get [number portability] in place in one state, theothers will fall," MFS's Holland said.The issue needs to be forced through by regulators, Brooks'Young, told LCR.  If not, "the local exchange companies willkeep trying to roll out number portability and pass unwarrantedcosts to competitors."The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now is exploringnumber portability in a notice of proposed rulemaking, but it isdoubtful the commission will devise more than an outline forimplementation.The FCC needs to be more proactive in the development of localcompetition, industry leaders believe."We need a higher awareness from the FCC" in order to establishfair interconnection rates and slow down premature lifting ofRBOC regulation, said Robert Annunziata, chairman, president andCEO of Teleport Communications Group.1996 and beyond will see former competitive access providers(CAPs) continue to layer on new services and add switches tobecome new and improved local exchange companies - but that maybe costly."It's somewhat facetious for CAPs to say they will be one-stopshops," said ACSI's Kozak.Kozak believes CAPs should focus on their core strengths - suchas circumventing the RBOCs networks for long-distance providers- rather than spreading themselves thin as a local exchangecompany."More companies die from indigestion than starvation," Kozaksaid.But other companies believe their game plan must includeswitches in order to become truly competitive."CAPs will have to offer switched services" to gain acompetitive edge, said J. Shelby Bryan, president and CEO ofIntelCom Group Inc.IntelCom and others plan to move into the switched mode in '96and beyond."All of our switched services will not be put on by 1997," saidBrooks' Young.It's likely today's budding local exchange companies will beswallowed up by some of the market's big fish.For instance, there has been speculation as to whether MCI willbuyout companies such as ACSI to help jumpstart it's localsubsidiary MCImetro with existing operations.And MFS long has been touted as a prize to be acquired - but itcould be MFS that does the buying.The first move in this direction already has been made by BrooksFiber Communications, which bought City Signal early last week.Back to Headline List CopyrightLOCAL COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996BROOKS FIBER SHARPENS ITS TEETH WITH CITY SIGNAL ACQUISITIONBrooks Fiber Properties is starting its new year off with a bang- with acquisitions, co-carrier agreements and hitting amilestone in number of networks.Local Competition Report has learned that Brooks has signed aletter of intent to buy City Signal.At press time, no details had been released about the priceBrooks paid for the Grand Rapids, Mich.-based competitiveprovider, which operates a 25-route-mile Michigan networkextending through Grand Rapids, Holland, Zeeland and TraverseCity.Speculation has run high through the industry about what wouldbecome of City Signal since its parent company, US Signal, soldits long-distance subsidiary Teledial last fall (LCR, Oct. 30,1995).At the time of the $115 million sale, City Signal said it wasplanning to use the proceeds to fuel its expansion throughoutwestern Michigan and possibly beyond state borders.The Brooks/City Signal deal is only the beginning of a trendyshakeup in the competitive access industry, analysts believe."There's going to be a definite wave of consolidation," DarrellJ. Edmonds, associate managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co.,told Local Competition Report last week.  Edmonds sees Brooks,as well as other competitors such as MFS, swallowing up thesmaller guys in order to enter a market more quickly.This move is definitely in line with Brooks' strategy, accordingto Stuart Conrad, vice president of C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche BankSecurities.Brooks will continue to swallow up smaller competitive accessproviders (CAPs) on their way to becoming one of the largestproviders in second- and third-tier markets.The company has an aggressive game plan and met its goals for1995.Just under the wire, Brooks Fiber Properties captured the lasttwo cities to reach its goal of being in 20 cities by the end ofthe year.  Brooks plans to invest more than $20 million to buildand operate fiber-optic networks in Stockton, Calif., andJackson, Miss.And with the purchase of City Signal, Brooks brings the tally ofcities it's in up to 24 after the first week of 1996.  By theend of this year, Brooks expects to be in more than 30 markets.A co-carrier agreement Brooks made with Nynex last week removedthe last hurdle for providing local service in Massachusetts.Brooks will install a switch in Springfield, Mass., and plans tooffer competitive dialtone services in the first quarter of '96.In other acquisition moves, Brooks Fiber merged with its parentcompany, Brooks Telecommunications, and the parent company'sprimary operating company GLA International.  The move wasdesigned to bring GLA's capabilities of telecom engineering andconsulting activities to Brooks Fiber."Our new relationship will allow us to leverage the technicalexpertise and industry experience of GLA in all areas oftelecommunications to facilitate the rapid expansion plans ofBrooks Fiber," said Jim Moffit, GLA's managing director.The surviving company will be Brooks Fiber Properties.Back to Headline List CopyrightLOCAL COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996TIME WARNER SEEKS PUCO AID IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH AMERITECHTime Warner Communications sent out an SOS to the PublicUtilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for help in finalizing aninterconnection agreement with  local incumbent Ameritech.But Ameritech claims that the cable company-turned-competitivephone provider is engaging in a war of words intended to keepthe telco out of the cable business.Time Warner had hoped to have a deal sealed by Dec. 31, 1995,but the deadline passed without one.With the PUCO's help, Time Warner hopes the last few economicdetails can be worked out by Jan. 15.  If a deal can't bereached, Time Warner said it will have to delay its plans to bea competitor in the local switched service arena.In its second required 60-day report to the commission on thestatus of negotiations, Time Warner said all the technicaldetails of interconnection have been fleshed out in the good-faith negotiations, but now comes the sticky part.There are costs, for things such as interim number portabilityand other items that neither company would comment on, that mustbe ironed out before Time Warner can begin providing service.The PUCO's staff most likely will sit in on final negotiationsbetween the competitors.  "We haven't made an offer yet," KerryStroup, assistant directors of the PUCO's utility department,told Local Competition Report at its deadline.  But he said thatdoesn't mean one isn't in the making.Time Warner could have filed a complaint with the PUCO, but hasnot yet done so because it felt a compromise could be reachedwith the commission's assistance."We didn't file a complaint because we're trying to keep thisbelow the level of a nuclear war," Marsha Schermer, regulatoryvice president for Time Warner's mid-West region, told LCR.But the A-bomb may drop anyway.Ameritech vehemently believes Time Warner is engaging in anegative publicity campaign that will sway Columbus, Ohio, cityofficials to delay or deny a cable franchise to the telco.Time Warner's Schermer calls that "fascinating speculation."In November, Ameritech and Time Warner apparently reached anagreement on several key points.  But, in mid-December, TimeWarner came back with a new list of demands, according to JamesC. Smith, Ameritech Ohio vice president.These new demands are what has caused the delay, Smith told LCR."We didn't put on the table anything that looked new late in thegame," Schermer said.Schermer said Ameritech has willingly negotiated the detailsthus far, but believes Ameritech Information Industry Services(AIIS) - the unit involved in negotiations - may not able tomake the final decision.It is possible that another of Ameritech's seven business unitswill have to get involved before all is said and done.Smith noted that AIIS has been the lead negotiator for severalinterconnection deals in Illinois and Michigan.  AIIS has finalauthority to approve all aspects of the deal."It is especially ironic that Time Warner has chosen to use thistactic when their own representatives have admitted thatAmeritech's cooperation has gone beyond what they haveexperienced in other non-Ameritech states," Smith said.Optimism remains that a deal can beworked out by Time Warner'sJan. 15 deadline."If Time Warner is serious, one can be worked out," saidAmeritech's Smith.  "The question is do they want one."Ameritech's Smith said he feels that Time Warner believes lackof an interconnection agreement may keep the telco out of Ohio'scable market.Time Warner is seeking a regional agreement so it can hook upwith the incumbent local exchange company (LEC)  in the threeAmeritech states it has operations:  Ohio, Wisconsin andIndiana.Unfortunately for competitors in these three states, Ameritechdoes not have the same willingness to interconnect as it does inIllinois and Michigan.In these two states, Ameritech is seeking acceptance of itsCustomers First plan, which would allow the local provider intothe long-distance market."Does Ameritech want to be the leader  in supporting local phonecompetition, like their ads say?" Schermer said.  "If it is sucha good idea [in Illinois and Michigan], why not in Ohio,Wisconsin or Indiana?"MFS Communications, one of the other certified competitors inOhio, just entered into negotiations with Ameritech Ohio.  Andthough progress is being made, MFS predicts it will not have aneasy time of it."Ameritech has different motivation there than in Chicago," saidDan Caruso, vice president of MFS's local servicesimplementation group.MFS already has an interconnection deal with Ameritech inIllinois and hopes it can transcend state boundaries."Some aspects can be regionalized, but for others it will benecessary to treat them on a state-by-state basis," Caruso said.IntelCom Group, which has an application pending in the state,also said it expected to initiate interconnection talks withAmeritech this week.MCImetro, which has been approved by state regulators, has yetto seek out an interconnection deal, Ameritech said.Back to Headline List CopyrightLOCAL COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996MARYLAND PUTS PERMANENT RULES IN PLACE & RATES ARE BEST AROUNDMaryland's got a good deal on interconnection rates.In its permanent rules regarding local competition adopted lastweek, the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) has set upinterconnection rates of .5 cents a minute - lower than eventhose rates of between .5 cents and .75 cents a minute set up bytrendsetting states like Illinois."This was a dramatic improvement over the interim rates (2.1cents a minute)," Gary Ball, MFS Communications' director ofregulatory affairs for the Eastern Region, told LocalCompetition Report.  "This sends a strong signal that thecommission is looking for companies to come in and compete."Issues such as number portability and universal service willhave to be addressed in additional rulemakings, said LarryBugden, vice president of Teleport Communications Group'sMaryland network.Development of universal service is one of Bell Atlantic'sprimary concerns.In addition to setting interconnection rates, the PSC set forththe terms by which new local exchange companies can buy dialtonelines from Bell Atlantic, either whole or in part.The commission's order also ensured customers will have accessto "911" services and, thanks to an interim number portabilityplan, they will be able to keep their current phone number evenif they switch providers.Under the ruling, new competitors will be able to establishtheir own local calling areas or use the same area set up byBell Atlantic.Back to Headline List CopyrightLOCAL COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996FAILED COMPETITION BILLS IN ARK. AND MO., LEAD LEGISLATIVELOSSESAmong the unsuccessful legislative initiatives in 1995 werelegislative attempts in Arkansas and Missouri to open all localservices to competition and allow price-based alternativeregulation systems.In both states, Southwestern Bell and GTE mounted a successfullobbying campaign that squashed all attempts from movingforward.  Southwestern Bell reportedly spent more than $5million on its lobbying just in Missouri to stop the state'slocal competition bill.Other unsuccessful legislation included a Washington state billthat would have prohibited intraLATA toll dialing parity until1998.  Although the bill passed the legislature, Washington Gov.Mike Lowry vetoed it as being contrary to the general pro-competition direction of state telecom policy.Another casualty included an Indiana bill that would haverequired state certification of any provider of two-way videoservices.This seemingly-simple bill was withdrawn by sponsors in the faceof massive lobbying by cable TV interests that claimed it wouldrequire them to obtain state territorial certificates in orderto provide interactive video services to schools or libraries,and would give telcos a way to thwart commercial development ofinteractive cable TV services until the telcos were able toenter that market.Nebraska was unable to pass a bill that would have given thePublic Service Commission jurisdiction over cable TV videoservice quality and the power to resolve certain types ofconsumer complaints involving cable TV video services.Telephone companies, eyeing eventual entry into video services,had pushed for the bill in hopes of consolidating handling ofvideo quality issues and customer video-service complaints atthe state level, rather than leaving these with scores of localgovernments.A North Dakota Senate bill to raise the maximum size for aderegulated small telco to 50,000 lines failed to win passage,although backers managed to push through a House bill raisingthe size limit for deregulated status from 3,000 lines to 8,000lines.Back to Headline List CopyrightLOCAL COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 8, 1996CABLE & WIRELESS ONE-STOP SHOP UP-AND-RUNNING IN NEW YORK CITYAdd Cable & Wireless Inc. (CWI) to the growing list of long-distance providers getting their fingers in the local servicecookie jar.But according to industry watchdogs, CWI may not be asformidable of an opponent as the big three interexchangecarriers."I would be more concerned if companies said they weren'tgetting into new markets," said Brian Adamik, an analyst at TheYankee Group.  "Now we're going to see solely communicationsservices companies rather than local telephone and long-distancecarriers."Although CWI is the first long-distance provider to offer resoldlocal service to customers in New York City, it seems that itsinitial scope will be limited.CWI will market its UniLink package of local and long-distanceservice to its current business customers, which total more than100,000 nationwide.But the company plans an aggressive attack on the market.CWI received authority in November to be a local exchangeprovider in Connecticut and awaits word from commissioners inCalifornia, Illinois and Texas."Our intent is to go national, [but] driving that is theregulatory environment," Alan Stiffler, director of strategicoperations at CWI, told LCR last week.CWI initially will resell local service from the networks ofincumbent LECs, competitive access providers or cable companies,depending on what's available in various markets."Once we reach critical mass, we intend to be a facilities-basedprovider," Stiffler said.UniLink is up and running in New York City now after a nine-month beta test ended last month.

The RHCs, however, are opposed by powerful informationalservices and consumer lobbies that for years have been tellingthe American public that if the restrictions are relaxed, theRHCs may increase rates for voice services to subsidize the newservices.     This year's campaign will claim through published articles,mailings and print advertisements that 80% of the American publicsupports the holding companies and wants the sophisticatedinformational services the local Bell operating companies (BOCs)want to provide, but--because of the restrictions--legallycannot.     The RHCs know that they must excite the American public intoaction so Congress will be compelled to address what amounts tothe formation of a national telecommunications policy, THE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER has been told.  If the issue is swept under a rugonce again, America's role as a telecommunications leader in theglobal market may be threatened.     Legislation that will revise Greene's oversight of the MFJis among high-priority items on the House telecommunicationssubcommittee list, we are told, and will be pushed early in thelegislative session by subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey (D-Mass.)      Greene's restrictions to keep the holding companies out ofthe manufacturing, long-distance and informational servicesbusinesses have kept half of the nation's telecommunicationsindustry idle, the RHCs complain and may reduce America's futurein the telecommunications explosion to that of a buyer offoreign-made goods and services.Again, RHCs Say That the Situation Has Changed in Last 6 Years     Conditions that existed 6 years ago when divestiture wasordered have been outdistanced by changing world conditions, theRHCs claim.  Located and oriented to regional markets, thecompanies claim they do not have the capability any longer ofdeveloping the monopoly that was foreseen in Greene's ruling.     The RHCs also say that America already has fallen behindother countries where such services as electronic mail delivery,data inquiry, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, cabletelevision and others are being provided by telephone companies.     France's Minitel has offered videotex and electronicservices since the mid-1980s, building a customer base of 5million by providing free terminals.  Today the government-subsidized company adds 10,000 customers per month and no longerprovides free terminals.     Minitel's customers can use their videotex terminals to makeairplane reservations, trade in stock, buy from a catalog or findout about weather conditions,employment opportunities, local roadconditions, and telephone and address listings from a databaseinquiry service that accounts for 20% of the system's traffic.     According to a study commissioned by the RHCs late lastyear, 3 out of 4 Americans believe that "it is absolutelycritical" that this country provide services offered by othercountries.  Four out of every 5 people in the survey said theywould use a telephone computer to make appointments, reviewsupermarket "specials," communicate with government or schoolofficials or scan community "bulletin boards" if those serviceswere available on their telephone lines.Public Pretty Much in the Dark About Strictures, Study Finds      Amazingly, according to Dr. Harold E. Quinley, a seniorvice president for Yankelovick, Clancy and Shulman, the Westport,Conn., research firm that conducted the survey for the RHCs, ofthe 17,000 who participated in the survey, few knew that localtelephone companies could not provide the services described inthe survey, and most were surprised to learn that the reason theservices were unavailable was because of restrictions by thefederal government!     "We are sure that the people we talked to did not know(about the restrictions),"  Quinley told us.  He said surveyorsprovided partial explanations of the restrictions to each persontaking part in the survey.  Some RHC lobbyists reported "victory"in the last Congress with 2 anti-divestiture bills--one in theHouse and one in the Senate--and see an early introduction ofrevised bills this session.  However, even though membersdescribed last session's bills as "highly charged" with "stronginterest on all sides,"  the bills did not get out of committeesbecause members were not compelled by their constituents to takeaction, observers said.     One House member, sympathetic to the RHCs' cause, said lastyear that divestiture was "very esoteric" and not a subject thatwas often discussed "at the dinner tables of middle America."But the telephone companies hope that much will be changed thissession, said Sam Simon, a Washington-based telecommunicationsconsultant who heads Issue Dynamics Inc.  He said RHC lobbyists"are already jockeying" to be in position when divestiturelegislation is revived.     Simon said the holding companies--whose revenues were cutwhen they were severed by the court from the parent company 6years ago--"crucially" need the added incomes the restrictedservices would provide.  But, Simon said, they may be content toaccept compromise legislation from Congress if a Court of Appealsdecision expected in the spring alters rulings Greene maderecently to uphold the 1984 restrictions.  "If for instance, thecourt lifts restrictions against information services, the BOCsmight be satisfied with legislation that retains the otherrestrictions," Simon said.     But other observers aren't so sure. Catherine Sloan, whomonitors legislation for the Competitive TelecommunicationsAssociation (CompTel), told us the RHCs would not likely besatisfied with a compromise.  "They need the long-distanceservice to provide the information services, and they need theability to research, develop and manufacture new technology tosupport all their services," she said.Legislation Could Result in New National Policy     Mike Brand, a spokesman in Chicago for American InformationTechnologies Corp. (Ameritech), one of the 7 RHCs, told us theRHCs were "set up" to push for legislation that will eventuallyresult in a new national telecommunications policy.  He said theholding companies rely on "substantial contacts" with Washingtonlegislators and "grassroots" campaigns in congressional districtsthat urge telephone users to tell their Washingtonrepresentatives that they do not favor the restrictions.     In past years, Ameritech has stuffed dividend envelopes withbulletins urging its shareholders to write their congressmenabout the divestiture restrictions, involved educational andpublic-policy organizations that rely on Ameritech researchgrants and received unexpected help from well-known radiocommentator Paul Harvey, for its cause.      Harvey, whose daily broadcasts reach a vast nationalaudience, told listeners "the Congress must be made to realizethat information is the lifeblood of contemporary commerce andindustry."  He said,  "The Baby Bells, although orphaned by MaBell, have picked themselves up, dusted themselves off andcontinue to serve the public and to profit and prosper."      Brand said the endorsement--while appreciated--"wascompletely Harvey's own doing" and that his dinner appearancebefore Ameritech managers 6 days before the broadcast, for whichhe received his normal $30,000 fee, did not influence the contentof Harvey's radio broadcast.Lobbyists Should Seize on Association Opinions     Simon, who presents seminars to Congress about issues facingthe telecommunications industry in behalf of Bell clients, saidthe RHCs must gain support from national consumer organizationssuch as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) ifthey are going to gain favorable legislation.     But the AARP does not make up its official mind until laterthis month, when the membership will be polled on thetelecommunications issue, said AARP senior policy analyst LarryFenster.  AARP--whose members are retired and live on fixedincomes--is one of Washington's strongest consumer lobbies.  Itplanned to reveal a "new in-depth telecommunications study on theexpanding information services and their impact on consumers andpolicy choices at a press conference [Jan. 11].     The Consumer Federation of America, which joined AARP inthat press conference, has been on record to oppose the relaxingof restrictions, stating that the new services will mean highercosts for basic voice services and the possibility of anothermonopoly.     But the major opposition comes from the American NewspaperPublishers Association (ANPA), whose members have fearedcompetition from electronic classified and directory inquiryservices from phone companies for more than a decade.     Not only have ANPA members appeared before Congress'committees to speak against loosening the restrictions, buteditorials in members' newspapers consistently remind readers(and members of Congress) that relaxing the restrictions mightwell mean a move toward government control of the information-generating process and a violation of the First Amendment.     While the players align themselves for the legislativekickoff, a smaller game--played at the U.S. Court of Appealswhere the RHCs are seeking legal relief from Greene'srestrictions--has produced strange teammates.     The Justice Department--the same federal agency that carriedthe burden of the government's year-long trial that shatteredAT&T's 100-year monopoly in 1983 and created the restrictions--filed briefs recently stating the time may be ripe to relax thoserestrictions.In the End, MFJ Impacts Nation's Bottom Line, Justice Says      Justice said in the brief that continuing Greene'srestrictions could be harmful to the telecommunications industrythat, Justice said, "measures in the billions dollars."  Justicesaid that continuing the restrictions concerns the well-being ofthe "country's entire national welfare and security."     The brief justifies relaxing the restrictions because oftechnological advances, developing global markets and thecorporate health of competitors that precludes one firm attaininga monopoly position.     Although not the major concern, the Justice Department citesthe administrative "burden" caused by more than 200 waivers theRHCs have filed since 1984, creating heavy workloads for both theJustice Department and the court system.     Before the Court of Appeals can make a decision, 3 judgesmust review thousands of pages of testimony and examine hundredsof exhibits submitted during the lengthy court process.Testimony taken in the 1987 triennial review alone--which is thesubject of the appeal--has created a document containing morethan 6,000 pages.     Early last fall, hundreds of typewritten pages written bydozens of attorneys representing many of the 80 different partiesinterested in the appeal--along with exhibits--were submitted tothe court simply to request that each side present 2 hours oforal argument to the court.  Those briefs took several months tofile and filled several folders in the clerk's office.  But thosearguments--granted after the court presumably reviewed the briefsand examined the exhibits--were heard Dec. 6.      They lasted exactly 4 hours.     (Editor's note: The preceding article is second in a plannedseries docu-menting proposed changes in the modified finaljudgment and how such changes will impact the long-distanceindustry.)Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNetJanuary, 1990CONGRESS, BUREAUCRACY HAVE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WITH NEW PHONESYSTEMS     While Congress and its bureaucracy may be wrangling overnational telecommunications policies later this year (seepreceding story), it is hoped that Hill and agency staffers willbe making clearer and more efficient long-distance and localcalls thanks to multi-billion-dollar technology now beinginstalled in Washington and 1,200 other government locales.     When the final cutover from the old FTS long-distance systemis completed in May, nearly 1 million federal employees will beusing up-to-date fiber optics and the new FTS 2000 system.     Two of the major suppliers, AT&T and US Sprint, were awardedthe 10-year contract by the General Services Administration (GSA)in mid-1989 over the protest of MCI, a late-bidder that claimedAT&T's prices did not reflect true costs.  MCI subsequentlythreatened legal action.      AT&T was given 60% of the contract and US Sprint theremaining 40%.  Both vendors will have an opportunity to re-bidthe contract in its fourth and seventh year.     The contract was awarded to supply basic voice service tothe agencies but allows the vendors to offer added voice services(such as 800), video switched data services and digitalintegrated services as needed that potentially raise thecontract's value to $25 BILLION over the 10-year life of thecontract, making it the largest federal civilian contract everawarded!     Not only is the government's long-distance service beingimproved, but 34 U.S. agencies and 130,000 federal employeesscattered throughout the Washington area have new desktoptelephones, switchboards, wiring and switches as a result of a$282 million contract awarded last January to the Washington,D.C.-based C&P Telephone Co.     The goal of that new system--known as Washington InteragencyTelecommunications Service (WITS)--is to update governmentoffices with advanced technology and services available to theprivate sector and the military. Complete installation will take3 years.Watchdog Agencies Keep Eye on Costs of New Systems     While still in the hands of technicians and installers, thesystems nevertheless have the attention of the GAO [Congress'investigative arm] that is overseeing the work to see that it isdone on time and according to the specifications of the contract,and a Senate investigating committee that is concerned that thecontract's huge dollar value could generate waste and possibleirregularities.     Ron Famous, a GAO evaluator, assures us that the first fourFTS switchovers--which started in October--have been on scheduleand on-site work problems, minimal, so far.  GAO also regularlyobserves work progress being made by AT&T and US Sprinttechnicians who--possibly for the first time--work side by side,bringing the agencies on line.     Jack Brock, a GAO spokesman, said a comprehensive breakdownof the complicated FTS 2000 contract is being prepared formembers of Congress "so they will have an understanding of whatthey bought."     Investigators from Sen. John Glenn's (D-Ohio) SenateGovernmental Affairs Committee also are observing FTS' progress,mostly  because of a 1988 investigation the committee conductedthat resulted in the resignation of a GSA executive who admittedto contract irregularities with bidders for FTS servicecontracts.Investigation Tightened Contract Procedures     That investigation--involving AT&T and BellSouth, both ofwhich were bidders on a dozen federal service contracts worthabout $55 million--tightened contract award procedures used byGSA in awarding the new FTS and WITS contracts, THE LONG-DISTANCELETTER was told.     Sureshar Lal Soni, the $60,000-a-year GSA executive,allegedly "slipped" confidential AT&T bid information tocompetitor BellSouth, where his daughter was employed whilecontracts were being bid.  Soni later pled guilty to criminalcharges of accepting $400 in meals from BellSouth while BellSouthand AT&T competed for contracts to service electronic tandemnetwork switches on the FTS system.     Soni, who faced up to a year in prison and fines up to$100,000, was fined $2,000 and placed on one year's probationlast April by a federal magistrate. Under terms of his pleaagreement, Soni resigned as director of GSA's Office of NetworkServices, where he supervised the review of technical and costevaluations submitted by vendors seeking FTS contracts and is nowbelieved to be working for a private telecommunications company.     Michael Corrigan, an investigator for the GovernmentalAffairs Committee, said the committee's investigation turned up anumber of problems associated with telephone service contractsand changes have been made in the agency's telephone contractingprocedures.     He said that, so far, nothing appears irregular about thenew contracts, but the committee plans periodic reviews of theprojects.  "There's just too much money involved not to,"Corrigan told us.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNetJanuary, 1990NATIONAL AUDIENCE FOR 900 SERVICE DOESN'T MATERIALIZE DURINGDECEMBER     900's debut as a prime-time television attraction (TLDL,November 1989, pp. 1-4) was less than successful last month withonly 21,000 viewers--out of an expected 175,000--paying $2 ontheir telephone bill to participate in a national volunteerrecruiting drive backed by the White House, THE LONG-DISTANCELETTER has learned.     Participants in the mid-December test that exposed 900numbers to 290 million primetime viewers of 6 of America's mostpopular television shows are meeting in California Jan. 20 todetermine--among other things--if the 900 telephone number is aviable national marketing tool.     The 900 numbers were flashed on the screen near theconclusion of such popular programs as "Cheers," "DesigningWomen" and "The Cosby Show," urging viewers to dial the numberand obtain the list.  The project's organizers criticized thenetworks for not giving the number more exposure and notproviding storylines that gave the messages more impact.     But while far short of the expected response, Jerry Michaud,executive director for Prime Time to End Hunger, the project'ssponsor, said the project lost no money because the $2 telephonecharge covered by the caller's long-distance bill.  He said theprinting order was reduced when it became apparent to sponsorsthat the response would not be high, we were told.     Michaud said the project will be thoroughly critiqued at theJanuary meeting.  He expected network and telephone companyexecutives to attend.     While the primary purpose was to determine if televisionnetworks were effective ways to recruit volunteers, Michaud saida "secondary" consideration was the effectiveness of the 900number as a response media.Long-Distance Carriers Disappointed in Response     Long-distance carriers--including the Big 3 and TelesphereNetwork Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.--who participated, viewed theproject as a field test for a national 900 services and a way toelevate the often-maligned 900 service to respectibility.     "I think the telephone companies were disappointed that wedidn't have millions and millions of responses," said GlennLebowitz, president of Optima Direct, a Washington-basedtechnical consulting firm that designed the 900 "hunger" network.     Lebowitz, who said the network's technology lived up toexpectations, criticized the television networks for not exposingthe 900 number longer than 15 seconds and giving the message"more impact" with viewers.  "I don't think 15 seconds givespeople enough time to absorb a telephone number," Lebowitiz said.     Spokesmen for the long-distance suppliers had no commentsprepared about the project when they were queried just beforepresstime.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNetJanuary, 1990NEW COMPANIES FIND INFO PHONES NOT MONEY MAKERS     Neil Sleevi of Weston, Mo., and J. Russell Leatherman of LosAngeles share something in common--they want to give telephonecalls away.  But the 2 entrepreneurs are in the embryonic stagesof developing telephone information services, and their give-awayschemes have--so far--been less than profitable.     Sleevi told us he has not made "a single nickel" with PhoneSpots Inc., a plan he has to provide free, one-minute long-distance or 3-minute local telephone calls to patrons atairports, hotels or bus terminals.     Leatherman and his partners have lost almost $1 million inPromoFone Inc., a service for Los Angeles moviegoers seekingaccurate movie listings and starting times.  A New York CityPromoFone service also is available.     Sleevi's free airport telephone call and Leatherman's movieservice also are similar in that they offer paid advertisingmessages--pitched quickly and professionally between rings andlasting less than 4 seconds--to pay the phone bills that make thefree call possible.     Sleevi said in an interview with The LONG-DISTANCE LETTERthat he hopes to sell advertising on Phone Spots to businesseslocated within a few feet of his free-call phone booth--anairport florist, a newsstand or restaurant, for instance.Pay Phones Being Offered as Marketing Ploy     But Sleevi also is thinking big.  He is trying to interestone of the country's Big 3 long-distance carriers to place aPhone Spot payphone in an airport and offer free one-minute callshome to patrons so they can assure families of a safe arrival ordeliver a similar message.     Between rings and while the caller awaits his connection, amessage would remind the patron that the sponsor's long-distanceservice is available for longer calls at other airport locations.     Sleevi, who is discussing an airport market test this summerwith the phone giants, said surveys show 9 out of 10 people willtake advantage of a free telephone.  He said the advertisingmessage "in no way" delays the call and does not interruptconversation.     Leatherman--a former rock musician--seeks rock stations orshow-business publications to welcome PromoFone users to hismovie service.  The short advertising message makes whatLeatherman calls "a needed public service" (movie information)available to vast amounts of people.  So far, however, it onlypays the phone bills and some of the overhead.     Leatherman said in an interview that for his service to beprofitable, it must attract "millions" of users.  He usesbillboards, small local circulation newspapers and television toget PromoFone's telephone number (777-FILM) known, but wasdependent on the Los Angeles Times for its massive circulation.He said he was caught off guard when the Times declared PromoFonea "competitor" and refused his advertising.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNetJanuary, 1990GTE AHEAD OF THE GAME IN GETTING PHONE SERVICE ON BOARD FOR BOWL     The upcoming NFL Super Bowl--scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 28in New Orleans--is labeled a sporting event, but to GTEtechnicians who have been wiring the mammoth Superdome for SuperBowl XXIV since Jan. 4, it is a major telecommunications event.     For the sixth consecutive year, GTE is providing all thetelecommunications service to the entire "Super Bowl community"of participating teams, league personnel, the media, corporatesponsors and fans.  A giant communications net that will cover 8different official NFL locations in and near the stadium thatwill be connected by 275 private telephone lines will alsoinclude 6 consoles, 24 cellular telephones and a high-speed datalink to the NFL's New York headquarters.     GTE also will provide telecommunications services to theparticipating AFC and NFC team, 100 lines for the majortelevision and radio networks, approximately 430 telephone linesfor domestic reporters and another 30 lines for the foreign presscovering the game.     Glen Miller, GTE Telecom's director of East Coastoperations, said planning for telecommunications services in thegiant Superdome began 15 months ago.  Preliminary budget work,site surveys, ordering of dial-tone services, the hiring andselecting of contract personnel, the setting up of offices,transportation and hotel accommodations will be done long beforecrews arrive on the game site.     Last October, when the 1989 NFL season was in its infancy,GTE had opened a 800 line that began taking service orders fromtelevision and print reporters who plan to cover the upcomingchampionship.  Miller said orders ranged from a simple privatetelephone line to the complex, multiple-location telephone linethat includes multi-button sets and other special services.Technicians on the Job a Month Early     When technicians arrived in New Orleans Jan. 4, their firstduties were to test all the wiring, cables, telephone connectors,common control equipment and other miscellaneous equipment in thestadium.  Another function scheduled to be performed beforegametime is the training of on-site workers, management peopleand others.  Miller said that while many GTE technicians haveworked the Super Bowl and other special events, theirresponsibilities change each year or technology has changed torequire constant retraining and updating.     GTE's Special Events Division provided telecommunicationsservices to such events as the 1988 Republican and Democraticnational conventions for the major networks, the Miss AmericaBeauty pageant, remote broadcasts for the "Today" show andnumerous sporting events.  The NFL's management service contractwith GTE is in effect through the 1993 Super Bowl.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNetJanuary, 1990NTIA INQUIRY SEEKS DATA FOR MAJOR TELECOM LEGISLATION     What could turn out to be the nation's first totaltelecommunications policy may be written from comments now beingsought by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommu-nications and Information Adminsitration (NTIA); NTIA is theprincipal telecommunications policy advisor to President Bush.     NTIA published and released a 99-page notice of inquiry(NOI) Jan. 9 in the Federal Register seeking comments fromindustry sources and other parties on subjects ranging from ruraltelephones to global competition.  Comments must be filed byMarch 19; reply comments are due April 23.     Janice Obuchowski, assistant secretary for the CommerceDepartment and head of NTIA, said recommendations will be draftedfor Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's approval and thenforwarded to the White House for consideration as the nation'sfirst total telecommunications policy.     According to Obuchowski, NTIA's inquiry will:      Examine the nation's telecommunications infrastructure;      Consider the technological and market trends that determinethe industry's growth in this country and elsewhere;      Evaluate ways in which telecommunications affectsinternational competition; and      Assess government's role in promoting the development of atelecommunications infrastructure.     Industry observers are saying that telecommunications is asimportant to the nation's production as transportation once was.NTIA's study will determine the importance of telecommunicationasto the country's economy and social welfare, Obuchowski said.     Besides examining the importance of telecommunications as afactor of production in the national economy, the inquiry raisesfor discussion the links between telecommunications and economicdevelopment in local, urban and rural areas.  It also willexamine the industry's role in such services as education, healthcare and public safety.  The inquiry also seeks comment onregulatory changes that might encourage improvements in theindustry, including modifications to the rate-of-returnregulation, depreciation practices, the AT&T consent decree,cable TV/telephone company cross-ownership restrictions and opennetwork architecture.

McGowan, chairman and CEO, MCI Communications Corp.     Whether you want to talk about geo-political developments,the economy, technology, science, social attitudes, businessmanagement, careers, the arts or education--everything importantthese days seems to be in a perpetual state of never-ending flux.There can be little doubt that the times we inhabit are, indeed,changing...and changing at breakneck speed.     I would suggest to you that the communications technologieswe take for granted--radio, television, telephones, fax machines,everything--really are revolutionary in nature.  They forcechange in business and politics and throughout society.     The old adage, "The more things change the more they staythe same," just isn't true any more--if it ever was.  Nowadays,it seems, the more things change, the more things change.     Technology propels change.  And the world's ability toinnovate technologically is at an all-time high.  It's beenestimated, for instance, that 85% of all the scientists who everlived in human history are alive today.  Significantly,imagination and technology have changed the way business viewsthe world.  What we're seeing today is a powerful trend towardglobalization of business and the erosion of geography, timezones and national boundaries as stumbling blocks to economicactivity.     Whether we like it or not, the future IS global.  Nothingattests to this more than EC '92.  As you all know, this drivetoward a single market of 325 million people and a grossnationalproduct (GNP) of $4.5 trillion--about the same as the UnitedStates--will "harmonize" major sectors of the European economy.     The telecommunications sector in the EC is expected to morethan double in size over the next 10 years, growing from 3-7% ofthe gross domestic product (GDP) among the 12 EC countries.  TheEC plan calls for public voice service and control of thetelecommunications infrastructure to remain in the hands of thenational monopolies, while value-added services are supposed tobe totally deregulated.Admit It--There are no Domestic Markets Anymore     One aspect of globalization that all businesses--especially,I think, American businesses--need to learn very quickly is thatthere are no entirely domestic markets anymore--anywhere.  Forany business that means, in effect, that you can run, but youcan't hide, from foreign competitors.     Since I'm in the business, I'm proud to point out thattelecommunications service.     Obuchowski said America does not have a "coherent"  nationaltelecommunications policy "because of the court situation," areference to U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's oversight of theMFJ restrictions.

For further information, contact Alfred Leeor Timothy Sloan, NTIA Office of Policy Analysis and Development,202/377-1880.     The notice of inquiry was announced at a press conferenceJan. 9. as a global economic force truly has come of age.Foreign investments, international banking, cross-border mergersand acquisitions--all have become commonplace and increasinglyvital elements of the global economy.  And telecommunicationsprovides the electronic infrastructure that allows it all tohappen.     Economists recognize telecommunications as a strategicindustry because it meets the 3 basic criteria required to be sodesignated.  First, a strategic industry must be important to acountry's national security.  Telecommunications clearly is.Second, it must be R&D intensive.  Again, telecommunicationsclearly is that.  And third, a strategic industry must have--Ilove this phrase--positive externalities, meaning that astrategic industry must produce spill-over economic benefits toother industries.  It's clear that other industries deriveenormous benefits by using telecommunications.     I believe the biggest future advantages of informationtechnology will come in the form of organizational health--increased productivity, better decisionmaking, improved operatingefficiencies, enhanced responsiveness and reduced bureaucracy.To compete against global competitors, companies everywhere needto organize leaner, decide quicker, produce smarter and marketbetter.     Recent events in China, in the Soviet Union, in Hungary, inCzechoslovakia and, most dramatically perhaps, in Berlin, shouldbe seen as part of the political "whiplash" that occurs wheninformation is distributed widely and without officialcensorship.Today's Telecommunications Precludes the Rise of a New Stalin     Glasnost may be a Russian word, but it is fundamentally aconcept born of the Information Age.  During his recent visit tothe United States, Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa admittedas much.  He was asked how all of these reforms in Eastern Europecame about.     His reply was insightful.  He said, "That's a result ofcivilization--of computers and satellite TV and other innovationswhich present alternative solutions...Is it possible for a newStalin to appear today who could murder people?  It'simpossible."     Information technologies are inherently democratic.  Theyforce decentralization and individualism.  They are designed forexpansion, for interconnection, for networking.  They have norespect for barriers and roadblocks.     Nothing as flimsy and porous as a concrete wall stands achance against information traveling at the speed of light acrossa multitude of media--from radio and television to theincreasingly ubiquitous fax machine.     Information technologies help people to absorb and put toeffective use vast amounts of information that would otherwise bewasted.  Because of that, I couldn't think of a more interestingtime to be alive, or a more exciting industry to be a part of.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNetJanuary, 1990TELECOM*USA, ALC SIGN LETTER OF INTENT TO MERGE OPERATIONS     Telecom*USA Inc. and ALC Communications Corp, the fourth andthe seventh largest long-distance interexchange carriersrespectively, have signed a letter of intent to merge in April,according to announcements made simultaneously this week by bothcompanies.  Telecom*USA, based in Atlanta, Ga., and ALC inBirmingham, Mich., will merge into an unnamed subsidiary ofTelecom*USA, the announcements stated.     Under terms of the letter, all outstanding capital stock ofALC would be converted into units of Telecom*USA common stock andcash.  Holders of ALC common stock and series B and C preferredstock would receive units valued at $3 for each share.  Holdersof ALC series A preferred stock would receive units valued at $20per share plus accrued unpaid dividends.     O. Gene Gabbard, chairman and CEO of Telecom*USA, and JohnZrno, president and CEO for ALC, both expressed optimism aboutthe merger although Gabbard said he expected the move may have"some dilutive effect" on Telecom*USA earnings this year.     "However, we believe that the combination of Telecom*USA andALC will enhance our position in a rapidly-growing industry andprovide significant opportunities for network and costefficiencies," he said.  "Over the longer term, we expect theseefficiencies to add to earnings and create additional value forshareholers, as has been the case with past mergers andacquisitions."     Zrno said that ALC's "strong presence" in the northeast andupper midwest "complements Telecom*USA's existing strengths inthe southeast and midwest.     "Through this combination, we anticipate offering a widerange of Telecom*USA enhanced products and services to ourcustomers," he said.     The proposed merger gives Telecom*USA access to ALC's 900service, where it has staked a strong market.  Telecom*USAalready markets 700 and 800 services, a spokesman said.Deal Contingent Upon Amending Previous Agreement     The merger is contingent upon execution of a definiteagreement, and regulatory and shareholder approvals.  Inaddition, the merger requires amending an existing 10-yeartelecommunications agreement between ALC and CommunicationsTransmission Inc. (CTI), of Austin, Texas, which controls 55% ofALC.  The amendment would permit the purchase of additionaltransmission capacity from CTI at a fixed price in exchange for apayment to CTI of $8.5 million.     The proposed merger will bring 400,000 new subscribers toTelecom*USA, more than doubling its subscriber base.  Spokesmenwould not confirm some trade press reports that claimedTelecom*USA is expected to dissolve ALC and drop the name of itslong-distance company, Allnet, following the merger.Back to Headline List WT03-B13-4IA086-000622-B038-266http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te127.html 205.156.212.5 19970122050952 text/html 713959HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:04:50 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:32 GMTContent-length: 713771Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te127.html Sample Issue Copyright M2 PRESSWIRE via NewsNet JANUARY 2, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES -THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary -- Statement by Press Secretary (258 words) -THE WHITE HOUSE: Executive Order -- Amendment to Executive Order No. 12871 (346 words) -THE WHITE HOUSE: Statement by the Press Secretary (172 words) -THE WHITE HOUSE: Edelman named Asst Sec.

But let me just say from my point of view, Iam pleased that our representatives met yesterday.They did make some progress. Obviously, a lot of thebiggest issues remain. But the process seems to beworking and I'm encouraged, and I want to continue todo it until we reach agreement on a balanced budget.That's what I think clearly we all want. I would say here that two days before Christmas Ihope some way can be found to get the check for thethree and a half million veterans and the aid to the8 million children who need it just to exist. Andthere are almost half a million federal workers whohave been working who won't get their paychecks todaythat they would otherwise get. So I think thoseproblems need to be addressed. But on the other issue, I at least believe that wemade some good progress yesterday and I'm lookingforward to the report today and continuing thisprocess until we succeed, until we get this job done. Q Can we ask the leaders, Mr. President, if they willget the checks out and -- Q Do you think the Congress should go home whenmillions are denied subsistence checks overChristmas? SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just say, if I couldfor a second, Mr. President, I think both the Houseand Senate hope to get those bills down here today sothat the -- the AFTC and the -- as the Presidentmentioned the other day on television. Q What are the chances of reopening the government,Mr. Speaker? SPEAKER GINGRICH: I think we're going to talk aboutthat now. Q Mr. Speaker, do you feel like a dog being wagged byits tail? (Laughter.)

We discussedalmost all the issues where we had differences on ourplans financially, in terms of the dollars. And thismorning we're going to have an extensive discussionof the Medicare policy. And then we're going to giveour staffs some instruction. We're going to meetagain on Tuesday and we're going to do our best towork through this and come to an accord.  My New Year's wish is that we'll get this balancedbudget plan and we'll do it in a way that protectsthe things that we care about -- the Medicare, theMedicaid, the education and environment, the otherissues, and we've been working at it. I've been verywell pleased and I think we've been somewhatsuccessful because we haven't said very much aboutit. We've just got to keep working until we reach anaccord. Q Mr. President, will you touch on -- negotiations -- Q Will you leave town today without reopening thegovernment, of the three -- SPEAKER GINGRICH: I'm sure we'll be talking aboutthat, that's one of the things we want to get doneand get agreed to. So we're trying to work out how toget the federal employees back to work -- we'd alsolike to get them paid, I think that's an integralpart of getting them back to work. But as thePresident said, I think, frankly, most of our successso far has been that we've been in this room talkingwith each other and not getting involved innegotiating in public, and I think we've made a lotof progress. Q To follow on that, sir, is it healthy to have theHouse speakers talking on CNN yesterday on the -- SPEAKER GINGRICH: Oh, that is nonsense. I told thePresident on Friday that I was so favorable about himin answering their big question on Evans & Novak thatI thought he'd want to see it. The fact is we'reworking very well together. I was asked a questionabout the campaign next year, and I suspect if youask Mr. Gephardt or Vice President Gore about howthey'll campaign next year, they'll give you similaranswers. We're negotiating very well from agovernment standpoint in here and I think we have alot to be proud of. Our New Year's wish ought to bethat we get this done and give the American people abalanced budget and the government paid for and backto work. SENATOR DOLE: The Senate is going to meet at noon,we'll try to pass something to help the federalemployees. Q Are you closer? SENATOR DOLE: Oh, we're about six feet apart.(Laughter.)

ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning.  Q Mr. President, do you hope to go to Bosnia in thenext month or so? THE PRESIDENT: I want to go when the Secretary ofDefense and General Shalikashvili tell me it's anappropriate thing to do. I don't want to interruptthe deployment in any way. You know, we've had a fewweather delays, but I'm here to get a briefing on thedeployment and what's going on and how we're doing.I've got a few questions I want to ask. If it weresolely up to me, I would go tomorrow -- literallytomorrow. But I think it's very important that I notdo anything which interrupts the deployment. I can goas soon as it's consistent with the military mission,and I will do that.  Q What have you heard so far, even before thisbriefing, on how the operation is going in Bosnia?  THE PRESIDENT: I think our people are doing a verygood job. I think the others in IFOR are doing a goodjob, and I think the people there, so far, arereceiving them well. But I've got some specificquestions, and that's why I want this briefing. Q Do you think Senator Dole should go if you can'tgo? THE PRESIDENT: I think that all of us should consultwith the military leaders and do what is consistentwith the interest of our troops and the mission.  Q That means no? Q Mr. President, do you worry about casualties? THE PRESIDENT: Every day I worry about that, but Ithink they're doing a very good job. They're showingtheir training and their discipline and the integrityof the plan in the way that they are working tominimize casualties and maximize the effectiveness ofthe mission.

We've also had a teleconference with GeneralJoulwan, getting the latest up-to-date briefing onthe conditions of the deployment. And I would say --I should emphasize to you two things. One is that notwithstanding some weather problems anda few delays occasioned by Christmas traffic on therails in Germany, we're pretty much on schedule. Andsecondly, and even more important, the attitudetoward compliance thus far in Bosnia by all partieshas been quite good. Now, it's early in the mission,but so far the attitude toward compliance has beenvery good and we're encouraged by that. And we thinkwe can stay on schedule for the separation of theforces and the other elements of it. And also, in this Christmas season, I'd like toremind the people who serve our country that we aredoing this essentially for three reasons. First ofall, because we can do it, and when we can dosomething like this it's consistent with our valuesto stop suffering and slaughter on the scale we'veseen it in Bosnia. Second, because it's very much in our interest tocontain and end this war, to prevent it fromspreading in a way that can involve our NATO allieson opposite sides and many other countries that arecritical to the stability of Europe. It's alsoimportant for us to do what we can to promote astable and democratic and free Europe. We, after all,have fought two world wars because we did not havesuch a Europe; we had a long Cold War because we didnot have such a Europe. So it's in our interest. And finally, it is critical to our ability to leadthe world for the next 10 or 20 years as we sort outwhat the security arrangements of the post-Cold Warera will be. I can tell you that our leadership ofNATO specifically, and in general, our ability tolead in the world toward peace and democracy is verymuch tied to our willingness to assume a leadershiprole in this Bosnia mission. I could see it on my recent trip to Europe -- whetherit was talking to prime ministers in Great Britain orIreland or Germany or Spain, or just to people on thestreet. It means a lot to them to know that theUnited States is still there working and leading andbeing a good partner. So, for all these reasons, I think this is a very,very important mission to our country. Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President -- after OperationJoint Endeavor, what do you see as the U.S. role inthat area, formerly known as Yugoslavia? What will beour role there? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think, first of all, we'llstill be there through NATO and whatever role thatNATO assumes in the general area beyond our NATOmember nations. But more importantly, I would expectafter this mission is over we will continue to haveAmerican citizens, both people who work for andrepresent our government, and people in the privatesector, going in and out of there helping in thereconstruction effort, contributing to that,supporting the political process in whatever way wecan. But I think it is quite important that the NATO forcenot become an occupying army. We're not dealing withBerlin here. We're not -- all we're trying to do isto give this peace agreement a chance to take hold.And we have a very clear and limited mission. Infact, I want to make sure that all of our folks knowthat, as far as I know, this peace agreement is thefirst one ever where the military annex to theagreement was actually written by the militarycommanders who were going to be expected to implementit. That is, the parties actually ask our military peopleto fashion the military annex to the agreement thatwas initialed in Dayton so that there would be alimited, defined, strictly military mission. Q Mr. President, do you agree with the premise thatBosnia is really the first test of post-Cold Warpolicy? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's been tested inother ways, but it's certainly the most significantmilitary test of our post-Cold War policy if youaccept the premise that what happened in the Gulf atthe Gulf War could have occurred during the Cold Waras well as afterward; that this is literally apost-Cold War problem. Then it is the biggestmilitary test. Q Does that mean that -- what is the success orfailure of this then mean to American foreign policy10, 15 years down the line? THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just say I think the mostimportant thing here is that the United States wasprepared to lead and to work with our NATO allies. Ifyou remember, in the beginning when the Bosnian Warbroke out, a lot of our European allies said, well,we ought to take the leadership role here, we'll dothis; we'll do it through the United Nations. Andwe've played a very strong supporting role throughNATO. After all, it's important that the UnitedStates never forget that during these last four,tough years we led in the conduct of the largesthumanitarian airlift in history; we led in enforcingthe no-fly zone, keeping the war out of the air, anda lot of other things that were done, includingNATO's willingness to use air strikes to, first ofall, bring about a relatively peaceful 1994, and thento bring about the conditions in which a peaceagreement could be made in 1995. But what I believe this means, if we make this effortand if we succeed in our military mission, even if,God forbid, after we're all gone the thing shouldcome apart, at least we will be united in doing whatwe can do to promote stability in Europe and to takea stand for peace in the post-Cold War era. If you remember when I sent our troops into Haitiwith a U.N.-led mission, and then when I left asmaller number there when the United Nations tookover on schedule, I always said that we could notguarantee the people of Haiti a future, they wouldhave to do that for themselves. The same is true forthe Bosnians. We cannot guarantee for them a futurewithout war. What we can guarantee for them is a yearwithout war, during which they can implement theirown agreement and in which time they can haveelections, they can begin the economicreconstruction, they can begin to see the benefits ofpeace, and then some equilibrium within the countrycan be established from a security point of view. But think it would be a mistake for the United Statesor for NATO to believe that we should be going aroundanywhere guaranteeing the results of peace agreementswhich have to be guaranteed in the minds and heartsof the people who are making them. So this will be a success for our alliance, for ourleadership, just by doing the mission. Obviously, itwill be a much, much greater success if thehumanitarian relief, the refugee relocation, theeconomic reconstruction all are completely successfuland Bosnia has a permanent peace. That is the realmeasure of success. But the main thing is we have todefine together where we must try and where we muststand against chaos. And I think we've done a goodjob of that here.Q Mr. President, under what circumstances would youorder the U.S. forces to withdraw from Bosnia withinthe next year, before the one-year mark? THE PRESIDENT: The only circumstance that I canimagine doing that is if the mission no longerexisted. That is, keep in mind, we are there not tofight a war, we are there not to stop a war, we arethere to implement a peace agreement. We anticipatethat there will be violations of this agreement, butthat the leaders will not abandon it and that thevast bulk of the people will not abandon it. So wehave to be prepared for some violations; we even haveto be prepared for some casualties, although I thinkour people have trained and planned as hard againstproblems for this mission as they ever have for any. But that would not cause me to withdraw. If -- Ibelieve that NATO would determine, if all thefactions decided they wanted to go fight again, thatthere was no longer a mission to perform. Q Switching a little bit to the defense authorizationbill -- you have said you are going to veto it. Thebill includes a pay raise and a housing allowanceincrease for military people. Since some of them areheaded off to Bosnia, are you concerned that notgetting the pay raise, not getting the housingallowance increase would be detrimental to morale?And is there some alternative? THE PRESIDENT: Very much. Yes, there is analternative. The Congress could send me a separatebill with the pay raise and the allowances in it andI would sign it in a heartbeat. I think, indeed Ihope that they will do one of two things -- I hopethey will either do that, or when I veto this bill,assuming my veto would be sustained, which I believeit would because there are some unconstitutionalrestrictions on the President's authority asCommander in Chief in this bill which compels me toveto it -- so they can either send me the pay raiseand the allowance increase in a separate bill, orthey could delete the offending portions of thedefense authorization bill and send it right back tome. They can do either one of those things. And Iwould hope the Congress would promptly act to dothat. I do not want any erosion of morale and spirit amongnot only our people in uniform, but their familymembers. I believe that we are completely united insupporting the full pay raise and the allowanceincrease. And I have done my best to budget for thesethings over a period of several years. I have visited a large number of our militaryfacilities, both in the United States and beyond ourborders. I have talked to a lot of people in uniformabout this. And I think it is a very important issue.If we want to keep the very best people in ourmilitary, we're going to have to see to thequality-of-life issues. We've allocated a lot ofmoney for it over the next budget cycle, and I wantto release it, starting with these two issues. Q Mr. President, on a slightly longer-term budgetissue, the Republican seven-year budget plan, whileit has more money for defense in the first couple ofyears, actually targets less money towards defensespending in the out-years 2000 and beyond. SecretaryPerry said earlier this week that that would forcehim into the difficult decision of actually cuttingforce structure to pay for modernization. You've talked a lot about social spending in thebudget debate, but I haven't heard you talk muchabout defending defense spending. Is that somethingyou're willing to give away to get a deal? THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say that I still hopethat I can work with Congress in a way that thatchoice won't be necessary. It is true that theyfront-loaded more defense spending than we did, whichmade it very attractive to all the people who wantedit in these years. But what we tried to do was tohave a balanced commitment.  I think the worst thing that can happen to themilitary is to be jerked around with these up anddown budgets and unpredictability. What we tried todo is to get our folks together here and to say,okay, what do we need over the next five years; whatdo we need over the next seven years. The only thingI can say to you, and I would say with some sense ofassurance is that our political system has shown awillingness now to respond if there's a problemcreated for our forces in uniform and for ournational defense. I mean, I think -- one of the things you see that inthe last three years is we've had a remarkablebipartisan ability to maintain a strong defense as apart of our continuing engagement in the post-ColdWar world. And I think that everyone knows that themilitary went through a significant downsizing with aremarkable maintenance of excellence and morale, andthat now we have to sustain the system that we havecreated.  And so I would say to our forces, I'm going to getthe very best budget agreement I can. I hope we canget an agreement. But if there is an alarming tailoffin years six and seven I think it can be corrected inthe future. And I believe if we balance the budget,get interest rates down, the economy will grow morequickly. And one of the big differences between meand the Republican Congress is that they have nowgiven me an economic plan which says if we doeverything they want, at the end of six or sevenyears, interest rates and unemployment will be higherthan they are now. I find that very hard to believe.I think that we're going to be better off, not worseoff if we do this, and we'll have more money,therefore, to invest in defense. So I would not worry too much about the out-years.Whatever happens in this budget agreement, at leastas long as I am here -- and I can't conceive ofanyone else coming into this job, or anyone cominginto control of the Congress that would not try tosustain a long-term plan for the military, becausethat's what we've learned -- that if the military hasa plan they can do nearly anything, but we can't jackaround the plan. And we don't want to play games withpeople's lives or with the national security. Q Mr. President, can I jump back to Bosnia for asecond and politics? How important do you considerthe success of the Bosnia operation to your ownpolitical prospects? Is it a defining moment for you?And secondly, from a tactical point of view, wouldyou mind if Senator Dole was the first seniorpolitical presence in Bosnia on Christmas? THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me answer the firstquestion. If you look at recent American history, theevidence is that the success of the Bosnia operationmay not have much to do with the election in 1996,but the failure of the Bosnia operation or thesustaining of significant casualties could have agreat deal to do with it in a negative way. Andthat's all. The conventional political wisdom is whywould the President do this; there's no up side andtons of down side? But I have to say, when you take a job, you have todo what you -- you have to do the job. And to bePresident at the edge of the 21st century, in a timeof dramatic, dramatic change in the way we work andlive and relate to each other, means that you can'tpredict the future, and you just have to do what youthink is right. So for me, this was not -- once Ibecame convinced we could train for this mission,that we could define the mission in the peaceagreement, that we could minimize the risks to ourtroops, then the decision to me was not so difficult,no matter what the political down side, because Ibelieve, in a time like this, you have to askyourself which decision would your rather defend 10years from now when you're not in office if it goeswrong?  I would much rather explain to my child and mygrandchildren why the United States tried to stopslaughter, prevent the spread of the war, maintainNATO instead of destroy it, maintain the leadershipof the United States in the world for peace andfreedom. I would much rather explain why we tried todo that than why, because of the short-term politicalproblems, we permitted the war to resume, itexpanded, NATO's alliance was destroyed, and theinfluence of the United States was compromised for 10years. I think it's obvious if you look at it that way --what do you want to tell your grandchildren 10 yearsfrom now -- that the United States is doing the rightthing. And the political risk is part of the priceyou pay for being President. Anybody who doesn't wantto take any political risk at a time like this shouldnot run for the job. Now, in terms of who goes to Bosnia when, I don'tthink we should politicize it. Senator Dole and Iworked together to get the support that the Senategave to this mission. He expressed his reservationsabout it, but he supported my decision asCommander-in-Chief. I appreciated that. Andobviously, at the appropriate time, I have noobjection to either Senator Dole or anyone else, forthat matter, going to Bosnia. The question is, when is the appropriate time. If Ihad my way I would be spending Christmas Eve andChristmas morning there. That's what I wanted to do.But our commanders made it clear that when aPresident comes into Bosnia, if I fly into thatairport at Tuzla, and then I go down to Sarajevo whenthey're in the middle of this deployment, it would beexceedingly disruptive. So even though I wanted to gothere to say to the American people I believe thismission is on the right track, and most importantly,to support the troops and to reassure their families,I'm taking the advice of the military commanders. Ido not want to interrupt this mission. The mission's success is the most important thing.And that's what I believe should guide everyone. Ithink everyone -- there are different levels ofdisruption that different trips would cause, and Ithink we ought to try to just keep it nonpolitical. Ihope anybody that wants to go there that has a reasonto go, including Senator Dole, will be able to go atthe appropriate time. And that's the determinationthat needs to be made. Q Mr. President, you mentioned the safety of thetroops as being part of your decision a couple timesin that last answer. We're sending quite a largeforce involved in the Bosnia mission. Some might say,awfully large for a peaceful mission. How extensivedo you think the danger is to our troops there? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think there is -- let's lookat what the sources are. No one can -- the extent ofthe danger depends on factors that we can't fullypredict. But I believe that we have minimized therisks -- what are the possible problems. First ofall, if you look at what the United Nations wentthrough over the last four years, I think somethingover 200 people lost their lives in Bosnia. But morethan half of them lost their lives in accidents. Sowe have really worked hard to train againstaccidents, to prepare -- to look at the roadways, tolook at the railways, to look at the airfields. We'veworked hard to minimize the loss of life or seriousinjury due to accidents. Then we know there are a lot of land mines there. Igot a very encouraging report today that the partiesthemselves in many places are assisting us inremoving the mines. But there are a lot of placeswhere there are a lot of mines laid where the landwas first in one hands and then another, where wedon't have records of the mines, where people don'thave memories of them. So we have trained very hardto deal with land mines. I think that's the nextbiggest danger after accidents. Then the third problem is people who fought in thatwar who are either from the country or who came infrom without the country who may have either aspecific grudge against the United States or, morelikely, will just be frustrated because they don'tagree with the peace agreement that the leaders made,and therefore, some -- and then, fourthly, there isjust the possibility of encounters that go wrong. Theonly casualty we sustained in Haiti had nothing to dowith opposition to our being there. It was a man whowas literally a common criminal who ran through abarrier, and there was an incident and he shot one ofour soldiers dead. So I would say that those are the dangers in order. Q Mr. President, I think that's all the time we have. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you and merry Christmas. Iappreciate what you do.

ESTMR. MCCURRY: Hi. I wanted to appear briefly with mycolleagues here and give you a very short updatebased on the guidance that we just got from thebudget principals, who obviously continue their hardwork in the Cabinet Room, sleeves rolled up, sheetsof paper flying back and forth, and coffee beingproduced in copious quantities. I'm doing my colorsince I don't have much substance to report. Q How many --Q Was it being consumed in copious quantities? MR. MCCURRY: The President, the Majority Leader, theSpeaker, the minority leaders and the othersparticipating agreed that they would work aboutanother hour tonight. They are working through aseries of difficult budget issues, but they clearlyare very serious about addressing those issues thatare on the table. They expect to work about anotherhour tonight, take a break. The budget advisors group, which consists of Mr.Panetta, Chairman Domenici, Chairman Kasich, and thetwo ranking members -- Mr. Sabo and Mr. Exon -- willreconvene on the Hill at approximately 8:00 p.m. orroughly a half hour after they conclude here. Theywill continue to do the type of work that they didtoday, working through some of the issues thatthey're attempting to analyze for the benefit of theprincipals. And then, according to the President andthe others, they expect to reconvene tomorrow asearly as possible based on the advice they get fromthe budget advisors who will meet later this evening.We don't have a time or -- Q The principals? MR. MCCURRY: The principals will meet again tomorrow.We don't have a time set, although the preference isto begin as early in the morning as they can based onhowever late the advisors group works tonight.  That's about all I am afraid I can report at thispoint. By agreement, we're not going to attempt tosummarize any of the substance. As one participantsaid, we obviously wouldn't be continuing to meet ifwe thought it was going poorly. But other than that,I don't want to characterize any -- Q -- no chance that the House or Senate would take upthe proposals that they mentioned in -- MR. MCCURRY: I really don't want to speak to that. Ithink it would be more appropriate for you to directthat to either the Speaker's or the Majority Leader's-- but if you want -- Q Are there any plans for the -- MR. MCCURRY: I think you know the President's view.The President's view is that it would be good to getthe federal government up and running, federalworkers back at their desk. Q But what about back pay? Q But wait a minute, wait a minute. Can we get themto answer the question of whether the House or Senatewill take up the issue tonight of -- MR. BLANKLEY: It has to be taken up in the Senatefirst --  Q Could you go to the mike? MR. BLANKLEY: Sure. I like that. (Laughter.) MR. MCCURRY: Don't get used to it. (Laughter.) MR. BLANKLEY: It would have to be taken up in theSenate first, and it's not clear whether the SenateDemocrats would be supportive. So we have to bechecking on that before we can move it -- Q Why wouldn't they? Q They voted for it last time. Q Why wouldn't they? Q Is this because of the expedited -- MR. BLANKLEY: Well, it's not clear. That may be anissue. So we're still checking. Q What about the House? MR. BLANKLEY: It will have to start in the Senate, sowe can't get out of the Senate. Q But as of now, it is still the plan of theleadership to try to push it through both chambers -- Q Tonight? MR. BLANKLEY: We're trying to, but as I said, itwould have to start with the Senate. You needunanimous support on both sides of the aisle there. Q The Senate is still -- Q What is it that you would try -- Q I don't get this -- MR. MCCURRY: Would you guys calm down? One of you ata time will ask a question. Q What are you trying to put through tonight in theSenate? MR. BLANKLEY: What the Speaker mentioned earlier atthe photo op, which is to have basically theprovision that passed in the Senate last week, whichis attached to the Middle East act, that would bring-- designate all government employees essential andwould not pay them, but would guarantee their payonce there is a government up and running again, andwould also have an expedited procedure rule for theSenate so that we could get whatever agreement we getout of here moved to the Senate with alacrity. Andthere's some speculation that the Senate Democratsmay not want to consent to unanimity on that point. Q Do you know what the state of play in the Senateis? MR. HINE: The Senate is still in session, prepared todeal with it, and Senator Dole may have more to sayon the floor once we're done here. Q Logistically, Mike, what would you anticipate thatwill happen at the end of the principals meeting?Would you come out and say something or will theyreturn to the Hill, have -- Q Yes, what happens in an hour? MR. MCCURRY: We did not cover that point. We willeither provide another brief readout which will notbe much different from this readout, oralternatively, have some type of joint statement aswe did at the conclusion of the meeting last Friday. Q You wouldn't expect an appearance by the principalshere? MR. MCCURRY: I don't expect an appearance by themhere, and I'm not aware of any plans by theRepublican leaders or the Democratic leaders toattempt to do any type of readout tonight on meetingsor make any type of comment. There obviously -- thisis a work in progress, and the work will continuetomorrow. MR. HALLEY: On the continuing resolution -- I workfor Senator Daschle -- when this bill comes up, theDemocrats will object because of the fast trackprocedures that are being attached to it that wouldaffect consideration of any budget bill. But at thesame time, we will offer a clean continuingresolution to fully open the government, as we'vebeen trying to do for days. So the one that is beingconsidered by the Republicans, we will object to thatbecause of the expedited procedures that have beenattached to it. But we will offer a clean continuing-- Q Does that mean you won't give unanimous consenttonight to that? MR. HALLEY: That's correct. Q What's wrong with the expedited procedure? MR. HALLEY: It violates basically most of theprocedures of the Senate in terms of amendments anddebate, et cetera. Q But hold on for a second. Didn't you vote forsomething just like this before Christmas -- MR. HALLEY: No, that was the Middle East part of it.There's three parts to this thing that's being put -- Q No, we're talking about just calling all theworkers essential. Do you have an objection to that? Q That passed last Friday evening. MR. HALLEY: No. There are three pieces to the thingthat are being put together by the Republicans. Oneis deeming workers to be essential, which we agreewith that. Two is the Middle East initiative, whichwe agree with that. What we will be objecting to isthe legislating of expedited procedures to -- thatwould harm our ability to both amend and debate thebudget bill. And so we will object to that vehicle,but then we will offer a clean continuing resolutionto open the government. Q Well, when you mean a clean continuing resolutiondo you mean to -- Q -- what the prospects for that? Q Michael, what's the White House position on thislegislation with the three parts? Do you support theSenate Democrats or the House --MR. MCCURRY: The President indicated that, earliertoday, he wants federal workers back at their desksand working. He wants the services of the governmentavailable to the American people. And we understandthat there will have to be discussions on CapitolHill to make that happen quickly. We hope that thatwill happen as quickly as possible. Q In other words, he sides with the Republicans, notthe Democrats on this? MR. MCCURRY: No. In other words, I very artfullyducked the question. (Laughter.)  MR. BLANKLEY: Let me just point out that theprovision that apparently the Senate Democrats aregoing to block is the same expedited procedure thatyou have on a reconciliation bill. And, obviously,their concern would be that they wouldn't -- it wouldget an agreement here that certain Democraticsenators might not be able to destroy the agreementby a filibuster on the floor after the members herehave worked it out. So there's -- that's a proceduralquestion. Q Tony, the Speaker is still against a clean CR, isthat not correct? MR. MCCURRY: Listen, I want John to do -- and this is-- our purpose here is -- my colleagues are here togive you an update on the meeting that's going onhere. I think if they want to talk about theprocedural issues, which are important, and therights of individual senators to raise points, whichthe White House acknowledges is a very important partof the procedure on Capitol Hill, they should reallybrief you up on Capitol Hill about those procedures. Q But he has the right of rebuttal. MR. HALLEY: Yes, thank you. But to restate, theDemocrats, as we've tried to do for weeks, are fullysupportive of opening the government and fullysupportive of that -- the piece of this, which is todeem workers as essential. And so that's not theissue. The reason we'd be objecting to this proceduralnotion is, again, because it would deny the abilityto amend and debate fully. And as we did in 1990,there is a way to reestablish a reconciliation bill.As you may recall, in 1990 after the agreement wasreached, we did another budget resolution that wouldthen trigger a reconciliation bill under the fullprocedures of reconciliation. And so that option isopen to us. And we felt that, therefore, we did notneed to run around completely the entire budgetprocess with something that we'd do this evening. MR. MCCURRY: Okay, anything more on the meeting goingon now before we exit? Q Yes, Mike. Does the President intend or feel hewill need to before Senator Daschle and Senator Exonleave the White House tonight, make the point to themthat apparently if everything is so close toreopening the government, they should set aside --does he intend to have a separate thing with them,saying set aside your objection to this; I reallywant you to do it? MR. MCCURRY: No, he has such good working relationswith them that I don't think he feels that there's aneed to cover that point. Q There were briefings on the Hill earlier about theareas that were covered at the budget advisoryreport, or whatever it's called. Can you say whetherthe leaders here essentially worked within thatframework? Did they go in it or out of it or -- MR. MCCURRY: Based on what I know -- I don't have acomplete readout of their entire discussions tonight.They did review some of those issues that theadvisers dealt with today. They also moved into whatare referred to in their argot now as the tier threeissues, which are more difficult issues that are --where the differences are more fundamental betweenthe sides. Q Which one? Medicaid -- MR. MCCURRY: I'm just not -- we're not authorized toget into the substance of their dialogue. Q Mike, can you explain what the benefit would be ofthis piece of legislation that's having itsdifficulties this evening? It sounds as though whatyou're talking about doing is essentially bringing260,000 people back who then will join a bunch ofother people who aren't getting paychecks. They'llall be getting their paychecks, there still will bemoney for their designated agencies to -- MR. MCCURRY: We would prefer, obviously, any type ofcontinuing resolution that would reopen thegovernment. That's been the President's view allalong. We believe the government should be open. Wehave believed for a long time there should be a cleanCR that would do so. But we're dealing, and we haveto be realistic about the environment we're dealingwith. And these gentlemen can speak better than I canon the attitudes on the Hill.  On the other hand, the effective legislation thatwould except federal employees who are currentlyfurloughed from the furlough would be to incur alegal obligation to pay them. That legal obligationwould be very useful to federal workers that need anytype of short-term loan to make mortgage payments orwho can produce that as evidence to a creditor thatthey got the ability to pay bills that are due. Ithink that would be at least some comfort to federalworkers. It would be far better for them to get apaycheck, far better for them to go back to work, farbetter for them to provide services to the Americanpeople. That at least it's something, and somethingis better than nothing. Q So you don't mind if they try to amend -- theyblock the ability to amend the -- MR. MCCURRY: As I just heard, that -- I could tellfrom their discussion, that's way over my head. Ithink there is some work, clearly, that Congress willhave to do on this. The President's view he statedvery clearly earlier; he would like to see thosefederal workers back to work as quickly as possible. Q Any guidance beyond talks tomorrow? MR. MCCURRY: No, I don't have anything for the daysbeyond that or what time they might finish tomorrow,or would they finish in time for various people tomake travel plans. I don't have any guidance on that. Q How are you going to let us know, Mike, if they'regoing to meet and what time in the morning? All-callor -- MR. MCCURRY: We will do an all-call tomorrow and alsoput in on the recording as soon as we know what thetime is. But I would check in here. I think thePresident still plans to do the radio address livetomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., so you will -- atleast at that point -- Q Live from the talks? Q You wouldn't expect it before the radio address,would you, Mike? MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, let me amend that. Just incase they want to start earlier, if they end updeciding they want to start earlier, there's somechance that we might have to pretape the radioaddress earlier in the morning. So check heretomorrow morning. Q What is it going to be on? Q If Senator Dole give the rebuttal, will he do thatlive -- Q Pass the mike around the table. Q Is he going to do that from here? MR. HINE: I think we're operating under the sameconditions that Mike on that. It's entirely possible-- Q Mike, just to clarify -- you're not suggesting thatthis measure that's being conducted this eveningwould restore the government to full functioning. MR. MCCURRY: No, it would -- our understanding is itwould allow federal workers to return to their work,it would allow them to do certain accepted activitythat would be authorized by their individualagencies. That would be some progress. It would allowin some cases, my understanding is, for applicationsto be processed. For example, one example is it'sconceivable to me under this legislation, unless mycolleagues disagree, that they might be able to beginissuing passports again for people who wish totravel, just as one example.  Now, that's an activity that doesn't incur anyadditional obligation to spend money on the part ofthe government, but it allows some measure ofgovernment services to be restored to the Americanpeople. And that would be better than nothing, as Isaid earlier. Q Can you open the national parks under this? MR. MCCURRY: I don't know the answer to that. I don'tknow the answer. Q Sometime this evening could you get us a reactionto -- the President's reaction to the SenateDemocrats stopping that process that you justoutlined? MR. MCCURRY: I think I commented on that already.They didn't say they were stopping it -- MR. HALLEY: We're not. We're --  MR. MCCURRY: They've got a plan to reopen thegovernment by a clean continuing resolution, which issomething, as you know, the President is stronglysupportive of. Q What's the chance of getting a clean CR? Q Do you have any idea what the mood is in the room? MR. MCCURRY: Unless my colleagues would dispute thischaracterization, they clearly are very serious inpurpose. As I said, many of them have their coatsoff, they've got their sleeves rolled up, they've gotpens out and -- Q Why didn't they do that before? MR. MCCURRY: -- they're working very seriously on therelevant issues. Q Is the Senate essentially in town? MR. HINE: Yes, we're in session. We're in recesssubject to the call of the chair.  Q So if there had to be a roll call -- you don'texpect a roll-call vote tomorrow, for example? If themajority found it necessary to have a roll-call voteto tamp down the Democrats thinking -- MR. HINE: I'm not certain that that's how events aregoing to unfold. Q Mike, why couldn't all of this have been doneTuesday or Wednesday? MR. MCCURRY: Tuesday or Wednesday -- you mean earlierin this week? The process that was defined by theprincipals last Friday, a week ago today, called forthe staff-level discussions and analysis to begin onTuesday and Wednesday, which occurred. It clearly wasvery useful for that to happen because it's been thepremise for a lot of the work that occurred today,and that the principals are doing now. There was an alternative procedure that had beendiscussed a while back. That was not available to thePresident or the principals for reasons everyone inthis room knows. This is the process that wasavailable. This is the process that at the momentappears to be working.  Q A question for John, just to clear up the Senateaction. Does the Senate action -- say, it happenedtonight or tomorrow -- does that have to be byunanimous consent, or can there be a vote on it,which presumably could override the Democrats'objection? And then could the Democrats, say,filibuster to prevent a vote? MR. HALLEY: No -- I mean, our intent is to -- I mean,you would need consent at this time of day. Again,our intent -- we've tried I'd say 10 times in thelast two weeks to pass a continuing resolution thatwould open the government, and that's our position. Q A continuing resolution, not just this deemingmeasure?  MR. HALLEY: Right. Q You're talking about a real, live CR? MR. HALLEY: Right, a complete opening. A real, liveput-people-back-to-work and pay them, and open theagencies. MR. MCCURRY: This meeting will be over before thebriefing ends if we don't move on. Q John, can you spell your last name? MR. HALLEY: H-a-l-l-e-y. Q Any idea when you might be able to give us someguidance about Hilton Head? MR. MCCURRY: It won't be tonight, and it will be latein the day tomorrow. I just don't have any way togive you any guidance. Q Can you say how early could these talks -- 7:00a.m.-8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning? MR. MCCURRY: I believe that will depend entirely onhow late Mr. Panetta, the chairman and thecongressional group works this evening. I think theirintent is to work rather late and that might make thestart not at the crack of dawn, but somewhat aroundmid-morning tomorrow. Q At 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.? MR. MCCURRY: And then I would suspect that thePresident and the other principals would commenceshortly after that. So I don't -- my guess is aroundmid-morning, but we'll wait and see and give youguidance as we've got it. Q Tomorrow the principals meeting would be back here,not at the Capitol? MR. MCCURRY: It sounded to me like the intent is tomeet here. THE PRESS: Thank you.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

In that reportI noted the success of our diplomatic efforts atDayton, Ohio, to assist the parties to reach anegotiated settlement to the conflict in the formerYugoslavia and reported the deployment of a NATO"enabling force" and U.S. support forces in order tolay the groundwork for the deployment of the mainbody of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR). Iam now able to report that on December 14, 1995, thepeace agreement that was initialed in Dayton wasformally signed in Paris. Following the formal signing of the peace agreementby all the parties, and consistent with ourconsultations with the Congress, United NationsSecurity Council Resolution 1031, and the NorthAtlantic Council (NAC) decision of December 16, 1995,I have ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000U.S. military personnel to participate in the IFOR inthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, principallyin a sector surrounding Tuzla. Approximately 5,000U.S. military personnel will also deploy as part ofthe IFOR in other states of the former Yugoslavia,principally Croatia. The IFOR, including U.S. forcesassigned to it, will be under NATO operationalcontrol and will operate under NATO rules ofengagement. In addition, a total of approximately7,000 U.S. support forces, under U.S. command andcontrol and rules of engagement, will deploy inHungary, Croatia, Italy, and other states in theregion in support of IFOR. These force levels arethose stated by U.S. commanders to be appropriate forthe missions assigned to them. The IFOR's mission, as outlined in more detail in thesummary of the operation plan (OPLAN), which I sentto the Congress on December 11, 1995, is to monitorand help ensure compliance by all parties with themilitary aspects of the peace agreement. Inparticular, IFOR will ensure withdrawal of the forcesof the parties to the agreed inter-entity borderswithin an agreed period and enforce establishment ofagreed zones of separation between forces of theparties. IFOR will also create secure conditions forthe safe, orderly, and speedy withdrawal from theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of those elementsof the U.N. Protection Force not assigned to NATO.Finally, within the strict limits of its key militarytasks, IFOR will endeavor to create secure conditionsfor the conduct by other agencies and organizationsof tasks associated with the peace agreement. NATOand U.S. military commanders believe, and I expect,that the military mission can be accomplished inabout a year. Many of the U.S. forces that will deploy to theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be drawn fromthe U.S. Army's lst Armored Division stationed inGermany, including two mechanized brigades and anaviation brigade. Other participating U.S. forcesinclude special operations forces, airfieldoperations support forces, naval and air forcespreviously assigned to support NATO's OperationsSharp Guard and Deny Flight, and an amphibious forcein reserve in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, acarrier battle group will provide support for IFOR'sair operations. All of our NATO allies are contributing forces aswell (except for Iceland, which has no military).Non-NATO nations whose offers to provide forces toIFOR are under consideration include Austria, theCzech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia,Lithuania, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia,Slovakia, Sweden, and Ukraine. These forces also willbe under NATO operational control and rules ofengagement. In total, approximately 60,000 militarypersonnel are expected to be deployed by IFOR to theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the U.S.case, the non-U.S. contingents in Bosnia will in mostcases be supported by forces of their respectivecountries at home and in nearby countries and waters. I authorized these deployments and U.S. participationin IFOR in conjunction with our NATO allies and othertroop contributing nations following the relevantU.N. Security Council resolutions and NAC decisionsand as part of our commitment to secure the peace andhalt the tragic loss of life in the formerYugoslavia. I have directed the participation of U.S.forces pursuant to my constitutional authority toconduct the foreign relations of the United Statesand as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my effort tokeep the Congress fully informed about developmentsin the former Yugoslavia, consistent with the WarPowers Resolution. I remain committed to consultingclosely with the Congress and I will continue to keepthe Congress fully informed regarding these importantdeployments of our forces. Sincerely,WILLIAM J.

EST MR. MCCURRY: Second verse, same as the first. Bye.(Laughter.) Q Do you know now how the President feels about theDemocratic move in the Senate? MR. MCCURRY: The President believes that we'll ableto work -- given the cooperation shown today, we canwork something out that will allow federal workers toresume their diligent service to the American people. Q Tonight? Q What's that mean? MR. MCCURRY: It will be up to senators and leaders onthe Hill to resolve those issues, but we hope theywill. Q Well, does he agree that the Democrats have apoint? MR. MCCURRY: He understands the concerns the senatorshave to make sure they've got the right protected todebate very important budget matters and the very fewhours of hearings and debate devoted to aspects ofthe Republican budget. And he well understands whypeople are protecting the right to have furtherdebate. At the same time, he will encourage allmembers of Congress from both parties to act quicklyto allow federal workers to return to their posts. Q Mike, when you say work something out, does thePresident -- is the President given to understandthat there will be something done today or tomorrowto work something out to return furloughed federalemployees back to the job -- to their jobs? MR. MCCURRY: The sense the President got is thatcongressional leaders on both sides of the aisle areworking urgently to solve the matter. Q -- conciliatory to me. MR. MCCURRY: -- let me tell you what I know abouttonight. They're taking a break. Mr. Panetta and hisgroup from the White House will return to CapitolHill, begin meeting with the so-called budgetadvisers group, approximately 8:00 p.m. It's myunderstanding they do not plan any further readoutsthis evening. They are continuing to work throughissues that they then prepare for discussion by thebudget advisers. I anticipate that staffs are goingto be working throughout the evening and into themorning to prepare discussion documents that will beused by the principals tomorrow. They've agreed toreconvene here at the White House at 10:30 a.m.tomorrow. That's the principals group. Q How does that affect the radio address? Still bedone live? MR. MCCURRY: The radio address is going to be donetaped just to protect -- make sure we don't have any-- because the President may be involved inpre-briefs prior to the meeting. Q What's the subject? MR. MCCURRY: It will be about the budget. Q When will that be available, Mike? MR. MCCURRY: He's taping it tomorrow morning, and weexpect it will be available just shortly before airtime. Q Mike, the Republicans all left tonight withoutcomment. Did the meeting end in an atmosphere of -- MR. MCCURRY: It ended very amicably. And thePresident, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and theDemocratic leaders agreed that the readout that youheard earlier this evening would suffice for the workthat they did between roughly 6:00 p.m. and 7:20 p.m. Q -- resolution tomorrow, Mike? What does it looklike? MR. MCCURRY: Say again. Q For the prospects of a resolution tomorrow. MR. MCCURRY: A resolution -- you mean a resolution ofissues or -- Q Yes. MR. MCCURRY: They will make progress tomorrow, but Idon't -- the work they're doing, it would be veryhard at this point to predict that they would arriveat any final agreements tomorrow. They've got a lotof work to do tomorrow. Q Do you this going, then, into Sunday? MR. MCCURRY: Conceivably, yes. But that's not beendecided yet. Q Do you have a reaction from the President to theDaschle blocking this plan that -- MR. MCCURRY: Yes, we talked about that earlier. Q Is there a meeting with Panetta and the budgetadvisers tomorrow morning before the principalsmeeting? There was some talk about a 9:00 a.m.meeting on the Hill before the principals came downhere. Was there any talk about that? MR. MCCURRY: They may -- the budget advisers groupmay reconvene tomorrow morning, but they -- thatwould be prior to the 10:30 a.m. meeting -- Q Why did the President cut off a reporter fromasking Gingrich whether he had caved? MR. MCCURRY: The President -- (inaudible) -- feltthat there had been any indication by the Speakerthat he had, quote, unquote, caved -- (inaudible) --the President also thought he might give a betteranswer than the Speaker might. (Laughter.) Q What? Q He wants peace to reign. Q -- single issue was set aside as agreed upon oranything narrowed substantially -- MR. MCCURRY: The procedure they've been using forthese discussions is that any element discussed andany element that they reach consensus upon would notchange the admonition that nothing is finally agreeduntil everything is agreed. Q Your sense, Mike, about any travel plans thePresident may have that could be tomorrow or morelikely Sunday now? MR. MCCURRY: I have no sense, but the Presidentseemed to be enjoying himself here as much as hewould in South Carolina. (Laughter.) Q You have no sense of that? Q -- answer to that question that nothing is agreeduntil everything is agreed -- what you're saying is,whatever differences they narrow today have nopermanent status because everything has to be agreedto or-- MR. MCCURRY: As a common negotiating device, theyusually -- even as they work through complicatedissues, that they reserve the right at the end of thediscussion to go back and look at the entire package.And they have done so here, and I suspect they willcontinue to do so -- that they will go back and lookat the final package that they get, if they in factget one, before they agree that they've got a finalagreement. Q But you -- as you agree, you guys are just checkingit off and moving on to the next one, and then -- MR. MCCURRY: Yes, but what they're doing -- they'redoing -- I mean, without getting into the substance,because I'm not authorized to get into the substance,they are working through a set of issues that havebeen identified. The budget advisers today met, dealtwith a series of budget issues, not all of them, butmany of them. They were analyzed in some detail,discussions papers were prepared. They were reviewedtoday. The budget advisers will now go back up to theHill, continue to address elements of the budgetdiscussion. They will be analyzed, discussion draftswill be prepared, and they'll work again on ittomorrow. They're taking these issues serially asthey work through a series of contentious issues thatrange from the -- starting with the lesscontroversial and moving to the more controversial.And they clearly now are moving into areas that aremore controversial. Q On the Hill tonight do you think there will beaction to get the workers back to work? MR. MCCURRY: I cannot predict that. You've heard thediscussion of the representatives and thecongressional leadership earlier, and it will be upto them to -- Q Mike, are there going to be simultaneous meetingswith the budget leaders up on the Hill, meeting atthe same time that the meetings down here are takingplace, or do they complete -- Q I think Tony Blankley said -- Q He did indicate -- Tony indicated that they'd be upon the Hill, you know, working on churning stuff outeven for future issues -- even as -- MR. MCCURRY: Oh, yes, they have -- well, we have --there have been staff -- staff work has continuedeven while the principals are meeting, yes. In fact,there's some -- staff has been available in theRoosevelt Room in case there is a need for expertadvice on budget related issues, and they continue. Q With Cabinet-level people? Will they be meetingalso at the same -- MR. MCCURRY: I wouldn't rule it out, but mostly thepeople who are there are more staff level experts. Q -- radio address subject? MR. MCCURRY: It will be the budget situationgenerally. It will also be, because it's the lastradio address of the year, it will be a review of1995. Q Mike, unrelated, is the policy out here changed atall, or was that just a mis -- MR. MCCURRY: That was a regrettable misunderstanding,and I believe we have got meetings going on right nowto straighten out -- Q That's not the first time it's happened today. It'shappened several times.  MR. MCCURRY: I understand, and there's -- Q Some people decided not to provoke a fight and -- MR. MCCURRY: Right. They're working to clarify whatthe ground rules are on -- (inaudible) -- becausethey obviously -- Q Is the President going out tonight? MR. MCCURRY: Say again. Q Is the President going out tonight? MR. MCCURRY: Not that I'm aware of. Is he? He is?Pool alert -- that he may go out for dinnerapparently.  Q Where? MR. MCCURRY: Okay, see you all tomorrow.

Both forecasts are below the 1990-94 average of$44 billion. Expected high crop cash receipts and aforecast increase in inventories of unsold feedgrains underpin the 1996 forecast. Net cash income isforecast at $43-$53 billion, compared with $51billion forecast for 1995. An important reason whythe net farm income forecast is generally upward andthe forecast for net cash income is generallydownward is that, in contrast to net farm income, netcash income excludes changes in inventory. The degreeand direction by which inventories change can swingwidely depending on production and marketingpatterns.Cash receipts from farm marketings are projected at$184-$192 billion in 1996, up from the $184 billionforecast for 1995. Both forecasts would be a record;the previous high was $180 billion in 1994. Expectedlarge feed grain production and strong feed grainprices stemming from tight world supplies explainmuch of the higher 1996 forecast. Livestock receiptsare expected to remain flat.Direct government payments for 1996 are forecast at$3-$5 billion, while the 1995 forecast is for $6billion. Expected high feed grain prices are the mainreason for the reduced forecast. Projected governmentpayments for both 1995 and 1996 would be the lowestin the 1990's.Total production expense, used to calculate net farmincome, is forecast at $169-$177 billion in 1996, upfrom $168 billion in 1995. Part of the forecastincrease is tied to the expected rise in plantedacres. High forecast feed grain prices and fewerrequirements to idle acreage in order to be eligiblefor government farm program benefits should encourageheavy plantings. High feed grain prices couldincrease feed expense for livestock producers, whichis of special importance because U.S. cattle numbersin 1996 could approach the large levels last seen inthe mid-1980's. Higher nitrogen fertilizer pricescould increase costs for crop producers.The value of agricultural assets is forecast at$985-$995 billion for 1996, up 3 to 4 percent from1995. About four-fifths of the increase is due torising real estate values. Expanding cash receipts,generally good returns to assets, and favorableinterest rates are supporting continued growth infarm sector capital investments. Farm business debtcould rise above $155 billion by the end of 1996, thehighest level since 1986. However, interest expensecould decline, as lower rates offset the rise indebt. Overall farm debt in 1996 should be about 60percent of what farm income can support, also thehighest level since 1986.Given trends developing for 1996--higher crop cashreceipts, flat livestock receipts, smaller governmentpayments, and slightly lower net cash income: * Net cash income could decline proportionally moreon the smallest farms than on the largest ones. Thesmallest farms traditionally earn a larger proportionof their income from livestock sales and governmentpayments. * Farms that specialize in red meat production couldhave proportionally larger dips in their net cashincome than other types of farms. Because they dependon livestock for about 90 percent of their income,farms specializing in red meat likely will facehigher feed expenses.* Midwestern farms could have proportionally smallerdeclines in their net cash income compared with farmsin other parts of the country. The Midwest is by farthe Nation's largest producer of corn and soybeans,the crops for which cash receipts are forecast toincrease the most.A special article in this issue looks at thefinancial performance of U.S. farm business in 1994.USDA's latest Farm Costs and Returns Survey, showsthat even though 1994 saw none of the adverse weatherthat decreased production the year before, net incomefrom farming for the average commercial farm businesswas up less than 1 percent. While the year-to-yearvariation in average income was not statisticallysignificant, the composition of net income didchange. Government payments were down significantly.The reduction in cash expenses offset the decline ingross cash income and was enough for income to risefrom an average of $37,997 per farm in 1993 to anaverage of $38,284 in 1994. In 1994, 6 percent ofcommercial farm businesses were in a vulnerablefinancial position based on their combined net farmincome and debt-to-asset ratios.A second special article outlines the issues involvedin accounting for forestry product sales in farmincome estimates.

It give us a glimpse of what the future holdsin store. This years achievements have provided uswith insight into the opportunities that await SouthAfrica in the coming years. It has at the same-timegiven us a better understanding of the magnitude ofthe task of reconstruction and development that stilllie ahead.The African National Congress has always admittedthat no major transformation process can ever succeedwithout the solid support of the majority of ourpeople in their organised formations and sectors. Weshall continue to ensure the constructive involvementof all these in the reconstruction and developmentprogramme. For indeed without their involvement thereconstruction and development programme will lackthe mass content critical to its realization.The single issue uppermost in people's minds, whichwill continue to impede the effective implementationof the RDP, and generates a negative perception ofour country in the outside world - is that of crime.Antisocial behaviour - be it murder, both politicaland criminal; car-hijackings; rape; robbery; childmolestation; or some other - must be seriouslyaddressed and eliminated. The sheer size of theproblem dictates that piecemeal methods will beineffective. It requires a comprehensive nationalstrategy for the prevention of crime. At the core ofsuch an approach is addressing the root causes ofcrime.The ANC, in government and outside government,remains firmly committed to creating a safe andsecure environment in which families can bring uptheir children; mothers can feel safe in their homesand on the streets; and breadwinners can go abouttheir business without fear.The Government of National Unity has already set inmotion a National Crime Prevention Strategy, linkedto the Community Safety Plan initiated by PresidentNelson Mandela.

"Our plan is a logical next step to replaceMaryland's current incentive regulation plan," saidDan Whelan, president and CEO of Bell Atlantic -Maryland. "It recognizes the competitive nature ofour industry today. It is pro-consumer,pro-competition and pro-economic development." Under the plan, services would be divided into fivecategories: Access, Basic-Residential, Basic-Other,Discretionary and Competitive. The Access categoryincludes services that provide connections tolong-distance networks. Basic-Residential includesresidential dial-tone lines, while Basic-Otherincludes business services. Discretionary includesoptional services like Call Waiting, and Competitiveincludes services provided by other vendors, such asSpeed Dialing. Under the Bell Atlantic proposal, the rates forBasic-Residential services would be capped for aperiod of two years, and many business services forone year. After that, rates for these services couldbe increased or decreased annually, under a formulathat is based on changes in the Gross DomesticProduct-Price Index.  "Our residential rates have been stable since 1985,and this plan ensures that this stability will bemaintained," Whelan said. The plan is also designed to give Bell Atlanticadditional flexibility in pricing Discretionary andCompetitive services categories. For example, ratesfor discretionary services, such as Call Waiting andCaller ID, could be increased up to 25% annually orcould be reduced at any time, provided rates are notreduced below costs. Competitive services such asSpeed Dialing, which compete with services offered byBell Atlantic's competitors, would be subject to fullpricing flexibility. "This plan preserves the PSC's regulatory authorityto oversee telecommunications in Maryland, andfocuses on prices paid by customers, rather thanregulation of Bell Atlantic's earnings," Whelan said."The plan also guarantees that we will follow thecommission's service quality standards and maintainsrelevant safeguards, such as pricing services abovecosts to prevent anti-competitive behavior." Whelan said that Bell Atlantic's plan is also aimedat keeping Maryland competitive with neighboringstates. Numerous studies have shown that regulatorypolicies which allow a company to retain its earningscan lead to a more aggressive deployment of newtelecommunications services--services that wouldsupport Maryland's economic development goal ofattracting and retaining businesses and jobs.  "Although Maryland is leading the nation inintroducing telecommunications competition, we arethe only state in our region that has not adopted amore modern regulatory structure. It is thereforeimportant that we move forward prudently, butquickly," he added. Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at theforefront of the new communications, entertainmentand information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,the company is the premier provider of localtelecommunications and advanced services. Globally,it is one of the largest investors in the high-growthwireless communications marketplace.

The date January 1, 1996, forexample, would be recorded by a computer as:01/01/96. This notation system, according to deJager, is the problem. "The two-digit date notation affects datamanipulation, primarily subtractions andcomparisons," explains de Jager. "For instance, I wasborn in 1955. If I ask the computer to calculate howold I am today, it subtracts 55 from 93 and announcesthat I'm 38."So far so good. But what happens in the year 2000?The computer will subtract 55 from 00 and will statethat I am minus 55 years old. This error will affectany calculation that produces or uses time spans,such as an interest calculation."De Jager believes a number of Year 2000 relatedproblems may well manifest themselves in 1996."A large number of business processes, such as creditcards, operate on a four year cycle. In 1996, it willbe interesting to see if any banks issue credit cardswith '00' as an expiration year. What could happen isthat ATM machines may think that the card expired in1900 if only '00' is used to signify the year 2000."While year 2000 problems are often associated withlarge computing systems, it will affect desktopcomputers as well. Many people that shut off theirpersonal computers on December 31, 1999 could besurprised when they turn them on the next day to findtheir computer's clock set at January 4, 1980 -another strange error that experts predict will occurbecause of the way internal clocks in computershandle the rollover to a new year. Some experts estimate that the costs of reprogrammingcomputers to rid them of this flaw in the next fouryears could total hundreds of billions of dollars.Peter de Jager is an industry speaker on the topicsof managing the impact of technological change. Hewas the first to actively speak about on the Year2000 computer crisis to those outside the computerindustry. In April, 1995, de Jager partnered with The TenagraCorporation to develop the Year 2000 InternetInformation Center (http://www.year2000.com/) - anInternet web site devoted to raising awareness of theYear 2000 computer crisis.

EST MR. MCCURRY: Okay. All clear, right? Q Yeah, right. Q How come there's no meeting until next Friday? Whathappened? MR. MCCURRY: As you can tell from our statement, as--in fact, can I have a copy in my statement so I canjust keep repeating what's in the statement?(Laughter.) Q We heard the President say that he's willing tostay every day, work hard and so forth to get anagreement. What happened? MR. MCCURRY: He is. The key thing -- I'll do anexegetical of reading this statement for you. Thegood meetings that they had today refers to the twomeetings they had. They had a larger meeting in theCabinet Room and then the private meeting that thePresident had with the Speaker, the Majority Leader,the two Minority Leaders and Mr. Armey, too, Ibelieve -- George? Armey was there -- in the OvalOffice. They build on the progress in yesterday'sdiscussions. That's an important observation becauseyou will recall that Mr. Panetta and Mr. Domenici andMr. Kasich designed a process yesterday by which wedealt with some of the less controversial issues inthis budget dispute. That generated over a seven-yearperiod some $40 billion in savings in some of thesesecondary areas. That was presented to the principalstoday, and I think there was agreement that whilethere's nothing agreed until everything is agreed,that represented some progress and served as a usefulmodel of how we might resolve some of the largerissues. So the President and the other leaders agreed thatthat process by which staff develops an analysis,presents it to the budget advisors -- which is thePanetta, Domenici, Kasich, Sabo, Exon group -- theyought to work through this analysis beginning rightafter the holiday and then present that back to theprincipals a week from today, as they just didyesterday in looking at the issues that they lookedat. And I think that's useful.  There have been different ideas on how we mightadvance this discussion, ranging from face-to-facemeetings to whatever, but they had a process, theydesigned a process yesterday. It seemed to beworking. I think there was agreement, as you can tellfrom this statement, that they ought to continue touse that process to see if they could make progresson these other issues. Q No sense of urgency at all? MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of urgency. Q How can you say that? MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of a sense of urgency. ThisPresident would, above all else, like to see the fullservices of the American government restored to theAmerican people. But everybody in this room knowsthat's not going to happen because you've beenfollowing -- presumably, you've been following thedebate in the House and the Senate today. So you justknow where we are on that. Now what we are going to do, since we can't get thefull services of the government restored, they aregoing to deal with the most urgent situations thatexist. Those range from benefits checks for veteransto income support checks for children who aredependent on AFDC, to federal workers who are notgetting their pay. That was an area of very greatconcern raised by the President and agreed to by mostof the leaders in the room. And they are looking now at ways in which they mightbe able to address that situation, despite the factthat there doesn't seem to be agreement on CapitolHill for a CR that would be fully fund thegovernment. Everyone here knows that Democrats todayhave offered on Capitol Hill clean versions of the CRthat would re-open this government. And you all knowwhat's happened to those measures. Q Well, would it come to a vote at all? Q Mike, at the very least, does this mean thatthere's no end in sight for the shutdown, at leastnot until next Friday when the next meeting takesplace? MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are ways in which we willattempt to address the consequences of the shutdown.We will continue our work day by day at OMB toaddress the consequences of the shutdown. I believeyou will see as a result of this meeting today onCapitol Hill efforts by the leaders to address someof the specific consequences. It certainly appears that there will be someagreement on trying to get veterans' checks out ontime and trying to get income support payments tochildren out on time. But we'll have to deal with themost urgent consequences of the shutdown on aday-by-day basis, doing what we can, working with theHill and getting legislation passed and doing what wecan do administratively under law as we did in thelast shutdown to address the consequences thatthreaten life and health of the American people. Q Well, so, the President -- this is a club over thePresident which he is accepting, basically? MR. MCCURRY: No. The club over the President thatthey tried to swing was to insist upon him tabling aseven-year balanced budget proposal scored by the CBOin order to have exactly this type of discussion. Andthat did not happen. Q But, Mike, he has repeatedly said he would notnegotiate with a gun to his head, this sort of threatof shutting down the government. But now he's doingexactly that. MR. MCCURRY: Well, it's the result of thisconversation today, while not removed, the gun wasclearly uncocked.  Q Huh? MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've taken some of -- whetherit's veterans' benefits or welfare payments or nowwe've got some forward movement as a result of thismeeting on the issue of payments to workers who arefurloughed -- they're going to try to work throughsome of these issues, and they've instructed staff tolook at ways that they could deal with that. Q -- half-cocked, right? Q Mike, was there a definite agreement that thismeeting today from the Republicans to go ahead andmove through on a limited CR basis all these urgentmatters as they come up? MR. MCCURRY: Well, it would be better given theagreement that we've reached not to try tocharacterize or spin the results of this meeting, foryou to direct that question to the Republicans. Q And was there agreement to continue to -- MR. MCCURRY: The President was encouraged -- thePresident raised those as urgent issues, and thePresident was encouraged by the response. Q What was the tone of the meeting? MR. MCCURRY: Workman-like. Workperson-like. Q What is the President going to be doing thisweekend? Q Were there any women there? MR. MCCURRY: In other words, they rolled up their --they did, this was, in fact, exactly a meeting wherethey rolled up their sleeves and went to work. Q Did he ask them to open the government and theyrefused? MR. MCCURRY: He has done that repeatedly. Q I take it the House is going to go into recess, butthere are different versions of this very narrow -- MR. MCCURRY: I cannot help you sort out what'shappening in the House and the Senate. We'refollowing that and trying to make heads or tails outof that ourselves, but it's a very fluid situation.I'd ask your congressional correspondents. Q What does the President do this weekend? How doeshe advance it? MR. MCCURRY: Well, he's confident that those who willbe working through some of the analysis of the issueswill be at work. There will be some staff level work,but to be candid about it, the budget staffs at boththe CBO and the OMB have been working 24-hour daysfor several weeks, and the President is going to giveour OMB staff and economists the Christmas holidayoff. They'll come back after Monday beginning workingon this analysis of issues. They'll present that tothe budget advisors group. That's the Panetta,Kasich, Domenici, Exon, Sabo group. I expect theywill meet late next week and prepare the agenda andthe discussion for the principals a week from today. Q What is the guidance on what he's going to do? Ishe still going to go to Camp David next week? MR. MCCURRY: Since this is just developing, heprobably was looking for an opportunity to talk tothe First Lady about their plans. His plans are stillto be here through the 26th at least, and then theoption of going to Camp David from the 27th he'llhave to explore. I don't have an answer for you. Q Is Hilton Head out? MR. MCCURRY: If he goes down, I think -- he still hasan interest in going down and having a party with hisfriends on New Year's Eve. But I don't know whetherhe's going to be able to do that, or not. Q Mike, in today's meeting, did the President askthem to put the government back to work? MR. MCCURRY: He addressed his concern as he didpublicly for all of you at the -- I mean, the answerto that, obviously, is yes, because he did it withall of you present at the beginning of the meeting. Imean, he stressed that concern, he raised thatconcern. They talked about it during the meeting. Q And they said no still? MR. MCCURRY: The no came from the action on CapitolHill today, as you know. Q Mike, the $40 billion that you talked about, didthe principals all agree to where that was comingfrom and did they reach any agreement about where toput it? MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- again, I would stress,because I don't want anyone to misunderstand what theWhite House is saying that nothing is agreed untileverything is agreed. They were satisfied they madesome progress on those roughly $40 billion worth ofsavings generated by discussions they had on the widerange of things they dealt with yesterday fromspectrum to banking, to financial, to transportationissues, some of the other issues that they've dealtwith. That's a useful model. And then that goes intofurther discussions. I don't have any detail breakoutof that. I can't specify that, and I won't specifythat. Q Mike, is the President -- Q -- there's no Medicaid agreement? MR. MCCURRY: Santa? SANTA CLAUS: Ho-ho-ho-ho. MR. MCCURRY: It's very good to see you. SANTA CLAUS: Merry Christmas. MR. MCCURRY: Merry Christmas. Let's do a couple morequestions, and then I'll turn the podium over toSanta. Q Is the President comfortable with the way thisthing ended? Would he have preferred more talkstonight, obviously, on the weekend? Is it just donenow until next Friday? MR. MCCURRY: The President would prefer to see thegovernment open, prefer to see the balance -- thebudget balanced now. But we are into a process thatwe hope will resolve some of these issues and resolvesome of the differences that exist. These differencesstill exist. It's not possible to achieve either ofthose objectives today. Q But this timetable is to give everybody a Christmasat home, isn't it? MR. MCCURRY: This timetable is to allow people towork through issues that are deeply divided at themoment and that apparently were not reconcilabletoday. Q Was the President willing to work -- Q Just one other thing, Mike, on another matter. Asyou know, as a result of the compromise, thoseWhitewater notes were released, went to the Hill.Senator D'Amato and others have reacted. What's thesense here about what the effect of this is? Does itmake things better, make things worse, prolong thecontroversy, end it --what? MR. MCCURRY: I concur fully on Mr. Fabiani'sstatement. Q Mike, just to be clear here, are you saying thatthe President was willing to work, but the members ofCongress wanted to go back home? I mean, who was itwho said we shouldn't -- MR. MCCURRY: The issue was not the desire to go backhome. The issue was the desire to try to make someprogress on these issues. And they clearly were notgoing to write a seven-year balanced budget plan atthis meeting today. That was not in the expectationsfor the meeting. Q Well, how about next week? MR. MCCURRY: What they have done is designed aprocess by which we can get to that objective.  Let me just take one or two more. Q So the President was unwilling to work on Tuesday.I just want to find out -- MR. MCCURRY: Look, that is not the case. ThePresident is more than -- would have been willing ifit was some prospect that this would have led to asuccessful result to have worked all through theholiday. That's not going to happen. It was clear inthis meeting that they're not going to bridge these-- Q Well, did they tell him, we won't do it? MR. MCCURRY: It's clear that they weren't going tobridge all the differences that exist and write abudget that is a very complex document in the courseof a weekend. Q Mike, explain what is the goal here now? Is thegoal to produce, as the Republicans want, as Armeyhas said repeatedly, a bill -- a bill in the end thatthey send to him that puts the government back towork and it's a done deal? Or is the goal to get farenough along to where the Republicans finally give inand pass a CR? What's -- I mean, it's got to be oneor the other. MR. MCCURRY: The goal we have is to see the servicesof the government fully restored. We can't achievethat goal right now. What we can do right now is toaddress the most urgent consequences of thegovernment shutdown. And we will do that, and webelieve today we've got some sense of cooperationfrom the leaders in trying to address those mosturgent issues. I cannot predict for you now when thecontinuing resolution or full funding or fullappropriations measures will pass that will fullyrestore government. But I do know the President iscommitted to working towards satisfactory solutionsthat deal with the most urgent consequences of theshutdown. Q But does the President believe that a CR will bepassed before there is a final agreement on thebudget deal? MR. MCCURRY: The President doesn't rule out thatpossibility. Q Mike, a follow-up -- Q Why? Q -- do you think that federal workers will get paid?Some of them have been told to start filing forunemployment next week. MR. MCCURRY: The one positive thing that came out ofthe meeting is it was very clearly on the part ofeveryone in the room concern about the status offederal workers who are furloughed, federal workerswho are working as excepted employees who are notgoing to get paid until there is funding. And also --well, those are the two categories. And they -- inboth categories, there seems to be willingness on thepart of the leadership to explore remedies that wouldallow them to be paid despite the shutdown. And thatwas encouraging. We don't have an answer to thatproblem yet, but there is some agreement that theywill look for ways to try to get paychecks to thosepeople, especially during this holiday season. Q Armey has said that they're not going to have anyvotes at least until Wednesday evening, as they wereshutting down on the House floor. Given that youwouldn't quarrel with the notion that the governmentis going to stay shut down at a minimum, at leastuntil Wednesday night, or at least until Thursdaymorning? MR. MCCURRY: I would not quarrel with that. I mean,and he knows the House schedule better. That'sexactly the situation we're in. They're not going to,despite the efforts by Democrats on the Hill to passa continuing resolution today, that's not going tohappen. Q Mike, to follow on, do they go ahead, though, andapply for unemployment, which will cost thegovernment even more? MR. MCCURRY: They will have to take the best advicethey can get from the Office of Personnel Management,and they will know best the situation. Federalworkers should contact personnel advisers at theiragencies or look for notices from OPM on how tohandle those circumstances. Q But are they all furloughed? I mean, how do they -- MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are 470,000 federal workerswho are working now. The federal government isincurring a legal obligation to pay them. And what weagree at the very least is that we ought to figureout how to get paychecks to those people since we arelegally obligated to pay them one way or another. Wealso are very concerned about people who arefurloughed. And we encourage that the Republicanleadership on the Hill have pledged to make surethose people do get their pay restored. And we willlook for ways that we can do that, even advance fullappropriations or a continuing. There's no -- therewas no answer or solution to that problem today, butthere is some willingness to explore a way to dealwith that situation. Q I don't want to go over old ground, but what youmay be hearing from us is you say there's a verydiscernable sense of urgency, and yet here both sidesare taking several days off, and no meeting scheduleduntil next Friday. And that's hard for us to put thetwo and two together and -- MR. MCCURRY: Well, there clearly are some divisionsthat exist here. You've been hearing them expressedpublicly all day. And having meetings throughout theweekend that weren't going to resolve thosedifferences wouldn't be a fruitful exercise. Butthey've designed a process here that they believewill work. This is the one that worked yesterday, andthey believe it will work now. Q Were there any food fights? MR. MCCURRY: I don't think they served any beveragesor refreshments. Q When you say they believe, do you mean theprincipals believe? MR. MCCURRY: Yes, as they say in their statement,they believe that the process that they usedyesterday to reconcile some of these issues worked.And they believe that if they try to employ it forthe larger issues, they might get somewhere. Q Mike, what's next up on the table? I mean, I assumeyou're moving from the easiest or least controversialissues to the tougher -- MR. MCCURRY: Substantively, I can't -- I can't answerthat question substantively. Q Just one final process question. Did the form ofthe discussions that have occurred so far suggestthat there's a kind of a component-by-component,issue-by-issue approach to this budget in which,while everybody may have a complete budget on thetable, those complete budgets become less relevant asthis process goes forward? MR. MCCURRY: That's a very good question, Brit. Ican't -- since I did not participate in all of themeetings and especially the Oval Office one, I can'tanswer that completely. I can tell you that thecentral elements of this budget discussion are now sowell-known to the participants in these discussionsthat they can look at individual elements from someof the different proposals out there -- whether it'sBreaux-Chafee, whether it's coalition, whether it'sSenate Democrat, whether it's the President's plan,whether it's the original congressional resolution --and know, based on what they -- take the element,look at it, know, based on whatever the number is howit would fit into an overall final agreement. So it's an interesting question and it probably is auseful observation. There may be, if there's a finalagreement to be made, it's going to draw on a lot ofthe different ideas that are out there. Q Can I follow up on that Mike? Q Is the President still going to pre-tape the radioaddress? Q There was a sense at the beginning of the week thatif this was bumped up to the principals -- MR. MCCURRY: Radio? We're going to do it live now. Dowe know the subject yet? Budget.  Q If I could ask you a question to follow on Brit --There was a sense at the beginning of the week thatif this was bumped up to the principals -- thePresident, congressional leaders -- they took over,they might be able to resolve it faster. Is it thefeeling now that the process you're talking aboutwould -- MR. MCCURRY: I don't know that I accept thatcharacterization. I don't believe that I've ever saidthat. I don't know that anyone here at the WhiteHouse has ever said that. I believe it's been saidelsewhere that if the principals would get involved,they might be able to resolve these issues quicker.But that was always -- Q Well, they said -- MR. MCCURRY: I think that's correct. But I don't knowthat that's ever been entirely clear. Q Is it your feeling that the process that involvesthe Chief of Staff and the chairs of the committees,the process that they're developing works better? MR. MCCURRY: Well, the point I'm making is that itworked yesterday. We had an agreement -- remember, wehad an agreement to conduct some face-to-face talkswithout preconditions, and that process failedbecause it was not acceptable to a portion of theHouse Republican caucus. Now we've got a process.That process seemed to work yesterday in narrowingsome differences. And it's encouraging that they noware going to employ this process as they work throughnext week and then to prepare for the meeting -- Q What's the process? MR. MCCURRY: It's the one that's defined in thestatement. And we've been through that four or fivetimes already. Q One thing you haven't said in the good meeting iswhether or not the principals themselves made any ofthe decisions they were talking about having to makegoing into the meeting. Everybody talked about makingtough decisions. Did they make any decisions today orjust agree on -- MR. MCCURRY: Well, the toughest decisions are thosethat are dealing with the most controversial items inthe budget. And as you know, they didn't attempt toresolve those today. Okay, anything else? Q Yes, there's one more important point oncontractors. Contractors are not getting paid. Whathappens -- MR. MCCURRY: I can't help you at that level ofdetail.

CatfishProcessing Down 5 Percent Farm-raised catfishprocessed during November totaled 34.1 million poundsround weight, down 5 percent from November 1994. Theaverage price paid to producers was 78 cents perpound for November 1995, unchanged from the last twomonths and 1 cent above a year ago. Net pounds ofprocessed fish sold during November totaled 16.7million pounds, an increase of 2 percent from thecomparable month in 1994.Sales of fresh fish, at 6.91 million pounds, were up6 percent from November 1994 and represented 41percent of total sales. Frozen fish sales, at 9.77million pounds, were down 2 percent from a year agoand accounted for the remaining 59 percent of totalfish sales. Sales of whole fish represented 24percent of the total, fillets accounted for 54percent, and the remaining 22 percent were mostly,steaks, nuggets, and value added products. TheNovember 1995 average price received by processorsfor total fresh fish was $2.20 per pound, down 5cents from last year. Prices for fresh whole fishdecreased 7 cents per pound to $1.63.Prices for fresh fillets decreased 1 cent to $2.90per pound. Total frozen fish averaged $2.48 perpound, unchanged from November 1994. Prices forfrozen whole fish decreased 7 cents per pound to$1.95, while frozen fillets at $2.82 per pound weredown 6 cents from $2.88 a year ago. Freshwatercatfish imports during September 1995 totaled 402thousand pounds, up 25 percent from the 322 thousandpounds imported the previous year. Ninety- sixpercent of imports were from Brazil, with theremaining 4 percent coming from Canada and Vietnam.No exports were reported for September 1995. Octoberdata were not available at the time of this releasedue to Government furlough. If available they will beincluded in the release on January 23, 1996. Importand export data are compiled by the U.S. Bureau ofCensus.Catfish Processing Estimates Survey Procedures: Survey data for catfish processing are collected fromapproximately 30 processors. All participatingprocessors must meet the minimum criteria of having acapacity to process at least 2,000 pounds live weightof catfish per 8-hour shift. The survey is conductedentirely by NASS Headquarter's staff in Washington,D.C. NASS field offices, however, are responsible forkeeping Headquarters informed of any new processingoperations in their state to ensure that the surveycoverage is as complete as possible. Processors arecontacted either by mail or telephone. Diligenteffort is made to ensure that all operations areaccounted for in the estimate. Estimation Procedures: The "Catfish Processing" report refers strictly tofarm-raised fish and excludes wild, captured fish.Prior to summarization, questionnaires are comparedwith the previous month's reports for comparableplacement of data, reasonable price levels, andreasonable inventory carryover given the sales andprocessing totals reported. Estimates are made forthose processors whose reports are not available intime to be included in the release. These plants areidentified by an asterisk on page 5 of this release.Estimates are normally based on the processor'sprevious report and current conditions. Publishedtotals are a straight summation of the individualreports and estimated data. Price items are weightedby the associated volumes to compute weighted averageprices.The published price for total whole fish, however,reflects an adjustment to the round and gutted onlyprice to bring it to an equivalent dressed weightprice. If a plant uses a fiscal accounting system,proration is used to convert reported data to acalendar month basis. Only national level estimatesare published due to the limited number of plantsinvolved. Generally, individual items are notpublished if there are less than three plantsreporting, or if any one plant has 60 percent or moreof the total.One unique feature of the "Catfish Processing" reportis the listing of cooperating processors by name oneach month's release. This feature originally wasused to solicit industry cooperation in maintainingcoverage, but it has continued because of theprocessors' overall acceptance of this policy. Importand export data for frozen catfish fillets, which arecompiled by the Department of Commerce, are alsoincluded in this report. Reliability: Catfishprocessing estimates are based on a census of allknown active processors and, therefore, have nosampling variability. However, estimates may besubject to errors such as omissions, duplication, andmistakes in reporting, recording, and processing ofthe data. These errors are minimized through strictquality controls in the edit and summarizationprocess, and a careful review of all reported datafor consistency and reasonableness.Revision Policy:Revisions may be necessary following a review of latereports received from plants. Revisions of less than2 percent of the existing published levels of anycategory will normally not be made.Definitions Used For Catfish Processing:Average Price Paid to Producers - Refers to the priceof fish delivered to the processing plant door. Priceincludes charges for any services provided by theprocessing plant, such as seining and hauling, butdoes not include any adjustments based on year-endsettlements.Fillets - Boned sides of the fish, cut lengthwiseaway from the backbone.Fresh Fish - Fish intended for immediate consumption.Also referred to as ice-packed.Frozen Fish - Fish which are individually quickfrozen and glazed (IQF) or individually bagged andbulk frozen.Nuggets - Small fillets cut from below the ribsection of the fish. Usually includes breading oradded ingredients.Round & Gutted Only - Fish with no processing done orviscera only removed.Round Weight - A term for fish live weight.Steaks - Cross-section cuts from larger dressed fish.Strips - Finger size pieces of fish cut from fillets.Usually includes breading or added ingredients.Whole Dressed - Weight of whole fish with only head,viscera, and skin removed. Generally, 60 percent ofthe live weight remains as dressed fish.

In fact, the vast majority oflaw enforcement officers are victims, not villains. Contrary to what the media has portrayed, the NewOrleans Police Department is not filled with greedy,corrupt, drug dealing cops. The 100 officers I metare some of the most sincere, dedicated officers Ihave ever had the honor to instruct. The officershere are not villains. They are victims. Political Cause #1 - Pressuring departments to hirenew officers without conducting an effectivebackground investigation. Many agencies, having had ascandal, have been forced to hire people without athorough background investigation. History has taughtus that this usually becomes a "root cause" forfuture corruption.In addition to forcing the department to hireofficers without an effective backgroundinvestigation, other political influences led to thedestruction of their law enforcement. Money isusually a very poor way to motivate employees. Itceases to motivate people the moment they receive itand often results in decreasing levels of dedication.Political Cause #2 - Not supporting officers with afair salary. When officers are not paid enough tosupport their families, common sense dictates that asmall percentage of normally good officers will givein to the stress of being poor and the temptation ofeasy drug money being so prevalent.Political Cause #3 - Officers are understaffed andoverworked. Months and years of such pressure oftenmeans that their original motivation of sincerityevolves into the feeling that they are being used andmanipulated. Political Cause #4 - Politicians take actions thatdemoralize officers. Unfair salaries, beingunderstaffed, not having enough time to provideeffective training, seldom being told that you areappreciated; all create an internal culture that isnegative, cynical, suspicious and resentful. This, inturn, leads to employees committing unethical acts. Political Cause #5 - Public officials created an"internal culture" that causes unethical acts. Rolemodeling is the greatest way to influence anyone'sbehavior. When elected officials role model dirtypolitics and hidden agendas, the police departmentwill usually have the same degree of shamefullpolitics and hidden agendas which lead to corruption. The Solution:1. Provide effective leadership training to replacedirty politics with fair, respectful leadership.2. Implement state-of-the-art, video and audio tape,ehtical dilemma simulation training.3. Implement an administrative process that preventsunethical acts as opposed to simply reacting aftercorruption occurs. Training is the vehicle that leads to the preventionof scandals. The elected officials who createdcircumstances that led to these events may have doneso because they didn't appreciate the consequences oftheir actions. If so, then their education shouldprevent the continued betrayal of integrity.CONTACT: National Institute of EthicsTel: +1 407 339-0322Fax: +1 407 339-7139e-mail: ethics@acc.netM2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

Therefore, I hereby direct the Secretary of theTreasury to take appropriate action to suspend theapplication of the sanctions imposed on Serbia andMontenegro pursuant to Executive Order No. 12808 ofMay 30, 1992, Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5,1992, Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993,and Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993,effective upon the transmittal of this determinationto the Congress.

The national emergency declared in Executive OrderNo. 12808 and expanded in Executive Order No. 12934shall continue in effect. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed topublish this determination in the Federal Register.WILLIAM J. CLINTONMemorandum of Justification for PresidentialCertification Regarding the Modification of theApplication of U.S. Sanctions on Serbia andMontenegroThe Serbia and Montenegro sanctions program is a keyelement of the President's policy aimed at bringingabout a settlement of the conflict in the formerYugoslavia. The United States has continued to striveduring the past three years to ensure strongenforcement of the sanctions on Serbia andMontenegro. This has maintained the effectiveness ofthe sanctions program, motivating the Serbianleadership to come to the negotiating table. The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosniaand Herzegovina, signed in Paris on December 14,1995, produced agreement among the warring parties toestablish a single state of Bosnia-Herzegovina withinits pre-1992 borders. Bosnia will be governed by acentral government with constitutionally enumeratedpowers over internal and international affairs andwill contain two entities. Along with resolution ofmany thorny territorial issues, the parties agreed toregional stabilization measures as well as to protecthuman rights and fundamental freedoms and to holdelections within the next year. The agreement required more than two weeks ofintensive negotiations in Dayton. During the talks,all sides were forced to make concessions on a rangeof deeply held issues. The likelihood of sanctionssuspension was one of the key factors contributing toSerbian President Slobodan Milosevic's agreement atthe talks. As the representative of Bosnian Serbinterests at Dayton, Milosevic's role was crucial inreaching agreement. Sanctions relief was clearlyanticipated as a consequence of accord, and hasalready taken the form of the United Nations SecurityCouncil Resolutions 1021 and 1022, adopted by theCouncil on November 22, 1995. Before agreeing to sanctions suspension, we insistedon a credible reimposition mechanism to ensure nobacksliding on the commitments made by the Serbs. Ifthe IFOR commander or High Representative determinesthat the FRY or the Bosnian Serbs are not meetingtheir obligations under the Peace Agreement, economicsanctions may again go into effect against the Serbs.Accordingly, we plan to leave the SanctionsAssistance Mission infrastructure and monitors inplace.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

ESTMR. MCCURRY: Let me just tell you what's going onright now. The President of the United States isthanking individually the various members of thebudget staffs that have been supporting theadministration team during these discussions, folksfrom Health and Human Services, Treasury, OMB, theNational Economic Council, Mr. Panetta's staff, thosethat have done extraordinary work over the last weekand, as you'll be able to tell in a moment, have gotan extraordinary amount of work today and tomorrow. The budget discussions today led to an agreement bythe principals to instruct staff to really summarizethe discussions they've been able to have over thelast several days, which resulted in exploring thedifferences that exist in a range of areas fromincome support programs to welfare, to tax issues, tohealth care finance issues -- to really summarizethose discussions and draw together the places wherethere appeared to be some agreement between theRepublican side, the administration and thecongressional Democrats; and then, also set forth inmore precise detail the areas that there clearly arestill differences.  That will lead to a meeting that will happen here atthe White House Tuesday evening, either lateafternoon or early evening -- I suspect more earlyevening -- between the budget principals. They willreconvene, review the discussion document that isprepared by staff over the next day and a half, andthey will begin, I think they all believe, the moreserious discussions of tradeoffs that exist on thelarge issues that will be fundamental to a finalagreement. But they all clearly remain committed tothis process and the process is working. They aremaking progress because they are defining the areasof agreement and disagreement more clearly. And thePresident's satisfied that they're making progress.  The President also strongly encouraged thecongressional leaders to find a way to pass somemeasure that would restore federal workers to theirrightful places of employment. He also wants them tobe paid, but he understands that those are -- thereare different points of view on that issue. He hopesthey can resolve some of these issues. Q What's his point of view on that? MR. MCCURRY: He believes they should be working, theyshould be paid, and the government should be fullyopen, as he said over and over and over again. Q Any suggestion, any hint that they were close toworking some deal today? MR. MCCURRY: They worked on it a lot. There wasconsiderable side-bar discussion during this meetingbetween House and Senate staffers, and Senatestaffers between the Republican and Democratic side,and that will lead to whatever action occurs on theHill shortly. Q Did Dole and Daschle say they would -- MR. MCCURRY: I'm not going to comment on the businessthat they need to do themselves on the Hill. Q Mike, Tony Blankley said that there was one areathat was not covered in the walk-through. What isthat area? He said it was one major area. MR. MCCURRY: I suspect -- can you run and check onthis? I suspect the answer to that is Medicaid. ButBarry will run that down. Q They didn't act on that at all? MR. MCCURRY: They spent a lot of time discussingMedicare. The almost entire discussion today wasdevoted to Medicare and different options. And whatthe President and congressional leaders asked for issomething that really defines more clearly what thepolicy choices are in Medicare given the respectivepositions of the various budget proposals that areout there. Q Mike, in the event that there is some kind of dealin the Senate, will there be any briefing here onwhat -- the technicalities of what that means for thegovernment? MR. MCCURRY: Well, if there's a final agreement inCongress that would restore federal workers to theirjobs, OMB staff will be available to talk about howthat will affect any restart activities that theyhave. But we'll direct that to OMB because they'll bein the best place to analyze that. Q Mike, can you confirm that as of yesterday they hadan agreement in principle to at least a packet ofsavings of $100 billion in social spending? MR. MCCURRY: Well, that would be -- that requiressome rough eyeballing that I don't think you canreally do under the circumstances. There aredifferent ways that you can look at the categories ofthings they've done here. There are some areas wherethere are clear agreements and they should be able torather quickly write the legislative language thatwould lock in some of the things they've agreed to.  There are other areas where it's a little fuzzier,where there are some different options that exist andyou could get a range of savings depending on how youcalculate it. But my guess is -- I saw that commentin one of the stories today; I think that wasprobably a rough eyeball guess that someone made thatwould try to put a numeric value on some of the workthey've done. Frankly, I'd caution people hereagainst using that kind of calculation because theranges are so large when you look at the big ticketissues. There could be considerably more in savings,depending on how you judge the progress they made onsome of these discussions. Q What are the differences on Medicaid without goinginto detail? Are they financial or are theyphilosophical? MR. MCCURRY: Both.  MR. TOIV: Medicaid is the issue, but it was discussedin the context of block grants, the whole block grantissue, but not separately as a -- MR. MCCURRY: The fundamental dispute there is theguarantee of health care coverage and the federalentitlement and what happens if you block-grant it.Now, that's a large issue and one of the issuescovered particularly as they dealt with domesticdiscretionary spending, which they did both yesterdayafternoon and yesterday evening. So I think that they've touched on that aspect ofMedicaid, but they haven't gone through all the --they haven't gone through it in the same detail andprecision on that issue as they have some of theother areas that they've looked at. Now, that will becovered by some of the staff work. They are going totake some look at issues related to that as they workover the next day and a half. They'll be preparingsome side-by-side analyses of how the differentissues play out. Q Are they working from the same base numbers? MR. MCCURRY: They're working from the samecalculation of what the budget impact is based on CBOnumbers, yes. Q What's the point of all these hours of walkingthrough this? It seems to me we all know what the bigdifferences are. MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not necessarily true. Imean, everyone knows what the big differences are andwhat the big numbers look like on a single sheet ofpaper. But remember, every one of those large numbersis premised on fundamental policy decisions that havea great deal of nuance and complexity associated withthem. And I think it's encouraging and the principalsare encouraged at how detailed these discussions havebeen. They have looked item by item at these policyimplications of the large numbers.  I think many Americans think, well, gee, you gettogether in the room and you split the difference ina simple arithmetic. That's not policymaking.Policymaking requires attention to the detail thatunderscores each of those numbers. And that's thework they've been doing.  Now, based on the very intense discussions they'vehad, the staff can now summarize in a much moredetailed fashion what the specifics of a legislativeapproach to a final budget agreement would look like.That's encouraging because it means if they do reachan agreement on a final budget package, the work ofassembling that and putting it in legislativelanguage would be considerably easier based on thediscussions they've had here. In a sense, oneparticipant compared this to something like aconference committee on the Hill; they're doing muchthe same thing they would do in a House-Senateconference committee, looking at big issues,discussing the policy differences, and then making itpossible for staff to write what amounts to aconference report. Q Are they getting a sense of how far away they arefrom reaching some kind of final agreement? Are theygetting a sense of the kind of time frame they'relooking at? MR. MCCURRY: They could be so near or so far awaybecause it will depend in part on what types oftradeoffs they make on the large issues. They havenot attempted to take the big issues, as Hillary justsaid that everyone knows are out there, and reconcilethem. They've approached this from saying, let'snarrow as closely as we can the differences thatexist and define better what types of tradeoffs willexist once you've reached those big decisions. But Isuspect that by Tuesday night when they meet again,they're going to start moving to those morefundamental issues that will have to be embraced ifthere's going to be a final agreement, which is whyright now it's impossible to say one way or anotherwhether they will actually reach an agreement. Q -- an agreement in the order in which they'll takeup the big issues? Because, as you've said in thepast, you would prefer that the spending and thefinal decisions on spending determine the size of atax cut. MR. MCCURRY: I don't believe -- they have given alist of specifics to the staff to address, but Ican't say for certain that the principals will workthrough those issues in the same order -- that theygo from income maintenance through health carefinance issues to discretionary spending issues torevenue issues. But I don't guarantee that that's theorder in which they will be addressed on Tuesdaynight. Q Would you say that they have finished stage one,the walk-through process, then and are getting -- areheading into stage two, the decision-making process? MR. MCCURRY: They finished the walk-through processduring the course of the day yesterday, with theexception of the more detailed discussion of Medicarethat they wished to have today. They are nowpreparing for what amounts to the tradeoffs that willhave to occur. Q Is the President ready to compromise and trade off? MR. MCCURRY: Well, the President is ready to continueto discuss these issues in good faith. Q In what context have they discussed SocialSecurity? MR. MCCURRY: It has been related to many of theirdiscussions of health care finance, Medicare inparticular, and related in some respects to theirAFDC discussions since they're all covered by thevarious titles of the Social Security Act. Q Did they talk about it in terms of -- MR. MCCURRY: They've had -- I believe they had a verybrief discussion of the CPI issue, and there was notinstant resolution of that. Q You said that there's a day-and-a-half discussionbeginning on Tuesday evening that concerns -- MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, it was a day and a half forwork now. The staff is going to be working -- one ofthe reasons the President wanted to spend some timewith our courageous and noble staffers is they arenow going to work for the rest of the day today andthey're apparently going to start about 9:00 a.m.tomorrow and they'll be able to work all day longtomorrow. That's not going to be any -- we're notgoing to arrange any press coverage of that, that'sjust the work they're going to be doing, bothinformal and probably getting together at variouspoints. Q Going back to -- how would you characterize theagreement so far money-wise? You won't say $100billion. How would you characterize it -- issue-wise,money-wise? MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've made good progress. It's alarge sum of money, but it's not satisfactory --wouldn't be sufficient to reach the balanced budgetgoals. That would require some additionaldecision-making that obviously wouldn't happen beforeTuesday night. Q Can you offer any color or anecdotal details oftoday's meeting? MR. MCCURRY: Well, they continued -- we do the beston food more than anything else. (Laughter.) They hadthe traditional congressional meeting donuts backtoday, for some reason. We were on a health food kickyesterday, but today -- normally, when the bipartisancongressional leadership meet with the President theyhave wonderful donuts available. And they reappearedand quickly disappeared during the meeting today. There was a lot of kibitzing. As the result of beingtogether over the couple of days, there were momentswhere the partisan sides are able to tease each otheror get little quips in on each other from time totime, and there was a fair amount of that going on. Idon't have a specific example of that that I canthink of off my head, but there's some of what Iwould describe as general ribbing back and forth. The Speaker was concerned that we all make sure that--he was concerned about a question he got in thepool session this morning and he was nervous that wenot over-interpret those -- the appearance on theEvans and Novak Show. Some of us watched that andsome of us managed to stay awake through it.(Laughter.) Q As he shouted Ron down -- did they discuss that? Ashe shouted Ron down, did he and the President thendiscuss that? MR. MCCURRY: No, they didn't. They didn't, althoughthe Speaker reached that with some of us and wedidn't take any offense at his remarks. Q You didn't take any offense at the remarks at all? MR. MCCURRY: No. Compared to other things that hesays, they -- (laughter.) Q Dole and Gingrich have said before that they seeWednesday as sort of a deadline; they're going to beadjourning Congress and reopening Congress. Is thereany sense that you'll know by Wednesday that you'regoing to have a deal or you're not going to have adeal? MR. MCCURRY: You mean on this question of federalworkers and -- Q No, no, no. No, over the budget deal, the budgetnegotiations. Q The CR would expire -- I mean, they're saying thatyou're supposed to have it finished in the firstsession, which is -- MR. MCCURRY: In the statutory and in the firstsession is on Wednesday, and clearly one reasonthey're meeting Tuesday night is with that deadlinein mind. But I wouldn't predict at this point itwould be possible to get an outline of agreement byWednesday. Certainly everyone hopes to get anagreement on a balanced budget as quickly aspossible. Q I watched the back-and-forth there. The money thatwe're not supposed to put a numerical figure onthat's not necessarily $100 billion, but is something-- what does that concern? MR. MCCURRY: I made that so absolutely, magnificentlyimpenetrable, there would be no way you could answerthat. (Laughter.) Look, the reason is as you lookthrough these issues it could be -- they've got --$100 billion is a rough estimate of some of the workthat were in the so-called tier two issues that werebeing handled at the budget advisors level. That'swhere it has come from. Now, if you look at some of the other issue areas --the so-called tier three issues -- where they'veidentified some agreement in policy approaches,they've got considerably more than that, I wouldguess. But I can't put a dollar figure on that, norshould I, because it's subject to further discussion.And in any event, as we've said all along again, theyhave to get agreement on a whole package before itall matters. Q Tier two is what? Tier two is nonentitlement,discretionary -- MR. MCCURRY: Tier one -- they've defined issues asthey worked at both the staff and budget advisorissues as tier one, tier two, tier three issues, asthey rank order some of the policy questions. Andjust, for example, in the area of revenues I thinkthere were, what, Barry -- 70 separate issues thatthey needed to examine. Now, they range from -- tier one would be somethingwhich there is a common approach both in the balancedbudget act, in the President's approach on policyterms that's reflected in some of the otherdiscussion documents they've looked at, whether it'sBreaux-Chafee, whether it's Daschle, whether it's thecoalition budget, that there's some commonalityapproach and they think they can lock in languagethat would satisfy everybody. So, in other words, adone deal; it looks like that will be easy to do. Tier two are areas where there are differences, butthey're fairly close. They can be significant policyissues, but there are ways in which you could bridgethe gaps. And they concentrated a lot of work on thetier two issues. And I think that's where they foundagreement that would take you beyond this mythical$100 billion that was reported somewhere today. And then tier three issues are the more fundamentaldifferences that really are central to getting finalagreement. And as I say, those are ones in which theyagree to sharpen up the discussion by really lookingfor how you define and analyze the tradeoffs thatwould have to happen in order to reconcile those twoor three issues. But that's work that will have to goon on Tuesday. Q Does it have to be balanced down to a penny? Imean, it has to be actually -- the numbers have to becoinciding totally? MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- it's more -- the moreimportant issue and then more of these discussionshave been around the policy has to be agreed to, howdo you -- what's the policy going to be. Q Are tax cuts on the table? MR. MCCURRY: Tax relief for working families hasalways been on the table. Q I didn't ask that. I asked would tax cuts -- Q When this is all finished, for each of the majortopics they talked about will there be a figure foreach of seven fiscal years that will be the limitleading to a zero deficit? MR. MCCURRY: Well, when it's all said and done andthey have a final agreement they will have a documentthat then can be scored by CBO that could producethat type of analysis, sure. Q Going back to -- can you characterize at all this-- without the figure, what kind of subject areasthere are agreement? How will you characterize theareas they have agreement on? You don't want to do itmoney-wise. Subject-wise, anything besides -- MR. MCCURRY: No, that's a -- I mean, substantivelywe're not -- that just is more fuel for a lot ofincorrect speculation. And as the Speaker made thepoint today, that it has helped them that they've nottried to score points in the public discussion ofthese deliberations. Q I just want to clarify -- if, for purpose ofdiscussion the President is talking about CBOassumptions in all of these discussions, is he thenacquiescing to CBO's growth predictions, its interestrate predictions? MR. MCCURRY: Not necessarily. I mean, that might bethat the issue of how you define assumption, willlook at assumptions -- and more importantly, how youdecided when certain budget features would trigger onor trigger off. Q I'm sorry, could you run that past me one moretime? You're saying he is not in agreement with theCBO -- MR. MCCURRY: I said that -- the question is aboutassumptions, has he agreed to lock in the CBOassumptions. I think that's still an area that theprincipals could explore as they look at issues likewhen certain budget features trigger on, trigger off,how you measure that and how you look at impact. Forpurposes of these discussions they have agreed to aCBO evaluation on what the budget options are. I'mnot going to get any more specific than what I justsaid, although I just gave you a very good hint. Q In talking about Medicare today and trying to talkabout their differences of viewpoint on medicalinflation, what are they -- whose numbers are theyutilizing? MR. MCCURRY: Well, for an informed discussion theyuse -- they were relying on budget experts at CBO, atHHS, they were looking at different types ofanalysis. Q Oh, this is the last tier thing where if you savemoney on discretionary in the last years then youhave to trigger off, based on if you beat the CBOassumptions? MR. MCCURRY: Well, trigger-on, trigger-off is anaspect of various budget proposals that are outthere. There are some in the coalitions, there is onein the President's most recent offer. Q What's he going to do at Hilton Head? MR. MCCURRY: In Hilton Head he's looking forward toseeing his friends, first and foremost; spending timewith his family; having dinner with his friendstonight and spending some time outdoors tomorrow.It's been raining -- Q What time do you expect -- Q Mike, will he say anything on going out to thehelicopter? MR. MCCURRY: No, I think he wants to just get downthere and see his friends and have New Year's Evewith people he's spent New Year's Eve with for thelast 12 years. All right, happy New Year, everybody. Have a safe andprosperous 1996. Q Did they all wish each other a happy New Year? MR. MCCURRY: They did. Actually, they said goodbye toeach other, happy New Year to each other. There was alittle bit of discussion about travel plans foreverybody. I think, as you know, Senator Dole afterthe senate session is going up to New Hampshire. Q Did the President wish him well? MR. MCCURRY: There was some good natured discussion.He's going for the first eve festivities, orsomething like that. I would say that there continuesto be a good atmosphere in these discussions, buteverybody is realistic enough to know that there aresharp differences that still exist and that there's alot of hard work ahead. Q Any idea when they're going to actually be donewith any sort of an agreement on the seven-year plan-- to they have a time -- can't do it by Wednesday? MR. MCCURRY: No, I think -- I think that everyoneunderstands -- the President is very cognizant of theSpeaker's concern about doing this within thestatutory calendar of the first session. In fact, thePresident, at several points when it was suggestedthere's going to be a lot of work that would have tobe done to get this discussion document together,that it might not be done by Tuesday, the Presidentadmonished everybody again and said it was very hardto ask people to work on the holiday. But thatbecause of the Speaker's concern about January 3rdand that date, that it was important to have ameeting during the day on Tuesday, even if it had tobe late in the day. So we understand the importanceof that and that's why everyone is committed totrying to work this through as quickly as they can. Q Do you think there will be meetings between theprincipals Wednesday, Thursday -- every day untilthere's -- MR. MCCURRY: I can't predict. I'm taking it a day ata day. I'll tell you what I know, they plan to meetTuesday night and we'll see where we go from there. Q So they have until midnight Wednesday night,Thursday morning -- or is that -- MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not -- I want to make itclear that's not a -- that's a date that's importantto the Speaker, for reasons that the Speaker can tellyou because it relates to the statutory deadline ofthe first session, and it also relates to thecontinuing resolution issue. But I think we need --you know, from our point of view we just need tocontinue to work to try to resolve the issues and doit as expeditiously as possible. Q Is it midnight Tuesday or midnight Wednesday -- MR. MCCURRY: You should ask the House Speaker. It'stheir deadline, not ours.

H.R. 1530 would unacceptably restrict my ability tocarry out this country's national security objectivesand substantially interfere with the implementationof key national defense programs. It would alsorestrict the President's authority in the conduct offoreign affairs and as Commander in Chief, raisingserious constitutional concerns. First, the bill requires deployment by 2003 of acostly missile defense system able to defend all 50States from a long-range missile threat that ourIntelligence Community does not foresee in the comingdecade. By forcing such an unwarranted deploymentdecision now, the bill would waste tens of billionsof dollars and force us to commit prematurely to aspecific technological option. It would also likelyrequire a multiple-site architecture that cannot beaccommodated within the terms of the existing ABMTreaty. By setting U.S. policy on a collision coursewith the ABM Treaty, the bill would jeopardizecontinued Russian implementation of the START ITreaty as well as Russian ratification of START II --two treaties that will significantly lower the threatto U.S. national security, reducing the number ofU.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads bytwo-thirds from Cold War levels. The missile defenseprovisions would also jeopardize our current effortsto agree on an ABM/TMD (Theater Missile Defense)demarcation with the Russian Federation. Second, the bill imposes restrictions on thePresident's ability to conduct contingency operationsessential to national security. Its restrictions onfunding of contingency operations and the requirementto submit a supplemental appropriations requestwithin a time certain in order to continue acontingency operation are unwarranted restrictions ona President's national security and foreign policyprerogatives. Moreover, by requiring a Presidentialcertification to assign U.S. Armed Forces under United Nations operational ortactical control, the bill infringes on thePresident's constitutional authority as Commander inChief. Third, H.R. 1530 contains other objectionableprovisions that would adversely affect the ability ofthe Defense Department to carry out national defenseprograms or impede the Department's ability to manageits day-to-day operations. For example, the billincludes counterproductive certification requirementsfor the use of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative ThreatReduction (CTR) funds and restricts use of funds forindividual CTR programs.  Other objectionable provisions eliminate funding forthe Defense Enterprise Fund; restrict the retirementof U.S. strategic delivery systems; slow the pace ofthe Defense Department's environmental cleanupefforts; and restrict Defense's ability to executedisaster relief, demining, and military-to-militarycontact programs. The bill also directs theprocurement of specific submarines at specificshipyards although that is not necessary for ourmilitary mission to maintain the Nation's industrialbase.H.R. 1530 also contains two provisions that wouldunfairly affect certain service members. One requiresmedically unwarranted discharge procedures forHIV-positive service members. In addition, I remainvery concerned about provisions that would restrictservice women and female dependents of militarypersonnel from obtaining privately funded abortionsin military facilities overseas, except in cases ofrape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. Inmany countries, these U.S. facilities provide theonly accessible, safe source for these medicalservices. Accordingly, I urge the Congress to repeala similar provision that became law in the"Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996." In returning H.R. 1530 to the Congress, I recognizethat it contains a number of important authoritiesfor the Department of Defense, including authorityfor Defense's military construction program and theimprovement of housing facilities for our militarypersonnel and their families. It also containsprovisions that would contribute to the effective andefficient management of the Department, includingimportant changes in Federal acquisition law. Finally, H.R. 1530 includes the authorization for anannual military pay raise of 2.4 percent, which Istrongly support. The Congress should enact thisauthorization as soon as possible, in separatelegislation that I will be sending up immediately. Inthe meantime, I will today sign an Executive orderraising military pay for the full 2.0 percentcurrently authorized by the Congress and will sign anadditional order raising pay by a further 0.4 percentas soon as the Congress authorizes that increase. I urge the Congress to address the Administration'sobjections and pass an acceptable National DefenseAuthorization Act promptly. The Department of Defensemust have the full range of authorities that it needsto perform its critical worldwide missions.WILLIAM J.

ESTMR. MCCURRY: Several people said they needed morethan the paper that you now have available, so haveat me. Q I need something on the budget. MR. MCCURRY: You need something on the budget? Well,we need a budget, period, so we can put thegovernment back to work --Q Gingrich said a little while ago that he thoughtthat maybe you should negotiate every day until theygot an agreement. Is the President willing to dothat? MR. MCCURRY: I thought the idea was that they weregoing to lock everyone in a room and -- Q That was the freshmen -- Q What's your reaction to all that? MR. MCCURRY: Whether we would be willing? Q -- marathon talks? MR. MCCURRY: We would be willing to lock thePresident and the Speaker, the Majority Leader andthe Democratic leaders in a room until they get adeal so long as we could lock the House Republicanfreshmen out. Q I may need Q-tips, Mike, but I can't hear whatyou're saying. Q Can you talk up, Mike? MR. MCCURRY: Their approach has not beenconstructive, because they had been insisting on nocompromises. For a negotiation of that nature to workthere has to be a give-and-take attitude and agood-faith negotiation. We keep getting -- we've gota particularly interesting idea here from SenatorDole and from Speaker Gingrich that we just go aheadand accept unacceptable appropriations bills and wecan talk about it later. That's putting the cartbefore the horse and allowing them the opportunity ifthey so choose to get up and walk away and leave usstuck with bills that are not in the interest of theAmerican people. So there's a lot of -- the Presidentis concerned that we're getting back into a cycle ofshenanigans here rather than serious, good-faithnegotiations that will move us forward.  The President has been working hard today, as youknow. He's withheld comment on some of these moreboisterous remarks. And he just wants to worktomorrow, see if we can make progress on budgetissues, achieve the goal of a balanced budget, andabove all else, get our government open so theAmerican people get their government back. ThePresident was disappointed today to hear that theRepublican leadership assessment is that they willforce the American people to go at least six moredays with a lack of full government services as wenegotiate these budget issues. The President hasconsistently demonstrated that he is conducting thesediscussions in good faith. And he believes thatthat's reason enough for the Republicans in the Houseof Representatives to lift this shutdown ofgovernment services. Q Mike, have you heard back from your officials whoare at the budget talks today?MR. MCCURRY: I don't -- I believe they're stillworking. At last report, they were still working. Andthe only thing we've heard is that they continued towork in a productive environment. And they continueto focus on how they can help the decision-makersnarrow differences tomorrow. Q What time is the budget advisers meeting set fortomorrow, and where will it be held? MR. MCCURRY: We believe it's going to be around 10:00a.m., 10:30 a.m. and on the Hill, we think. The Congress is hosting tomorrow, so it will up tothem to announce. But we're planning for 10:00 a.m.to 10:30 a.m. on the budget advisers meeting. Then weintend to host the Democratic leaders here at roughly2:30 p.m. tomorrow; and the full principals group,including Representative Armey, the Speaker, theMajority Leader, who will then be joined by theDemocratic leaders at approximately 3:15 p.m., 3:30p.m., in that neighborhood. Q And do you have an agenda for those talks? Is itgoing to be on narrow items or broad-ranging policy? MR. MCCURRY: What the team of staff people from theCongress and the White House have been doing arereally shaping those discussions by looking at whatthe different proposals are. Remember, this is aboutmore than dollar figures. It's also about thepolicies that underscore those numbers. When you picka number and put it in a budget outline, it's not anumber picked out of thin air. There are policyassumptions that underpin those numbers. And what the-- what we believe the staff people have been doingis looking at where those policy differences are andsharpening up that discussion so the budget advisersand the principals can have a more enlightenedconversation. Q Are you saying he's going to meet Dole and Gingrichat 2:30 p.m. and then broaden the meeting? MR. MCCURRY: No, I'm sorry, he's going to meet withSenator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt atapproximately 2:30 p.m., and then they'll be joinedby the rest of the group later. Q And, excuse me, is there a session with thePresident and Panetta here before Panetta goes to theHill? MR. MCCURRY: They will be talking at some point.We're not certain when that will happen, but weexpect Mr. Panetta back in town sometime latertonight. Q Mike, both Gingrich and Dole seem to be talkingabout tomorrow's principals talks carrying over untilSaturday and maybe even beyond that. Is that anexpectation the White House has? MR. MCCURRY: Well, we -- we hope they're right,because that would reflect and be some sense ofoptimism, and that would indicate that they are hardat work and moving towards the goal of a balancedbudget, which is what the President desires. Q Is it incorrect to say that the President's team,having reviewed kind of what ought to go on thetable, has some new markers to lay down or has somenew ideas? MR. MCCURRY: I believe that we are prepared to havegood-faith discussions. And, you know, we're willingto bridge differences that exist as long as there's awillingness on the other side to reciprocate. Q Has the President done anything himself today topersonally move the process along -- like has hetalked to any of the Republican leaders on the phone? MR. MCCURRY: He's continued to work on thisextensively. And he would prefer that we keep anyconversations that he may have had private. Q So what's he done? MR. MCCURRY: What? Q So what's he done if he's been working so hard? MR. MCCURRY: He's been working with Director Rivlin.He's been having some conversations. He's beenworking hard. Q Are you denying he -- I mean, how do you say it --Imean, you prefer not to -- I mean, you're saying he'shad some, but you just won't say who? MR. MCCURRY: I said I would prefer to keep anyconversations that he may have had private, at hisrequest. Q Well, we're not asking you for the -- what theconversation is; who did he talk to? MR. MCCURRY: Well, he didn't -- Q Did he talk to Dole and Gingrich? MR. MCCURRY: He would prefer that I not say. Q Did he protest the fact that they don't meet again-- the House doesn't meet again until Wednesday? MR. MCCURRY: He's very concerned -- Q -- to them? MR. MCCURRY: -- very concerned by the statements fromthe Republican leaders today that made it clear thatthey don't really have any intention of movingforward to open the government before next Wednesday.The President believes the government ought to bereopened now. And he believes the fact that they areinvolved in good-faith negotiations to balance thebudget should be reason enough for Congress to passthe necessary continuing resolution that would reopenthe government. Q Gingrich says it won't pass the House -- just theintention. MR. MCCURRY: Well, the Speaker -- probably a verycandid assessment of the Speaker's read of thesentiment of some his members. But he also pointedout that 79 members apparently can hold hostage themajority of the House, which is unfortunate. Q What was the read here on the freshmen pressconference today where they said -- they sort of tookthe stance of we just want to stay and get this done;everything's on the table and so forth? Is that ashift in your opinion? MR. MCCURRY: It was a shift from the position theytook after we met with the Speaker and the MajorityLeader and worked through a way that we could bothreopen the government and have good-faithnegotiations and developed a formula to have thePresident -- remember, the President agreed with theSpeaker and the Majority Leader to have exactly thosearound-the-clock discussions. And that agreement fellapart when those same House Republican freshmenobjected. So it sounds like it's a change of tune ontheir part -- Q But what's going on? MR. MCCURRY: -- and if it's a more constructiveattitude on their part, we welcome it. Q Mike, is the President willing or unwilling tocompromise on funding levels for Medicare, Medicaidand the size of a tax cut? MR. MCCURRY: The President has always indicated thathe's willing to have good-faith negotiations. And heunderstands that he can't rule out compromises. Onthe other hand, he has repeatedly and consistentlymade clear his fundamental priorities in thisdiscussion. They are now a matter of law becausethey're in the continuing resolution. They have beenadopted by the Congress presumably. And they includeproviding and continuing necessary funding forMedicare and Medicaid. Q What is the White House expectation tomorrowafternoon that with Gingrich and Dole saying, youknow, if we can meet for two or three days we getthis hammered out, that tomorrow afternoon will bethe beginning of long negotiations over the weekend?I mean, what's the White House expectation? MR. MCCURRY: We share their abundant hope that theycan reach that -- Q Dole also said he was going to New HampshireSunday, so -- MR. MCCURRY: Well, I noticed that the Speaker of theHouse seemed to criticize him for that, but wecertainly wouldn't. Q Mike, Senator Dole also talked about bringing thewelfare -- MR. MCCURRY: Harold, how am I doing? (Laughter.) Q Terrible. (Laughter.) MR. MCCURRY: All right, let's wrap this up -- ourintent is to give you a full lid when we're donehere, right? Have we checked on a full lid? Q Mike, Dole also said that he was thinking aboutbringing the welfare bill here tomorrow in the hopethat the President might sign -- MR. MCCURRY: Look, welfare reform is now a subjectwe've had enormous volumes of discussion about withthis Congress. They know very clearly what thePresident considers welfare reform. And they knowvery manifestly that this ain't it. Q Mike, why did the President not go ahead and signthe executive order on the military pay raise today?Is there's some technical issues he's waiting -- MR. MCCURRY: No, he did. MS. TERZANO: -- it may have been signed already. Itwasn't signed immediately because we were changingthe -- MR. MCCURRY: We were conforming the text and doingsome other things necessary to make sure they had anaccurate submission. But as our statement earlierindicated, he intends to put that forward. We shouldhave the -- we do have the text out now. Q Dole started talking about sending theappropriations back and changing them a little bit.Is that a -- I mean, he said it before, but he'snever said about changing them. MR. MCCURRY: I took that idea on a little bitearlier, Kevin. I just said that that's not -- that'snot a constructive approach here. They're asking thePresident to put the cart before the horse, to acceptunacceptable appropriations bills as a condition forhaving discussions -- it seems. And that's not theenvironment of good faith discussions that we've hadup to this point. Q But if they were willing to take out some of theprovisions in some of these bills that the WhiteHouse has objected to -- MR. MCCURRY: Well, that -- they need to do a lot tofix these appropriation bills, and they know that.And most of what they need to fix are very essentialto the budget discussions that are being held; that'swhy the President vetoed these appropriations billsin the first place. Look, they are feeling -- and rightfully so --feeling a great deal of heat now for keeping thisgovernment shut for 14 days. And they're trying toindicate that they're doing something about that andthey're suggesting that, you know, if Clinton hadjust signed these appropriations bills -- and I thinkthe American people know the President cast thesevetoes because he can't accept what he thinks are notin the best interests of the American people. Q Didn't he take the defense appropriation and vetothe authorization? MR. MCCURRY: He vetoed an authorization bill for thespecific reasons that he cited. Q Right, but he took the appropriation bill, eventhough it was $7 billion more than he wanted. MR. MCCURRY: Well, he took a defense appropriationsbill and accepted it and signed it for the reasonsthat he set forth. A defense authorization billestablishes long term national security policy; and,in this case, very clearly would commit the Presidentto an unrealistic and unnecessary Star Wars program.And also, simultaneously, various elements thatinfringe on his constitutional responsibilities --unlike an appropriations bill that provides mirrorfunding for programs that have already in many casesbeen authorized in law. Q My understanding of the budget negotiation processwas that they were going to deal with technical,easier to resolve issues first, and then sort ofcenter in on the big core issues. Is that still thecase? Or are they now going to try to deal with --because, I guess Dole said the opposite, we need toget these core issues resolved now, then the rest ofthe stuff will fall into place fairly easily. What's the expectation of the order? MR. MCCURRY: I don't want to dispute the MajorityLeader's interpretation. I mean, there arefundamental core issues that everybody understandsand they are -- there are differences that existthere and that's where the bulk of the hard work willhave to occur -- as when they get to the principalslevel.  In a sense, they are working through these issuesthat we hope the staff has made progress on thattoday. We hope the budget advisors can make furtherprogress to codify some of that work tomorrow. Andthen that will have to be considered by theprincipals because one agreement that they do have,based on their prior conversations, is that none ofthis package can be agreed to until all the elementsare agreed to. But I think what the Majority Leader was suggesting-- look, we've got to resolve these other issues andthe other parts of the puzzle fit into the finalagreement. Q What is this business on good faith? Every timeeither side opens his mouth they start -- if theother would only operate or negotiate in good faith.Is there no good faith at this table? MR. MCCURRY: No, we believe there is. We don't likesome of the things that happened today publicly, butthe President chose to withhold his fire and didn'tanswer back some of these more boisterous remarks. Q He sent you out -- MR. MCCURRY: I've been very temperate. Q Has the President expressed to the White Housestaff his strong and irrevocable preference --everything else being equal -- to go to Hilton Headfor at least New Year's Eve, if he can so do withoutbeing irresponsible in deserting -- endingnegotiations? MR. MCCURRY: No. He said -- you know, he said onbalance he'd like to go and have a party with hisfriends on New Year's Eve. But he'll only do that ifit seems like the right thing to do and it makessense at the time. Q Does he have -- MR. MCCURRY: But he doesn't sound like it'sirrevocable and he has a lust for Hilton Head that isinsatiable and incurable. (Laughter.) I wouldn't besurprised if he goes, I wouldn't be surprised if hedoesn't go. Q Saturday is he clearing the decks to stay here andwork on budget? MR. MCCURRY: He plans to be here on Saturday, at thispoint. He would like -- I mean, his original -- as Itold some of you, his original desire was to try togo down to South Carolina Saturday night. But he'swilling to delay that or cancel that if it'sconducive to getting a budget agreement. Q But does he expect to spend much of Saturdayworking with -- MR. MCCURRY: You know, we have no way of knowing. Idon't -- ask me tomorrow, this time tomorrow nightand we might have a better idea. Q Mike, one last one. When you said that thePresident chose to withhold his fire, that makes itsound like he was at least angry at what Dole andGingrich were saying? MR. MCCURRY: No, he just -- you know, look, they sentwelfare reform down with great fanfare today, but theworld knows where President Clinton is on reformingwelfare. He wants to do it, but he wants to do it theright way. He doesn't want to do it in a way thattakes it out on kids and makes it harder to getpeople back onto work. And everyone knows that thePresident's view of welfare reform, as he clearlystated it to the Congress, does not make it possiblefor him to embrace this type of measure.  So they passed this with great fanfare, as if it wasactually going to mean something. And, you know, theyknow it doesn't. Q Will he continue to exercise this kind ofdiscipline about holding his fire by keeping the pooloutside the doors to cover -- MR. MCCURRY: When he feels it's the appropriate thingto do, yes. If you prefer not to have the picture wecan, you know, cancel that kind of opportunity. Q Well, it was humiliating. MR. MCCURRY: We try to make sure everyone doesn'thave to stay cold. Q If there was this goodwill that you talked about onboth sides, is it really a two or three day processto work this stuff up? MR. MCCURRY: No, no. I mean, he -- let's notmisinterpret what the Majority Leader said. He saidwe could -- he said we could get an outline by two orthree days. No, there -- because of all the work, wehope that some of the work the staff is doing willmake it possible to get a final agreement in a formthat can be passed by Congress quicker. But that's alot of hard work that goes into just doing that.And even if the principals agree to the framework ofa budget, there will be -- take some time to draft afinal measure.Q How long -- what's a more realistic assessment ofhow long it would take? MR. MCCURRY: I've heard Dr. Rivlin say it would take,you know, maybe a week. I don't think anyone has everpinned it down. But our hope is that some of the workthat this -- that, you know, what the staff has beendoing in the last day is looking at exactly thosetypes of questions: What are the policy differencesthat exist in that type of measure. Q I'm sorry, when you say a week, do you mean fromthe time they have an outline we can expect some sortof -- MR. MCCURRY: Yes, that's a rough -- I mean, that'snot -- that was just a rough estimate at one point,and she -- you know, it would depend on thecomplexity of any agreement they reached or -- youknow, getting a -- Q But a week to do what? I didn't quite follow you. MR. MCCURRY: To actually draft the bill that wouldhave to be passed. They just have to be put inlegislative form and -- an outline is not the samething as specs they can write a bill off of. Butthat's apparently what we think the other folks havebeen making some progress on. Q But it's your understanding that once there's aplan in hand that they'll be willing to go ahead anddo a CR, correct? MR. MCCURRY: We -- based on the Speaker's commentstoday, it seemed to me that -- he said that if it wasclear to members of the House that there was anagreement, that he would be able to proceed onunanimous consent to get a CR. You know, our view is that they know that when it'sworking towards this end then they ought to decouplethe question in keeping the government open. Butthat's been our view all along and it's been ignoredby the House of Representatives. Q Do you think their feeling the heat more than youare? MR. MCCURRY: I think everyone is feeling the heatbecause this is an outrageous situation. It's beentwo weeks worth of government services lost toAmericans who need them. I calculated today, thereare 32,000 American families that have got their -- Q Oh, here he goes. MR. MCCURRY: I'll do the whole list for you. Q No, no, no. You can post it. (Laughter.) MR. MCCURRY: But just one example: 32,000 Americanfamilies who went -- you know, the end of this year,looking forward to next year -- in many casesprobably giving up leases on apartments becausethey're moving into their first homes, don't haveanywhere to go because they can't get their FHAmortgages closed. That's not a good situation. Ithink people in this room have probably been upagainst, you know, a mortgage closing before -- andthese people are losing those opportunities. And that's -- you know, that's one more small sliceof life in this shutdown, not to mention all thefederal workers and their families who aren't gettingpaid -- all the contractors now who are losingservices, and they'll never regain -- there's nolegislation pending in Congress that restorescontracts or restores economic livelihood to peoplewho provide services to the government. So it's a bad situation and it's -- you know, onething that the Speaker said today which is manifestlytrue, it was all unnecessary.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

Moreover, certainprovisions would have raised serious constitutionalissues by restricting the President's authority toconduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander inChief."I am anxious to have Congress delete theunacceptable provisions in this bill and to return itto me for my signature," the President said.The bill would have provided for a 2.4 percent payraise for uniformed men and women. In light of hisveto, the President wanted to ensure that uniformedmen and women were not harmed as he worked to resolvedifferences with Congress on the bill. Consequently, he is issuing an Executive Order todaythat provides for a 2 percent pay raise, the mostthat the law allows him to do. He also is sendinglegislation to Congress today to implement a full 2.4percent pay raise, giving the military fullcomparability with civilian pay raises since civilservants benefit from locality pay increases as well.(The legislation also would increase two pay-relatedallowances for uniformed personnel -- one forhousing, the other for food)."I welcome separate action on the pay raise; I wantit to be effective on January 1 and I will sign it assoon as I get it," the President stated. "We arecommitted to giving the troops a full pay raise andwe ought to do so immediately."Unacceptable provisions in the authorization bill arenumerous. Among the most important are therequirement to deploy a costly, unnecessary ballisticmissile defense system in the U.S. by the year 2003,which would put U.S. policy on a collision coursewith the ABM Treaty. Also, the bill would restrictthe President's ability to conduct contingencyoperations and require certifications to Congress ofcommand over such operations that infringe on hisauthority as Commander in Chief.The bill also would unwisely restrict the Nunn-LugarCooperative Threat Reduction programs, directprocurement to specific contractor facilities, forceunwarranted discharge of HIV-positive servicemembers, and restrict the ability of female servicemembers and dependents of military personnel toobtain privately-funded abortions in militaryfacilities overseas. The President did note that the bill containsimportant authorities for military construction,family housing, acquisition reform, and management ofinformation technology which he hoped to see returnin an acceptable bill.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

The resolution also provides funding for severalvitally important programs for children and families.It continues funding for Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC), ensuring that nearly 9million children receive benefits vital to theirwell-being. It funds child care for about 600,000children whose parents are trying to work their wayoff welfare. And it continues funding for State childsupport enforcement agencies to ensure that "deadbeatdads" do not get a reprieve from supporting theirchildren. In addition, H.J. Res. 136 provides authority for theDistrict of Columbia to continue full operations. Theresolution contains an objectionable provision thatwould single out poor women by prohibiting the use ofDistrict funds for providing abortion services. Ihave opposed including this provision in the regularfiscal year 1996 District of Columbia appropriationsbill. Nevertheless, H.J. Res. 136 allows the Districtgovernment to continue to operate without disruption. Although I welcome H.J. Res. 136, it is a poorsubstitute for what the Congress should doimmediately -- that is, send me an acceptablecontinuing resolution to reopen the departments andagencies that are at least partially shut downbecause they lack fiscal year 1996 appropriations.Along with the Departments of Veterans Affairs andHealth and Human Services, they include theDepartments of Education, Labor, Housing and UrbanDevelopment, Commerce, Justice, State, and theInterior; the Environmental Protection Agency; theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, andthe Small Business Administration. To be sure, H.J. Res. 136 prevents the serious impactthat the partial shutdown could have had on 3.3million veterans and their survivors as well asnearly 9 million low-income children. But theshutdown continues to hurt millions of innocentAmericans -- from the 20,000 parents and studentseach day who cannot apply for student aid, to the2,500 moderate-and low-income working families eachday who cannot get their Federal HousingAdministration (FHA) mortgage loans processed. The shutdown also has forced the affected departmentsand agencies to furlough a total of about 280,000Federal employees, throwing their lives intodisruption and raising their fears just as theholidays approach. Federal workers, who are alreadybeing asked to do their jobs more efficiently as wedownsize the Government, deserve better. The congressional majority apparently wants to use apartial Government shutdown to force me intoaccepting their extreme budget plan. It did not worklast month, when the majority prompted an earliershutdown by not sending me an acceptable continuingresolution. And it will not work now. The Congress should send me an acceptable continuingresolution to reopen the Government, return to workthe 280,000 Federal employees who were furloughedthrough no fault of their own, provide back pay forthese workers, and give the American people theservices they expect from their Government.WILLIAM J.

Skim solids prices areprojected to decline as production outstripscommercial use, largely offsetting higher milkfatvalues. Prices will average above a year earlier infirst-quarter 1996 as prices adjust downward from ahigher seasonal peak this fall. But are projected tobe near a year earlier during the second and thirdquarters and are not expected to reach this year'speak in the fall. The support price for manufacturing grade milk willrise 25 cents per cwt to $10.35 effective January 1,1996. The increase was required under currentlegislation because projected 1996 net removals,adjusted for the increase in 1994 imports from the1986-90 average, fell just under the trigger of 3.5billion pounds, milk equivalent, total solids basis.This is the first triggered increase since triggersbecame a common feature of dairy legislation in theearly eighties. Strong export demand for butter was the main reasonthe projected surplus fell below the trigger level.However, the support purchase price for butter cannotlegally be increased. Therefore, the support purchaseprice for nonfat dry milk must increase 3.1 cents to$1.065 per pound. The support purchase price forcheddar cheese will rise 2.5 cents to $1.145 perpound for 40-pound blocks and $1.115 for barrels. The increase in the support price is not expected toaffect average milk prices much, as higher nonfat drymilk prices are not expected to affect cheese pricessignificantly. Milk prices have averaged more than$1.50 per cwt above the support price each year since1992. The early December crash in butter prices probablywas much sharper than needed to move surplus butterinto export markets. Aided by domestic stockbuilding, butter prices already recovered slightlyand are expected to run 20-35 cents per pound belowNovember's peak. Even though milkfat currentlyaccounts for less than one-third of the manufacturingvalue of milk, potential swings in butter pricescould affect cheese prices. Cheese prices are expected to decline graduallythrough early spring but probably will have to remainhigh enough to attract milk away from butter-powderoperations. This will make cheese prices particularlysensitive to butter prices and milk output in cheeseareas. Nonfat dry milk prices rose considerably in November,triggered by seasonally low production and possiblylow user stocks. However, expected expansion in milkproduction in 1996 and smaller allowable Dairy ExportIncentive Program (DEIP) exports will keep powderprices weak during most of the year. Since 1990, retail dairy prices have risen about 1percent annually, less than half the increase in allfood or all consumer items. This year, prices ofmanufactured dairy products rose more than fluid milkprices, largely because of continued relativelysizable increases in prices of frozen desserts andmiscellaneous products. Retail dairy prices areexpected to rise 1-3 percent in 1996, following anincrease of less than 1 percent in 1995. Prices ofproducts containing more milkfat will tend to risefaster than skim-based products. Moderate Beef Expansion ContinuesPreliminary cow slaughter estimates for 1995 stronglysuggest that moderate herd expansion will continue in1996, resulting in higher beef production at leastthrough 1997. In spite of the sharp downturn inlightweight feeder cattle prices this year, cowslaughter as a percent of the January 1, 1995,inventory was only 13.6 percent, up only marginallyfrom 1994 and below the industry liquidation level of15 percent or higher. Both beef cow and heifer slaughter rose 8 percentfrom 1994, indicating a slowdown in the rate ofexpansion is underway. Steer slaughter, on the otherhand, was up less than 1 percent, which is somewhatsurprising given the large number of Mexican feedersteers imported from late 1994 through this pastsummer. Calf slaughter increased nearly 12 percent in 1995,reflecting this year's larger calf crop and thedramatic decline in lightweight feeder cattle prices.Heifer calves may have accounted for a sizableportion of the increased calf slaughter. Beef exports are expected to remain strong in 1996,insulating the domestic market from larger beefsupplies. However, continued high grain prices,particularly if exacerbated by drought, would forcelarger beef supplies on the market and increasedownward price pressure. Higher grain prices and poor winter wheat grazingprospects are putting additional pressure on lighterweight stocker-feeder cattle prices. But favorableforage conditions in most areas and record hayproduction are allowing these cattle to remain onpasture or forage for additional weight gain. Fed cattle prices in December were down about $2 percwt from a year earlier, with 750- to 800-poundfeeder cattle prices down $9 and 500- to 550-poundstocker calves down more than $22. With larger feedercattle supplies carried over into 1996, and a largerexpected calf crop, good planting conditions nextspring and favorable crop development next summerwill be critical if lighter stocker cattle prices areto avoid further declines.  Choice beef supplies remain tight, with retail pricesup 6 cents per pound from a year earlier in November,reflecting the strong hotel-restaurant and exportdemand. All fresh beef prices were up less than 2cents, with prices for most non-Choice cuts used incalculating the composite price down from a yearearlier. Pork Prospects Viewed Favorably Rising grain and protein meal prices over the pastmonth will add about $3 per cwt to the cost ofproducing hogs. Cash breakeven costs when theseanimals are marketed in the spring will approach$43-$45 per cwt, compared with about $40 in December.Each 10-cent-per-bushel increase in corn prices addsabout 40 cents per cwt to the cost of producing hogs. Higher grain prices have not curbed recent optimismin hog futures contracts. In early December, theApril, June, July, and August 1996 hog futurescontract were trading near $50 or above, offeringproducers an opportunity to more than cover recentgrain price increases. Corn prices would have toapproach $5 per bushel for producers to view thecurrent market climate as overly bearish. The premium currently carried on spring futuresassumes pork production is slated to trend lower overthe next 6 months. Using historical price- supplyrelationships, estimated production next spring wouldhave to be held to about 4.175 billion pounds. Thatis 275 million pounds or about 1.5 million head belowcurrent production/slaughter projections. This wouldhave to be accomplished by either reducingSeptember-November 1995 sow farrowings or the averagenumber of pigs saved per litter. Both cases may be argued. Pig survival rates thisfall may have been lower due to heat stress lastsummer. Higher grain prices may have squeezedoperating margins and caused farrowings to fall belowreported intentions for September-November. TheDecember 1 Hogs and Pigs report will be released onDecember 28 and should provide additional insightinto 1996 production. Egg Prices Exceptionally StrongLower egg production in the fourth quarter has led tosharply higher wholesale and retail prices. Wholesaleprices are continuing strong in December. The 2- to3-percent decline in egg production this quartershould have caused prices to rise 10-15 percentrather than 20-25 percent. Seasonal strength duringthe holidays has probably contributed to a strongerthan usual increase in prices as retailers strive toassure supplies will be available. The number of eggs in incubators on November 1 foregg-producing birds was 13 percent higher than a yearago. These birds will be ready to enter the layingflock in April and May, suggesting flocks willcontinue expanding next summer. A return to 1995flock size is expected by spring, with about 1-2percent more eggs expected to be produced in 1996. Egg exports are projected to increase slightly in1996, as egg product exports increase more than thedecline in shell egg exports. Decreases in ExportEnhancement Program funds for shell egg exports aremandated to decline under GATT. Turkey Prices WeakeningLarger cold storage stocks of turkey parts inNovember and slower movement of whole birds duringThanksgiving have contributed to seasonally decliningturkey prices. Prices remain above a year ago, butthe difference has narrowed. December production is projected to decline 2-3percent from a year earlier based on one lessslaughter day. However, weekly production during themonth will be higher due to heavier slaughterweights. Cumulative placements of turkey poults forfirst-quarter 1996 slaughter are fractionally abovelast year. Larger increases in poult placements inearly 1996 will be necessary to reach the forecast4-percent production increase. Broiler Production Forecasts LoweredProduction estimates for early 1996 have been lowered100 million pounds because of the impact of lastsummer's heat stress on the broiler hatchery supplyflock. Production of pullets for placement in theflock appears to have been affected. Also,hatchability of eggs continued to lag behind normallevels into the fall. These factors have limitedpullet placements and are expected to limitproduction increases in early 1996. U.S. poultry exports to Hong Kong are expected to top1 billion pounds in 1995, up over 40 percent from ayear earlier. Hong Kong is the second largest marketfor U.S. poultry products. Most of these exports weretranshipped to China. However, starting in lateNovember, the Chinese government cracked down onpoultry imports from Hong Kong, which had beenexported illegally or undervalued to limit tariffpayments. U.S. poultry exports to China are growing, but areonly forecast at 80 to 90 million pounds in 1995.These products also include broiler parts such aswing tips, feet, and necks, as well as bone-in darkmeat.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

While theZapatista indigenous communities have worked to buildcultural centers to promote the dialogue with thenational and international civil society and tostrengthen the process for peace with dignity andjustice, the Mexican military has mobilized convoysof armaments and soldiers and sought to provoke theZapatistas. The position of the Mexican government is that themobilizations are maneuvers related to the normalrotation of deployed troops. However no one in thearea believes this. For example the CongressionalCommittee set up by Zedillo and Bishop Samuel Ruiz'committee, CONAI, have been carrying out marathonnegotiation sessions with the government regardingits provocations in Chiapas.The United States government is complicit in what ishappening as it has continued to provideunquestioning economic and military support to theZedillo government in much the same way that itsupported former President Carlos Salinas,--Zedillo'spredecessor and mentor, and who has now been linkedwith one of the largest international drug cartels.This unquestioned support for the Zedillo governmentis tantamount to cover-up of serious human rightsabuses, including the lack of any action by the StateDepartment regarding the attack on Cecilia Rodriguez,a US citizen who on October 26th was raped by armedmen in Chiapas as a political act of intimidation. Inlarge part this cover up is to hide the failure ofNAFTA and the resulting profound social and economicupheaval in Mexico. In response to this critical situation, the NationalCommission has organized a U.S. delegation toChiapas.Originally set up to participate in the Zapatista NewYear festivities, the delegation will now also serveas human rights observers to document the Mexicanmilitary's provocations and violations of humanrights laws. The Commission is also preparing aFreedom of Information Request to bring to light theextent and nature of US involvement in thelow-intensity war in Chiapas.Cecilia Rodriguez' New Year MessageCHALLENGE FOR 1996THE CONSTRUCTION OF CENTERS OF RESISTANCE"These buildings being raised represent the work ofmany people. They will be a place for culturalevents, where different communities can share asbrothers, share their customs. A center where all canwalk freely, as true brothers, sharing theirhappiness and their presence. A place which allowsthem to have exchanges of their social life,expressed through a song or a dance.That is why they are important. They sustain a senseof community, brotherhood, unity, resistance. Theyare also a space where the whole world, no mattertheir place of origin can be received as a brother,regardless of whether or not they are indigenous.Honest people who wish to participate in the path ofour people.We have never had a center like this. We did not havethem because each community felt separated, eachfollowed its own path to find the solution to itsproblems. But now, with this new consciousness, theneed to become organized is necessary. We must buildsomething together. It is the truth that before amongour people, we saw each other as enemies, or asstrangers, without relationship to one another. Nowthat barrier has been broken.There has always been a common condition, but thecircumstances of an unjust social system during somany years made our communities feel isolated,destroyed its social base, its values. Now we haverecovered our unity. That is why they come from manyparts, tzotziles, tzeltales, choles and tojolabales,to collaborate in the construction of a space whichwe say is for peace... we do not hide the truth..weare speaking of peace."Comandante DavidClandestine Indigenous Revolutionary Committee EZLNon the construction of the Centers of Resistance,Chiapas, Mexico, 12-27-95by Cecilia RodriguezIt is now the practice of the Zapatista communitiesto come together in gigantic democratic assemblies.To organize themselves into massive human chains of 4to 500 people to travel to a distant place in orderto construct hope. Together they agree to leavebehind their "personal" lives, because they know thathope lies in the organization of each other, and theconcentric organization of others. They areaccustomed to walking patiently for ten or twelvehours to come to a humid, rough-hewn auditorium andthen to sit and listen to one another, withoutinterruption, without self-destructive emotionaloutbursts that sabotage a collective discussion,without posturing and exaggeration. It is theirpractice to wait, and wait and wait until togetherthey can give birth to a good decision, and then itis their practice to work together, to surrendertheir "individuality" so that it is possible to carryout that decision.That is their proposal for a "new democracy", aliving process which has worked well for them forhundreds of years. They are able to carry it outbecause their culture builds and reclaims a set ofcommon values and a shared belief system. This is notan argument for cultural superiority, it is anacknowledgement of the strongest reason for theirsuccess and their continued survival.It is the dusk of the old year, another small step inhumanity's crawl towards the 21st Century. Mostnatural in all of us is to stand still for a momentand reflect on the days that have slipped through ourfingers, on the decisions and plans and thoughts thathave guided our steps. From this examination shouldcome wisdom, skills for the good fight in the daysthat come, inspiration and strength in order toconfront the difficulties of new undertakings.For those of us who have worked together for a peacewith dignity in Mexico each day which has passedsince January of 1994 has been filled withuncertainty, and joy in the midst of simultaneouspain. The hands of the clock have always spun out ofcontrol ticking off events and changes which slippast us like objects in the swollen river of history.We should congratulate one another for our tenacityin denouncing an invisible war in spite of thestudied indifference of the mass media. We have aswell managed a modicum of faith, because while timehas worn away those driven by sheer emotion andromanticism, many of us continue to work in thesimple belief that the work itself will teach usbetter ways of doing things. Sometimes, by the seatof our pants we have managed to gather the financialand human resources necessary in order to fight back,in order to say to the powers-that-be "We are here!We reject your global project! We demand, togetherwith the Zapatistas, the power to decide our owndestiny!"In spite of these accomplishments; we have failedmiserably at the most important and transcendentallesson of the Zapatistas, their sense of community,their willingness to work at one another's and ourside and build a new global project together, theirsovereignty and sense of self and independence in theface of projects they consider deadly to their humannature. Our ability to understand this, to undertakecertain tasks with clarity and patience will be theelements which will determine whether we can moveforward in our struggle for peace with dignity inMexico in 1996.Together, whether we like it or not, we confront thisglobal economic system where financial capital isdominant. It is the portion of the economy mostdependent upon speculation, and corruption, it feedson mergers, and the concentration of power. Itprovokes the elimination of national borders,identities, spheres of production and governmentscreating a global environment where vast financial,industrial and political power can be concentrated inthe hands of a few. It is a profoundly undemocraticeconomic system.Its parasitic state has deteriorated to the pointwhere it can no longer afford, the "benevolentcapitalism" inherent in Keynesian economics. Itregresses, returning to the dramatic contradictionsand extreme vacillations dictated by the forces of amarket "liberated" by technocrats who argue that allthis suffering is "temporary", and that, upon theintegration of certain populations into the marketthe benefits will befall all who can live that long.Civil discontent and social change is anathema tothis economic hallucination, so it invests millionsin sustaining armed forces capable of controlling thekind of discontent inherent in starvation, misery,and extreme poverty. Financial capital has played adominant role for the past 50 years in the world, andits phenomenal impact is manifest in the pillage ofentire continents in the pursuit of a quick profitprocured through short-term investments. We live in aworld where bankers prey on its resources like hordesof locusts. We are mostly overwhelmed by its size andits power.Not so the Zapatistas. As hundreds of indigenouscommunities organize to construct not just one, butmany new Aguascalientes, the government and themilitary watch with extraordinary fear. They fear thecontinuation of this intense dialogue which they havemaintained with the world since they emerged onJanuary 1st of 1994. They fear that this strangedisease called dignity, and the euphoric freedomderived from risking everything in order to findsomething new, will spread.They watch in terror as hundreds of indigenous peopletraipse to and from, machete in hand, lumber on theirshoulders, and smiles on their faces. They pace andwonder as hundreds more prepare food for theothers--they have no inkling of how to explain suchextraordinary movements. Haunted by the spectre oftheir own brutality they accuse them of militarypreparations--how else does one elicit victory, howelse does one win this slow and silent war? Whatcould possibly result from a "dialogue", from such acultural exchange? They await, terrified that theywill be blown up by a corrido, their skulls crushedin by hundreds of people dancing to La Valentina--barracks disguised as cultural centers, unarmedchildren brazenly confronting their tanks andartillery... what a danger to their omnipotence!They parade in their tanks bristling with theirweaponry, faces scrunched beneath their concavehelmets, yelling and waving their guns "we want war,we want war now!" --and the Zapatistas continue tomobilize, to build, to invite people to come andexchange ideas and hopes and proposals for a newnation, and indeed a new world. What the hell is tobe done with them anyway?Follow their example. Take history by the horns andsay "No 70,000 people will die as they did in ElSalvador, no 250,000 as in Bosnia...we will seek thepath of reason until all avenues are exhausted, wewill force the path of reason because there aremillions of us and a few of them, we will disable awar driven by rage and despair." Respond to theircall, strengthen that path of reason by not leavingthem alone. Help them build these cultural centers,these Towers of Babel where we can bow and beam atone another because although we do not share the samelanguage, we share the same dream, and that makes ussilly with happiness.The cultural centers that the Zapatistas are nowbuilding can provide us with the opportunities andexamples we need in order to go about a new path forpeace. Some can claim that pieces of this path werepioneered during the war against Vietnam, and the warin Central America, but just as we learned so did theopposition.We must rise to the challenge of imaginativestrategies. As the first people to rebel against thisglobal project, the Zapatistas have also pioneerednew strategies. That is why together, we must find away to implement them, and allow that experience tonurture effective international strategies. That iswhy these centers of resistance are an importantinvestment in peace and in the future.UPON MY RETURN TO CHIAPASThe success of the strategy of low-intensity warfarehinges on the continued isolation of the EZLN and itsbase communities. It is clear to me that the UnitedStates State department is complicit in thisstrategy, that behind the backs of the Americanpeople, this country participates in the preparationof a war.In a recent story in the National Catholic Reporteran anonymous source in the State Departmentsupposedly stated that they had offered to accompanyme to file a police report with the appropriateMexican authorities but that "I had refused". It mustbe public knowledge that there has been no suchoffer, there has been no communication of any naturebetween myself and the State Department in regards tothe rape I was subjected to on October 26th of 1995.It should also be public knowledge that ToddRobberson of the Washington Post interviewed me underthe guise of publishing a full report on thephenomenon of rape in Chiapas a few weeks after myreturn. In spite of his continual assurance that areport would soon appear none has ever materialized.The latest information is that Robberson's post onthe Mexico City desk has apparently ended.The advice of books and therapists tells me that afull year is required to recover from this kind oftrauma. It has always been my theory that the StateDepartment would like for Mexico to appear serene andunder control until after the next administration isput into office. Neither party can afford anotherBosnia-like disaster on their hands. I wish it werepossible to afford a full year of recovery. I wish Icould pretend that I am separate and better thanthose thousands of indigenous women who labor underthe cruelest of conditions, who hope and dream asfervently as I do for my own children, who suffer thecontinual sexual harassment of military checkpoints,and the humiliation of body searches.I wish I could turn my head in indifference uponlearning that the Border Patrol now constructs"holding pens" in preparation for what they assume tobe "hordes from Mexico" escaping the chaos which theU.S. Treasury Department itself has created. I wishpretend the Border Patrol does not chase our peopledown the street as though they were animals. I wish Iwere unable to feel the deep sense of shame thatcomes when I listen to the level of corruption andthe cynicism which reigns in the party-state systemof Mexico.If there is nothing else I can do with what is leftof me, I can say to this stupidity that rules bothour countries "You have not won. You may usepsychological terror, rape, torture, death, and mediamanipulation but your time is limited. Your reign iscoming to an end, its end is inevitable, because itis illogical, unproductive, contradictary to natureand to humanity. We have also learned aboutlow-intensity warfare, and reached deep into oursouls to find the spirit of those who have lived onthis earth for thousands of years, to find that humanspirit that hungers for progress and for freedom,that values human dignity above possessions.CONTACT: Adriana Manjarrez, SpokespersonTel: +1 310 927-4707e-mail: ar919@lafn.orgNational Commission for Democracy in MexicoTel: +1 915 532-8382e-mail: moonlight@igc.apc.orgM2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

This was slightly above December 1994 but 1percent below the September 1, 1995, inventory. Thisis the highest December inventory since 1980.Breeding inventory, at 7.13 million head, was up 1percent from both December 1, 1994 and September 1,1995. Market hog inventory, at 53.1 million head wasslightly above last year but 2 percent below lastquarter.*****Beginning March 1996 the line up of the quarterlyestimating states will include Arkansas and Oklahomabut will exclude Tennessee. The report will containan estimate for the each of the quarterly states, the17 state region, the 33 annual state region, and theU.S. total. Mt An 4 (12-95) The September-November1995 U.S. pig crop at 24.9 million head was 2 percentmore than 1994 and 4 percent more than 1993. Sowsfarrowing during this period totaled 2.99 millionhead, only 9,000 head below last year. Litter rateincreases continue at a record level, with an averageof 8.34 pigs saved per litter for theSeptember-November period.Last year the litter rate averaged 8.18 pigs perlitter. Hot weather late last summer did notsignificantly reduce farrowings or litter rates. Thisis largely due to increased production by largeroperations with environmentally controlled facilitieswhich minimize the affects of adverse weather. Inaddition, market hog prices, relative to corn prices,provided little incentive for herd reduction. Pigssaved per litter by size of operation ranged from7.45 for operations with 1-99 hogs to 8.64 foroperations with more than 2,000 hogs and pigs.U.S. hog producers intend to have 2.92 million sowsfarrow during the December 1995-February 1996quarter, 1 percent more than the actual farrowingsduring the same period last year and 1994. Intendedfarrowings for March-May 1996, at 3.31 million sowsare 2 percent above 1995 but 2 percent below the 1994period. The December-May intentions utilize 87.4percent of the breeding herd, compared to 87.0 foractual farrowings last year and the 5 year average of86.7 percent. The number of operations with hogstotaled 182,700 during 1995, down 12 percent fromlast year and 19 percent below 1993. Places with2,000 or more hogs on hand accounted for 3 percent ofthe operations and 43 percent of the inventory. Ayear ago 2 percent of the operations had inventoriesover 2,000 head and accounted for 37 percent of theinventory.Considering all hog operations, currently 6 percentcontrol 60 percent of the total inventory. RevisionsAll inventory and pig crop estimates for 1994 and1995 were reviewed using final pig crop, officialslaughter, import, and export data in U.S. levelbalance sheets. Based on the findings of this review,no revisions were made to the inventories for Juneand September 1995 along with the 1995 March-May pigcrop.

EST THE PRESIDENT: I want to be brief today because we'regetting off to a little late start. We've got a lotto do. I have three things to say. I think we made agood start yesterday, we're making progress, and Ibelieve we need to open the government. I hope we canagree to do all that. Q Sir, do you know any more information on thesoldier who was wounded in Bosnia? THE PRESIDENT: Our reports are sketchy and I havetried to get an update, but what I do know is thatthere were apparently two vehicles and four soldiersinvolved. Only one was seriously hurt and he has beenmedivacked to Croatia in a hospital there, and weunderstand he's in stable condition. But mines have always been our biggest concern andwe're working very hard on it, but that's whathappened. And we'll continue to monitor it and do thebest we can. The mission itself is going very well.The people have received our soldiers very well andI'm very well satisfied with the progress. And I'mobviously very sorry this happened, but they'remaking good progress on the mine problem, but it'sgoing to be difficult to get rid of them all. Q -- the measure to get the workers back that's goingto get through Congress? SENATOR DOLE: Well, it passed the House. We hope wecan pass in the Senate today, so make some progress.  SENATOR DASCHLE: We tried to pass a clean CR, onewithout any conditions. And that was objected to, butI hope we can work something out. Q But isn't the fact now that the Democrats areholding things up? SENATOR DASCHLE: Not at all. As a matter of fact, asI said, we passed a continuing resolution -- we hadno conditions. It sent people back to work, and thatwas objected to. So we're not trying to hold anythingup here. We hope we can get some sort of an agreementas early as today. Q Well, what's it going to take to get a deal? SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just something. Ithink the President had a right -- we're glad to haveyou all in. We have a lot of work to do. We made, Ithought, real progress last night. It is not easy. Wehave very significant areas we have to work on, but Ithought the spirit was very positive. We don't justwant to get the federal workers back, we want to getthem paid. And in order to do that, I think we've gotto get this whole thing worked out. But I thought wehad a great start last night. And with you all'spermission, I think we can get a lot more done in thenext few hours. Q Mr. President, is the message from the Democratsbasically that they don't trust you? THE PRESIDENT: We've got to go to work. Thank youvery much.  THE PRESS: Thank you.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

ESTTHE PRESIDENT: I want to welcome the congressionalleaders back here after Christmas. We're going tohave, I think, a good meeting today, based on thework that has already been done this morning. Iexpect us to make further progress. We will begin to deal with some of the difficultissues today involving how we can balance the budgetand protect things like Medicare and Medicaid andeducation and the environment, which I think are veryimportant. I believe we're proceeding in good faithand I think we're making progress. I do believe that we ought to move to reopen thegovernment. As you know, I feel very strongly aboutthat. The public services will begin to besignificantly curtailed. And, of course, I'mconcerned about the federal employees -- those thataren't working who want to work, who are going to getpaid regardless, and those who are working whohaven't gotten paid who are going to run into somevery serious financial problems with their mortgagesand other things soon. So I hope we can get someagreement to reopen the government so that theseproblems can be averted. Q Is there some room for compromise now that you'vehad a little bit of time to think it over over theholidays? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're -- I've gotten apreliminary report. I think we'll have some moreprogress this afternoon and then I expect we'll workall day tomorrow. I'm prepared to spend whatever timeit takes to move as quickly as we can move. But someof these issues are quite complicated in terms oftheir impact on the American people. But I'm ready togo and I think that all of us are. Q Mr. Speaker, do you see any way of having anagreement that can reopen the government without the-- SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll discuss it this afternoon.And I think that Senator Dole and Congressman Armeyand I have been trying to work out a way to both getthe currently nonessential employees deemedessential, which Senator Dole began to work on lastweek after our meeting here, and also to find a wayto possibly get everyone paid. We feel strongly thatfederal employees ought to be back -- all the federalemployees ought to be at work. We know they want tobe, and it's not fair to them. And we also feelstrongly we ought to try to find some way to geteveryone paid. We also have an obligation under thecontinuing resolution that was adopted about sixweeks ago to get a balanced budget by next Wednesdaymorning, at the latest, at the end of the firstsession of Congress. So I agree with the President. I think there arereasons to be cautiously optimistic. I wouldn'texaggerate them, but I think we've made some progressover the last few days, and I would hope in the nexttwo or three days we could basically get this doneand then have everything up and running and everyonepaid for while the staff work was finished out on theactual technical details. Q Let me clarify, though, sir -- is there any way toget the people back to work without resolving abalanced budget plan? SPEAKER GINGRICH: There might be a way -- yes. SENATOR DOLE: Yes. SPEAKER GINGRICH: We're going to explore today someways to get that done by unanimous consent over thenext two days. But I think it takes working it outtogether, and we haven't done that yet. SENATOR DOLE: Just let me add that we're sending --we're in recess now in the Senate, subject to call ofthe chair, and I hope to be able to give SenatorDaschle some language to look at this afternoon. AndI want to congratulate Congressman Armey for hisleadership on the House side with the Speaker,because if we can work this out it could be done yettoday. Q And have people back to work? SENATOR DOLE: Well, it would go down to the Presidentas quickly as we could. It's a Middle East peacefacilitation act. It's the same language we passedlast Friday in the Senate deeming people essential.And the third element of the package would beexpedited procedure, if we get an agreement, so wecan get it through the Senate in less than 60 days, Iguess. We just take the budget reconciliationlanguage and shorten the time and put that in theresolution. SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll try to get that down here bysometime this evening if we can get it all workedout. It's all got to be done -- our system iscomplicated even at best, and it takes a littlewhile, but we hope to get it worked out today. Q President Clinton, what's your reaction to that,sir? THE PRESIDENT: I think the people ought to go back towork and I think they ought to be paid. And I thinkif we don't do it we're going to see some veryserious consequences that should not -- that neitherthe public, nor the public employee should have toendure. And I think we need to keep working at thisuntil we get an agreement. I'm prepared to work untilwe get an agreement. We've just got to keep workingthrough it. But these are complex issues. To protect Medicare andMedicaid, education and the environment, the thingsthat are at the core of the resolution we adopted,and get the budget balanced in seven years is noteasy to do. We're going to have to work at it. Q -- the Republicans rejected last time? You thoughtyou had an agreement on something like this and theHouse Republicans rejected it? Q Why did you change your position, Mr. Gingrich? THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. Let's don't ask anymore questions like that. We're trying to work thisout and I think -- give us a chance to meet today andgive them a chance to do their work; let's see whathappens.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

EST THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Tomorrow is New Year'sEve, a time for celebration, friendship and hope.Nineteen ninety-five has been a good year for ourcountry, and the coming year can be even better. In Washington, we all know this has been a year ofserious differences and profound debate over ournation's future direction. But if we remain true toour values, we will prove once again that in Americawe can have serious differences without leaving deepdivisions. We know our nation is strongest when we'retrue to our fundamental values, giving every Americanthe opportunity to make the most of their lives,remembering the duty we owe to our parents and ourchildren, preserving our families and ourcommunities, keeping America the strongest force ofpeace and freedom in the world. In our effort to advance these values, 1995 has beena time of real progress and concrete achievement. Thekey to our strength is economic opportunity for everyAmerican. In 1995, the ingenuity and hard work of ourpeople has kept the economy growing, steady andstrong. In the past 12 months the economy created1.75 million new private sector jobs. In every monththe unemployment rate has been below six percent. Alltold, since 1993, we Americans have created nearlyeight million new jobs. The stock market has brokenevery record. The deficit dropped for the third yearin a row, for the first time since Mr. Truman wasPresident. Long-term interest rates continue to fall,bringing lower mortgage payments for working familiesand more affordable credit for small businesses andconsumers. A growing economy and lower interest rates are why amillion new Americans became homeowners for the veryfirst time in 1995. There were more new businessesincorporated this year than in any previous year. Andhere in Washington, in spite of all of ourdifferences, we made some real progress on animportant issue -- political reform. At long last,Congress passed a law which applies to themselves thesame laws they oppose in the private sector. And atlong last, after three years of effort, the Congresspassed lobby reform legislation, banning gifts tocongressmen and requiring extensive disclosure aboutthe activities of lobbyists. Most important, our communities all over America arecoming together around our values again. In cityafter city, in state after state, violent crime isdown; the welfare and food stamp rolls are down; thepoverty rate is down; even the divorce rate is down.And for two years in a row now, the teen pregnancyrate has dropped. It hasn't always been an easy year for America. Therehave been moments that tested our national community.In the wake of the terrible bombing in Oklahoma City,which took the lives of 169 people, our nationreached out and recognized the bonds that hold ustogether. Out of the ashes of that tragedy a newsense of national spirit took hold. We affirmed onceagain that all Americans are in it together. Werecognized once again that we can't love our countryand hate our government. And a strong America has been the world's strongestforce for freedom, peace and democracy in 1995. Ourbrave men and women today are in the snows of Bosnia,helping to uphold the peace agreement to end theworst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. Andfrom the cobblestone streets of Northern Ireland tothe sands of the Middle East, a strong America hashelped to bring peace to regions long torn by strife. Yes, 1995 has been a good year for America. Ourpeople have accomplished a lot. And it goes withoutsaying, we still have one major task to finish to topoff the accomplishment of this year. We have tofinish the job of balancing the budget and to do itin the right way. As you know, for the last two weeks the Congress hasrefused to pass legislation that would keep thefederal government open to serve the American people.This has never happened before for this length oftime in the whole history of the republic. And it'sbeen very hard on three-quarter of a million publicservants who have to pay rent and utilities andmortgage payments and buy food. And they're losingpay at holiday time. And it's also cut off servicesfor millions of Americans who depend upon them. This Tuesday, if the government is not open, clean-upefforts will be stopped cold at 32 toxic waste sitesin neighborhoods around our country. Next week,federal funds for unemployment insurance will beginto run out, forcing states to scramble to find waysto keep helping workers who have lost their jobs. Andthe Meals On Wheels program to our senior citizenswon't go forward. Every day, nine of 10 work placesafety complaints go unanswered. And every day 2,500people can't get guaranteed home mortgages. Everyday, thousands of young people looking for collegeloans can't apply for them. If ever we needed areminder that our government is not our enemy, thisis it. Let me be clear: I am committed to balancing thebudget. Our administration already has cut thedeficit nearly in half, and I am determined to finishthe job. For weeks I've been working in good faithwith Republicans and Democrats in Congress to findcommon ground, to balance the budget in a way thatreflects our values. Yesterday I met well into theevening with Speaker Gingrich and Majority LeaderDole. And in just a few moments I will sit down withthem again, along with the Democratic congressionalleaders. We are making real progress. We know that our work isnot done. We know we have much to do, so that theAmerican Dream will remain alive for every citizen,and so that we can come together as a people, and sothat America can remain the strongest force for peacethe world has ever seen. So on this New Year's, let's resolve that we willbalance the budget, but that we'll do it in a waythat will keep our country growing and that will betrue to our basic values. That is, we'll balance thebudget without gutting Medicare and Medicaid, withoutdeeply cutting education or the environment, withoutraising taxes on working families. Let's resolve toreopen the government and do it now. And let'sresolve to act without rancor or partisan bitternessin the spirit of the new year and in the interests ofthe American people. Nineteen ninety-five has been a year when we've beentrue to the best of America. If we'll just work hardand work together and follow our values, 1996 can beeven better. Hillary and I want to wish you and yourfamilies a happy and health New Year. Thank you forlistening.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

With me today are the families of seven Americansserving in and around Bosnia: Lieutenant Colonel BobNorman of the 621st Air Mobility Control Squadron inTuzla; Command Master Chief Jim Sirles on the USSAmerica in the Adriatic; Sergeant William LeBright ofthe 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit on board the USSWhidbey Island; Warrant Officer Willie Wade with the586th Assault Bridge Company; Lieutenant ColonelO'Malley Smith of the 353rd Civil Affairs Group;Sergeant Mark Ackerman with the 114th Public AffairsDetachment; and Linda Carsey, an Army CivilianContract Specialist on her way to Tuzla. These families here remind us all of the Americanswe're sending to Bosnia. They're leaving theirfamilies behind. And many of them are already farfrom their loved ones this Christmas Eve. I want toextend a special greeting to those families today. Iknow that when we call on our troops to protectAmerica's interests and values, we also call on theirfamilies. Their families' special sacrifice may notmake the headlines, but we could not be successfulwithout it, for as our troops stand up on America'sbehalf, it is their families who stand behind them,who keep them strong with confidence, support andlove. These thoughts are especially close in our minds thistime of year. As Americans come together in thisseason of peace, we know that you, the men and womenof Operation Joint Endeavor, are serving on a missionof peace, the noblest mission of all. The pride yourfamilies have in each of you is shared by all yourfellow Americans all across our nation.  Ten days ago in Paris, the presidents of Bosnia,Croatia and Serbia signed an agreement that turnstheir troubled region from war to peace. Our nationhas an important interest in seeing that peace takehold for the people of Bosnia, who have suffered somuch for so long; for the stability of Europe, whichis so crucial to our own stability; and for thesafer, stronger world we want to leave for ourchildren. There is too much at stake in Bosnia today for ournation to sit on the sidelines, and that's why we'veturned to you, our men and women in uniform. Youprovide us with the power to meet threats to oursecurity. You have the strength to bring hope andstability to people exhausted by war. We know, andthe people of Bosnia know, that you will get the jobdone and that you will do it right. Each side there wants NATO to help them safeguard thepeace they have agreed to make, and to help them liveup to their commitments to one another. They trustyou to create a secure environment so they can seizethis chance to rebuild their lives and their land.They see in you how much can be achieved when peoplefind strength in their diversity. That is the powerof America's example. I know this will be a demanding mission, but I know,too, that you are up to the task. General Joulwan andGeneral Nash have assured me of that. And I have seenit for myself. Earlier this month, I visited with the men and womenof Task Force Eagle in Germany. I saw in them thequalities that all of you share, the qualities thathave earned our nation the respect and trust of theentire world. Your training, equipment andpreparation are unequalled. Your reputation precedesyou. The most advanced technology protects you. Butjust as important, you are strong in your character.Time and again, without pause or complaint, you stepforward to serve our nation.  In this new era of challenge and change, America'sobligation to lead for peace and human dignity hasremained as important as ever. In Bosnia, you, themen and women of our Armed Forces, will bear thatcharge with great honor. You will make the differencebetween horror and hope, between a war that resumesand a peace that take hold.  I am proud to be your Commander in Chief and to thankyou on behalf of your nation. Your mission of peaceand goodwill in Bosnia reminds us all what thisseason is all about for all people everywhere. Tomorrow, on Christmas Day, and as long as you arethere, Hillary and I will have you in our thoughtsand prayers. May God bless and protect you and yourfamilies and bring you success and a very safereturn. And may God bless America, the nation you doso much to serve.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. As you know, I havespent the last week in intense discussion withcongressional leaders over how to balance the budgetin seven years. It's important to balance the budgetto lift the burden of debt from future generations. In the last three years, we've cut our deficit inhalf, and we need to finish the job. But we have tobalance the budget in a way that reflects our mostfundamental values: increasing opportunity; askingeveryone to assume responsibility; strengthening ourfamilies and the economy; and recognizing the duty weowe to each other -- to our parents, our children,and those who need and deserve our help. That's howwe've reduced the deficit since I took office --cutting unnecessary programs, reducing the size ofthe federal government by 200,000, reducing red tape,but investing in education, the environment, researchand technology, protecting Medicare and Medicaid,reducing taxes on the hardest-pressed workingfamilies. It's worked. It's given us more jobs, morenew businesses, low inflation, and record economicperformance in the stock market and in many otherplaces.  Now, that's how I want to finish the job of balancingthe budget. But even as we continue talking, I hopeCongress will agree to open the government and openall the agencies that have closed so that we can endthe financial and emotional turmoil for more than280,000 furloughed federal employees and 460,000working but not getting paid federal employees. In the spirit of the holidays, we should doeverything we can to put these people back to workand to resume critical services the American peopleneed and deserve. Just last night, I signedlegislation that Congress passed yesterday to allow3.3 million veterans and 13 million needy childrenand their mothers to receive their benefits byJanuary 1st. That's a good start. I hope we canresume all services as we work together to balancethe budget. Our talks are making progress. Yesterday we agreed toresume our negotiations next week with the goal ofreaching an agreement as soon as possible. I amconfident we can end this impasse and pass aseven-year balanced budget. As we look back at this year, in this season of hope,I think we ought to take just a little time toreflect on the progress and accomplishment ofAmerica. It should give us real optimism that we canfinish this budget job and go on to greater things in1996. Nineteen ninety-five was a year in which our countryhad the opportunity and the responsibility to playour role as the world's premier peacemaker. Ourefforts opened the door to peace in places where onlyrancor and war had previously existed. As apeacemaker, not a policeman, we have helped the peaceprocess finally begin to take hold in the MiddleEast, while we joined the world in mourning thetragic assassination of Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin. We have done what Prime Minister Rabinwould have wanted us to do -- we've kept movingforward. And finally, it looks like Israel and Syria will sittogether in the United States to seek a way toresolve their differences and live togetherpeacefully. We're also helping to bring peace toBosnia. The Dayton agreement and our decision to joinin the international effort to secure the peace inBosnia has given the people of the former Yugoslaviaa chance to rebuild their lives. After four longyears of horrible violence, America now has theopportunity to lead in the effort to bring lastingpeace to that war-torn country and to stabilizeCentral Europe as well. In Northern Ireland, I saw thousands and thousands ofchildren beginning to celebrate their secondChristmas season of peace. And in Haiti, they willsoon celebrate the very first peaceful transfer ofpower from one democratically-elected president toanother in the history of the country. And Americanleadership helped to make both those celebrationspossible. The seeds of peace are also sinking deeper rootsright here in America. We just learned that last yearour murder rate dropped 12 percent, the largestdecline in 35 years. Violent crime overall is downfive percent. Now, we know our work is far from doneon too many of our mean streets -- too many of ourchildren still are raising themselves, not beingtaught right from wrong. There is still too muchcrime and violence, and it's still rising amongteenagers in many parts of the country. But we arebeginning to turn the tide. And we do know whatworks. Much of the success is due to efforts in communitiesthroughout our country to get guns off our streetsand put more police on the streets, and to give ouryoung people something to say yes to as well assomething to say no to. More importantly it is due tothe outpouring of grass-roots community involvementin all these efforts in the comprehensive fightagainst crime and violence. People are getting the message that communitypolicing works. And it's up to every citizen to riseup, reach out and link arms with local police to keeptheir own neighborhoods safe and their schools safe.Now, the progress we've seen is cause for hope. Wejust have to keep working on it here at home. From the Middle East to Northern Ireland, to ourtroops in Bosnia, to our toughest neighborhoods,America is leading the way to peace andreconciliation. All around the world billions ofpeople look to America as a model of democracy andfreedom. And we should see ourselves as others seeus. We should finish the job of balancing the budgetand reopening the government in the spirit ofcooperation and unity so that we can continue to growand prosper together and be a force in the world forpeace and freedom. That is the spirit of the seasonand the spirit of America. Let each of us resolve to do what we can to bepeacemakers. Let us bring peace to every child whodeserves to be free from violence and full of hope.And as we celebrate the birth of a child whose onlyshelter was the straw of a manger, let us rememberthe words of the Prince of Peace who said, "Blessedare the peacemakers." We ask the blessings of thispeace for everyone. That is our prayer thisChristmas. Thanks for listening.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

DATASUPPLIED BY NAMED PARTY/PARTIES.Back to Headline List CopyrightM2 PRESSWIRE via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners-- Situation and outlookM2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OFAGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners -- Situation andoutlook(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDRDATE:221295SummaryWorld sugar production and consumption for 1995/96are forecast at record levels of 117.9 and 116.6million metric tons, respectively. The impliedsurplus of 1.3 million tons for 1995/96, togetherwith a somewhat smaller surplus estimated for1994/95, allows a modest rebuilding of global stocksand puts downward pressure on world prices. Thesurplus in 1994/95 followed 2 years of sugardeficits. Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation andOutlook report, world sugar production andconsumption were revised downward by 380,000 and450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downwardadjustment in global production reflects reducedproduction prospects for the United States, India,Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offsetthe improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, andThailand. Also, downward revisions in key consumingcountries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, morethan offset increased consumption prospects by otherleading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand. With world stocks and the stocks-to-consumption ratioexpected to rise, world prices could face downwardpressure. The spot price in late 1995 is more than 2cents a pound below a year ago. Prices averaged 11.94cents a pound (Contract No. 11, spot basis) inOctober, 11.96 cents in November, and 12.39 cents forthe first 11 market days of December (throughDecember 15). Brazil's sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated ata record 13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from lastseason because more cane is being used for sugar andless for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugarproduction, driven by the demand for exports,occurred in the Center-South region. Sugar productionin the Northeast is forecast unchanged from lastseason. Many processing facilities that had producedonly alcohol have been converted to regular sugarmills with annexed distilleries for fuel alcoholproduction. Brazil now has 370 processing facilitiesto produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce onlyfuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.Brazil's sugar consumption is forecast at 8.1 milliontons, the highest in Latin America and the fifthhighest in the world behind only India, the EuropeanUnion (EU), the United States and China. Brazil's rawand refined sugar exports are forecast at a record4.8 million tons, the world's largest. U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million shorttons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the recordoutturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeetproduction is expected to total 28.9 million tons, adecrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,at 1.42 million acres, is 1.2 percent below lastyear. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons peracre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet springgot the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start andlowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problemsin Michigan and late season harvest problems in partsof the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, havecaused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast fromthe September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 milliontons, raw value, 393,000 tons less than the record1994/95 crop. The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partiallyoffset by an increase in the forecast for cane sugarproduction to 3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons fromearlier forecasts due to the improved outlook forsugarcane yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despitethese upward revisions, the overall outlook for canesugar is expected to be down slightly from 1994/95,reflecting a further contraction in the Hawaiiansugar industry. The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchangedat 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tonsor about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand growthappears to be running only slightly ahead ofpopulation growth, compared with the 1.6 percentgrowth rate of recent years. Reduced demand growth isattributed to encroachment of high fructose cornsyrup (HFCS) into traditional sugar markets andweaker demand for confectionery and bakeryproducts--major industrial users of sugar. Sugar useexpanded an average of 164,000 tons per year over thelast decade (fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), following themajor contraction in sugar use in the early 1980'sdue to the substitution of HFCS for sugar in softdrinks. Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,the Secretary of Agriculture, on November 9,increased the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ)for raw cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000metric tons). This action raised the TRQ to 1.56million short tons, and total supply (carryin stocks,production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,comparable with the 11.1 million forecast inSeptember.  U.S. raw cane sugar prices averaged 23.21 cents apound in September and 22.67 cents in October(Contract No. 14, nearby futures), more than 1 centabove the level for the same months in 1994. Sincethe quota increase, prices have remained firm,averaging 22.60 cents a pound for November and 22.64cents for the first 11 market days of December. Asindicated in USDA's press release of November 9announcing the quota change, USDA will continuemonitoring import requirements and will adjust theTRQ accordingly. Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach11.2 million tons in fiscal year 1995/96 of whichU.S. production is expected to supply 98 percent. TheUnited States supplements domestically produced cornsweetener supplies with imports, mainly from Canada.USDA forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons,up 3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecastfor HFCS is based on projections of deliveries fromdomestic production and imports. Using a U.S.population of 269.2 million (including Puerto Rico),domestic HFCS use is forecast at 59.3 pounds infiscal 1995/96, up from 57.7 pounds for last year,and 45.2 pounds a decade ago. Per capita sugarconsumption is forecast somewhat higher at 64.6pounds, refined basis.HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis, respectively,for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For theJune through September period, prices for HFCS-55averaged 18.51 cents a pound, and HFCS-42 pricesaveraged 16.62 cents. In the past, prices moved upsharply during the summer due to the high demand forHFCS from the beverage sector which pushed processingcapacity to the limit. However, this past summer,while demand was strong due to unusually hot summertemperatures in many parts of the country, prices didnot move up. This reflects added corn sweetenerprocessing capacity--as much as 25 percent accordingto some estimates--that has come on line in the lastyear. With the very sharp downturn in this season'scorn crop, higher HFCS prices have increased. HFCS-55prices averaged 19.68 cents a pound in October, and20.84 cents in November and for the first 2 weeks ofDecember. For fiscal 1994/95, wholesale HFCS-55averaged 18.81 cents a pound compared with 25.26cents for refined beet sugar. The 6.45 cent pricespread between HFCS and refined beet sugar for1994/95 contrasts to the 2.73 cents the year before.For fiscal 1995/96, it is likely that the pricespread between HFCS-55 and sugar will narrowsomewhat.  World SugarOverviewWorld sugar production and consumption for 1995/96are forecast at 117.9 and 116.6 million metric tons,respectively. 1/, 2/ The implied surplus of 1.3million tons for 1995/96, together with a somewhatsmaller surplus estimated for 1994/95, allows amodest rebuilding of global stocks. The surplus in1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar deficits (figure1). With world stocks expected to be higher coupledwith a higher stocks-to-consumption ratio, worldprices could face downward pressure. Current spotprices are 12.4 cents a pound, more than 2 centsbelow a year ago.  Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation andOutlook report, world sugar production andconsumption were revised downward by 380,000 and450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downwardadjustment in global production reflects reducedproduction prospects for the United States, India,Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offsetthe improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, andThailand. Also, downward revisions in key consumingcountries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, morethan offset increased consumption prospects by otherleading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand. ProductionWorld Record Production Forecast  The 1995/96 estimate of world sugar production is arecord 117.9 million tons, raw value, 2 percent abovethe revised 1994/95 outturn of 115.6 million, and 1percent above the previous record of 116.4 millionset in 1991/92. This production forecast is less thanmany other analysts are forecasting because USDAexpects India's output to decline. Sugar producedfrom sugarcane is estimated at a record 81.5 milliontons, up marginally from a year ago. Sugar processedfrom sugarbeets is estimated at 36.4 million tons, up5 percent from last season. Over the past decade cane, sugar production has beentrending up. The expansion from an average of 66.4million tons annually during the second half of the1980's, to more than 80 million tons the last 2years, is largely attributed to growth in harvestedarea. In contrast, yields and recovery rates havebeen fairly steady at around 60 to 61 tons perhectare and 10 percent, respectively. For 1995/96,USDA estimates that a record 12.8 million hectares ofsugarcane for sugar will be harvested around theglobe compared with 10.9 million in the late 1980's(figure 2). Among the major producing countriescontributing to the global expansion have beenAustralia, Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Thailand. Beet sugar area, in contrast, has generally declinedto a decade low of 7.7 million hectares in 1995/96,compared with 8.6 million in the second half of the1980's. The downturn was largely in the RussianFederation and Ukraine. Higher recovery ratesreflecting improved seeds, heightened use ofproduction inputs, and greater factory efficienciessomewhat offset the area decline. Production Prospects in Selected Countries:Mexico--Sugar production during 1995/96 is forecastat 4.3 million tons, down 7 percent from lastseason's record output of 4.6 million. The decreaseprimarily reflects the return to a more normal caneyield of 72.5 tons per hectare, following lastseason's unusually high yield of 78.4 tons perhectare. Brazil--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last seasonbecause more cane is being used for sugar and lessfor fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar production,driven by the demand for exports, occurred in theCenter-South region. Sugar production in theNortheast is forecast unchanged from last season.Many processing facilities that had produced onlyalcohol have been converted to regular sugar millswith annexed distilleries for fuel alcoholproduction. Brazil has 370 processing facilities toproduce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce onlyfuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol. Cuba--The 1995/96 estimate pegs sugar output at 4.0million tons, up 21 percent from last season's 50year low of 3.3 million. The turnaround is due to theincreased availability of inputs, such as fuel,fertilizers, chemicals, and replacement parts formachinery. The inputs were financed by foreign loans,secured by the anticipated increase in sugar output. European Union (EU)--Sugar production during the1995/96 season is estimated up 3 percent from lastyear, to 17.0 million tons, because of a 2-percentincrease in harvested area and improved yields. InFrance, sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up5 percent, to 4.6 million tons, accounting for 27percent of the EU total. The increase is due to a5-percent increase in harvested area. For the secondconsecutive year, France suffered through a hot, drysummer which hit the sugarbeet growing areasparticularly hard. This limited beet growth andresulted in a smaller-than-average beet weight.However, because planting conditions were nearlyideal, a record number of beets were sown perhectare. In Germany, the EU's second largestproducer, sugar production during 1995/96 isestimated at 4.2 million tons, 5 percent above lastyear. The upturn reflects a 3-percent increase inharvested area and a 5-percent increase in theaverage beet yield. Although the hot summer weatherthroughout the EU did not cause major damage to thebulk of the beet crop, beets grown in the sandy-soilregions of northern and eastern Germany wereadversely affected by the heat. Rains during thelatter part of August helped to offset part of themoisture deficit. Russia--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at1.9 million tons, 15 percent above 1994/95. Sugarbeetproduction for 1995/96 is forecast at 19.0 milliontons, up 36 percent from a year ago. The increase insugarbeet production is due to a 38-percent increasein beet yield per hectare compared with 1994/95,which returns Russia's average beet yield to a morenormal level. Ukraine--Sugar production for 1995/96 increased fromlast season's drought-reduced crop, but remains wellbelow pre-independence levels because of a shortageof farm equipment, low availability and high pricefor farm chemicals, and poor maintainence ofsugarbeet factories. China--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up 8percent, to 6.5 million tons, because of asignificant expansion in sugarbeet and sugarcanearea. In Guangxi, the province in China that producesthe largest volume of sugarcane, the area planted tosugarcane increased 53,400 hectares; in Yunnan,another major producing province, planted area is up15,400 hectares. In total, the area harvested forsugarcane is estimated up 8 percent from last season,and sugar from cane is estimated up 6 percent to 5.3million tons. China's 1995/96 sugar production frombeets is estimated up 20 percent from last year to1.2 million tons. Harvested beet area is forecast up16 percent over last year, to 672,000 hectares. Theincrease in sugarbeet area is taking place primarilyin Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Provinces. With a perhectare yield 4 times higher than that ofHeilongjiang Province, Xinjiang is expected toreplace Heilongjiang as the largest producer ofsugarbeets this year. India--Sugar output is forecast to decrease in1995/96 to 15.2 million tons, down 7 percent from therecord 1994/95 sugar crop of 16.3 million tons. Amonth delay in the onset of the 1995 monsoon seasonin many areas, combined with variable rainfall in keygrowing states will likely lower cane yields. Also,in 1995/96, the Indian government is expected to liftgur (crude brown non-centrifugal sugar) stock holdinglimits, which will likely decrease the volume of canediverted to centrifugal sugar production. Moreover,cane diversion to the production of khandsari (a lowrecovery centrifugal sugar) is expected to decreaseagain in 1995/96, due to reduced demand for thisproduct from the alcohol industry. Overall, undefinedmarket and policy factors, such as those thatdetermine the diversion of sugarcane between gur andcentrifugal sugar, including khandsari, will play asignificant role in determining the final mill sugarproduction level in 1995/96. Despite the expecteddownturn, India is forecast to be the world's largestsugar producer (excluding the EU). Thailand--Sugar production for the 1995/96 season isestimated at a record 5.7 million tons, up 5 percentfrom 1994/95 because beneficial rainfall is likely toresult in a record-breaking sugarcane crop of 54.0million tons. Additionally, crop quality is improvingin Thailand as growers increasingly switch to newvarieties that have higher sucrose content. Thenumber of factories in Thailand remains stable at 46because the Government banned construction ofadditional mills. However, the Government has givenpermission to expand crushing capacities and torelocate mills. As a result of this policy,Thailand's milling capacity has greatly expanded. Inaddition, a number of mills have been relocated fromcane-deficit zones in the Central and Eastern regionsto cane-surplus zones in the Northern andNortheastern regions. Australia--Sugar output for 1995/96 is estimated at4.9 million tons, down 3 percent from last season'srecord of 5.1 million. The area harvested in 1995/96is pegged at 373,000 hectares, up 9,000 hectares fromlast season. However, dry weather in some growingareas reduced the volume of sugarcane produced. And,unseasonal rains, which closed more than half ofAustralia's mills for nearly 3 weeks midway throughthe processing season, reduced the sugar content ofthe harvested cane. Nevertheless, the decline insugar production in the drought-affected southerngrowing regions during 1995/96 will be more thanoffset by increased production in the expandingBurdekin and northern growing areas (figure 3). ConsumptionGlobal Consumption Forecast LoweredWorld sugar consumption in 1995/96 has been reviseddown to 116.6 million tons, about 450,000 tons belowthe September forecast. Slower than expected growthin domestic sugar demand in Brazil, Russia, andIndonesia account for most of the revisions.Nevertheless, the revised record 1995/96 world sugarconsumption forecast is 2.1 million tons or 1.8percent above the 1994/95 estimate. Increased sugarconsumption is expected in countries in Central andSouth America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Therise is due to a mix of factors, including lowerprices, higher consumer incomes, population growth,and rising demand for sugar containing products suchas soft drinks and processed foods. In Asia, whichtoday accounts for over 30 percent of world sugaruse, sugar consumption has increased more than 20percent over the last decade, from 27.8 million tonsin 1985/86 to a forecast of 40.0 million in 1995/96(figure 4). Over the last decade, global sugar consumption growthhas been about 1.2 percent per year, down from 2percent from the previous decade. In contrast to theoverall growth in global sugar consumption,year-to-year growth has been weak or non-existent inmany of the world's industrialized economies in NorthAmerica, Europe, and Japan where population growth isslow, sugar markets are mature, and alternativecaloric sweeteners and high intensity sweeteners arepopular. For 1995/96, sugar consumption growth in theUnited States is forecast at only 1 percent, whileCanada's use is expected to decline due to increaseduse of lower priced corn sweeteners and a fall-off inexports of sugar containing products. The EU's sugaruse is relatively stagnant at 14.0 million tons, asis Japan's at 2.4 million. In Central Europe and the countries of the formerSoviet Union, sugar consumption forecasts arerelatively unchanged between 1994/95 and 1995/96, butare sharply lower compared with the late 1980's orearly 1990's. Many of these formerly centrallyplanned economies continue to undergo painfuleconomic transitions, increased retail sugar prices,and high unemployment. TradeTrade Forecast RaisedThe 1995/96 world sugar trade forecast was revised up2 percent to 31.3 million tons. Increased exportprospects in Brazil, Ukraine, Thailand, and Cubaaccount for most of the higher 1995/96 sugar tradeforecast, which is almost 1 million tons more thanthe revised 1994/95 trade estimates. World sugartrade in 1994/95 was revised due to higher exportavailabilities in the EU and India. Larger sugar export supplies in 1995/96 in Brazil,Thailand, Cuba, Ukraine, and Guatemala will likelyaccount for most of the increase in world sugarexports this season. These countries' higher exportsshould offset lower forecasts for leading exporterssuch as Australia and the EU. Anticipated lower sugarproduction in Australia could hamper its exportavailabilities, while the need to rebuilt stocks willlimit the EU's sugar shipments. In recent years,Brazil, Thailand, and Australia have substituted fordecreased Cuban sugar exports in world markets(figure 5). Increased sugar imports in the United States, Russia,and the Philippines will be a major factor in theanticipated increase in world sugar trade in 1995/96.China will continue to be a major importer. The structure of world sugar trade continues to behighly concentrated on the export side compared withimports. The top six exporters for 1990/91-1994/95--EU, Australia, Brazil, Thailand, Cuba, andUkraine--accounted for about 70 percent of worldexports. The top six importers--Russian Federation,EU, China, United States, Japan, and SouthKorea--accounted for about 40 percent of globalimports. Total sugar trade over the past decade has oscillatedwithin a fairly narrow band between 27 and 33 milliontons. Nonetheless, sugar continues to be among theworld's most heavily traded agricultural commodities.In 1994/95, about 26 percent of world sugarproduction was traded, compared with 5 percent ofpaddy rice, 21 percent of wheat, 14 percent of corn,and 25 percent of soybeans. In contrast, 81 percentof coffee production was traded. By volume, the 30million tons of sugar traded in 1994/95 was exceededonly by wheat (96 million) and corn (58 million), andwas about equal to soybean trade (31 million). Of the roughly 30 million tons of sugar traded lastyear about half was raw cane sugar and the other halfrefined beet and cane sugar. Major raw cane sugarexporters are Australia, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa,and Thailand. Their markets include the UnitedStates, Japan, and the EU and a wide set of othercountries--some of which import raw cane sugar andreexport refined sugar--such as China, South Korea,and also the United States. The EU has been the majorsupplier of refined sugar, but in recent yearscountries such as Brazil and Turkey have becomeimportant sources of supply. Leading markets forrefined sugar continue to be the Middle East and theRussian Federation. Over the past decade, refinedsugar trade has grown from about 9 million tons or 35percent of world trade to about 15 million tons or 50percent of the global sugar market last year. Stocks and PricesUSDA forecasts stocks at the end of 1995/96 at 20.8million tons, the highest since 1992/93. Thestocks-to-use ratio is forecast at 17.9 percent, upfrom a low of 16.4 percent 2 years ago (figure 6).Prospects of large crops this year will facilitatethe rebuilding of stocks in a number of countries,including the EU, particularly France, Germany, theNetherlands, Argentina, Colombia, and Zimbabwe. Chinaand India's stocks are expected to be large, allowingChina to reduce imports and India to export. World spot prices for raw sugar (f.o.b. Caribbeancontract No. 11) averaged 12.39 cents a pound for thefirst 11 market days of December (through December15), compared with 11.94 and 11.96 cents a pound inOctober and November. This compares with prices ayear ago of 14.57 for the first half of December, and12.75 and 13.88 cents for October and November. Prices are likely to weaken into the spring due tothe outlook for a record 1995/96 global sugar crop,and a further buildup in world sugar stocks. Aforecast record 1995/96 crop in Thailand and reducedsugar consumption in Russia will make them keycountries to watch. Prospects for record 1995/96global sugar consumption, relatively low world sugarcarryover stocks, possible higher imports by Russia,larger 1995/96 imports by the United States, andstrong Middle Eastern import demand, could providesupport to futures prices in the next few months. Analyzing world sugar prices for the past decade,USDA data indicate years of low prices--6.0 cents apound in 1985/86 and 1986/87--coinciding with abuild-up of world stocks and 2 years--1989/90 and1994/95--when prices moved up to near 14 cents apound when stocks were drawn down. However, a majorprice spike did not occur, in fact the last majorprice increase occurred in 1981/82 when world pricesaveraged around 23 cents a pound. USDA believes theconditions which led to past world sugar price spikeshave been largely removed since 1982. These changesinclude: * The bulk of import demand on the world market is nolonger from high-income, price-inelastic countriesbut from poorer, price-elastic countries; i.e., theyhave to stop buying when the price rises. o Cornsweeteners now provide a viable substitute to sugarin many countries (such as the United States, Japan,and Canada). High intensity sweeteners are also afactor in the United States, Japan, Western Europeand China (i.e. unusally high use of saccharin inrecent years in China). The increased availability ofsubstitutes has greatly increased the priceelasticity of sugar demand; i.e. customers can switchto the substitute if the prices rise. o Policy reformhas occurred in many countries (such as Australia,Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Eastern Europe andMexico) which has increased price transmission tointernal markets. Previous world sugar price spikes led to expansion ofglobal sugar capacity and periods of relatively lowprices. If there are no future world price spikes,there also will not be the tendency for prices to goas low. Colombia: Growth in Production and Exportsby Nydia R. Suarez* *The author is an agricultural economist in theCommercial Agriculture Division, Economic ResearchService, USDA. Colombia has displayed strong sugar production growthin the last 10 years, underpinned by expanded area,improved yields, and increased use of varieties withhigh sucrose content. Production jumped from 1.2million tons raw value in the mid-1980's to a record2.04 million tons in 1994/95. USDA's productionforecast for 1995/96 is 2.07 million tons. Thisforecast assumes normal weather conditions andyields, and only 1 percent growth in area. Expansionmay be slowing, as Colombian producers anticipatelower world prices in the next few years. Colombia's sugar production is concentrated in theCauca Valley where cane is planted and harvested yearround and cane milling is spread evenly throughoutthe year. Thus, a relatively small cane millinginfrastructure is needed to produce the same amountof sugar produced in other countries, giving Colombiaa competitive advantage. Colombia, Hawaii, and Peruare the only places in the world that cultivatesugarcane year round, Colombia being the largestproducer. Colombian farmers have continued theirefforts to raise yields to boost overall productionwith the aid of the Cenicana Research Institute.Sugar area cannot be expanded much more without adrop in average yields. This is why the trend towardgreater use of disease-resistant cane varietiescontinues. Experts in the field forecast that by theyear 2000 more than 60 percent of the centrifugalsugarcane area will be planted to a variety that ishighly resistant to both rust and smut diseases.Also, cane and sugar yield for this variety arehigher than the older varieties, and sugar extractionyields are reportedly 12 percent higher. Colombia hasone of the highest productivity rates and one of thelowest costs in the world. Colombia has consistentlybeen among the world's most efficient producers andpossesses one of the world's most competitive sugarindustries. According to cost data developed by LMCInternational, Colombia ranked 6th among 62 worldsugarcane producing countries during the period1987/88-91/92. From 1979/80 to 1991/92, Colombiaenjoyed total production costs that were nearly 25percent lower than the global cane average.Colombia's average factory costs were the lowest inthe world in 1987/88-91/92 due to its year-roundmilling. Colombia also performs well at the fieldlevel. Average field costs in 1987/88 to 1991/92 werethe 8th lowest among 62 world sugarcane producingcountries. This compared with a ranking of 26th from1983/84 to 1987/88. Besides centrifugal sugar, Colombia produces crude,non-centrifugal sugar called panela. Although areaplanted to cane for panela is almost 2 times largerthan the area for centrifugal sugar, panelaproduction is only two-thirds of the amount ofcentrifugal sugar. Cane for panela production isgrown mostly by small farmers using traditionalmethods. Their yields cannot compare with thoseobtained by large commercial producers of cane forcentrifugal sugar who have access to moderntechnology, equipment, and disease resistantvarieties.  Colombia's centrifugal sugar consumption for 1994/95is estimated at 1.22 million tons, up 3 percent fromthe previous year and 6 percent higher than the1985/86-89/90 average. In addition to the populationgrowth, sugar use increased because sugar retailprices increased less than the growth in the consumerprice index. For 1995/96 and the next 3-5 years,consumption is expected to increase about 2 percentper year, the same as the population growth rate. Inaddition, Colombia consumed more than 1 million tonsof panela. This amount varies with the price ofpanela vis-a-vis white sugar. In September 1991,panela and white sugar prices were the same, but 2years later, the panela price was 24 percent lowerand by 1995, the difference is forecast at 40percent. Another factor that affects consumption isthe unemployment rate. As it declines consumption ofwhite sugar increases as disposable income increases.  Colombian sugar exports currently account for aboutone-third of total output. Colombia began exportingraw sugar in 1961 when world prices were attractiveand the country had plenty of exportable sugar.Stimulated by favorable world prices, Colombia'ssugar exports grew steadily until 1982, and thenbegan to fall as world prices dropped. In 1987exports were only 96,000 tons or 55 percent lowerthan the previous year. Sugar exports during 1985-89averaged a little more than 230,000 tons per year,with the United States receiving almost two-thirds ofthe total. A shift in export distribution occurred in 1991 whenthe Andean-Pact countries opened their borders tocertain products, including sugar. Exports toEcuador, Peru, and Venezuela represent more than 50percent of Colombia's exports for 1990-94. The UnitedStates dropped to 26 percent. In January 1992,Colombia and Venezuela established the Andeanregion's first binational custom union to apply acommon external tariff. Colombia and Venezuela'sbilateral trade accord for several agriculturalcommodities was expanded by the Group of Three (G3)Agreement to include Mexico. Under this Agreement,the Colombian Government is negotiating with Mexicoover the possibility of exporting Colombia sugar toMexico duty free in exchange for a gradual reductionof Colombian import tariffs for fruits, vegetables,pulses, and orange juice imported from Mexico. Majorchanges in Colombia's trade policy orientation areexpected from either future NAFTA accession orparticipation in a Western Hemisphere TradeAgreement. U.S. SweetenersOverviewU.S. Sweetener Market Expands The U.S. caloric sweetener complex, the world'slargest and most diverse in terms of consumerproducts, continues to expand in quantity andvariety. Use of refined sugar, corn sweeteners (HFCS,glucose, and dextrose), honey, maple syrup, andedible molasses in 1995, will likely total 19.7million short tons, compared with 19.3 million lastyear, and 15.5 million in 1985. This expansionreflects growth in the U.S. population (includingPuerto Rico) to over 269 million in 1995, up from 242million in 1985; increased income; and changes inconsumer lifestyles and tastes. Total per capita use of caloric sweeteners in theUnited States is forecast at 148 pounds in 1995,compared with 146 last year, and 128 in 1985. Refinedsugar use in 1995 is expected to account for 43.7percent of the total per capita use or 64.6 pounds,while corn sweeteners should represent 55.3 percentor 81.8 pounds. Growth of corn sweetener use percapita continues to outpace the growth of sugar use,a trend established over the last decade. In addition, caloric sweeteners are increasinglysupplemented by high- intensity (low-calorie)sweeteners, mainly aspartame, saccharin, andacesulfame-k. This segment of the industry ischanging rapidly because of new uses for highintensity sweeteners approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), the prospective introduction ofnew high intensity sweeteners, and growth in thenumber and availability of "light" foods sweetenedwith high-intensity sweeteners. Domestic supplies of sweeteners are also supplementedwith imports of sugar, HFCS, honey, maple syrup, andaspartame. Import levels change from year- to-year,largely based on weather-related productionconditions, prices, and Government policy. U.S.sweeteners are also exported in significantquantities. For calendar 1994, U.S. exports ofrefined sugar totaled 480,000 tons, raw value; HFCS,118,000 tons; honey 8.3 million pounds; and maplesyrup, 569,000 gallons.  The U.S. sweetener industry also generates valuablebyproducts. From the U.S. beet and cane sugarindustry, the key byproducts are molasses, beet pulp,and bagasse from sugarcane milling. Domesticallyproduced molasses is used as an animal feed. Importssupplement domestic supplies. Imports of industrialor feed molasses were at a record 1.8 million tonslast year, but are expected to fall in 1995 due toincreased demand and higher prices in Asia andEurope. A large share of beet pulp production isshipped to Asian markets. Bagasse is mainly used asmill fuel. The corn wet milling process, in additionto sweeteners, produces the byproducts of corn oil,corn gluten meal, and corn gluten feed. Corn glutenfeed, in particular, has a large market in the EU. U.S. SugarProductionBeet Sugar Production LowerU.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million shorttons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the recordoutturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeetproduction is expected to total 28.9 million tons, adecrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,at 1.42 million acres, is down 1.2 percent from lastyear. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons peracre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet springgot the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start andlowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problemsin Michigan and late season harvest problems in partsof the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, havecaused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast fromthe September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 milliontons, raw value, 55 percent of U.S. sugar productionand 393,000 tons less than the record 1994/95 crop. The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partiallyoffset by an increase in the cane sugar forecast to3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from an earlierforecast due to the improved outlook for sugarcaneyields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite these upwardrevisions, the overall outlook for cane sugar isexpected to be down slightly from 1994/95, reflectinga further contraction in the Hawaiian sugar industry. Over the past decade (fiscal 1985/86 - 1994/95), thegrowth trend for U.S. beet sugar production has been128,000 tons per year, while the growth trend forcane sugar production has been 20,000 tons per year(figures 7 and 8). Beet sugar has increased its shareof U.S. sugar production from 49 percent in 1985/86to a record 57 percent in 1994/95. Growth in beetacreage in the upper Midwest States of Minnesota andNorth Dakota has been a major contributing factor inthe expansion of U.S. beet sugar production (figure9). Cane sugar's reduced share is largely due to thesharp contraction in Hawaii's production (figure 10). Developments in the Beet Sugar Producing RegionFor the 1995 Crop 3/3/ The sugarcane harvest is still underway in allsugarcane producing States. Detailed analysis of thecrop will appear in the March 1996 Sugar andSweetener report.The 1995/96 sugarbeet harvest has been completed withthe exception of the upcoming spring harvest inCalifornia. As of mid-December, beet processorsoutside California are continuing their slicingcampaigns largely from piled beets. The majorremaining threat to the crop would be possibledeterioration of sucrose levels in beet piles overthe next several months due to alternating freezingand thawing of piles which can occur during wideswings in temperatures. This season's harvestedtonnage and sucrose levels were adversely affected byweather and crop disease problems. Developments inthe various growing regions are as follows: Great Lakes--Sugarbeet acreage in Michigan and Ohiofor 1995/96 was 204,200 acres, up marginally fromlast year due to increased acreage in Michigan thatoffsets a decline in Ohio. Yields were expected toaverage 16.0 tons per acre, comparable with lastyear, but 4 tons below the national average. Industrysources indicate that sucrose content was 16.4 to17.5 percent. USDA estimates total tonnage to beprocessed at 3.28 million tons. Regional sugarbeetprocessing plants concentrated in the Saginaw Valleyof Michigan (five) and Fremont, Ohio (one) begantheir slicing campaigns in early October and will runthrough the end of January in Michigan andmid-December in Ohio. Agronomically, the 1995 crop proved challenging.Significant spring rains in April and May delayedplantings. However, beet emergence was excellent andcombined with closer seed spacing, provided aboveaverage beet populations. Climatic conditions throughthe summer months provided below normal precipitationand above normal temperatures. Coupled with a heavyinfestation of root aphids in the Michigan growingarea, these conditions had a negative effect onyields and beet quality. Despite wet conditions andtemperatures that were alternately too warm or toocold, about 80 percent of the harvest was completedby November 1. Most of the remaining beets wereharvested under wet and freezing conditions duringthe first 3 weeks of November. Red River Valley and Southern Minnesota--Sugarbeetharvested area in Minnesota and North Dakota isestimated by USDA at a record 625,000 acres for1995/96, up 2 percent from the previous season andequal to 44 percent of the national beet acreage.Yields, however, are down in Minnesota by 10 percentto 18.5 tons per acre and 9 percent in North Dakotato 19.3 tons reflecting generally adverse conditionsboth at planting and harvest. Total beet tonnageharvested for the two States is estimated at 11.7million tons versus 12.7 million tons for 1994/95.Processing of the crop is underway at six beetfactories in the Red River Valley and one at anadjacent area in southwestern Minnesota. The lastprocessing plant in the region is expected tocomplete its slicing campaign by mid-April. In the Red River Valley the 1995 planting seasonexperienced a late start due to excessive soilmoisture and wet spring weather. To offset expectedyield reduction due to late plantings, acreage wasincreased 3 percent. After planting was completed inlate May, warm, humid weather with frequent rainsprevailed through August and September. Reflectingthe warm and moist soil conditions, root rot diseasessuch as aphanomyces and rhizoctonia were moreprevalent this year. Also, cercospora leafspotinfections were reported to be the most severe sincethe early 1980's. Restricted harvest started inmid-September and full harvest started the first weekof October. Sugar content was negatively influencedby excessive rainfall during harvest, an earlykilling frost (September 23), and heavy cercosporapressure. In the southwestern Minnesota growing area, wetconditions in the spring delayed plantings. Forexample, by May 2 only 13 percent of the crop wasplanted versus the normal 52 percent. As a result,yield expectations were reduced due to a lack ofsignificant early planted acres. Compounding the slowstart of the crop, heavy rains during late June andearly July caused severe retardation of rootdevelopment. In the summer months, temperature andhumidity conditions were ideal for development ofcercospora leafspot. Despite multiple applications offungicides, significant leaf damage resulted from theintense infection which further reduced yield andsugar accumulation. Harvest was delayed until mid-September to allow thecrop additional time to mature. October waspunctuated with additional rainstorms, and finallythree snowstorms near the final week. Several growerswere unable to complete harvest before the soil frozeto a depth of 4 to 6 inches. This resulted inadditional lost acres and reduced tonnage, not all ofwhich are reflected in current USDA data. Northwest--The Idaho and Oregon 1995/96 sugarbeetcrops were harvested from 216,000 acres, marginallylower than 1994/95. Yields are estimated at 25 tonsper acre, down more than 2 tons from last year. USDAestimates beet tonnage at 4.95 million tons forIdaho, down 12 percent from last year's record, and464,000 tons in Oregon, comparable with last year.The slicing campaigns got underway at the region'sfour plants (three in Idaho and one in easternOregon) in mid-September and are expected to befinished by early February. A wetter-than-normal spring delayed plantingssomewhat. However, the wet conditions were favorablefor germination and crop establishment, resulting invery good stands and high per-acre populations.Cooler-than-normal temperatures prevailed throughoutthe growing season and resulted in considerablybelow-normal heat unit accumulation for the season.While this retarded crop development, it also reducedirrigation water demand. In addition, the season'scoolness created conditions less favorable foryield-reducing rhizomania's development. Weatherduring harvest was nearly ideal, facilitating arelatively smooth harvest season and enabling beetsto go into storage piles for processing in goodcondition. In addition to the traditional growing areas, theNorthwest has a relatively new growing area in theMoses Lake section of central Washington.Approximately 7,500 acres were harvested in the MosesLake area starting in mid-October. Yields arereported to be over 30 tons per acre, reflecting thearea's highly fertile soil. Since this growing area does not have a mill closeby, beets are shipped by rail to Nampa, Idaho, andHamilton City, California, for processing. But aNovember 3 industry press release indicated that thismode of processing will change in the near future.Columbia River Sugar Company, a grower ownedsugarbeet production cooperative based in the MosesLake area, announced that it has completednegotiations with Holly Sugar Corporation, toconstruct and operate a sugarbeet factory in theMoses Lake area. The factory's initial slicingcapacity when it commences operations in 1998 will be6,000 tons per day, and its design provides forincremental expansion should market conditionswarrant. This will represent the first new beetprocessing plant to be built in the United Statessince 1975.  Great Plains--Sugarbeet production results in theGreat Plains are mixed. Regional sugarbeet areaharvested, including the States of Colorado, Montana,Nebraska, Texas, and Wyoming, totals 250,600 acres,down 2.6 percent from last year. Yields are expectedto be somewhat below normal for the region, averaging19.5 tons per acre. Total sugarbeet tonnage isestimated by USDA at 4.88 million tons, 17 percent ofthe national total, and 9 percent below last year.The beet slicing campaign began in late September atthe region's 11 processing facilities: Colorado, 2;Nebraska, 3; Wyoming, 3; Montana, 2; and Texas, 1. In Montana the growing season was marred by a cold,wet spring which delayed the emergence of thesugarbeet crop. Hail storms plagued the area duringthe summer months and freezing temperatures in lateSeptember kept sugar content from reaching the recordlevels of recent years, and yields were 15 percentbelow the most recent 5-year average. Total tonnagefor the State is estimated at 1.22 million tons, 6.6percent below last year. The sugarbeet crops in northern and central Wyomingwere subject to similar spring conditions, but thesummer growing season was nearly ideal. However, insoutheast Wyoming poor spring planting conditions,coupled with adverse weather through the growingseason adversely affected the sugarbeet crop, andharvesting results were poor. State-wide sugarbeetproduction for Wyoming is estimated at 1.30 milliontons, up 18 percent from last year. This season proved to be particularly difficultagronomically in Nebraska and Colorado, withyear-to-year yields falling 19 percent to 16.5 tonsper acre in Nebraska and 17.7 tons in Colorado. Inboth States a cold wet spring accented diseaseproblems with higher incidence of seedling stress,fusarium, and rhizoctionia. At harvest both areaswere hard hit by frost in late September, especiallyto the growing area in western Nebraska. With theshort crop, processing campaigns will wind up duringthe first 2 weeks of January in both States.  In the southern part of the Great Plains, very littlemoisture was received in the growing area aroundHereford, Texas during the summer months. Yields wereslightly below normal and due to a fall-off inacreage--19,500 acres this season versus a high of41,000 in 1990--total sugarbeet production isexpected to be only 429,000 tons compared with nearby500,000 tons last year and an average of 837,000 tonsfor 1990-93. California--Sugarbeet agriculture in Californiaspreads from the Imperial Valley on the border withMexico through the Central Valley and to the KlamathBasin straddling the Oregon line. Sugarbeet acreageharvested continues to decline in California and isestimated at 114,000 this season, compared withannual averages of 151,000 for the first 5 years ofthe 1990's and 201,000 acres during the 1980's. Thedownturn this year is explained by heavy rains lastspring which delayed plantings and caused some plantloss, especially in the Sacramento Valley, and theavailability to growers of more remunerativealternative crops. The decline in area will be offset somewhat by yieldsthat are the highest in the nation at 27 tons peracre. Total harvested tonnage from California grownbeets is estimated by USDA at 3.1 million tons, down25 percent from 1994. Sugarbeets in California areprocessed at six plants, one located in the ImperialValley and five others located in the Central Valley.These plants also process sugarbeets from the KlamathBasin in Oregon, Central Oregon, and Washington. In the Imperial Valley, the beet crop got off to agood start as soil temperature remained above averageuntil early spring. The 1995 April-July harvest was arecord, yielding over 5.5 tons of sugar per acrecompared with a national average of 3.0 tons peracre. In the Central Valley, the fall tonnage andsucrose content were slightly below average. Nextspring's crop will be short due to rain delays thatprevented planting. In addition, the State hasexperienced its driest fall on record along withunseasonably warm temperatures, and thesedevelopments could affect yields. ConsumptionSugar Use Growth SlowsThe U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchangedat 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tonsor about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand is forecastto run only slightly ahead of the 0.8 percent annualpopulation growth, compared with the 1.6 percentgrowth rate of recent years. The lower rate of growthis attributed to encroachment of high fructose cornsyrup into traditional sugar markets and weak demandfor confectionery and bakery products--majorindustrial users of sugar. Following the majorcontraction in sugar use in the early 1980's due tothe substitution of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)for sugar in soft drinks, sugar use has expanded anaverage of 164,000 tons per year over the last decade(fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), (figure 11).  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995 sugarconsumption is estimated at 9.34 million tons, aboutthe same as use in 1993/94. Industrial users' switchfrom traditional stocking patterns to just-in-timedelivery systems, which may be causing a one-timereduction in apparent sugar deliveries. Crystallinefructose use, while small, also may be taking somesugar markets. Reduced transfers to sugar-containingproducts for export also was a factor in 1994/95. Sugar deliveries for confectionery and cereal/bakeryproducts in 1994/95 totaled 1.88 and 1.34 milliontons, refined value, respectively. Together these twocategories accounted for 64 percent of industrial useand were down slightly from the year before. Growthin sugar use by the bakery/cereal and confectionerysectors had underpinned the growth in total sugar usein recent years. The decline in growth in these twokey use categories is attributed to sluggish demandfor cookies, sweet goods, and confectionery,including lower confectionery exports (figure 12). TradeSugar Import Quota RaisedReacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,the Secretary of Agriculture on November 9, increasedthe fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) forraw-cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000 metrictons) after the release of the monthly WASDE report.This action raised the TRQ to 1.56 million shorttons, and raised total supply (carrying stocks,production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,comparable with the 11.1 million forecast inSeptember as the reduction in the sugar productionforecast largely was offset by the TRQ increase. According to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, TRQimports for the first 2 months of fiscal 1995/96(October 1-December 1) totaled 91,116 short tons. Atthe request of several countries, USDA allowed earlyentry of 1995/96 TRQ sugar. These early entries,arriving before October 1, 1995, totaled 82,960 tons.As of December 1, 1.395 million tons of TRQ sugarwere available for entry into the United States priorto September 30, 1996. As of December 1, 1995, all but about 200 tons of therefined sugar tariff-rate-quota for 1995/96 set at24,251 short tons (22,000 metric tons) had beenfilled. There are also specialty sugar quotas for 23countries, each allocated 79 tons. These specialtyquotas are not usually all filled. At the presenttime several countries, including Japan and UnitedKingdom, are not eligible to fill their specialtysugar import quotas, since they have failed to giveassurance that no Cuban sugar will be transhipped intheir quota. Over the past decade, the United States has remaineda major importer of sugar as growth in consumptionneeds has largely offset upward trending domesticsugar production. Total U.S. sugar imports averaged2.0 million tons annually from 1985/86-1989/90.Imports were composed largely of TRQ importsaveraging 1.45 million tons, and 511,000 tons ofquota-exempt imports for reexport as refined sugar orin sugar-containing products. For the period1990/91-1994/95, U.S. sugar imports averaged 2.1million tons of which TRQ imports accounted for 1.6million and quota-exempt imports 548,000 tons. Starting October 1, 1995 the United States has acommitment, under the Uruguay Round Agreement, to theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) to allow import accessfor at least 1.256 million short tons per year at thelow tariff level of the TRQ. The United States also remains a small, butconsistent exporter of sugar. These exports arelargely refined sugar produced from quota-exempt rawsugar imported, refined, and reexported. For 1994/95total exports were 502,000 tons of which reexportswere 445,000 tons. Despite the changes in trade withCanada, U.S. sugar reexports in 1995/96 are expectedto drop only slightly because of favorable marketsfor refined sugar in other countries, and currently alarge differential between raw and refined sugarprices on the world market. Over the last decade,(1985/86-1994/95), U.S. sugar exports averaged494,000 tons annually of which reexports accountedfor over 95 percent of the annual total. U.S. Canada Sugar Trade DevelopmentsOn November 6, 1995, the Canadian International TradeTribunal (CITT) ruled that sugar imports from theUnited States, certain member States of the EuropeanUnion (EU), and Korea are being dumped in Canada.Revenue Canada found dumping and subsidies in a finalruling in September or October. The CITT ruled inNovember that the dumped and subsidized sugarthreatened to injure the Canadian sugar industry. TheCITT also found that sugar imports from the EU arebeing subsidized. The investigation was initiated inMarch 1995 following a petition from the CanadianSugar Institute, and in July, Revenue Canadaannounced a preliminary finding of dumping andsubsidizing in the case and imposed provisionalanti-dumping and countervailing duties. The CITTruled in November that, although the imports threatenthe livelihood of Canadian sugar refiners, no damagehad yet occurred. Any duties paid since July wererefunded, but the tariffs will apply from November 6. The anti-dumping duties on U.S. companies exportingsugar range from 69 to 85 percent. The duties againstKorea were dropped due to the small volume of tradeinvolved. It is possible that this ruling may beappealed by parties in the United States and/or inCanada. The ruling effectively eliminates U.S. sugarfrom the Canadian market. In 1994/95 the UnitedStates exported 158,000 tons, raw value of refinedsugar to Canada including approximately 101,000 Tonsunder the reexport program. Stocks and PricesStocks Forecast LowerU.S. sugar stocks at the end of fiscal 1995/96(September 30, 1996) are forecast at 1.19 milliontons, down about 3 percent from the revised estimatefor fiscal 1994/95. Stocks reflect a projected totalsupply of 11.01 million tons and total use of 9.82million. The fiscal 1995/96 stocks-to-use ratio isforecast at 12.1 percent, compared with 12.5 percentfor 1994/95. According to USDA's stocks and pricemodel, a 1-percent drop in the ending stocks-to-useratio has historically corresponded to a 0.3-cent apound rise in the New York price for domestic rawcane sugar. For the year ending September 30, 1995, stocks areestimated at 1.23 million tons. This compares with1.45 million tons estimated in September. The 217,000ton decline in the stock estimate can be attributedto downward revisions in supply variables, such asproduction, and upward adjustments to use variablessuch as exports. From 1985/86-1994/95, end of yearstocks and the stocks-to-use ratio averaged 1.42million tons and 15.4 percent, respectively. Sugar Prices Remain FirmU.S. raw cane prices averaged 23.21 cents a pound inSeptember and 22.67 cents in October (Contract No.14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent above the levelfor the same months in 1994. Since the quotaincrease, prices have remained firm averaging 22.60cents a pound for November and 22.64 cents for thefirst 11 market days of December. As indicated in theNovember 9 press release announcing the quota change,USDA will continue monitoring import requirements andwill adjust the TRQ accordingly. U.S. prices of raw cane sugar and refined beet sugarhave remained relatively stable over the last decadebecause of the U.S. sugar program (figures 15 and16). Raw cane sugar prices averaged 21.96 cents apound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a low of 20.46cents in 1985/86 and a high of 23.29 cents in1989/90. Wholesale refined beet sugar prices averaged25.74 cents a pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with alow and high of 23.30 in 1985/86 and 30.14 cents in1989/90, respectively. U.S. retail refined sugarprices averaged 39.31 cents annually over the 10 yearperiod, ranging from a low of 35.12 cents in 1986/87to a high of 43.08 cents in 1990/91. The spreadsbetween the low and high years for raw cane sugarwere 2.45 cents a pound, for wholesale refined beetsugar 6.85 cents, and for retail refined sugar 7.96cents. CostsNew USDA Estimates on Processing CostsIn the winter and spring of 1994-95, ERS contactedall beet and cane sugar processors to collectprocessing cost information for the 1992 crops. Basedon these data, processing costs for the 1993 and 1994crops have been estimated and previously publishedprocessing costs for 1992 have been revised. Forbeets, the traditional East (Red River Valley andeastward) and West (all other) processing regionshave been maintained. For cane, however, Louisianaand Texas have been combined to prevent disclosure ofconfidential accounting data for the one factory inTexas. In fiscal 1993/94, a record 4.55 million tons of rawbeet sugar were produced, an 11-percent increase over1993. Costs of processing this sugar rose 3.6percent, averaging $35.06 per net ton sliced.However, after accounting for credits for byproducts,net processing costs averaged $26.50, a 2.7-percentdrop from 1993. This difference is explained byincreased returns from pulp and molasses offsettinghigher, primarily fixed, processing costs. Similarrelationships were found on a cents-per-pound basis.Total processing costs rose in 1994 but were offsetby higher credits, even with a slight drop in sugarrecovery. Over the 1992-94 period, total costs per ton of beetssliced were consistently higher in the East than inthe West. However, this can be offset by the highersugar recovery rates in the East. On acents-per-pound basis, total beet sugar processingcosts were lower in the East. In 1994, recovery ratesnarrowed and, while recovery was still higher in theEast, processing costs per pound of sugar were lowerin the West. Raw cane sugar production for fiscal 1993/94 was upnearly 2 percent. U.S. total processing costs for the1994 sugarcane crop averaged $19.22 per ton, up 2.3percent from 1993. Most of the increase was due toincreases in the costs of materials and supplies forcane transportation and factory repairs andmaintenance. On a cents-per-pound basis, costs roseeven more (5.1 percent) due to a 2.7-percent drop inthe average sugar recovery rate. There was considerable cost variation across themajor sugarcane regions. Florida is the majorproducer and had costs of 6.98 cents per pound,compared with Louisiana/Texas costs of 8.26 cents andHawaii costs of 11.345 cents. On a percentage basis,Louisiana/Texas had the largest increase for the yeardue to a nearly 9 percent drop in recovery rate.After subtracting credits for molasses and otherbyproducts, net processing costs ranged from 6.30cents in Florida to 9.3 cents in Hawaii, averaging7.22 cents at the U.S. level. Adjustment to Production CostsUSDA has revised its sugarcane costs and returnsestimates published in the Sugar and Sweetener reportin September to account for yields on a net ton perharvested acre basis rather than a gross ton basis.This change will bring the estimates into conformitywith yield estimates published by USDA's NationalAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in CropProduction reports. The change has two effects:* Gross value of production (price times yield) wasrevised to reflect the change in yield. This alsoaffects the returns estimates which are thedifference in gross value of production and eithertotal cash expenses or total economic costs. * Costs for land were reduced in the Louisiana-Texasregion. This is due to a change in the share rentcost which is based on the imputed gross value ofproduction. Per acre cash costs were not affected. The estimates for 1994 still remain preliminary inthat regional sugarcane prices will not be publishedby USDA until January, 1996. When 1994 prices arepublished, estimates will be revised to reflect thenew estimates. Until then, 1994 prices have been keptat their 1993 levels. USDA's latest costs of sugar crop production andprocessing estimates, as well as sugar crop loanrates, are provided in tables 31-39. U.S. Sugar Import Duties 1/by Ron Lord* 1/ The words duty and tariff are usedinterchangeably.U.S. import duties on sugar agreed to during theUruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) generally becameeffective on January 1, 1995.  October 1, 1995, the United States has agreed to setan access level for sugar imported under the low dutyand the time period of the import quotas is fixed asof October 1 through the following September 30. Theminimum low-duty tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for raw canesugar is 1.231 million short tons, and for refinedsugar, 24,251 short tons, raw value. With either theraw or refined sugar quotas, the Secretary ofAgriculture may reserve a TRQ quantity for theimportation of specialty sugars as defined by theUnited States Trade Representative. The Secretary ofAgriculture has authority to set a TRQ higher (butnot lower) than the above minimum levels. Forexample, on November 9, 1995, the Secretary announcedan increase in the raw cane sugar import TRQ for1995/96 of 331,000 tons above the minimum level. The low duty for raw cane sugar under quota, asdetermined under Additional U.S. Note 5 of Chapter 17of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the UnitedStates (HTSUS), is 0.625 cents a pound, raw value.This duty is waived for countries under theGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP), theCaribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the ANDEANtrade pact. Thus the low duty on TRQ imports iswaived for all countries currently allocated a shareof the U.S. sugar import quota except Australia,Brazil, Gabon, and Taiwan. There is a polarizationadjustment (i.e. an adjustment of the duty forquality differences) on the low duty. For thepurposes of subheadings 1701.11 and 1701.12, "rawsugar" means sugar whose content of sucrose byweight, in the dry state, corresponds to apolarimeter reading of less than 99.5 degrees. The low duty for refined sugar under the quota is1.66 cents a pound for 100-degree sugar. There is apolarization adjustment for refined sugar testingless than 100 degrees. Any amounts of sugar imported in excess of theannounced TRQ levels pay the high duty. The high dutyis based upon a tariff equivalent to the quotas inplace during the period 1986-88, and is scheduled todecline by 15 percent over 6 years to the year 2000.For raw cane sugar, the base period duty wasestablished at 18.08 cents a pound, and the first 2-percent reduction which took effect January 1, 1995,resulted in a duty of 17.62 cents a pound for 1995.The duty will fall to 15.36 cents a pound in the year2000. The high duty on refined sugar is about 1 centhigher, and will fall to 16.21 cents a pound in theyear 2000. There is no polarization adjustment forthe duties on sugar imported above the TRQs, but theUnited States is considering a technical revision ofthe HTSUS to provide for such polarizationadjustments. U.S. duties on sugar imports from Mexico are coveredunder the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)which became effective January 1, 1994. The duty onMexican sugar imported under the access provisions ofNAFTA is zero, and the duty for sugar above theaccess provisions is 15.20 cents a pound in 1995.This NAFTA high duty will decline to zero by the year2008. Sugar imports from Canada are composed entirely ofrefined beet sugar, since Canada's export controlregime only allows domesically produced sugar to beexported. Sugar imported from Canada under theprovisions of HTSUS Additional Note 5 faces a duty of0.20 cents a pound in 1995, and this will fall tozero in 1998 as agreed to in the U.S.-Canada FreeTrade Agreement which became effective in 1989. Theavailable TRQ for refined sugar for 1995/96 is 22,426tons, which is the announced total TRQ for refinedsugar of 24,251 tons minus 1,825 tons set aside forspecialty sugar allocations for 23 countries. Infiscal 1996, this refined sugar TRQ is available on afirst-come, first-served basis. Duties on HFCS between the United States and Canadaare low and scheduled to decline to zero in 1998. TheMexican duty on HFCS from the United States isscheduled to decline from a base of 15 percent (priorto the implementation of NAFTA in 1994) to zero over10 years, and in 1995 is 12 percent. Between October1, 1990 and January 1, 1995 sugar imports from Canadawere not subject to quota.  World and U.S. Corn SweetenersWorld ProductionWorld Production Growing ButRemains Highly ConcentratedThe world's leading non-sucrose caloric sweetener ishigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS is a liquidsweetener which can be produced from a variety offeedstocks provided they contain sufficient amountsof starch. The most prominent source of starch in theUnited States is corn, but some producers in Asia usesweet potatoes or tapioca. In Europe, wheat andpotatoes are also used as starch feedstocks. Globally, HFCS first started to make an economicimpact in the mid-1970's when sugar prices soared andnew technologies became available. The global sugarprice boom of the mid-1970's provided a much neededprotective umbrella for the first attempts to produceHFCS on an industrial scale. Global sugar pricesboomed again in the early 1980's, at about the sametime that further major technological breakthroughsoccurred and proved that this alternative caloricsweetener was commercially attractive even when lowersugar prices prevailed. While sugar prices have historically been the leadingreference value for determining the marketpenetration of HFCS, sugar and HFCS are not perfectsubstitutes. For example, sugar has a number ofbulking, texture, and browning characteristics whichmake it the sweetener of choice for theconfectionery, bakery, and cereal industries.World-wide, HFCS is competing primarily with liquidsugar in carbonated soft drinks. The availability ofHFCS in liquid form creates constraints for storageand trade. Transport of HFCS is costly and thereforetrade has been restricted to short-distanceexchanges. According to leading international sweeteneranalysts, some combination of five prerequisites areusually necessary for successful development of anHFCS industry.* Import status for sugar and a high internal pricefor sugar o Sufficient supplies of starch at areasonable net price o Well developed food productionand consumption infrastructure o Capital forinvestment in research and development (R&D) andplant and equipment* Favorable government policy A decade ago world HFCS production was estimated at5.4 million metric tons, dry basis. By 1987,production had expanded to 6.8 million tons, and for1995 the forecast is 9.4 million tons, up 22 percentsince 1990. Globally, production remainsconcentrated, with the United States accounting for75 percent (7.1 million metric tons) of the worldtotal in 1995, Japan 8 percent (750,000 tons), andthe EU 3 percent (303,000 tons), followed by Canada,Korea, Argentina and Taiwan at between 2 and 3percent each. Together these seven countries areexpected to account for 96 percent of global HFCSproduction this year. While this year-to-year growth in global HFCSproduction has been significant, its production anduse remains small compared with sugar. For example,USDA's global sugar consumption forecast for 1995/96is 117 million metric tons versus 9.4 million forHFCS. Moreover, the outlook for the short run is thatthe substitution of HFCS for sugar will remainconfined to a small set of countries and largely toliquid sweetener markets. U.S. ProductionU.S. Corn Crop Lower;Corn Sweetener Output Continues To Grow The 1995/96 (September/August) U.S. corn crop isestimated at 7.37 billion bushels, down 27 percentfrom the record high 1994 corn crop, due to reducedarea and lower yields. According to USDA's NovemberCrop Production report, 1995/96 corn harvestedacreage is estimated at 64.8 million, down 11 percentfrom last year. The reduction reflects prolonged wetconditions in the Midwest this spring which preventedsome plantings and delayed others. Based onconditions as of November 1, the average corn yieldis forecast at 113.7 bushels per acre compared with arecord 138.6 bushels in 1994/95. The sharp decline isdue to a very hot dry summer in many leadingproduction States as well as production losses thisfall. For example, yield estimates were reduced inKansas due to damage from early frost. In Nebraskaand some other areas, high winds led to reports oflodging and ear droppage. With generally favorableconditions, farmers made rapid progress harvestingcorn in October. As of November 5, 87 percent of thecrop was harvested in the 17 major producing Statesaccounting for 94 percent of estimated production.This compares with an average of 74 percent. This year is shaping up as one of the tightest everfor U.S. corn. With importers' buying continuing at abreakneck pace, limited corn supplies and higherprices are expected to have a larger impact ondomestic users despite strong potential demand. According to the December World Agriculture Supply -Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, domestic corn usefor 1995/96 is forecast at 6.28 billion bushels, withfeed and residual use taking 73 percent or 4.58billion bushels, and food, seed, and industrial (FSI)use the remainder, 1.70 billion bushels. Within theFSI use sector, the corn grind for corn sweeteners isforecast at a record 705 million bushels, 19.7million short tons, up 1.7 percent from 1994/95. Cornsweeteners represent about 9.6 percent of theforecast domestic use of the 1995/96 crop, and 41percent of FSI use. Over the last decade, corn usefor sweeteners have climbed from around 500 millionbushels annually to a record of over 700 millionexpected this year. U.S. corn sweetener production in fiscal 1995/96(October/September) is forecast to total 12.1 milliontons, dry basis, up 3.9 percent from the year thatended September 30. This forecast reflects expandedindustry capacity and is based on recent growthtrends. Figure 19 provides a detailed flow-chart ofthe corn wet-milling process yielding cornsweeteners. HFCS production is forecast at 8.1 million tons, drybasis, up 4.2 percent from 1994/95 and accounting orabout two-thirds of expected total corn sweetenerproduction for the coming year. For fiscal 1994/95,HFCS production totaled 7.8 million tons, up 4.4percent from the corresponding period in 1993/94. Glucose syrup and dextrose are the other primary cornsweeteners produced by the U.S. corn wet millingindustry. Combined glucose and dextrose productionfor fiscal 1995/96 is forecast at 4.0 million tons.This is up 125,000 tons from the fiscal 1994/95estimate and accounts for about a third of totalexpected corn sweetener production during fiscal1995/96. U.S. ConsumptionHFCS Use HigherTotal U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach11.2 million tons of which U.S. production isexpected to supply 98 percent. The United Statessupplements domestically produced corn sweetenersupplies with imports, mainly from Canada. USDAforecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons, up3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecastfor HFCS is based on projections of deliveries fromdomestic production and imports. On a per capitabasis, and using a U.S. population of 269.2 million(including Puerto Rico), domestic HFCS use isforecast at 59.3 pounds in fiscal 1995/96, up from57.7 pounds for last year, and 45.2 pounds a decadeago. Glucose syrup and dextrose deliveries areforecast at 3.3 million tons, up 2.6 percent from1994/95. HFCS deliveries for fiscal 1994/95 totaled 7.68million tons, up 3.5 percent from the preceding year.HFCS-55 use is driven largely by demand by thenonalcoholic beverage sector which normally accountsfor 90 percent of its total use. Tables 44 and 45provide a breakout of HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 use bymajor food use categories and beverages. For HFCS-55,there appears to be only small growth in foodcategories such as processed foods; with beveragesremaining the leading category of use. HFCS-42depends on beverages for only about 40 to 45 percentof its total use. Other food use categories in totalare more important and expanding, especially use inprocessed foods, and the cereal and bakery category.For 1995, soft drink use growth is estimated at 3 to4 percent, somewhat below increases in recent years.While summer soft drink use was reported to bestrong, price increases--mainly due to increasedcosts for plastic and aluminum packaging--earlier inthe year dampened demand somewhat.U.S. Prices and CostsHFCS Prices Remain Low Through SummerHFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis respectively,for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For theJune through September period, prices for HFCS-55averaged 18.51 cents a pound and for HFCS-42, pricesaveraged 16.62 cents. Normally, prices move upsharply during the summer due to the high demand forHFCS from the beverage sector and because of tightprocessing capacity. However, this past summer, whiledemand was strong due to unusually hot summertemperatures in many parts of the country, prices didnot move up. This reflects added corn sweetenerprocessing capacity, as much as 25 percent accordingto some estimates, that came on line in the lastyear. With the very sharp downturn in this season'scorn crop, HFCS prices have increased. HFCS prices are consistently lower than refined sugarin the U.S. market. For the 10 year period1985/86-1994/95, wholesale HFCS prices averaged 20.76cents a pound, dry basis, compared with 25.74 centsfor refined beet sugar. This price spread of nearly 5cents is one major reason for the substitution ofHFCS for sugar in beverage and certain food markets.Moreover, these HFCS prices are "list prices" andlikely do not reflect significant price discountsreceived by major buyers. Fundamental also to the growth of the corn sweetenerindustry in the United States has been the abundantavailability of corn coupled with its relatively lowcost. The cost of corn as a raw material input can beviewed either on a gross or net basis. Thewet-milling process creates three valuablebyproducts: corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal, andcorn oil. Sale of these byproducts generates revenuesthat reduce the gross cost of corn. When corn pricesrise, so usually do the byproduct prices, partlyoffsetting the effect of higher corn prices on cornsweeteners. In the calculation of byproduct credits,it is assumed 1 bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds andproduces 1.55 pounds of crude corn oil, 13.5 poundsof corn gluten feed, 2.65 pounds of corn gluten meal,and 33.33 pounds of corn sweetener, dry weight. Table51 provides net cost of corn starch data throughNovember 1995. The Midwest price of number 2 yellow dent corn, thegrade used by wet millers, averaged $2.28 per bushelfor the first 9 months of fiscal 1994/95, comparedwith $2.67 for the corresponding period in 1993/94.The lower corn prices in 1994/95 reflected the recordcorn crop. But corn prices have been rising in recentmonths averaging $2.77 per bushel July-September,$3.12 in October and $3.22 in November, reflectingthe forecast sharp downturn in corn production in1995/96. The December WASDE forecast corn prices for1995/96 to range from $2.95-3.35 a bushel, comparedwith $2.26 per bushel for the whole season of1994/95. Net corn cost averaged $1.67 per bushel in October1995 versus 1.27 per bushel for the first 9 months of1995. For the previous decade (1985-1994), net corncosts averaged 90 cents a bushel. U.S. Honey and Maple SyrupProductionHoney Output UnchangedU.S. honey production in 1995 is estimated at 216million pounds (108,000 short tons), practicallyunchanged from 1994. Production of honey in theUnited States have been hampered by a continueddecline on bee colonies. The number of commercial beecolonies in the United States has gradually declinedfrom a peak of 5.9 million in the late 1940's, to 4.3million in 1985, and to an estimated 2.7 million in1995. Declining colony numbers are mainly due tofewer easily accessible floral sources, increased useof pesticides, increasing losses from mites, risingproduction costs, and declining net income. In addition, the migration of Africanized bees intothe southern United States may have contributed to adecline in beekeeping, and therefore, reduced beecolonies. Although the number of producing colonieshas declined over the past years, honey yields percolony have increased. Yields per colony averaged 35pounds in 1985, 62 pounds in 1990, and compared withan estimated 78 pounds in 1994. The lower colonynumbers and higher yields likely reflect structuraladjustments in the U.S. honey industry in whichsmaller producers continue to leave the industry,while larger apiaries continue technologicalimprovements. More than one-third of all colonies inthe United States are located in California, NorthDakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Florida. TheseStates continue to account for over half of U.S.honey production. Maple Syrup LowerMaple syrup production for 1995 is estimated at 1.1million gallons, down 17 percent from 1994. Thedownturn is largely attributed to a fall-off inproduction in Vermont, the largest producing State,from 435,000 gallons in 1994 to 365,000 gallons thisyear, due to less than optimal weather. To generatethe best sap flows, freezing conditions at nightfollowed by warm days are required. Production was upsomewhat in Maine, the second largest producer butdown in New York, the third largest producer. In NewYork, the first sap run was reported March 4 and thelast April 1, with an average of 47 gallons of sapper gallon of syrup. In 1994, the first and last runwere March 16 and April 11, respectively, averageyields were 41 gallons of sap per gallon of syrup. ConsumptionHoney Use Expected LowerU.S. honey consumption has been increasing in thelast few years, due to population growth andincreased use by bakery, cereal, and health foodmanufacturers. However, U.S. domestic demand forhoney in 1995 is forecast to decrease by 4 percentbased on lower supplies and higher prices. Householdconsumption accounts for approximately 40 percent oftotal U.S. honey domestic use. Honey for table use isgenerally liquid, light color, and with mild flavor.The United States is also one of the world's largestmarkets for industrial honey, which accounts forabout 45 percent of total domestic consumption. Thefood manufacturing industry, primarily bakery, healthfood, and cereal manufactures, is the major user ofindustrial honey. The food service industry, which iscomprised of restaurants, schools, hospitals, andother institutional operations, accounts for theremaining 15 percent of the honey consumed annuallyin the United States. Maple Syrup Demand Trading UpMaple syrup use continues to grow in popularity.Total use was estimated at 4.0 million gallons in1994, compared with 2.5 million in 1985. The upturnin use can be attributed to wider marketing ofdomestic output increasingly supplemented by imports.  TradeU.S. Net Honey ImporterExports of U.S. honey in 1994 were 8.3 million poundsor 4,171 short tons, 2 percent below 1993 shipments,mainly due to increased competition from low pricedChinese and Argentine honey in international markets.U.S. honey exports in 1995 are forecast at 9.3million pounds or about 12 percent above 1994shipments. Although U.S. honey supplies are expectedto be lower in 1995, higher international prices,combined with continued promotion campaigns inprincipal U.S. markets, like those in the MiddleEast, have improved U.S. honey export prospects thisyear. Total U.S. honey shipments during the periodJanuary-August, 1995, reached 5.7 million pounds, up25 percent from exports during the same period lastyear. Moreover, exports to date to important marketssuch as Germany, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia are alsorunning ahead of last year. About 55-60 percent of U.S. honey is exported in bulkform, with the remaining 40-45 percent directed tothe retail consumer-ready market. Exports ofhigh-quality, consumer-packed honey have beenincreasing in recent years due to increased worlddemand and to promotional efforts under the MarketPromotion Program, which is administered by theNational Honey Board. U.S. imports of honey in 1994 were 123.2 millionpounds or 61,615 tons, 8 percent less than imports in1993. Anti-dumping investigations regarding honeyimports from China, the major supplier to the U.S.market, discouraged exports of Chinese honey to theUnited States last year. Still, U.S. honey importsfrom Argentina in 1994 increased for the sixthconsecutive year to 40.3 million pounds.  U.S. imports in 1995 are forecast to decrease furtherto 84.0 million pounds based on a new agreementreached this year with China, which will restrict theamount of Chinese honey imported into the UnitedStates. Moreover, decreased world honey supplies andhigher international prices will likely discourageU.S. honey imports in 1995. U.S. honey exports duringthe period January-August 1995, were 58.6 millionpounds, compared with 85.8 pounds during the sameperiod last year. Moreover, imports from China andArgentina, the two top U.S. suppliers, are runningbehind last year's pace by 64 and 33 percent,respectively. China, Argentina, Canada, and Mexicohave been the leading suppliers of honey to theUnited States, accounting for nearly 90 percent ofU.S. honey imports. Honey imports account for about30 to 35 percent of U.S. honey consumption. Over thepast decade (1985-94), U.S. honey imports haveexceeded exports by about 90 million pounds annually. Maple Syrup Exports Small,Imports GrowingU.S. maple syrup exports continue to be small,totaling only 569,000 gallons in 1994, and averaging364,000 annually for the previous 5 years. Incontrast, imports of maple syrup, mainly from Canada,were a record 3.3 million gallons in 1994 with annualimports averaging 51.5 million gallons for theprevious 5 year average. The upturn in importsreflects increasing demand for maple syrup in theUnited States and the need to supplement domesticsupplies. Programs and PoliciesHoney Support Program ChangedThe U.S. Honey Price Support Program was amended bythe Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1993. The 1993Act reduced the minimum honey loan rate from 53.8cents a pound for the 1991-95 crops, to 50 cents apound for the 1994 and 1995 crops, 49 cents a poundfor the 1996 crop, 48 cents for the 1997 crop, and 47cents a pound for the 1998 crop. The 1993 Act alsodropped the 1 percent (0.538 cent) nonrefundablemarketing assessment, which growers paid on eachpound of domestically produced honey. However, thefunding for the price support portion of the honeyprogram was eliminated for the 1994 and 1995 honeycrops. Also, the loan portion of the program is nowoperating as a recourse, interest-charged loanprogram. Loans are available for 9 months to provideinterim financing while a producer markets the honey.Table 62 provides data on loan activity. Chinese Imports RestrictedU.S. honey imports from China expanded steadily fromabout 26.5 million pounds in 1989 to 75 million in1993. In response to a petition from the AmericanBeekeeping Federation and the American HoneyProducers Association, the U.S. International TradeCommission (ITC) instituted an anti-dumpinginvestigation on imports of honey from China inOctober 1994. On November 14, 1994, ITC votedunanimously to pursue a complaint that Chinese honeywas being dumped in the United States and harmingU.S. honey producers. After the ITC decides to accepta case, the actual anti-dumping investigation is doneby the International Trade Administration, Departmentof Commerce. After ITC found that honey from Chinahad been dumped in the United States, anti-dumpingduties on imports from China were established. In August 1995, the U.S. Department of Commerce andthe Government of China reached an agreement, whichsuspends punitive U.S. anti-dumping duties and placesquantitative and a price limits on Chinese honey orshipments to the United States. The agreement, whichcovers 5 years beginning in 1995, will allow China toexport 44 million pounds (21,982 short tons 19,942metric tons) of honey annually to the United States.The agreement also established that Chinese honeycannot be sold at a price lower than a referenceprice, equivalent to 92 percent of the average unitvalue of honey imported by the United States from allother countries. The reference price will be updatedquarterly. Tables 58-64 provide supply use and pricestatistics for honey and maple syrup. World and U.S. High Intensity SweetenersWorld High Intensity Sweetener Use Continues ToExpandWorld production and use of high intensity (lowcalorie) sweeteners continues to expand around theglobe. While USDA does not have an independentproduction survey system for high intensitysweeteners, a prominent market analyst placescombined production of saccharin, aspartame, andacesulfame-k at about 37 million pounds (table 65).No public data are available for the other major highintensity sweeteners cyclamate, sucralose, andalitame. The approximate sugar sweetener equivalent(SSE) to the major high intensity sweeteners is asfollows: cyclamate (30), aspartame (180),acesulfame-k (200), saccharin (300), sucralose (600),and alitame (2,000). The growth in the use of high intensity sweetenersreflects their cost economics compared with sugar andHFCS. One of the most notable features of the worldintense sweetener sector in recent years has been thegrowing trend towards the blending of differentsweeteners with one another. From a commercial pointof view, one of the most important advantages of suchblends is their sweetening synergies. The sweetnessintensity delivered by a blend is nearly always fargreater than the sum of the sweetness potencies ofthe individual sweeteners, enabling food and drinkmanufacturers to realize substantial sweetener costsavings. Moreover, blending often results in tastesynergies and enhanced stability. For markets to grow, these products must first gainapproval by food safety authorities in variouscountries. For example, both sucrolose and alitamewere approved for use in Mexico and Australia thispast year. In contrast, both products are awaitingapproval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)for use in the United States. Saccharin is one of the most widely used highintensity sweeteners. It is approved for use in theEU, Japan, China, Canada (for table top use andpending approval in soft drinks and food), and theUnited States. Saccharin has been low pricedaveraging about 1 cent a pound SSE, in the UnitedStates. It is widely used in China and Indonesia as asubstitute for sugar in soft drinks and other foods.In the United States and Europe, saccharin is alsowidely used in non-food uses such as toothpaste andpharmaceuticals. One of the oldest and most widely used blends is thatof saccharin with cyclamate. Used on their own, thetaste profiles of these sweeteners are poor, bothhaving slight metallic after tastes. However, whenused together, the overall taste profile is muchimproved. Moreover, because of sweetening synergiesthat exist between the two sweeteners and low costs,the potential cost savings are significant. However,in some of the world's largest sweetener marketsregulatory barriers prohibit the use of one or eitherof these sweeteners. For example, in the UnitedStates and United Kingdom cyclamate have been bannedfor use since 1969. Aspartame has achieved wide-approval in the EU,Canada, Japan, and the United States. Applications inthe United States include carbonated soft drinks,refrigerated and non-refrigerated ready-to-drinkbeverages, table top use, frozen desserts, yogurt,and candies. Aspartame gradually loses its sweetnessin liquids as a function of time, temperature, andpH. It also loses its sweetness when exposed to highheat, as in baking. A new encapsulated form ofaspartame was recently approved by FDA for baking.Encapsulation protects aspartame under high heat andreleases the sweetener only during the final stage ofbaking. Aspartame's advances in the U.S. market were spurredlargely by growth in demand for "diet" soft drinks,despite its high cost--in 1989 $60-$70 per pound, or36 cents a pound SSE. Since NutraSweet's patent onaspartame expired in December 1992, the price hasfallen and currently is estimated at about $20-$35dollars a pound, or 17 cents a pound SSE. While mostof the aspartame used in the United States isproduced domestically, dependence on imports isgrowing. In 1994, the United States imported a record5.9 million pounds (2,683 tons) valued at $92.4million, most of it from Japan. The unit import valuewas $15.62 per pound, or 8.68 cent a pound SSE (table66). Acesulfame-k has broad approval for use in food andbeverages in the EU and Canada. It has not beenapproved yet in Japan. In the United States it hasbeen approved for a number of food products such asbaked goods, yogurt, dry drink mixes, and as a tabletop sweetener. Approval is pending for its use incarbonated soft drinks. In the United States, itsprice on a sugar equivalent basis is about 17 cents apound. In Europe an increasingly popular blend isacesulfame-k and aspartame. Competition in U.S. Soft Drink Market Between HighIntensity Sweeteners, Sugar, and HFCS During the 1980s, U.S. sweetener analysts generallybelieved that aspartame was not having much negativeimpact upon the market for caloric sweeteners such assugar and HFCS. Instead, aspartame was competing withsaccharin. It was also felt that aspartame had playeda major role in revitalizing the diet beveragemarket, but that these extra sales represented a newform of soft drink demand, which was largely inaddition to the existing large non-diet or regularsoft drink sales. More recently, this view has beenchanged. Analysts now believe that there is some"cannibalisation" or substitution of the regular softdrink market by diet products--that is, highintensity sweeteners are competing directly with thecaloric sweeteners, sugar, and HFCS. Ukraine's Sugar Industry: Recent Developments andProspects by Peter Buzzanell, Yuri Markish, and RogerHoskinNote: This is the second in a series of threearticles on the republics of the former Soviet Unionthat will appear in the Sugar and Sweetener Situationand Outlook report. The first article, "The RussianFederation: Sugar Industry in Transition" appeared inMarch 1994. Abstract: Four years after the end of the Sovietperiod, Ukraine remains one of the world's largestsugar producers despite declines in area, yield, andproduction. The processing industry is plagued withoutmoded equipment and production practices whichhamper productivity. To date, governmentprivatization efforts have meant no real change inadministration. High prices and falling incomes havelowered Ukrainian sugar consumption. The countryremains self-sufficient in sugar and exports abouthalf of its production, mostly to other FSUcountries. Current tariff regimens, especially inRussia, could favor the resurgence of raw sugarimports for refining and reexport.  IntroductionUkraine's sugarbeet industry ranks as one of theworld's largest in terms of area harvested,processing capacity, beet sugar production, andtrade. However, field and factory performancecontinues to be constrained by high prices andshortages of agricultural inputs, fuel, machinery,spare parts, and low capital investment. The industryis struggling with policy reforms as it adapts to thecountry's shift from state planning to market forces.The outlook for Ukraine's sugar industry, a keycomponent of the nation's rural economy and exportearnings, is being shaped by the lack of initiativesto increase production efficiencies and the slowreform of the industry's organizational structure. Structure of Production and Processing--Sugarbeets is a Leading CropUkraine is the world's fourth largest producer ofsugarbeets and beet sugar behind France, the UnitedStates and Germany. For 1995/96, USDA forecastsUkraine`s sugarbeet harvest from an estimated 1.43million hectares, the largest of any country in theworld (table A-1). USDA forecasts Ukraine's 1995/96sugarbeet production at 33.0 million tons yielding4.0 million tons of beet sugar, raw value (tableA-2). In recent years, sugarbeets have been processed in 19of the Ukraine's 25 oblasts (similar to states in theUnited States or provinces in Canada). Ukraine'ssugarbeet crop is sown in the spring and harvested inthe fall. Of more than 1.6 million hectares sown tospring crops in 1995, sugarbeets accounted for about6 percent. More than half of spring planted area wasdevoted to grain crops such as barley, corn, andfodder crops. Sunflowerseed plantings were alsosomewhat larger than sugarbeets at 1.8 millionhectares. Although sugarbeets occupy less than 10percent of cultivated land, the crop accounts forabout 30 percent of gross farm income and 15 percentof net farm profits. Moreover, the byproducts of thesugarbeet crop (beet tops, beet pulp, and molasses)provide valuable animal feed to supplement foddercrops.Sugarbeets are grown on an estimated 7,500 to 8,000agricultural collectives and farms spread across thecountry. Key producing oblasts are located in thecentral and western parts of the country, generallynear sugarbeet processing facilities (figure A-1).Among the leading oblasts in terms of sugarbeet areaare Vinnytsya, Cherkasy, Khmel'nyts'kyy, Kiev, andSumy. Together these five oblasts account for over 50percent of the total area in sugarbeets. The Ukraine has excellent natural advantages forgrowing sugarbeets, including fertile soil and a goodclimate. Sugarbeets are grown in rotation with othercrops, particularly grains, and year-to-year changesin beet area planted reflect the relative pricesreceived by farmers for sugarbeets compared withother crops. Planted area in 1995 was 11 percentbelow the average 1.66 million hectares harvested inthe late 1980's (table A-2). In part the declineeffects the disappearance of Soviet Union's centralplanning schemes, under which the Ukraine wasobligated to produce sugar to meet the needs of otherrepublics of the former Soviet Union (FSU). The loweracreage also reflects a shift to more profitablegrains or sunflowers, problems between sugarbeetgrowers and processors, and removal of subsidies tosugarbeet processing plants. While some traditionalsugarbeet areas have gone out of production, newareas have come into production in the Crimea,Dnipropetrovs'k, Luhans'k, and Kherson oblasts. OnlyZaporizhzhya oblast does not currently growsugarbeets. In November, Ukraine's sugarbeet yields for 1995/96were forecast at 23.2 tons per hectare, up from thedrought-reduced yields of last season but well belowthe average 30.4 tons of the late 1980's. Recentreports indicate the final result may have beensomewhat lower. Yields in the Ukraine in the late1980's were about 5 tons below the world average ofabout 35 tons (figure A-3). France and Germanytypically average yields of 42 to 45 tons perhectare. Quantity and quality of agrochemicals andother industrial inputs in these countrieshistorically have been several times higher than inUkraine. However, Ukrainian yields have tended to behigher than in some neighboring East Europeancountries such as Romania, Bulgaria, and the RussianFederation. Ukrainian yields have declined since the end of theSoviet period because of the declining use offertilizers and plant protection products. The end ofgovernment subsidies of these inputs has led tosharply higher prices and reduction of input use.This season's production upturn represents a recoveryfrom 1994's severe drought. In recent years, the productivity of Ukrainiansugarbeet agriculture has been constrained byproblems with seeds, field equipment, chemicals, andfuel. For example, sugarbeet seed has not beenavailable in sufficient quantities. Average annualsugarbeet seed production is estimated at 17,000tons, which is enough to plant 1.1 million hectares.The three sugarbeet seed factories in Ukraine(Vinnytsya, Lebedyn and Buryn) all are reportedly inneed of modernization. Foreign hybrids were plantedon about 60,000 hectares in the spring of 1995, 4percent of total plantings. Efforts to modernize the seed industry are underway.To support breeders, each beet factory has tocontribute to a special breeding fund of theUkrainian Sugar Concern (Ukrsakhar), aquasi-government agency. Five new Ukrainian-developedhybrid seed varieties are expected to be releasedsoon. Domestically produced sugarbeet seeds weregiven by the government to sugarbeet factorieswithout advance payment for the 1993-95 plantingseasons, and then distributed to farmers, alsowithout any advance payment. In 1995, seeds will bereportedly paid for after the crop harvest at a costof 200 kilograms of sugar per hectare. Higheryielding, foreign hybrid seed costs about three timesas much as Ukrainian varieties. Fertilizer and pesticide applications have fallensince the Soviet era due to higher prices, andremoval of subsidies to growers to purchase inputs.Fertilizer applications to sugarbeet fields havefallen from 300 to 450 kilograms per hectare in themid 1980's to 80 to100 kilograms in some areas forthe 1994/95 crop. Pesticide use has fallen to 20 to30 percent of the amount applied during the Sovietperiod. In the future, the rate of fertilizer, andchemical use will be determined by their economicbenefit. Application rates are unlikely to return toSoviet-period levels. Like the seed problem, thereduced use of production-enhancing inputs has shownup in lower sugarbeet yields. Growers initially were unable to obtain credit forthe spring planting campaign in 1995. However, theCabinet of Ministers decided to ignore the Governmentanti-inflation guidelines and requested the Ministryof Industry to give fertilizers to sugarbeet farmerslast spring without prepayment. Final settling issupposed to be done after growers sell their 1995harvest, but is unlikely to happen. Given theinflationary environment in Ukraine, the governmentdecision to delay payments represents a subsidy togrowers. Harvesting of sugarbeets normally begins in Septemberand lasts about 60 days, while processing can last upto 100 days. According to Ukrainian governmentsources, average losses from the previous five cropsaveraged 22.5 percent. This staggering loss estimateincludes beets unharvested and those dug but notdelivered to factories. Despite the agronomic andcapital equipment problems, a return to more normalweather helped Ukrainian farmers in 1995/96 toharvest and deliver an estimated 33.0 million tons ofsugarbeets to processing facilities. While more than20 percent below the 45 million ton average of thelate 1980's, the volume will exceed that of any othercountry in the world. Harvests in France, Germany,and the United States, for example, each are expectedto range around 26 million tons this season. Grower-Processor RelationshipCurrently Ukraine regulations presume that allsugarbeets and byproducts (molasses and beet pulp)are owned by the growers. Growers pay sugar factoriesa processing fee ranging from 19 to 42 percent withmoney, beets, or sugar. Sometimes shares of molassesand pulp also remain with the factories. Payment isdone according to quality and quantity of beets,taking into account data on sugar content and averagesugar losses at the factory through the entire beetprocessing campaign.  This season, for the first time, there appears to belittle or no state or government mandated contractbetween growers and processors, and procurementscontinue to be scaled back. Growers and factorieshave to find their own markets for their output andhave to find supplies of inputs and equipment. Thecontracts between farmers and processors areunderstood to include pricing alternatives such as:1) growers pay a fee to cover the processing andstorage costs of sugarbeets, and 2) sugar produced,as well as molasses and pulp, remains the property ofthe grower (after deducting storage losses) and thefactory retains part of the finished sugar as paymentfor processing costs. There are major disagreements between beet growersand processors regarding the amount of sugarprocessors should receive under barter agreements.Processors want to implement a new regulationstipulating that 51 percent of the sugar processedbelongs to the growers and the remainder to them. Thegrowers, in contrast, want a 70-30 percent split. Asa point of comparison, in the United States there isgenerally a 60-40 percent grower-processor split,with grower payments based on their individual sugarcontent and the market price of sugar received by theprocessor. In the western U.S. contract model, theprocessor keeps returns generated from byproducts. Processing Facilities Need ModernizationUkraine has one of the world's largest sugarbeetprocessing industries. According to the latestavailable statistics, there are 195 beet processingplants located in 19 of the country's oblasts,although several are not operational this season.Total daily sugarbeet slicing capacity is about500,000 tons, and beet sugar production capacity isabout 50,000 tons per day. In addition, Ukraine hasfive raw cane sugar refineries strategically locatedthroughout the country, the largest of which issituated at the Black Sea port of Odessa.Sugarbeets are shipped to processing plants generallylocated near growing areas. A large share of theplants are clustered in the central and western partof the country with the highest concentration in theoblasts of Vinnytsya (41), Cherkasy (23),Khmelnytskyy (17), and Kiev (15). By world standardsUkraine's beet processing plants tend to be small.For example, in the oblast of Vinnytsya, 9 of the 41beet plants have a daily capacity under 1,500 tons;25 have capacities of between 1,500 and 2,500 tons; 7have capacities of between 2,500 to 5,000 tons; andonly 1 has a capacity of over 5,000 tons per day.Only 17 plants, 9 percent of the total, havecapacities over 5,000 tons; and the national averageis 2,623 tons per day. In contrast, the U.S. beetsugar industry's plant capacity averages 5,375 tons,and 18 of the 34 U.S. plants have capacities over5,000 tons per day. About 50 of Ukraine's beetprocessing plants are characterized as in goodmechanical condition, 50 are in poor condition, andthe remainder are characterized as very poor.  Ukraine's beet processing campaign usually starts inmid-September and runs through mid-December. Thenational average length of the processing campaign is90 to 100 days, with some regional variation. Whileportions of the industry tend to run efficiently,large segments do not. By western standardsprocessing losses are high. Capacity utilizationlevels during the short processing season tend to below due to endemic problems of insufficient beets andlack of fuel to maintain plant operations. In recentharvests, increasing transportation delays and lackof coordination between growers and processors havecontributed to below-optimum throughput in factories.High energy consumption has became a major problemfor the industry. Ukraine's exports of sugar toRussia are tied to reciprocal arrangements for oilimports, so the more oil required for each ton ofsugar, the more sugar that must be bartered toRussia. According to statements by Ukrsakhar, the Ukrainianbeet processing industry extracts about 72 percent ofthe sugar content of sugarbeets entering the factory.The vintage of equipment, lack of repairs andmaintenance as well as management practices inhandling beets from the field to the factory, allcontribute to lower recovery rates in Ukrainianplants. While this extraction rate is similar to thatachieved in Soviet times in the late 1980's, it iswell below western standards. For example, in theUnited States, plants normally extract over 80percent of the sugar in beets, and if desugaring ofmolasses is added, the figure goes to over 90percent. However, the sugar content of Ukrainianharvested sugarbeets is comparable to those ofwestern countries--over 16 percent. Thus, increasedefficiencies in the factories would reduce losses anddecrease costs. A good index to compare both fieldand factory productivity levels is sugar produced perhectare. As figure A-4 reveals, Ukraine's sugar perhectare is well below levels achieved in France andnearby Poland. Yet, the sugar per hectare level in the Red RiverValley of the United States is closer to that ofPoland than France. This highlights the differencebetween technical and economic efficiency. If inputsor outputs are subsidized, then agriculture willbecome very technology intensive; this may explainthe high sugar per hectare figure for France. Ifproduct prices and inputs are not subsidized then itmay not be economically profitable to attain a highertechnical level of productivity. Ukraine's industryis currently undergoing the removal of assets andinputs that results when subsidies are ended, hencethe value of fixed assets is low, perhaps excessivelyso. What the "optimal" use of these inputs is willdepend on costs and returns in a restructuredindustry. However, there is no evidence that reported changesin ownership arrangements have meant any changes inday-to-day administration. The Ukrainian governmentscaled back procurement more out of an inability tofinance the program than out of conviction that itshould be ended. Presently, domestic sugar prices arehigh, $700 to $800 a ton, well above world prices,and stocks are ample. The fact that prices have notfallen, suggest that growers and processors areholding stocks because they believe that they willeventually convince the government to ratify theindustry's high cost structure by some form ofsubsidization or renationalization. Processing Facilities PrivatizationUntil 1991 all of Ukraine's processing facilitieswere state owned and all the major strategicdecisions concerning plant investment andmodernization were made in Moscow and passed to Kievfor execution. The state guaranteed a supply offinancial resources, raw material, energy, andmachinery to run the facilities. After the collapseof the Soviet Union, central planning ceased, but thestate still owned the factories.  To help solve some of the endemic problems of theprocessing sector, the Ukrainian government has begunto privatize plants and seek foreign investment tohelp modernize the industry. As of the first half of1995, 31 beet factories were reportedly privatized,16 percent of the total. These sugar factories werefirst leased, then privatized. An additional 72factories have been leased. Since early 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament hasshifted away from leasing to a directopen-joint-stock company privatization method, withparticipation of sugarbeet farmers. Regulationsrequire a 51-percent majority ownership by sugarbeetfarmers. However, there have been some problems withthis approach due to a lack of "farmer privatizationcertificates." Moreover, there are some proposals torenationalize factories already privatized becausethe distribution of their shares does not correspondto the recent regulations set up by the Parliament,(i.e. farmers should hold at least 51 percent of theshares). Ukrainian State Certificates are documentsprovided by all Ukrainian state, private andcooperative enterprises to each employee in theseorganizations. Certificates are supposed to be ableto be sold for cash or traded for shares in otherenterprises. Some enterprise certificates are worthmore than others depending on the value placed on theenterprise's assets. Some enterprises and farms areprohibiting the use of certificates by theiremployees for purchase of assets in other than theemployer's enterprise. Also the problem has arisenthat often there are not enough farmers at collectivefarms with certificates to cover the required 51percent of the factory assets. A major stumbling block to privatization is that thegovernment has set the price of these "assets" toohigh and producers know it. Consequently, it is theirpreference to invest their certificates in paperassets rather than factories. Moreover, there is noincentive to own factories that are virtuallybankrupt nor is there any incentive to buy if growersand workers perceive that the government could bepersuaded to continue subsidization in one form oranother. Foreign companies have shown little interest, todate, in participating in joint ventures designed toprivatize beet factories. However, Ukraine is gettingsome foreign investment for its raw cane sugarrefiners. Tate and Lyle Inc. of the United Kingdom,has invested $15 million in a joint venture toupgrade the Odessa refinery. The plan is to increasesugar output from 750 tons per day to 1,500 tons. Oneattraction of the project is that under currentregulations, Tate and Lyle can avoid the RussianFederation's 25 percent import duty on refined sugarby supplying refined sugar made in the Ukraine fromimported raw sugar. Lack of foreign interest in Ukrainian processingplants re-enforces the notion that the asking priceis too high given the uncertainty of the businessclimate. Furthermore, given Russia's import dutyschedule for refined sugar, refining raw sugar couldbe the most profitable segment of the industry,depending on domestic sugar prices in Ukraine andRussia, hence the foreign interest in refineries. Marketing--Domestic Consumption and ExportsPer Capita Use Remains High USDA forecasts 1995/96 sugar consumption in theUkraine at 2.25 million tons, raw value, down 50,000tons from last year and 610,000 tons lower than theannual average for the late 1980's and early 1990's(1987/88-1990/91). For 1995/96, Ukraine's sugarconsumption is expected to account for 56 percent ofits production, not unlike the recent trend. AlthoughUkraine is consistently a surplus producer, thedownturn in sugar use also has come at a time ofdeclining production.Underlying the aggregate estimates are importantchanges in per capita use. Ukraine's sugarconsumption averaged over 50 kilograms, refined, percapita during the late 1980's, compared with 55 inthe EU and 20 worldwide during the period. The highper capita sugar use reflected heavily subsidizedprices to consumers. Since the early 1990's sugarconsumption has fallen more than 20 percent becauseof lower real income, higher prices, and increasedavailability of sugar-containing product imports. The sources of sugar demand in Ukraine differ fromwestern countries. Commercial food processing andother manufacturing account for about one-third oftotal sugar use, compared with two-thirds or more inthe United States. In Ukraine, retail sales andnoncommercial home use account for about two-thirdsof total use. For example, a large share ofnonindustrial use goes for home preservation offruits, berries, and vegetables. In addition,Ukrainians traditionally use sugar for homemade vodkaproduction. Some estimates show that about 5 percentof the total sugar consumption goes for homeproduction of alcohol in Kiev, with a higher figurein the countryside. In 1991, after the demise of the Soviet structure,the Ukrainian state sugar agency, Ukrsakhar, wascreated. Ukrsakhar is responsible for sugardistribution in domestic and export markets.Currently, Ukrsakhar issues shipping notices to sugarfactories for sugar to be procured under statecontract. Because both growers and processors are paid insugar, the amount remaining for disposal by the statehas been declining. Increasing shares of the sugarcrop are in the hands of farmers or processors on afree market basis. For example, the volume of freemarket sugar handled by farmers totaled nearly300,000 tons, refined value, in 1992; 600,000 tons in1993; and around 1.0 million tons in 1994. Thesedevelopments have created multiple domestic marketsfor sugar. World Ranking ExporterDespite the downturn in export availability in recentyears, Ukraine remains one of the world's largestbeet sugar exporters, and only the European Union islarger. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts that Ukraine willexport about 2.0 million tons, up 300,000 tons fromthe previous year, but down sharply from the 4.2million-ton-average achieved during 1987/88-1990/91.The exports are expected to be composed of about 1.5million tons of domestically produced beet sugar and300,000 tons of imported raw sugar refined forreexported sugar. Sugar exports account for about one-quarter ofUkraine's total agricultural exports, ranking secondonly to grains, which account for about one-half oftotal exports. Ukraine's other major agriculturalexport commodity is sunflowerseed. Of total beet sugar exports for 1995/96, 1.76 milliontons, or nearly 90 percent, are expected to beshipped to Russia and other republics of the FSU. Theremaining 10 percent is expected to be exported toneighboring countries. According to InternationalSugar Organization (ISO) statistics for 1994, Ukrainesupplied nearly 40 percent or 1.5 million tons of thetotal sugar imports of the FSU-12 and Baltic States.The Russian Federation, Belarus, Uzbekistan, andAzerbaijan were the major destinations in terms ofvolume. For several FSU republics--Azerbaijan,Belarus, Moldova, and Tajikistan--Ukraine accountedfor two-thirds or more of their sugar imports. Non-FSU markets for Ukraine in recent years haveincluded Bulgaria, Romania, and China. WithTurkey--Ukraine's major regional exportcompetition--shifting from a net exporter to a netimporter position this season due to a fall-off inproduction, Ukraine could capture an increased shareof the import markets in Albania, Romania, the formerYugosolvia, Iran, and Iraq, as well as Turkey. In1993 and 1994, Turkey exported 90,711 and 62,492tons, respectively, to the FSU-12 republics ofAzerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation, Tajikistan,and Uzbekistan. However, Ukraine likely will beunable to fill the void left by Turkey in 1995/96because of insufficient availability. USDA forecasts1995/96 sugar imports by FSU-12 (excluding Ukraineand Russian Federation) and Baltic States will totalabout 1.8 million tons, raw value. Ukraine's major trading partner has been Russia,which mainly trades oil for Ukraine's sugar.Traditionally, Ukraine has exported to Russia, theworld's largest sugar importer, a combination ofdomestically produced beet sugar as well as importedraw cane sugar refined in Ukrainian facilities.During the 1980's, around 2.0 million tons ofimported raw sugar were refined annually. This rawcane sugar, mainly of Cuban origin, was tolled inUkraine as part of the FSU's barter exchange of Cubansugar for Russian oil. In recent years, sugarrefining has been largely a commercial activity, withvolume depending upon the level of the refinedpremium--the difference between the prices of refinedand raw sugar. As table A-2 reveals, imports of rawsugar into Ukraine dropped sharply since the late1980's, reflecting the fact that the refined premiumhas generally not been high enough for toll refiningto be commercially viable. USDA expects Russia's sugar imports to increase from2.7 million tons in 1994/95 to about 3.0 million in1995/96. According to Russian Customs Committee data,in calendar year 1994, Russia imported 2.2 milliontons of sugar, of which Cuba accounted for 911,711tons or 42 percent and Ukraine 681,502 tons or 31percent. For the first half of 1995, (January-June),Russia's raw sugar imports from Cuba totaled 364,757tons, 59 percent of total raw imports. Ukraineprovided 508,439 tons of Russia's refined sugar, 81percent of the total of refined imports.Historically, Russia imported raw and refined sugarin about equal amounts, but the share of raw sugarhas increased in the last 3 years, with 1995/96 rawimports forecast at about 55 percent compared with 48percent in 1993/94. The reason for this change is ahigher import tariff for refined sugar (25 percent)compared with raw sugar (1 percent). Also since April1995, imports of refined sugar have been subject to a10-percent value-added-tax (VAT) and a special tax of1.5 percent. The VAT on raw sugar, however, is 20percent. However, the refined sugar import tariff of25 percent does not apply to other FSU republics suchas Ukraine. It is expected that 200,000 to 300,000 tons of rawsugar will enter Ukraine during 1995/96 for refiningand reexport. Under Ukraine's tolling and reexportregulations, imports of raw sugar for tolling have tobe re-exported within 90 days or be subject to theUkrainian import tax. Ukraine applies a 10-percentimport duty on either raw or refined sugar. A20-percent VAT is also applied to raw sugar imports,unless they are re-exported.Ukraine's sugar import flows are controlled byUkrsakhar under an import license system. Ukrsakharis also responsible for export deliveries againstintergovernmental agreements with other FSU republicsand for refined sugar exports from imported raw sugarbased on tolling contracts with international sugartrade houses. Export licenses are issued by theMinistry of Foreign Trade. Prospects for the FutureIndustry in TransitionUkraine's sugarbeet growers, processing sectorofficials, and government policy makers continue totry to bring greater economic incentives, productionefficiencies, and market reform to the country'ssugar industry. The outlook is uncertain with respectto production, consumption, trade, and thereorganization of the industry. Production--The data clearly point to a significantgulf between the technical performance of Ukraine'ssugar industry and those in Western Europe and theUnited States. While this indicates the generallypoor state of Ukrainian sugarbeet agriculture, itsuggests that with application of appropriatetechnologies (i.e. seed, fertilizers, chemicals) andfinancial support, Ukraine could increase sugarproduction. For example, assuming current area insugarbeet, a 15-percent increase in beet yields fromthe late 1980's level to 35 tons per hectare--stillwell below the level regularly achieved in westernEurope--would raise sugarbeet production to around 50million tons. Assuming average recovery rates for thepast four seasons of 12.7 percent, beet sugarproduction could total about 6.0 million tons, up bynearly 50 percent from recent levels.While a larger volume of sugarbeets would help thegeneral throughput problem of Ukraine's processingsector, the industry is clearly in need of capitalinvestment and restructuring. One plan mentioned withthis focus concerns the building of a 12,000 tonplant in Zhytomyr oblast and closing five smallnearby mills. There are several factors that are likely todetermine the direction of production over the nextfew years. On the positive side there are factorsthat would encourage an increase in Ukraine's sugarproduction. These include greater exportopportunities in Russia, other FSU countries, and theworld market. On the negative side there are factorsthat could cause further contraction. These includethe immense needs in capital investments, theincreasing energy costs of the processing sector, anda view that sugar production should be only largeenough to meet domestic consumption needs, andresources should be shifted to more remunerativecrops or activities. Consumption--Ukraine's per capita sugar consumptionremains high. However, high sugar prices and lowconsumer purchasing power are likely to continue tocurb demand growth until incomes improve. Ukraine'spopulation, now estimated at 52 million, is growingslowly, so no significant increase is foreseen intotal sugar consumption. What may change over time isa use pattern from one dominated directly byconsumers to one of greater consumption ofsugar-containing food products from an expandingwestern-style food processing industry. Trade--It is very likely that Ukraine could expandsugar exports if it is able to raise production.Assuming no change in consumption, production ofaround 6 million tons would leave an annualexportable surplus of around 4.0 million tons, thesame level achieved in the late 1980's. Markets areavailable to Ukraine both within the FSU and inneighboring countries. The magnitude of these exportswill depend ultimately upon such factors as theindustry's production costs, the price it receivesfrom world market sales, and the price it receivesfrom domestic sales. Moreover, the need to improvethe general quality of sugar for export will alsodetermine how competitive Ukraine will be ininternational markets. The role of tolling raw sugar for Russia is aquestion mark. Russia will remain a large importer ofsugar. Ukraine has sugar refinery capacity and adeveloped infrastructure for unloading raws andshipping refined products. The level of exports toRussia is likely to continue to depend onintergovernment agreements on fuel and sugar, theraw-refined price premimiun, and border taxes--suchas the waiving of the import tariff on refined sugarfrom other FSU countries.  Policy Reform--Ukraine's sugar industry faces manyunderlying structural problems that have not beenaddressed in the initial transition from the oldSoviet command economy. The privatization initiativeis an important first step for a long termdevelopment strategy. However, it remains to be seenwhether this launches a new restructuring processthat will encourage investment and improveavailability of some of the inputs and technologiesavailable to beet sugar industries in Western Europeand the United States. Unresolved is a comprehensive policy concerning thecountry's sugarbeet factories. To cut the high costof sugar production, a large number of the small, oldsugar factories with low efficiency would have to beclosed. However, a sizable shut-down of factorieswould increase rural unemployment. Clearly theprivatization and potential factory modernizationstrategies will be pivotal to the future vitality ofthe Ukrainian sugar industry. In addition, seemingcontradictions among different UkrainianParliamentary acts pertaining to enterpriseprivatization could seriously limit privatization ofUkrainian agricultural enterprises. Moreover, transition to a domestic market whereprices are based on supply and demand forces andpayments are made in currency is also essential.These programs and policies will not be easy toformulate or implement and the temptation to solvethe industry's underlying structural problems bygovernment intervention will remain strong.

Rain inthe southern Great Plains provided some relief towheat fields that were not already damaged from theextended dry weather. In Florida, brief durations ofbelow-freezing temperatures did negligible damage tocitrus trees.Low-volume irrigation continued in citrus groveswhere leaf curl and wilt were evident. Harvest oforanges for processing was active throughoutFlorida's citrus region. Freezing weather burned someof Florida's vegetable crops' leaves, but the extentof the damage had not been determined. In thesouthern Great Plains and the Delta States, minorinsect problems in small grains were reported in someearly wheat fields. Wheat in the Midwest was inmostly good condition before the snow arrived. A dryweek was welcomed in the Pacific Northwest where somestanding water remained in low-land fields from lastweek's storm. Light rainfall limited fieldwork innorthern California, while farther south, citrusgrowers continued to pick fruit.National Weather Summary Volume 82, No. 52 December17 - 23, 1995 For additional information, call (202)720-7917.Highlights:Quiet weather prevailed along the West Coast afterlast week's major storm, owing to the development ofa jet-stream split over the eastern Pacific. Energycoursing into the southern branch of the split jetspurred the development of a significant storm. Theearly- to midweek system eased drought in the centraland southern Plains, delivered heavy snow from theSouthwest to the Northeast, and dropped heavy rain onthe Gulf Coast States. In the storm's wake,temperatures showed a remarkable uniformity,resulting in above-normal readings in the North andbelow-normal values across the South. Early in theweek, 4 to 10 inches of rain fell from eastern Texasto northwestern Florida, causing widespread flashflooding and minor river flooding. Two-day (December17-18) totals reached 8.89 inches in Beaumont, TX,8.84 inches in Lafayette, LA, and 7.68 inches inMobile, AL.In addition to the heavy rain, severe weather,including more than a dozen tornadoes, raked theregion. Meanwhile, urgently needed precipitation fellacross the central and southern Plains. In Lubbock,TX, 0.45 inches of rain on Sunday ended a 75-day dryspell, leaving the city 2 days shy of itsFebruary-April 1972 all-time record. Dodge City, KSmeasured 0.48 inches (5.0 inches of snow),quadrupling their October 1 - December 15 total.Storm-total snowfall on the southern Plains, whippedby wind gusts in excess of 30 mph, reached 2.7 inchesin Amarillo, TX and 4.0 inches in Oklahoma City, OK.Las Vegas, NM reported a maximum depth of 7 inches.The northwestern half of the central Plains remainedcritically dry, however. In Tribune, KS, only 0.13inches of precipitation fell during the astronomicalautumn (September 23 - December 22), breaking arecord that had stood since 1939, when 0.18 inchesfell. Farther east, heavy rain fell as far north asthe lower Ohio River Valley, with heavy snow and iceaccumulations observed from the Midwest into theNortheast.December 18-19 snowfall topped 8 inches from centralIndiana to New England, driven bynorth-to-northeasterly wind gusts that reached 43 mphin Cleveland, OH (15.3 inches of snow) and 39 mph inIndianapolis, IN (8.0 inches). In Youngstown, OH, an11.6-inch total on Tuesday was their greatestsingle-day December snowfall. The storm boosted theastronomical-autumn snowfall to a record 25.4 inches(three times normal) in Harrisburg, PA. Elsewhere inthe Northeast, snowfall included 10.0 inches inBridgeport, CT, 15.0 inches at New York City's LaGuardia Airport, and 15.7 inches in Portland, ME.

Price gains fromNovember for corn, hogs, soybeans, and eggs more thanoffset price declines for broilers, turkeys, lemons,and lettuce. The seasonal changes in the mix ofcommodities farmers sell also can affect the overallindex level, but these changes were essentiallyoffsetting in December. Higher relative seasonalmarketings of wheat, tobacco, milk, and cotton offsetthe effect of relatively lower seasonal marketings ofcattle, corn, soybeans, and grapes. Compared withDecember 1994, the All Farm Products Index was 9points (9.2 percent) higher. Higher year over yearprices for corn, hogs, wheat, and soybeans more thanoffset lower prices for virtually all vegetables,cattle, and calves. Prices Received by Farmers The December All FarmProducts Index was 107 percent of its 1990-92 base,up 0.9 percent from November and 9.2 percent aboveDecember 1994. All Crops: The December index, at 117,was up 0.9 percent from November and 10 percent aboveDecember 1994. Higher grain, oilseed, and cottonprices in December more than offset lower vegetableprices.Oil-Bearing Crops: The index was 118, up 4.4 percentfrom November and 20 percent above one year ago.Higher prices for soybeans and peanuts more thanoffset lower prices for cottonseed and sunflowers.Soybean prices averaged $6.71 per bushel, up 32 centsfrom the previous month. Dry weather concerns inSouth America and good export demand are supportingprices.Food Grains: The December index, at 162, was up 3.2percent from the previous month and 33 percent aboveDecember 1994. Prices were higher for wheat and rice.The December wheat price averaged $4.92 per bushel,the highest since March 1974. Lower projected worldsupplies and good export demand are supportingprices.Feed Grains & Hay: The December index was 132, up 5.6percent from the previous month and 38 percent fromDecember 1994. Prices were higher for all feedgrains. The December corn price averaged $3.08 perbushel, the highest since August 1984. The Decembersorghum price averaged $5.66 per cwt, the highestsince November 1974. Tight supplies and strong exportdemand continue to support feed grain prices.Commercial Vegetables: The December index, at 93, was9 percent below November and 42 percent belowDecember 1994. Contributing most to the monthly indexdecline were lower prices for lettuce, celery, andtomatoes pressured by ample supplies.Fruit & Nuts: The December fruit and nuts index, at84, declined 13 percent from the previous month butwas 17 percent above December 1994. Price increasesfrom November for apples, grapes, oranges, andstrawberries were more than offset by the effect oflower grape marketings coupled with higher orangemarketings.Livestock & Products: The December index was 96, up2.1 percent from November and 6.7 percent above ayear ago. Higher hog and egg prices in December morethan offset lower poultry and cattle prices.Meat Animals: The December meat animals index, at 84,was up 2.4 percent from November and 1.2 percent fromDecember a year ago. The December hog price, at$44.30 per cwt, increased $4.40 from November and was$13.50 above the previous year. December weekly hogslaughter levels have been running 5-10 percent belowyear earlier numbers. December beef cattle pricesdropped slightly in December to $60.60, 10 centsbelow a month earlier and $3.80 below December a yearago.Poultry & Eggs: The December index was 118, down 1.7percent from November but up 15 percent from a yearearlier. Broiler and turkey prices declinedseasonally as demand typically increases for pork inDecember. Both broiler and turkey prices are athigher December levels than in recent years. Eggprices continued to climb on strong seasonal use andalso are considerably higher than recent year levels.Reliability of Prices Received by Farmers EstimatesDefinition: Prices received represent sales fromproducers to first buyers. They include all gradesand qualities. The average commodity price from thesurvey multiplied by the total quantity marketedtheoretically should give the total cash receipts forthe commodity.Survey Procedures: Primary sales data used todetermine grain prices were obtained from probabilitysamples of 2600 mills and elevators. These proceduresensure that virtually all grain moving intocommercial channels has a chance of being included inthe survey. Generally, States surveyed account for 90percent or more of total U.S. production. Livestockprices are obtained from packers, stockyards,auctions, dealers, and market check data fromAMS-USDA, private marketing organizations, and statecommodity groups and agencies. Inter-farm sales ofgrain and livestock are not included since theyrepresent very small percentages of the totalmarketings. Grain marketed for seed is also excluded.Fruit and vegetable prices are obtained from samplesurveys and market check data from AMS-USDA, privatemarketing organizations, state agencies, anduniversities.Summary and Estimation Procedures: Survey quantitiessold are expanded by strata to state levels and usedto weight average strata prices to a state average.State prices are then weighted to a U.S. price basedon expanded marketings. Recommendations are preparedby the State Statistical Offices and reviewed by theAgricultural Statistics Board in Washington, D.C.State recommendations are reviewed for reasonablenesswith survey data, other States, and recent historicestimates.Revisions: For most items, the current month's pricerepresents a 3-5 day period around the mid-month.Previous month's prices represent actual dollarsreceived for quantities sold during the entire month.Revisions are published in monthly issues of"Agricultural Prices" and in the annual summarypublished in July. A schedule of monthly revisions ispublished in the December issue of "AgriculturalPrices" and in the July annual summary.Reliability: U.S. price estimates generally have asampling error of less than one half percent for themajor commodities such as corn, wheat, soybeans,cotton, and rice. To assist users in evaluating thereliability of prices received estimates for majorgrain commodities, the "Root Mean Square Error" isshown in the table on the next page. The "Root MeanSquare Error" is a statistical measure based on pastperformance and is computed using the differencebetween first and final estimates. The "Root MeanSquare Error" for the 5-month corn price is 0.2percent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 thatthe current 5-month price of $2.47 per bushel willnot be above or below the final 5-month price by morethan 0.2 percent, or about half of a cent. Chancesare 9 out of 10 (90% confidence interval) that thedifference will not exceed 0.3 percent, or aboutthree-fourths of a penny.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)prohibits discrimination in its programs on the basisof race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age,disability, political beliefs, and marital orfamilial status.CONTACT: U.S. Department of AgricultureTel: +1 202 720-5446NASS Information HotlineTel: +1-800-727-9540e-mail: NASS@AG.GOV.M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

The 5.3% drop is small whencompared with the 16-3% recorded between 1994 and1993.  There was also a 4.6% increase in largercompany liquidations (from 16,335 to 17,280).  Thisis the first increase in company liquidations for thepast three years.More than 6,000 larger companies in London wereliquidated compared to 4,700 in 1994 an increase of28%.  This large increase was in pan compensated forby a 20% decrease in smaller business bankruptcies. But overall annual business failures in the capitalrose by 14%. NU Philip Mellor, D&B's Senior Analyst, said:"There are worrying signs in these figures thatcompany liquidations are beginning to rise again inthe North and Scotland as well as in London, For thepast nine months we have witnessed an increasingtrend in company liquidations in the capital whichhas now spread to other parts of the country.  Itremains to be seen in the coming months what impartthis will have on smaller companies."During the last quarter of the year the number ofbusiness failures in the North West increased by aquarter from W to 1,054 and in the North East theyincreased by 16% from 847 to 986, The disappointinglast quarter's figures meant there was little declinein the overall business failure rates in both theseregions during the year.In Scotland the business failure rate increased by22% but because the law relating to bankruptcy inScotland differs to that in England and Wales, novalid comparisons can be made between businessfailure rates in Scotland and those in the rest ofBritain. Wales emerges as the region of the country with thebiggest decrease in business failures.

Gross domestic product atfactor cost fell 0.3% in October, as domestic andforeign demand retreated. The drop left production0.3% below its most recent peak in January 1995. Theweakness was widespread, spanning several industrialsectors.Retailers suffered lower sales for a secondconsecutive month. The weakness in consumer spendingwas also evident in community, business and personalservices, as reflected in lower sales by lotterycorporations. Lower housing resales restrained growthin the finance group.Two sectors dropped the most: transportation andstorage services; and mining. These two sectorsaccounted for approximately 45% of the overalldecline. Wholesale trade and the output of utilitiesalso receded. Manufacturing production andconstruction activity were unchanged. Consumers reduced their spending once moreRetail sales fell 0.7% in October, after slipping0.3% in September. Sales dropped in 11 of the 18trade groups in October. Motor vehicle dealers postedlower sales for a second consecutive month; afterslowing in September, the number of new vehicles soldslumped 7.4% in October. Purchases of clothingcontinued to fall, while spending on furniture andhousehold appliances eased for a second month in arow.Note to readersThe gross domestic product (GDP) of an industry isthe value added by factors of production when thosefactors transform inputs purchased from otherindustries into output.Monthly GDP by industry is valued at 1986 prices. Theestimates presented here are seasonally adjusted atannual rates. Widespread decline in wholesale tradeWholesalers lost ground (sales fell 0.8%), aftergaining ground in August and September. As in retailtrade, sales of motor vehicles and parts and ofhousehold goods deteriorated. Lower sales ofmachinery and equipment and petroleum productsaccentuated the overall decline. By contrast, grainmerchants and wholesalers of farm machinery postedstrong gains.Mining sector slumpedAfter strengthening in each of the previous fourmonths, output in the mining sector fell 1.3% inOctober. Production of crude oil and natural gasdecreased 0.6%. Natural gas production, which droppedonly marginally, has remained at almost the samelevel since April 1995. With generally weak demand,the price of natural gas has fallen steadilythroughout 1995. Although demand for natural gascontinued to weaken on domestic markets in October,foreign demand has been firming up since August.Coal production dropped 2.8%, following peak levelsof production between July and September. In October,exports of coal returned to normal levels, but outputby thermal electric utilities fell sharply again.Less drilling activity and lower production in basemetal mines also contributed to the weakness in themining sector.Growth in manufacturing production pausedManufacturing production was unchanged in October,after improving during the previous three months.Output was still 1.0% lower than its peak in January1995. Production of primary metals and of electricaland electronic equipment fell the most. Manufacturersof paper and refined petroleum products also cuttheir output.Output in the wood industries continued to improve;some of the production-mainly lumber-was accumulatedin inventories. Elsewhere in the wood industries, arecent increase in the backlog of unfilled orders maysignal higher production in the coming months.Manufacturers of chemical, plastic and metalfabricated products were also among the producers whoraised output the most. Production of transportationequipment advanced despite a decline in motor vehicleassembly.Output of primary metals fell 3.6% in October. Theweakness reflected a 6.6% decline in smelting andrefining of non-ferrous metals; production of primaryaluminum was affected by a labour dispute. Lowernickel production accentuated the drop in the primarymetals industry.Production of electrical and electronic equipmentfell 1.7%, reflecting a sharp decline in productionof office machinery. The decrease coincided with asharp drop in exports of office machinery andequipment.Manufacturers of pulp and paper products wereresponsible for a 1.4% decline in the paper andallied products industries. Foreign demand for pulptumbled in October, while shipments of newsprint tothe United States fell significantly. Despite thestrong declines in exports, manufacturers of pulp andnewsprint maintained production and accumulatedinventories.Production of motor vehicle parts led a 0.8% gain intransportation equipment production. However, part ofthe production went into inventory, as motor vehicleassemblers reduced their demand. In October,production of motor vehicles fell in Canada and theUnited States. Production in the aircraft industrycontinued to gain momentum, however.Growth in transportation services easedGrowth in transportation and storage services eased(-1.5%), reflecting declines in air, rail and trucktransport. In rail transport, carloadings of mostcommodities fell-especially alumina, coal andcontainers-while carloadings of grain rosesubstantially. A 2.4% decline in the transportationof natural gas added to the overall weakness.Activity in construction remains uncertainActivity in construction was unchanged in October.Declines in home-building and non-residentialconstruction offset a gain in engineeringconstruction. Home-building fell 0.9%, due mainly toweakness in the construction of apartments.Construction of single dwellings inched ahead and,for the first time since June 1994, improved for twoconsecutive months. In October, the number ofbuilding permits issued rebounded, mainly formultiple dwellings. Activity on non-residentialbuilding projects fell marginally following stronggrowth during the summer months. In October, activityon industrial projects continued to rise, butactivity eased on commercial projects. Other industriesOutput in the finance group advanced 0.2%, afterslipping 0.2% in September. Real estate sales fell inseveral provinces for a second month in a row;however, advances by securities brokers, mutual fundsand stock exchanges were enough to offset the drop.The output of utilities fell a further 1.3%, asdemand for electricity and natural gas continued tosag.The October 1995 issue of Gross domestic product byindustry (15-001, $14/$140) will be released inJanuary 1996.Table: Gross domestic product at factor cost byindustry, at 1986 prices                       Oct. 1994    Aug.

Employmentincreased in business services and in finance,insurance and real estate, but declined in retailtrade and miscellaneous services. Since January 1995,businesses have added on average 12,000 employees totheir payrolls each month. This pace of growth was50% slower than in 1994. Since the beginning of theyear, employment gains have been led by community,business and personal services; manufacturers; andretail and wholesale trade establishments. Publicadministration was the only industry to report asubstantial employment decline during this period.Provincially, the gains in employment since thebeginning of the year have been focussed mainly inOntario and British Columbia; to a lesser extent,there have been gains in Quebec and New Brunswick.Table: Employment gains from January to October 1995Ontario                           51,000British Columbia                  41,000Quebec                            29,000New Brunswick                      8,000Employees' weekly earnings, after increasing by $4.75in August, have since remained stable. During thepast year, employees' earnings have increased by only$5.96 per week (+1.0%). During the same period, therate of inflation as measured by the consumer priceindex rose 2.4%.Higher than average earnings increases wereregistered for employees in finance, insurance andreal estate as well as mining, quarrying and oilwells. Employees in public administration and inlogging and forestry services saw their earningsdecline.Manufacturers maintained recent gainsManufacturers employed slightly more workers inOctober, maintaining the strong gains of the previoustwo months. This easing of employment growthcoincided with a dampening of manufacturers'shipments, a contraction in unfilled orders and anexpansion of inventories. Manufacturers have been oneof the stronger sectors maintaining growth in theeconomy in 1995. They have added 4,200 employees onaverage to their payrolls each month since January1995, compared with an average of 3,700 employees permonth in 1994. Average hours for manufacturingemployees paid by the hour have strengthened inrecent months, after following a declining trendsince the start of the year. Similarly, strongearnings growth in August and September wasmaintained in October, as earnings were unchanged.These recent gains more than offset the drop inearnings during the first seven months of the year. Growth stalled for retailersFollowing no change in September, the number ofemployees in retail trade fell by 11,000 in October.The recent movement in retail trade employment hasrun counter to the increasing trend observed sinceOctober 1994. It also coincides with retail sales,which fell in October after remaining stable inSeptember. The drop in retail employment and saleswas most evident in Ontario. Employees' weeklyearnings rose 0.4% in October to $346.06. Followingsubstantial monthly fluctuations, earnings in retailtrade returned to the April 1995 level.Fluctuations continued in miscellaneous servicesFluctuations in the number of employees inmiscellaneous services, which began in the fall of1994, continued in October with a decrease of 7,000employees. (Miscellaneous services includesamusement, recreation, personal, and householdservices, membership organizations and otherservices.) These strong monthly fluctuations leftemployment down slightly from its August 1994 peak.In October, the drop was concentrated in BritishColumbia, and affected mainly amusement andrecreation services.In October, weekly earnings for employees continued agrowth trend that began in April 1995. Averageearnings in miscellaneous services rose 0.8% inSeptember, to $394.45.Employment declined again in public administration,but at a slower pace The declining trend in public administrationemployment accelerated between January and July 1995.On average, this sector reduced employment by 3,000employees per month during this period. Since then,the rate of decline has slowed; the number ofemployees declined by only 700 since July. During thepast three months, declines continued in federal andprovincial administrations. These were partly offsetby increased employment in local administration.Weekly earnings for public administration employeeswere 0.6% less than in October 1994.Special trade contractors reduced employmentConstruction companies cut employment by 4,000 inOctober. The decline was concentrated among specialtrade contractors, who reduced their number ofemployees by 6,000.

The HCs have been dropped down manholes, flung fromthe roofs of speeding vans and even stolen.  Yet sofar, Thames has not lost any data as a result ofthese testing conditions. In 1991, Thames carried out a study into the newsystems the business needed to improve efficiency andquality of services.  It found three areas collectingwater and waste water samples, meter reading, andscheduling distribution work where portable computerswould help to streamline the process.  The companytalked to as many suppliers of handheld computers itcould find up to 30 and was impressively thorough. Psion met the three key criteria.  The first was thefunctionality of the HC series.  The second was themodularity of the Psion approach: applications andhardware options such as modems, bar code readers andmemory packs could be added easily.  And third wasvalue for money.   The Psion HC was the only productwe looked at that met all our selection criteria,'says Dr Mike Hanbury, manager of Business SystemsDivision, a group set up within Thames Water'sManagement Services Division.Thames has developed its own software for its fieldapplications.  In November 1991 it began work on theMobile Job Management System, the handheldcounterpart of an application that ruins on an IBMmainframe.  Essentially, it's a field engineermanagement system adapted for the water industry.  Itallocates work, such as checking for leaks and otherpossible problems. A customer agent at the Thames Customer Centre takesreports of leaks and other problems of supply, andraises a job on the mainframe if appropriate.  Thesystem allocates the job to a network servicestechnician, (the water board inspector of old).  Itis then downloaded to the technician's HC, eitherdirectly, or from a supervisor's HC in the field. The technician completes the job, and enters thedetails into the HC, from which they are transferredto the supervisor's HC.  The supervisor returns tothe depot, and uploads the details to the mainsystem.  Within 24 hours full details are on themainframe, so if the person who reported the. faultrings again, they can be told what has been done. The network services technician also collectsinformation from data loggers, supplied by Radcom,which record water flow rates in the mains forleakage control and similar data. Thames intends to transfer the data from the HC tothe mainframe over radio, an approach already used byother Psion clients such as Bass Leisure MachineServices for its field engineers.  "The things theBass engineers are doing in the field are obviouslytotally different, but there isn't much difference inthe approach," says Hanbury. Full roll-out of the Mobile Job Management System wascomplete by the beginning of this year, with 400technicians handling more than 4,000 jobs every day. Water sample collection, with software once againwritten by Hanbury's Field Information Systems team,went live in October 1993.  Used by water qualityinspectors, this system interfaces with TAPS theThames Advanced Pre-scheduling System.  Inspectorsenter details of the sample collection point, timeand date.  Bottles containing the samples are barcoded, and all internal bar code scanner in the HC isused to link the bottle to the record.  Eighty ofthese are now in use.70 Thames meter readers began to use HCs on 19 July1993.  The meter readers work from home, and use theHC's internal modem to get details from the depot ofnext day's 'walk' using their home telephones.  Onthe walk itself, they record meter readings and allyproblems.  Once home, they send this data to theThames customer information system, where it isavailable for billing and analysis.Thames is now looking at another application, itsPlanned Maintenance Services (PMS) system, formobile, paperless operation using the Psion HC.  Jobmanagement and planned maintenance are quite similar. "If you were there on day one, you would probablyonly build one system for both jobs, but they weretaken in as packages, serving different parts of thebusiness," says Hanbury.  "The PMS looks after fixedassets such as pumps and other electrical ormechanical systems."Mobile planned maintenance will be used by thoseservicing one of Thames' most exciting projects, theLondon Ring Main.  Longer than the Channel Tunnel anddeeper than London Under-round, this huge main has abore of between 100 and 125 inches. The relationshipbetween Psion and Thames is important to bothcompanies.  'Bearing in mind that we've now got morethan 600 units out there, it's very important to ourbusiness that we get the working relationship withthem right in terms of support, says Hanbury.  'It'simportant that if we have a hardware problem, Psionwill fix it and fix it fast.  But to date, we haven'thad a true hardware fault.The planned maintenance and job management systemsare good candidates for a mobile geographicalinformation system, using digitised large scale mapsof streets, mains, hydrants and manholes.  The PsionHCs have the potential to display maps should Thamesdecide to take this approach.CONTACT: Psion PLCTel: +44 (0)171 258 7248/9M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

We'll be round in thirty seconds(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTDRDATE:201295In the fast moving drinks market, having an edge overthe competition is vitally important.  In many cases,this means investing in the very latest technology. But new machines bring their own problems and boththe customer and the consumer have to be convinced ofthe benefits.Landlords or pub managers may find that more and moreof their keg technicians arrive armed with computersinstead of pen and paper.  HP Bulmer Limited were oneof the first to "go techno" equipping their staffwith the top selling Psion handheld range.  And thecustomers, initially reticent about the newtechnology, became swift converts to the new systemwhen they saw the benefits it could provide. Bulmer's IT Manager, Robin Flower, tells the story ofa moody landlord who phoned the telesales desk ofBulmer to ask for a Strongbow pump to be fitted inhis pub.  He put the phone down and saw a manstanding at the bar with a hand-held computer."Bloody yuppies," the landlord mumbled to himself andstrode forward to serve the computer-toting gent.`Good afternoon," said the man, "I'm from Bulmer.  Iunderstand you're looking for a Strongbow pump?"As the telesales staff had been typing in the detailsof the landlord's request, a keg technician 200 yardsup the road from the pub had been accessing thecompany's database at the same time from his Psionhandheld computer.  A coincidence?  Yes, but it showsthe customer service benefits computers can bring toa company. Bulmer are the world's largest cider manufacturer andthey hold 45% of the cider market in the UK. Strongbow and Woodpecker are the top two cider brandsrespectively and are served in some 60,000 pubs,clubs and bars.  The company's database which holdsall of this information is affectionately known atBulmer as the "pub universe".  This database containsvast quantities of information ranging from a retailoutlet's history right up to plans and profiles formarketing future products. With only 33 keg technicians to manage their 60,000outlets, the task of scheduling a day's work atBulmer was a huge one.  Apart from new installations,there are maintenance audits to be carried out.  Thesheer size of Bulmer's "pub universe" - they have GBP33 million worth of equipment in pubs and clubs -makes it very difficult to manage and there wereinstances where some of their equipment hadn't beenseen for over a year!Bulmers sought a technological solution to theproblem. "We are the No. 1 cider manufacturer in theworld," says Flower.  "We want to stay one step aheadof the pack to remain No. 1. With the Psion handheldcomputer the whole scheduling process has beensimplified and streamlined, and the "pub universe" isput to much better use." Nowadays there is no need for keg technicians to makecostly phone calls to the office to find out theirnext jobs.  Using the Psion and a modem, up to threedays work can be scheduled, including suggested waysto get there.  These more flexible routes not onlystart and end as close to the technician's home aspossible, but have allowed the scheduling of spotaudits to check up on the company's "missing"equipment. The benefits of using the "Keg Technician System" aregreater efficiency leading to cost savings.  "Withbetter journey planning and scheduling, Bulmer's kegtechnician's call rate has increased from five tonine calls daily and as a result, Bulmers can nowprovide better customer service," Flower continues. Further benefits have been due to more regular auditsin the field helping reduce Bulmer equipment lossesfrom 10% to 7% per year.Overall, Bulmer's has saved an estimated GBP 1m sofar on its investment of GBP 250,000 and is expectedto save a potential GBP 3m in total by using thePsion "Keg Technician System".CONTACT: Psion PLC Press OfficeTel: +44 (0)171 258 7248/9Fax: +44 (0)171 258 7340M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

BLit behind the brightlights, whirring reels and endless "nudges" lies ahighly sophisticated business. One of the majorplayers is Bass Leisure Management Systems (BLMS),part of the Bass drinks group.  They have 42,000machines spread across 10,000 sites and every week400 of their staff count a staggering GBP 3 millionin cash from machines all around the country. Traditionally, when the cash was collected, the splitbetween BLMS and the pubs had to be calculatedmanually.  "This process was open to errors as largeas 25 per cent," said Mike England, Computer ServicesManager at BLMS.  "We felt the answer was to automatethe collection system." BLMS examined some of thefinest high tech solutions available and chose thePsion HC.At the user end, the BLMS system consists of a smallhand-held terminal - no bigger than a calculator withan in-built modem - and a till-roll printer with aspecially designed case. Information about themachines to be visited and the terms and conditionswhich apply to them is downloaded each night to a PCat the BLMS depot.  The collectors then transfer thisinformation onto their Psion terminals eitherdirectly from the PC or via the telephone. Collectedinformation is then up-loaded to the computer in thesame way. The immediate benefit was to the collectors. Chrissie Holt, the first collector to use tile systemsaid: "Psion have made our jobs so much easier. Everything we do now is self- explanatory.  We cannow do more work, cover more machines and it is mucheasier to get things right first time!"The biggest benefit to BLMS is cost savings with theinitial investment being recouped within two yearsbut other pluses have emerged also.  Psion terminalsprovide managers with important information onefficiency and we are able to identify problems earlyand take appropriate action, for example, byproviding further training." The full benefits for BLMS are yet to come.  As wellas speeding up the process, it will produce costsavings of GBP 80,000 a year on stationery alone.

An increasing part of research anddevelopment vocabulary, the use of acronyms helpsreduce long-winded terminology and enables complexideas to be contained in simple phrases.  However,where acronyms come together in large numbers, theaim of offering simplicity is often overturned andthe meaning of the information can become confused.'European Union R&D Acronyms' is a single desktopreference tool for those wanting to know more aboutEU RTD activities.  It is a facet of the EU'scommitment to spreading the message about itsresearch activities and opening up information to anever-increasing target audience.  The intention is toensure that as many people as possible have access tothe core information about EU research, to encourageexploitation of results and participation in currentprogrammes. Within the dictionary the 4,900 entries are explainedin alphabetical order.  The entry for each acronymalso identifies the originating body and the generalprogramme area to which the acronym belongs.  Thisextra information helps set the acronym in contextand provides a clearer idea of the background to theproject or programme to which the acronym refers. Users can not only establish the meaning of anacronym but can ascertain the wider context impliedby its use. The dictionary is based on the information held inone of the databases of CORDIS, the CommunityResearch and Development Information Service which isoperated under the European Union's InnovationProgramme.  It also serves as a means to alertpotential users to CORDIS and the other informationproducts offered by this service.  For existing usersof CORDIS the dictionary also offers a conciseexplanation of the various subject codes found in thedatabases and can thus be used as part of the queryforming process when interrogating CORDIS. Absolutenewcomers to EU RTD are recommended to register withCORDIS for a more complete and current informationresource, although the content of 'European Union R&DAcronyms' has a potential value for everyoneinterested in this area of activity.'European Union R&D Acronyms' is published by theOffice for Official Publications of the EuropeanCommunities at a price of ECU 25 and is availablefrom all the Office's sales agents in EU membersstates and worldwide.CONTACT: Office for Official Publications of theEuropean CommunitiesTel: +352 29 29-1Fax: +352 48 85 73M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

The share of viewing taken by cable andsatellite channels increased between October 1994 andOctober 1995 from 34.9% to 39.6%, while BBC1's sharefell from 24.3% in 1994 to 21.2% in 1995.  Viewingshares remained fairly constant for ITV and BBC2 overthe two years but Channel 4's share also fell by onepercentage point.Sky One remained overall the most popular cablechannel, with a share of 4.8% although this share hasfallen from 6.6% recorded in 1994 and 9.6% in 1993. Indeed, in the league table of audience shares (table1) Sky One dropped to third cable place for the firsttime behind the Movie Channel (5.8%) and Sky Movies(5.2%) within homes receiving these channels.1995 has been a successful year for cable andsatellite channels targeted at the child audience. Children's viewing of cable and satellite channels asa whole accounts for over half of their total viewing(54.4% of 2 to 15 year olds viewing in October 1995compared to 47.3% in October 1994).  The preferencefor the "new" channels is even more pronouncedamongst the younger age groups with viewing of cableand satellite channels accounting for 63.9% ofviewing amongst 2 to 9 year olds.  Most notably, theviewing share for the Cartoon Network has risenacross all individuals from 2.0% in 1994 to 4.5% in1995.Amongst 2 to 9 year olds this share reaches 30.5%.The recently launched Disney Channel accounts for1.8% of total viewing rising to 6.2% of allchildren's viewing (2 to 15 year olds), and 10.1% ofthe younger age group (2 to 9 year olds).  TheChildren's Channel, one of the longest running cableand satellite channels. now re-launched as TCC, alsofared well in 1995.  Viewing shares amongst allindividuals doubled (from a 0.6% share in 1994 to a1.3% share in 1995), while amongst children (2 to 15year olds) this share rose to 5.1% of all viewing.Other key results from the study are:* The proportion of viewers with 2 or more decoders,giving television sets in different rooms access tothe range of cable channels, increased from 28.4% in1994 to 34.8% in 1995.  This benefits the morespecialised channels which may appeal to individualmembers of the family.  Thematic channels such as theMovie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and The CartoonNetwork, achieved greater audience shares in homeswith multiple set connections.  This increased boththe total amount of viewing in those homes, by 2.8hours a week per viewer, and the cable and satelliteshare, which rose to 41.9% compared to 38.3% insingle connection homes.* Viewers in higher socioeconomic groups continue toremain lighter viewers of cable and satellitechannels although this characteristic has become lesspronounced (a 33.2% share amongst AB viewers in 1995,compared with a 24.1% share in 1994).  Cable andsatellite channels disproportionately favoured by ABviewers in 1995 were Sky One, Sky Sports andNickelodeon.* The socio-economic difference in viewing patternshas become less marked over the years.  The heavyskew towards DE viewing of cable and satellitechannels has declined from 54.1% in 1993 to 34.7% in1994 and 38.1% in 1995 compared to an overall averageviewing of 39.6% in 1995.  DE viewers watchedproportionally more of Sky Movies, The Movie Channel,UK Gold, The Cartoon Network and The Disney Channel.* The amount of self-reported time spent viewingtelevision in broadband homes overall has decreasedslightly to an average of 25.13 hours per week in1995, compared to 25.32 in 1994.  Amongst childrenthis tendency has been dramatically reversed withoverall viewing amongst 2 to 15 year olds increasingfrom 19.95 hours in 1994 to 22.47 hours in 1995. This is largely accounted for by increased viewing ofchild-friendly channels such as The Cartoon Network,The Disney Channel and TCC, together with thecontinued appeal of Nickelodeon.* The level of expressed satisfaction with cabletelevision services remains very high overall,although slightly lower than in 1994 (86.4% said theywere very or quite satisfied/pleased with theservices in 1995, compared with 87.2% in 1994). Satisfaction is higher amongst viewers in homessubscribing to premium channels, with 92.3% ofrespondents in homes receiving all three Sky MovieChannels plus Disney stating that they were very(32.1%) or quite (60.2%) pleased with the service.Technical NotesThe ITC's study was undertaken by ContinentalResearch over a two week period in October.  It wasbased on a total of 1,306 one- week diaries derivedfrom 653 respondents aged 2 years old and overrepresentative of broadband cable viewers in 39 cablefranchises in different parts of the country.  Thediaries covered the two weeks from Monday 16 Octoberto Sunday 29 October 1995.This is the latest in a series of similar studies,conducted by Continental Research for the CableAuthority in 1990 and for the ITC in 1991, 1992, 1993and 1994.  The ITC plans to publish a review of thesestudies early in 1996.Tables giving more detailed information are attached.

TheCommunity has long recognised their importance forcreating employment and stimulating growth.  Indeed,the Treaty on European Union makes a specificcommitment to "encouraging an environment favourableto initiative and to the development of undertakingsthroughout the Community, particularly small andmedium-sized undertakings". The best way for the Community to stimulateentrepreneurs and businesses is by improving andsimplifying the environment in which they operate. They need an environment which a@lows them to becompetitive in world markets, particularly vis a visthe US, Japan and the fast-emerging economies of theFar East. The Commission has drawn up a report' which gives acomprehensive view of the measures taken at EU levelto improve the business environment and to supportthe development of small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs).  The report also looks at collaboration withthe Member States, professional organisations andother European institutions.IMPROVING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTA recent study from the European Observatory for SMEshas estimated that the total annual costs ofadministrative burdens for business in Europe werebetween 180-230 billion ECUs, the equivalent of 3-4%of EU GDR There is therefore a serious economic costwhich needs to be reduced. Assessing the impact of legislation on small businessThe role of DG XXIII at the Commission, which is incharge of enterprise policy, is to ensure that theCommission is taking appropriate account of theimpact on enterprises, and in particular smallbusinesses, of any legislative proposals.  Accountmust be taken not only of the compliance costs andother burdens of a regulation but also theadministrative procedures or requirements which stemfrom it.! Where appropriate, a business impactassessment is undertaken which involves fullconsultation and the setting out of often conflictinginterests of different business sectors.The fiscal environmentThe Commission has identified three priority problemsfor small businesses as far as their fiscal positionis concerned: their capacity to attract adequatefinancial resources, their capacity to respond toadministrative complexity and finally the problem ofchange of proprietor.  A Recommendation on thetaxation of SMEs aims to ensure greater equity in thefiscal treatment of retained or reinvested profitsbetween sole traders, partnerships and limitedcompanies and to lift the fiscal obstacles in thetransformation from sole trader or partnership tolimited company.  The Commission has also beenworking on the transfer of ownership of SMEs. The financial environmentAmongst the initiatives to improve the financialenvironment, a Round Table of bankers and smallbusinesses has been set up to improve small businessaccess to finance.  A Recommendation on payment termsfor commercial transactions aims to combat delays inpayment and a Directive has been proposed oncross-border payments.  Directives on insurance havebeen adopted which simplify the conditions of accessto insurance markets as well as the operatingconditions.  Two new financial instruments have beenput in place: subsidised loans for job-creating SMEsand the European Investment Fund, (see below). The Internal MarketEfforts to improve the business environment are alsounder way in other policy areas.  In general, theInternal Market is seen as having a positive effecton the business environments of small business.  Itis seen as providing a stimulus to overall demand andbusiness development and allowing for a reduction inaverage production costs as a result of mark-etexpansion.  On the other hand, it has led to keenercompetition and greater pressure on costs and priceas factors in competitiveness.  It may lead to acertain, amount of restructuring in the short-runwhile the positive effects materialise in the mediumto longer-term. CompetitionSMEs have been freed from unnecessary administrativeburdens with exemptions and special regulations incompetition policy.  As far as state aid isconcerned, the Commission's traditionally favourableattitude to state aid for SMEs was formalised by theadoption in 1992 of a specific framework, to bereexamined in 1995.  This framework provides MemberStates with the option of granting aid, withincertain set limits, designed to encourage investmentby SMEs and to encourage them to improve theircompetence through advice and information.  MemberStates are dispensed from notifying the Commission ofvery small sums of aid which it considers to have anegligible impact on trade between Member States andon competition. Energy policyThe Union's energy policy has a direct effect on thedevelopment and Operation of SMEs since itsobjectives are to meet the needs of individual andindustrial users at less cost and under circumstanceswhich ensure security of supply and environmentalprotection.  The availability of energy at bestprices and on the best terms is a determining factorin strengthening the overall competitiveness of theeconomy and of SMEs in particular. Environmental policyIn November 1994, the Commission presented aCommunication on Economic Growth and the Environmentwhich underlines the need for market-basedinstruments in the area of environmental policies,such as eco- labelling, tax rebates for greeninvestments etc.  The idea is for companies to beable to integrate environmental considerations intheir policies in a more flexible way.PROGRAMMES AND SUPPORT MEASURESA large part of Community support comes throughfinancial instruments, in particular the StructuralFunds, as well as Community programmes, such as theresearch and vocational training programmes. Financial instrumentsThe European Investment Bank (EIB)The EIB finances large-scale investments throughindividual loans and modest investments, inparticular those of small businesses, indirectlythrough its global loans.  Those global loans areconcluded with financial intermediaries operating atthe national, regional or even local level.  Thisputs the EIB in a position to support smallerinvestments which it would not be able to finance byindividual loans, for reasons of managementefficiency.  The field of application of global loanshas been progressively increased in order to adapt tothe development of needs and the diversification ofCommunity policies.  They usually concern investmentsof small businesses in industry, services (notablytourism and agriculture) and small-scaleinfrastructure projects contributing to Communityobjectives in the areas of regional development,environmental protection, energy or transport.In 1994 the EIB concluded global loans totalling ECU3.281 million and credits on current global loansamounted to ECU 2.763 million. 60% of this amount wasdevoted to supporting SMEs, 90% of which employedless than 50 people.  Since 1990 the EIB has providedsignificant support to the financing of SMEs.  Nearly36,000 have benefited from credits in a total of overECU 9.4 billion.  Over 80% of them are enterprisesemploying less than 50 people and 90% less than 250people. The EIB will now not only accelerate the financing ofinfrastructure but it will also help job-creatingSMEs. The SME facility: subsidised loans for job-creatingSMEsA mechanism for interest subsidies relating to ECU 1billion in global EIB loans in favour of smallbusinesses was approved in April 1994 by the Councilof Ministers.  The interest subsidy of 2% per year isapplied for five years on a maximum loan amount ofECU 30,000 per job created.  The SME facility shouldallow 30,000 jobs to be created.  The mechanism wasimplemented in September 1994 and by the end of April1995, 48% had been allocated to some 2,100 businessesand more than 23,000 new jobs are planned. 96% of thevolume of loans was granted to SMEs with less than250 employees.The European Investment Fund: loan guarantees forSMEsAt the Edinburgh Council in 1992, it was decided tocreate a European Investment Fund (EIF) aimed atgranting loan guarantees for projects relating totrans-European networks! and for small business.  TheEIF concentrates its attention on those areas whereit can be complementary to existing sources offinance.  It offers two main types of financialproducts, financial guarantees and equity.  Theinitial ceiling on the overall commitments of theFund has been set at 3 times its subscribed capitalbut this may be raised at a later stage once adequatereserves have been established.  The Fund will workthrough appropriate financial intermediaries in theMember States rather than providing direct guaranteesto individual SMEs. Structural FundsRegional initiativesOn average 10% of the total resources of the EuropeanRegional Development Fund are devoted specifically tomeasures dealing with the promotion and improvementof the economic environment of SMEs.  Funds go toencouraging demand for services from small businessesas well as to the supply of services to them. A so-called SME Community initiative, allocated ECU 1billion for 1994-99, aims to contribute to theinternationalisation of small businesses and topromote improvements in their competitiveness. Seven priority areas have been identified:improvement of production and organisation systems;environment and rational use of energy; cooperationwith research centres; access to new markets;cooperation networks; strengthening vocationalqualifications and improved access to the financialsystem. Twelve other Community initiatives also contribute tothe development of small businesses.  Amongst theseare REGIS which is concerned with the most peripheralregions of the EU, RETEX which is designed to assistenterprises in the textiles sector, URBAN whichtargets urban areas and ADAPT which helps the labourforce to respond to the changing needs of the labourmarket.Other innovative forms of Community support includeglobal development subsidies.  These were introducedin 1988 and are granted to an intermediary body forcarrying out a territorial development strategy whichit negotiates with the Commission and implementsunder its own responsibility.  Between 1988-1993, 31agreements were established for a total combinedamount of ECU 687 million. Social fundingRecognising that small businesses are a major sourceof new employment, the Commission aims to encourageentrepreneurial activity to stimulate the creation ofmore SMEs.  The European Social Fund (ESF) has threepriorities: to improve education and initialtraining; to increase competitiveness and preventunemployment by adapting the workforce to change withcontinuing training; and to improve the employmentopportunities of the long-term unemployed.The promotion of a more systematic approach tocontinued training is planned to involve about ECU 6billion during 1994-1999, or some 14% of total SocialFund allocations. Other fundsSmall businesses benefit from other Funds, such asthe Agricultural Funds and they are principalbeneficiaries of Community structural interventionsin favour of fisheries. Research and technological development (RTD)Increased efforts are being made to facilitate theparticipation of SMEs in Community researchprogrammes. Under the 3rd Framework Programme(1990-94) a total of 6368 small businessesparticipated in RTD programmes with a budgetarycommitment of ECU 1035 million or 22% of the totalCommunity financial commitment.Within the Brite-Euram Programme (Industrial andMaterials Technologies) the Commission introduced twoschemes specifically for small businesses: thefeasibility awards which are aimed at SMEs with RTDcapacity who wish to play a major role in a largemulti-partner project and CRAFT which targets thosewith little or no RTD means, enabling them to engagethird parties to carry out RTD work on their behalf.80% of SMEs taking part in CRAFT are total newcomersto EU RTD and 50% have no previous RTD cooperationexperience at all. About 920 separate SMEs participated in theInformation Technology programme ESPRIT III, with abud-et of ECU 1532 million for the period 1991-94. They carry out about 31% of the total of the relevantwork of the programme, up from 21% during theprevious programme.  In the next programme, runningfrom 1994-98, participation of SMEs will be furtherencouraged.The VALUE programme is aimed at promoting the spreadand effective use of results of scientific andtechnological research in order to strengthen thecompetitiveness of European industry.  SMEs have beeninvolved in 69% of the projects as contractor, 39% aspartner and 38% as participant. Under the fourth Framework Programme special budgetshave been allocated within the different programmesfor specific SME measures totalling over ECU 700million, or 9% of the total budget of theseprogrammes.  In addition, SMEs will participate inother actions within the mainstream researchprogrammes. SPRINT aims to stimulate innovation and technologytransfer, particularly in small businesses. Altogether 162,600 SMEs have benefited from theSPRINT programme, either by purchasing, testing orkeeping informed of the new technologies.EUROTECH CAPITAL is an initiative to encourage thefinancing by private capital of high technologytransnational projects.  In 1994 the Eurotech capitalnetwork comprised 13 members, covering the majorityof Member States, who had undertaken to invest atotal of ECU 202 million. From 1974-1989 half of the projects under the THERMIEenergy programme involved SMEs in a total of 2450projects representing ECU 1.2 billion of financialsupport.  The THERMIE programme for 1995-1998 givesfinancial support to projects implementing innovativeenergy technologies and to a whole series ofcomplementary activities including technologicalstimulation of SMEs. While more than half the funds from the EURETprogramme, which supports research in transport, hasgone to large enterprises, SMEs come second amongbeneficiaries with 19% of the budget and 25% of thenumber of participants.Vocational trainingIn addition to the resources from the European SocialFund (some ECU 20 billion for the period 1989-1993),there are a number of programmes aimed at raising thelevel of qualifications throughout the Community,such as EUROTECNET, COMETT, FORCE and PETRA.  Theseprogrammes were completed at the end of 1994 andreplaced by the LEONARDO programme which will runfrom 1995-99. The EUROTECNET programme aimed to promote innovationin vocational training resulting from technologicalchange and 18% of projects from 1990-94 targetedSMEs.The COMETT programme encouraged intra-Communitycooperation between university and business in thefield of technologies, particularly advancedtechnologies.  About 75% of enterprises involved aspartners in one or more COMETT projects were smallbusinesses and 80% included at least one smallbusiness.  Alto-ether it is estimated that 40,000SMEs will have benefited directly from COMETT II(1990-94), including at least 15,000 which havereceived students on placements from differentcountries.  As far as continuing training isconcerned, it is estimated that 200,000 smallbusiness employees have taken a training course orare using training materials. Furthermore, over 1000SME intermediary organisations, such as chambers ofcommerce or trade associations have participated inthe COMETT partnerships with a multiplier effect onsmall businesses. FORCE had the objective of encouraging enterprises,particularly small ones, to invest in continuingvocational training.  Between 1991-93 2,250 smallbusinesses or groups of small businesses participatedin this programme as partners in more than two thirdsof the projects, directly or indirectly. The LEONARDO programme (1995-99) takes up three maintypes of trans-national cooperation measures of theearlier programmes: pilot cooperation projects,exchange programmes and surveys and analysis.  Itincludes an important innovation in that all measuresshould have a trans-national character and a strongeraccent is put on disseminating and analysing theresults.Environmental programmesOut of 99 projects co-financed in 1993 under the LIFEfinancial instrument for the environment, it isestimated that 43 involved small businesses,receiving 38% of the total granted. A number of actions have been pursued to help informsmall businesses about improving health and safety. The Commission has drawn up a document on riskassessment in the workplace with one partparticularly devoted to small businesses.  Aself-audit method for health and safety at work hasbeen prepared to help heads of SMEs to do theirassessments.  A conference entitled "Taking risks andworking safely" was principally geared towards smallbusinesses and the European Agency for Health andSafety at Work, which should come into operation in1995, will pay particular attention to the specialproblems of SMEs.  A proposed programme called SAFE(Safety Action for Europe) will support projects topromote improvements in safety, hygiene and health atwork, to improve work practice and to influenceattitudes in order to reduce accidents andoccupational diseases. The information marketThe IMPACT programme(1991-95), targeting the singlemarket for information services, has undertakenseveral actions in favour of small businesses.  In1994 it implemented over 700 actions on awareness andpromotion of electronic information services.  Smallbusinesses need advanced methods of access to andprocessing of information to become and remaincompetitive.  Also the productive industry ofelectronic information services is itself largelycomposed of small businesses.Out of the 160 contracts under the TEDIS programme(Trade Electronic Data Interchange Systems) half ofthe prime contractors are SMEs.  TEDIS promoteselectronic data interchange (EDI) standards and hasdeveloped a network of 40 centres in various Europeanregions to stimulate the knowledge and use of EDI tohelp small businesses.  TEDIS is also active inseveral international cooperative ventures. Providing information for businessThe network of Euro-Info Centres (EICs) providesinformation for businesses in their region on thevarious Community programmes and policies.  EICs haveplayed an important role in providing information onpublic tenders and on research and technologyprogrammes.  The information and advice mission ofEICs puts them in a special position to understandthe actual problems encountered by SMEs inimplementing legislation or in participating incertain programmes.  The Commission thereforeconsults them directly or asks them to carry outspecific studies based on questionnaires circulatedto the SMEs in their region. Promoting businesscooperation and partnershipThe Business Cooperation Network (BC-NET) wasestablished to encourage an awareness of increasingbusiness opportunities across Europe.  Its primarytask is to help identify other business partners. Other initiatives to promote business cooperation andpartnership include the Business Communication Centre(BCC) and the Europartenariat and Interpriseprogrammes.  Europartenariat establishes contactsbetween SMEs in different regions of the Community sothat they can conclude technical, commercial andfinancial agreements. The European Enterprise and Innovation Centres(EEICs), launched in 1984, are public/privatepartnership structures which identify and selectentrepreneurs and projects which offer the mostcomplete range of services to enterprise andaccompany the firm during the start-up period.  Thereare 70 fully operational EEICs throughout the EUwhich have contributed to the creation of more than2,800 businesses representing 16,000 direct jobs.Pilot schemesA number of pilot schemes are being undertaken by theCommission in areas such as access to research andtechnological development, access to publiccontracts, standardisation and certification,commerce and distribution and the craft sector andsmall businesses.  The Commission will be supportingthe creation of 7 cross-border offices to help thecraft sector and small businesses developcross-border activities and overcome existingbarriers.Following an audit of 842 small businesses, a reportproduced by AFNOR (Association Francaise pournormalisation) showed that the principles of thesingle market and standardisation are generally verypoorly understood because of difficulties gettingaccess to information and because of the lowparticipation rate of SMEs in the work on European,or even national, standards.  Small businesses havedifficulty formalising their quality procedures andoften make over-complex interpretation$ of standardsand set up cumbersome and expensive systems.  Asregards certification, there is still much work to bedone in completing the single market, in particularon mutual recognition.  SMEs are often unfamiliarwith EC markings and see the cost of obtainingcertificates as a problem.The Commission launched a pilot scheme in 1989 tostimulate the creation of start-up capital funds.  Ithas supported the establishment of 23 start-up fundswhose aim is to make capital available to firms whichare in the embryonic stage of existence and whichhave great difficulty obtaining this on the market. Another pilot programme, Commerce 2000, aims toencourage cooperation between small businesses byestablishing modern methods of management and newtechnologies. 52 feasibility study projects and 6pilot projects were selected in 1994, the results ofwhich should become available in the course of 1995. The Community has a multi-annual programme of workfor cooperatives, mutual societies, associations andfoundations in the EU.  The programme provides aformal framework for EU action and aims to preservediversity in the sector, to encourage solidarity andto help cooperative enterprises to respond toeconomic development and social progress.With a view to improving the available statisticalinformation, Eurostat, the EU's statistical off ice,in conjunction with national offices, has begun tocollect all the financial information available onenterprises in order to highlight the importance ofsmall business for production and employment.  Inconjunction with DG XXIII, Eurostat has published atregular intervals its report "Enterprises in Europe"which contains detailed information by sector ofeconomic activity and by payroll size on all theenterprises in the EU. International cooperationProgrammes have been set up to stimulate and supportcooperation between enterprises in the EU and thosein EFTA countries, Central and Eastern Europe, theformer Soviet Union and Georgia, Asia, Latin Americaand the Mediterranean.In the context of the PHARE programme, the Commissionhas supported the development of SMEs by providingtechnical assistance in many countries.  Between1990-93 the EU made a contribution of ECU 320 millionto countries of Central and Eastern Europe.Within the framework of TACIS, which fosters linksbetween the EU and the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS) and Mongolia, ECU 19 million has beenallocated to support small businesses in 1992, ECU 20million in 1993 and ECU 12 million in 1994, a totalof ECU 51 Million.  The programme has been based onthe need to build up intermediary agencies to provideassistance to existing entrepreneurs and those whowish to set up businesses.MEDINVEST is a programme to support the developmentof small businesses in Mediterranean countries andhas a budget of ECU 12.2 million for 1993-95. ALINVEST, with a budget of ECU 18.5 million, aims tofacilitate commercial exchanges, technology andknow-how transfer and financing to the mutual benefitof Latin American and European enterprises.The ECIP (European Communities Investment Partners)is a financial instrument for the developingcountries of Latin America, Asia and theMediterranean which facilitates the creation of jointenterprises.  The orientation of the ECIP scheme istowards SMEs.Initiatives to develop contacts between SMEs are alsounderway with China and Japan.  Given the importanceof the private sector for the development of African,Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, the Fourth LomeConvention provides for a vast range of instrumentswhich can be used to support SMEs in those countries. A large part of these programmes are also of director indirect interest to European SMEs. COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATIONConsultation with business organisationsThe Commission regularly consults and informsassociations representative of small businesses, thecraft sector and commerce at the European level onCommunity activities specifically directed towardsthem as well as on all subjects that may concernthem, like the Structural Funds, RTD programmes andlegislative proposals.  In return, theseorganisations inform the Commission of their opinionand a good partnership is established which allowsthe viewpoints of business to be taken into account. In the commerce and distribution sector theCommission systematically consults the Committee onCommerce and Distribution, which was created in 1981. Social dialogueThe Agreement on Social Policy which forms part ofthe Maastricht Treaty requires new procedures forconsultation with the social partners as well asconditions by which these collective agreements areconcluded. The list of social partner organisationsincludes the European Association of Crafts, Smalland Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), amongstothers.  The Commission has been in contact during1994 with numerous organisations expressingparticular interest in SMEs, both at theinter-professional level and at the sectoral level. The commerce and distribution sector, over 90% ofwhich is mad up of enterprises with less than 10people, is represented by EUROCOMMERCE.  TheCommission has also enlarged its consultation to takeinto account the needs of SMEs in the implementationof the Structural Funds. Partnership with Member StatesBy mutual consultation and cooperation between theMember States and between the Member States and theCommission it is hoped that actions can be targetedat SMEs so that their potential for growth andemployment can be better mobilised.Collaboration with the other institutionsThe European Parliament has emphasised that theIntegrated Programme in favour of SMEs and the CraftSector' is the result of the good collaboration thatit maintains with the Commission and that there isnow a global commitment and a strategy towards smallbusinesses.  It has also created anInter-Parliamentary Group on commerce anddistribution.The Economic and Social Committee proposes carryingout an evaluation of the effectiveness of existingmeasures and an institutional strengthening,according the political weight necessary to implementCommunity policy in favour of SMEs.The Committee of the Regions emphasises theimportance of coordination between the Communityprogrammes so as to facilitate access for SMEs andthe craft sector to research and training programmes. This is to be achieved by information, asimplification of procedures, greater participationof SME representative organisations and adecentralisation of measures to the regional or locallevel. Conclusion: In its report the Commission hasattempted to present the links and coordinationbetween the actions carried out under various Unionpolicies.  The coordination of Community activitiesimplies several levels: first within the Commissionservices; then with the Member States and the otherEuropean institutions; and then with businesscircles.The Commission will monitor the implementation ofprogrammes so that the declared objectives of greatersupport for SMEs are effectively transformed intoconcrete advantages for them.  The Commission intendsto ensure good cooperation with the otherinstitutions of the Union.  However, given that SMEpolicy is principally the business of national orregional authorities, the role of the Commission incoordinating the policies of the Member States islimited to stimulating or orchestrating mutualconsultation and cooperation between them and withthe Commission with a view to ensuring moreeffectiveness and a certain convergence of actions. Effectiveness of measures also implies goodcoordination and a permanent dialogue with SMErepresentative organisations.The Commission will reinforce coordination with allits partners, the Member States, the Europeaninstitutions and the business organisations so thatthe efforts of the Union in favour of smallbusinesses are converted into growth, competitivenessand employment.* Please note that Background Reports are written bya variety of authors on behalf of the LondonRepresentation of the European Commission to provideinformation on current issues at the European level.They do not necessarily reflect the views of theCommission either in whole or in part.

A vigorous and open BalticSea(1) economy will Provide new trading andinvestment opportunities.  The political, economicand security interests of the EU and the region willbe served by the fullest integration of the regioninto the European and world economy.  To this end, EUrelations with Scandinavia have progressed with therecent inclusion of Sweden and Finland as members ofthe Union and relations with the three Baltic Statesof Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continue to expand. EU relations with the Baltic States have progressedsignificantly over the last two years.  Relations nowcover much more than simply trade agreements incertain sectors.  The European Union has recognisedthe wish of the Baltic States to become part of theUnion when the necessary preconditions for membershipare fulfilled.  To this end, the European Union hassigned Europe Agreements with all three BalticStates.  As a consequence, the Baltic States now takepart in the pre-accession strategy in preparation foreventual accession to the Union.  Latvia and Estoniahave already applied for membership of the EuropeanUnion(2).  The pre-accession strategy covers suchdivers fields as Home and Justice Affairs, Foreignand Security policy, political dialogue, internalmarket and trade. Against all precedent, the future accession of theBaltic States to the European Union will in many waysnot be as easy as the accession of any of the currentMember States.  Before accession, the new MemberStates(3) already had enough expertise in specificareas, for example law, to meet the requirement formembership.  The application of the new legislationand policies will be the most difficult thing for theBaltic States.  Without detailed assistance from theEU, the entire process threatens to take much longerthan necessary.  As a precondition to accession,therefore, the EU underlines the importance for theEuropean Union to provide assistance in order toenable these countries to establish the necessarystructures, introduce measures for implementation andlay out an optimal set of policy and economicincentives for economic operators(4).BackgroundThe Baltic States joined the Central and EasternEuropean Countries (CEEC) strategy in 1992.  EuropeanUnion relations with the Baltic States, therefore,falls under the Central and Eastern Europe pre-accession strategy, under which many of the measuresare applicable to all CEE countries, including theBaltic States.The Agreements on trade and commercial and economicco-operation concluded in 1992 with Latvia andLithuania entered into force on 1 February 1993.  TheAgreement with Estonia entered into force on 1 March1993.  These agreements cover trade in certainsectors.  The trade arrangements were supplemented byframework agreements.  Annual arrangements forfisheries Protocols and on trade in textile productswere also signed with Latvia and Lithuania. At the request of the Copenhagen European Council,the Commission asked the Council for authorisation tonegotiate with the Baltic States to convert theagreements on trade, commercial and economicco-operation into Free Trade Agreements, with the aimof concluding Europe Agreements when possible.  TheFree Trade Agreements would fit in with theenlargement negotiations and would preservecompatibility between Community acquis (establishedCommunity law and practice) and the existingagreements between the Nordic countries and theBaltic States.  Free Trade Agreements for the threeStates were signed on 18 July 1994 and came intoforce 1 January 1995(5), replacing the trade aspectsof earlier agreements, as well as including politicaldialogue. In order for the Baltic States to be included in thepreparation for accession, certain conditions had tobe met.  These include being able to satisfy thethree basic conditions of European identity,democratic status and respect for human rights ascontained in the Treaty on European Union(6).  Inaddition certain other conditions had to be met: theexistence of a functioning market economy, thecapacity to compete in the internal market of theUnion and the ability to take on the obligations ofmembership including the adherence to the aims ofpolitical, economic and monetary union. As early as 29 May 1995 the Council recorded that theconditions had been met for the Baltic States to beincluded in the strategy to prepare for accession asdefined by the European Council meeting in Essen. This has had the effect of allowing the Baltic Statesto participate in the joint meetings under thestructured dialogue with the associated CEEC(7).A key element of the strategy to prepare foraccession is the narrowing of the gap in preparationof the associated States for integration into theinternal market of the EU.  Preparation for theinternal market is backed up by a variety of measuresdesigned to promote integration through thedevelopment of infrastructure and of co-operation infields having above all a trans-European dimension(including energy, environment, transport, scienceand technology, etc.), and in the fields of commonforeign and security policy and of justice and homeaffairs.  The PHARE programme, appropriately fundedwithin a multiannual financial framework inaccordance with the preparatory strategy agreed upon,will provide support for this purpose.PHARE and TACIS Democracy ProgrammeThe process of trade liberalisation in the BalticStates is one of the purposes of the PHARE and TACISprogrammes.  Projects under these two schemes includemeasures to improve the ability of localadministration to handle trade flows, and bydeveloping export, credit and insurance facilities toencourage regional trade.  The move towardsassistance to improve infrastructure and attractinvestment is another priority of the PHAREprogramme.  PHARE assistance to eliminate bordercrossing obstacles in the Baltic region remains amajor instrument, for example, through thedevelopment of the Via Baltica and the Helsinki-StPetersburg corridor(8).Aid from the PHARE programme continues to expand asthe following figures for 1993(9) and 1994(10)demonstrate.Financing from PHARE to Estonia amounted to 12 mECUin 1993.  This breaks down as follows: * Education, training and R&D      1.5 mECU* General technical assistance;  miscellaneous                   10.5 mECU In 1994 this figure rose to 22.5 mECU and breaks downas follows: * Private sector, SMEs             8   mECU* Environment and nuclear safety   2.5 mECU* Education, training and R&D      4.5 mECU* Infrastructure:  energy, telecommunications,    transport, etc.                   6 mECU* GTAF(11) & others                 1.5 mECUFinancing from PHARE to Latvia amounted to 18 mECU in1993.  This breaks down as follows: * Education, training and R&D       2   mECU* General technical assistance;  miscellaneous                    16   mECUThis figure rose to 29.5 mECU in 1994 and breaks downas follows: * Financial sector                 14.5 mECU* Environment and nuclear safety    5.5 mECU* Education, training and R&D       5   mECU* GTAF & others                     4.5 mECUFinancing from PHARE to Lithuania amounted to 25 mECUin 1993. This breaks down as follows: * Education, training and R&D       2.5 mECU* General technical assistance,  miscellaneous                    22.5 mECUThis figure rose to 39 mECU in 1994 and breaks downas follows: * Financial sector                 14.5 mECU* Environment and nuclear safety   1    mECU* Education, training and R&D      6    mECU* Infrastructure:  energy, telecommunications,    transport, etc.               16.5  mECU* GTAF & others                    1    mECUAt the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1995certain priority concerns as regards financialassistance under the PHARE scheme were laid down. PHARE has been redirected towards supporting thestrategy for preparation for accession, so itsprogramming is being carried out on a multiannualbasis. Technical assistance must take into accountimplementation of the White Paper on preparing forintegration into the internal market(12).  Assistanceunder the programme has been extended to includeinvestment activity in the field of infrastructures.One example of how the PHARE programme has recentlyhelped Latvia is through the provision of anemergency assistance package of 2.5 mECU in order toassist efforts to stabilise the banking sectorfollowing the collapse of Latvia's largest bank, BankBaltija(13).  This programme is designed to assistthe sixteen banks in Latvia which are still trading -following the effective closure of 31 other banks andto provide assistance to the Bank of Latvia in itson-site supervision activities in order to helpprevent any further deterioration in the currentsituation.The TACIS Democracy Programme forms part of theEuropean Democracy Initiative of the EuropeanParliament.  It seeks to support the activities andefforts of non-governmental bodies (NGOs) inpromoting a stable open society and good governance. It also focuses on the difficult or unpopular aspectsof political reform and democratic practice.  Thegeneral objective is to contribute to the creation ofa human rights ethos in the countries concernedwhereby the general public is made aware of the ruleof law.  It supports the acquisition and applicationof knowledge and techniques of parliamentary practiceand organisation by cross-party groups ofpoliticians(14) and by parliamentary staff.  TheDemocracy Programme also covers the strengthening ofnon-governmental bodies and associations which bytheir vocation and specific activities can make acontinuing contribution to the promotion of apluralist society, as well as the transfer ofspecific expertise and technical skills aboutdemocratic practices and the rule of law toprofessional groups and associations in the countriesconcerned(15). Europe AgreementsThe Europe Agreements establish bilateralassociations between each of the European countriesand the EU. They are based on shared understandingand values, and set the path for progressiveconvergence in a very wide range of activities.  Theyare valid indefinitely with short transition periodsfor Latvia and Lithuania.  Because of the progress ofeconomic and political reform in Estonia there is notransitional period for this country.As each agreement is the result of a separatebilateral negotiation, there are a number ofdifferences of detail.  The objectives and mainelements are however the same.  The Europe Agreementscover approximation of legislation, economicco-operation, financial and political and culturalco-operation as well as including provisions on theprevention of activities such as illegal immigration,drug trafficking and illegal trade in industrialwaste.  The Agreements include matters of bothCommunity and Member State competence.  Eachagreement contains a clause on observance ofdemocratic principles and human rights and a clauseenabling either party to suspend the agreement atshort notice if the obligations attached to it arenot respected.  The Europe Agreements additionallytake account of developments in certain sectors andaccordingly recognise the increased importance ofmultilateral political dialogue and contain a newheading on co-operation in crime prevention andprovisions for the three Baltic States to take partin framework programmes, in specific programmes andin projects or other schemes set up by the Communityin various areas.Europe Agreements with the three Baltic States weresigned on 12 June 1995(16).  Following ratificationby all parties, including each individual MemberState, the agreements will enter into force.  Sincethe signing of the Europe Agreements the three BalticStates take part in the pre-accession strategy. Themain elements of the Europe Agreements are:* political dialogue* recognition of the importance of the involvement ofthe Baltic States in WEU, the NATO Partnership forPeace Initiative and the European Stability Pact;* bilateral political dialogue in the framework of EAas well as multilateral political dialogue;* structured relationship with EU institutions, asdefined by the Essen European Council. * economic activities* free trade in industrial goods;* preferential treatment of trade in agriculturalproducts including those already processed;* liberating trade in many services;* national treatment for establishment and operationsof enterprises;* national treatment for bidding for public contractawards according to Community procurement rules;* movement of workers: prevention of discriminationagainst workers from any partner country legallyemployed in the other country;* co-ordination of social security systems forlegally employed workers and their families; * right of establishment of companies and nationaltreatment or MFN status(17); free movement of goods;* transport.* rules and approximation of lawsCommitments by the Baltic States to introduce similarlegislation as that applying in the EU - where thisis not already the case - concerning:* competition rules and public undertakings(18),including a safeguard clause in the event ofbalance-of- payments difficulties; protection ofintellectual, commercial, industrial property;* liberalisation of payments and capital transfers inrespect of trade and investments(19); approximationof laws in other areas affecting the implementationof the Agreements. * co-operation(20)* economic co-operation;* industrial co-operation;* environmental co-operation;* educational and training co-operation;* monetary policy co-operation;* financial co-operation (continuation PHARE aid andother financial support);* cultural co-operation.* crime prevention co-operation.* institutions* Association Council at ministerial level toregularly examine progress in the process of economicreform;* Association Committee at senior officials level;* Parliamentary Association Committee.Structured RelationshipThe Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 agreedthat the associated countries will become members ofthe Union when these countries are able to assume theobligations of membership.  The Essen EuropeanCouncil of December 1994 adopted a strategy to assistthe CEEC in preparing for their accession.  Thisincludes, amongst other things, a series of regularmeetings at ministerial level ('structuredrelationship with the institutions of the EuropeanUnion') and the elaboration of a White Paperidentifying what the CEEC need to do (legally,regulatory, institutionally, administratively) inorder to participate in the open internal market.Political dialogue has been on-going since 1993.  Forexample, on 19 April 1993 the Community 'troika' hada meeting in Copenhagen with the foreign ministers ofthe Baltic States, in December 1993 Latvia's Ministerfor External Trade and EC Affairs, OlgertsPavlovskis, met Commissioner Van den Broek inBrussels.  Under the structured relationship,however, meetings at higher levels have intensified. A number of ministerial meetings have been held in avariety of areas, for example: the meeting ofMinisters for Foreign Affairs on 10 April 1995 gaverise to exchanges of views on several politicalissues of mutual interest.  Meetings at the level ofPolitical Directors and European correspondents wereorganised, as well as numerous meetings at expertlevel* the meeting of ministers with responsibility forthe internal market met in June 1995 along withBaltic State representatives.  The meeting discussedand exchanged views on the Commission White Paper onthe preparation of the associated countries forintegration into the internal market;* the meeting of the Research Council in June 1995,at which stock was taken of the progress onscientific and technical co-operation with the CEEC,the alignment policy implemented by the associatedcountries and the forecasts for their participationin Community research programmes; * the Heads of Government and State of the associatedStates were invited to meet alongside the CannesEuropean Council in 1995;The structured dialogue has continued under theSpanish Presidency in the following fields: * Justice and Home Affairs;* Transport;* Agriculture;* Education;* Foreign Affairs.Stability Pact(21)The European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993discussed the French proposal for an initiative to betaken by the European Union in favour of a Pact onstability in Europe.  This initiative is directedtowards assuring in practice the application of theprinciples agreed by European countries with regardto respect for borders and rights of minorities.  TheEuropean Council agreed that recent events in Europehave shown that action in these areas is timely andappropriate.  It welcomed the idea of using theinstrument of 'Joint Action' in accordance with theprocedures provided for in the Common Foreign andSecurity policy.In the Common Foreign and Security Policy framework,the Pact on Stability in Europe is intended topromote preventive diplomacy and therefore is notconcerned with countries in conflict.  Initially, itwill be directed at those countries which have theprospect of becoming members of the EU and with whichthe Union has concluded or negotiated agreements. This includes the Baltic States.  The aim of theinitiative is to contribute to stability by avertingtension and potential conflicts in Europe, fosteringneighbourly relations and encouraging countries toconsolidate their borders and to resolve problems ofnational minorities.The inaugural meeting took place in Paris in March1994.  The documents setting in train the processwhich will lead to the conclusion of the Pact onstability in Europe were concluded following a roundtable discussion(22).  Countries participating werethose which make a particular contribution to theinitiative, countries immediately bordering on thecountries having association agreements and countrieswith an interest in stability, in Europe by virtue oftheir defence commitments(23).  Representatives ofinternational organisations concerned by theinitiative also participated(24). The European Union reaffirmed its will to mobiliseits economic and financial instruments as itscontribution to the success of this undertaking atthe Corfu European Council meeting in June 1994. Atthe Cannes European Council meeting in June 1995, theEuropean Union further specified some of theaccompanying measures to be taken under PHARE alongside the Stability Pact.  These include, projectsconcerning regional transboundary co-operation,issues relating to minorities, cultural co-operation, including, language training andadministrative training, and environmental problems. White Paper(25) on preparation of the associatedcountries of Central and Eastern Europe forintegration into the Internal Market of the Union(26) The White Paper marks the beginning of a process.  Itprovides a guide for the associated countries inadapting their legal structures to those which areneeded for future participation in the internalmarket. It sets out a logical sequence for adoptingthe necessary measures and will enable associatedcountries to draw up internal market work programmesadapted to each country's own economic and reformpriorities.  It will also enable the European Unionto provide the kind of support which is most needed,drawing on the necessary expertise in the Union's owninstitutions, in the Member States and in the privatesector.The White Paper(27) focuses on legislation which isessential for the functioning of the internal market.It shows the key measures in each sector and thosemeasures which should be tackled first, withoutsetting up priorities as between sectors, including:* free movement of goods;* free movement of services;* free movement of persons;* freedom of capital movements;* competition policy;* state aids.It also describes in detail the administrative andorganisational structures which are required in eachsector if the legislation is to be effectivelyimplemented and enforced. The EU recognises that certain assistance needs arecommon to all associated countries.  To this end theCommission intends to establish a TechnicalAssistance Information Exchange Office supportedthrough the PHARE programme.  The Office will belocated in Brussels and managed by the Commission. It will provide for the exchange of information andwill help ensure the adequate delivery of services tothe associated countries.  This includes Communitylegislation, its transposition into nationallegislation, legal terminology, translation, trainingand exchanges.The White Paper also highlights the current state ofplay in the relationship between the CEEC and theEuropean Union, detailing the progress made to datewith legislative approximation and specific sectors,including:* company law;* financial sector;* agriculture;* transport;* competition policy;* telecommunications;* intellectual property.ConclusionThe relationship between the European Union and thethree Baltic States has changed dramatically over thelast few years.  It has progressed from simple tradearrangements to trade agreements and, this year, toEurope Agreements.  All three states have expressed adesire to become part of the European Union, Latviaand Estonia have formally applied for membership. The IGC will address some of the questionssurrounding the accession of new Member States to theUnion in 1996.

In addition, the White Paper does not changethe contractual relationship between the EU and theBaltic States, which is based on the EuropeAgreements.  As detailed in these agreements, theapproximation of legislation is monitored by aspecific Sub-Committee(27) The annex to the White Paper provides acomprehensive and detailed presentation of current EUlegislation relating to the internal market.

After scrutiny of the planand taking account of legal advice, the ITC hasconcluded that such a scheme, if completed by 31December 1995, would not breach the provisions of theAct.However, the Members of the Commission believe thatsuch arrangements raise not only legal but alsoimportant policy and regulatory issues.  It is theview of the Commission that the proposed structure iscontrary to the spirit and intention of theBroadcasting Act 1990.As a consequence of the acquisition of CentralTelevision by Carlton Television and LWT by GranadaTelevision, the holdings of 18 per cent held by eachcompany increased to 36 per cent. The Act establishedthat there should be a limit of 20 per cent on anyindividual shareholding by a deadline to be set bythe ITC.The original deadline of 31 December 1994 for sellingthe excess shares was extended by one year pendingthe completion of a review by Ministers of a range ofownership issues.  The Secretary of State forNational Heritage confirmed earlier this year thatthe Government did not propose to raise the existinglimits on shareholdings in a nominated news Providerand the ITC has stated that it expects disposal totake place by the stipulated date of 31 December1995.The ITC regrets that Carlton and Granada are givingactive consideration to interpreting the ownershiprules of the Broadcasting Act in a way which in theITC' s view was not originally intended byParliament.David Glencross, Chief Executive, ITC said:"We have urged Carlton and Granada to reduce theirshareholdings to the level envisaged by the Act assoon as is practicable, and in a way which isconsistent with both the spirit and the letter of thelegislation."We very much hope that the new broadcastinglegislation will address avoidance mechanisms of thiskind".CONTACT: Independent Television CommissionTel: +44 (0)171 255 3000M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

The order isvalued at some DM 2 million.PCM MULTI, the new multi-channel transmission system,will enable the network operator SPT to make multipleuse of existing two-wire telephone lines.  Thiscapability is especially important wherever, due topoor infrastructure, only one telephone line isavailable, and yet a much larger number of lines isrequired. Using the PCM MULTI system, up to eleven independentanalogue voice channels can be transmitted digitallyusing the HDSL transmission technique via onetwo-wire line.  The echo cancellation procedure withthe internationally standardised 2B IQ line code isused for direction separation.  The PCM MULTI systemcomprises a connection unit at the subscriber'spremises and one at the exchange.  PCM MULTI can beused in both analogue and digital telecommunicationsnetworks.  In the ISDN, a maximum of five telephonelines are available.The PCM MULTI units are powered via a central 48/60 Vexchange battery.  A power supply is therefore notrequired on the subscriber side.  The bridgeabledistance between the connection unit at thesubscriber's premises and the exchange depends on thesubscriber line diameter.  Using cable with aconductor diameter of 0.4 mm, a distance in excess of3 km can be bridged.  Being so quick and easy toinstall in existing telecommunicationsinfrastructures, PCM MULTI represents an affordableway of extending the number of telecommunicationlines.CONTACT: Philips Kommunikations Industrie AGTel: +49 911 5 26 5144Fax: +49 911 5 26 4102M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

TV and radio channels will betransmitted in digital format via fibre-optic cable. DIMOS, the digital television transmission system, isable to transmit one or more TV channels in PAL,NTSC, SECAM or D2-MAC.  It can also be used to relayradio channels and data.  The signals are transmittedat a data rate of 140 Mbit/s.  As a result of thehigh transmission quality, DIMOS is equally ideal forexchanging channels between TV studios as it is -when used in combination with SDH transmissionequipment - for feeding channels into broadbanddistributive networks. Transmission in the long-haul network is achievedusing the SLE-16 SDH transmission systems.  These areeach capable of accepting sixteen DIMOS systemssimultaneously at the central feeding point.Factors encouraging the network operator to deploythe DIMOS and SLE-16 systems for setting up newnetwork structures include the quality of the video,audio and data transmission, as well as costconsiderations.  By using different coding boards,DIMOS can be adapted for a host of applications.  Insuitable networks, up to sixty TV and sixty FMchannels, plus two DSR packages (32 digital radiochannels), can be broadcast, for example.CONTACT: Philips Kommunikations Industrie AGTel: +49 911 5 26 5144Fax: +49 911 5 26 4102M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

To shift 1lb of fat you haveto lose 3,500 calories. This may seem a depressingstatistic, but if you see your beer gut as half -pound packets of butter hanging around your middleand picture losing two of those packets a week, a lba week suddenly seems like quite a lot! says MEN'SHEALTH Magazine.The equation for losing your beer gut isstraightforward - calories in versus calories outthrough exercise.  Just work out how much exerciseyou are willing to do and the rest of the caloriesyou have to cut from your diet. But remember, diet and exercise COMBINED is the mostefficient way to lose weight, so aim to lose 50% ofyour calories from your diet and burn off 50% throughexercise, says MEN'S HEALTH.Now get out your calculator and do your sum.  Firstlywork out how many calories you need to maintain yourweight.  An easy guide is to multiply your bodyweight in kilograms by 35.  So, for example, if youweigh 76 kilos, you need 2,660 calories to keep yourweight steady.You already know that to lose one lb of fat you needto lose 3,500 calories a week and that's 500 a day. This could mean you burn-up an extra 250 caloriesthrough exercise and you cut 250 calories from yourdaily diet. To find out how many calories you are going to burnfrom exercise, consult the following table andmultiply the number beside your chosen exercise (s)by your body weight in kilos to find out your hourlycalorie burn. Rowing                         9.5Cycling (road 10mph.)     6 to 8Cycling (stationary)      3 to 5Stairmaster                    6Weight-lifting                 3Running (6mph)                10Swimming                      10Skiing                         7Social football                2.5In-line skating                7Speed-walking                  4.5Tennis                         7Golf (carrying clubs)          5.5Aerobics (low-impact)          5For example, if you decide to cycle to work threetimes a week and it takes half an hour, multiply thefigure for cycling (6) by your body weight and youwill find out your hourly calorie burn.  IE: Cycling: 6. So 6 x 76kg (body weight) = 456 calories burnedper hour.  Therefore 1 1/2 hours a week cycling 684calories burned.  As you need to lose 3,500 caloriesa week, that still leaves 2,816 excess calories whichyou will have to take out of your diet. That's 402calories a day.  So, subtract 402 calories from theamount you should be eating to maintain your weight,2,660, and you will find out your new calorie intakeshould be 2,258 calories a day.To achieve weight-loss as well as cardiovascularfitness, you should ideally aim to exercise three orfour times a week for around 30 to 40 minutes,advises MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

"And it's almost alwayshappier than a legitimate holiday, because there isno pressure to have a great time, it's a day just foryou." In fact, a lot of sickness absence is simply astress-relieving exercise - you've worked hard m aproject and you need a day-off.  In Sweden, workersare given a number of 'mental health days' by theiremployers, which they can take without having tophone in to say they've got the lurgy.So next time you genuinely feel the need for astress-busting day-off, don't call it a 'sickie'.  Bepositive and call it 'a happy day'.* HAVE A LAUGHThe very act of laughing helps you feel happy.  Andthe sillier, the better, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. Research shows people who are most happy seem to beeccentrics who don't care what the world thinks ofthem.  Monty Python had it right all along. "When youlaugh, your whole body benefits from an internalmassage," says MEN'S HEALTH. "This relaxes muscletension, reduces stress in the nervous system, youbreathe deeper, you have greater circulation andendorphin 'happy' chemicals are released." * DO THINGS THAT MADE YOU HAPPY AS A KIDResearch has found that in average kids smile 400times a day, whereas adults only times a day - so tryreverting to your childhood pleasure, says MEN'SHEALTH Magazine. "Fly a kite, play Scalextric, go tothe seaside and build sandcastles or go ride yourbike.  For many of us, the times we remember beinghappiest were Saturday mornings, with no school to goto, the world to explore and a Raleigh Chopper to doit on" * SMELL A 'HAPPY SMELL'Of the five sense, smell is the me most directlylinked to the brain, says MEN'S HEALTH.  "Theolfactory nerve goes into the part of the brain thatdeals with emotions, moods, hormone release andprimitive instincts.  Even by simply making youbreathe more deeply, essential oils can have abeneficial effect.  Breathing well and feelingrelaxed is a pretty happy state to be in."Choose an essential oil that is classified as'uplifting' such as rosewood mixed with lime or acoriander and lemon mixture - but don't heat ailsover a candle, you will simply cook up all theresidue and give yourself a splitting headache! Instead, invest in an Aroma Diffuser from the chemistor evaporate the oils over a pan of boiling water.You could also try frying some bacon and thentantalise your sense of taste with a bacon buttie!* GET FILTHYIt's not often nowadays that a man can enjoy thehonest pleasure of getting caked in filth.  But inour modern world of order, cleanliness and desktidies, there's spiritual renewal to be had fromsimply getting mucky, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.* DRIVE A TANK FOR THE DAYGive a new meaning to road-rage.  Off-road centresaround the UK offer the experience of driving a rangeof 4WD and ex-military  vehicles and a few havetanks!  Driving a 55-ton Chieftain tank is'absolutely brilliant' says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. "You sit in a very small cab with your head pokingout of the top.  There is a real sensation of powerand control as you accelerate and all you see if yougo uphill is the sky."* EAT HAPPY FOODIf you really fancy a flake, have one.  The power ofchocolate is legendary, it's the all-purposehappiness drug, says MEN'S HEALTH.  It containsphenylethylamine, or PEA, a substance that is turnedinto noradrenalin in the brain and could have anaddictive effect.  It has even been likened to thefeeling of 'being in-love'.  Chocolate is also highin sugar and because many people suffer from lowblood-sugar which makes them feel mentally andphysically sluggish, lethargic and possibly fed-up,chocolate can give you a quick lift for an hour or sowhich can be positively mood enhancing. "A one or twoday detox can also work wonders, both mentally andphysically, but don't go on a water-only fast.  Eatfresh fruit, vegetables and brown rice all weekendand by Sunday evening, you will really feel on form. Your mental clarity will be good and your aches andpains will have cleared up," says MEN'S HEALTHMagazine.* GET A NATURAL EXERCISE ENDORPHIN HIGHEndorphins are naturally occurring morphine-likeopiates within the body and they are linked tofeelings of happiness.  Certain enjoyable activities- love and sex, drinking alcohol and eating - can allbe linked to the production of endorphins, but noneis as effective as vigorous exercise. * GO AND LOOK AT SOMETHING BEAUTIFULVisit an art gallery.  Art provides mentalstimulation.  If you are feeling low, go and learnsomething, expand your mind - it is a key tohappiness, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.- WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, INDULGE YOURSELF!There are times when even the fittest, mostspiritually pure triathlon runners find truehappiness with a couple cans of beer, a chickenBiriyani from the local takeaway and a night on thesofa with a Van Damme video. "It's only one meal in aweek that might contain 21 of them so enjoy it anddon't feel guilty," says MEN'S HEALTH, "but don'tmake it the norm." And remember, me of the highest causes of stress isthat people are waiting for happiness to happen, saysMEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  It's the Puritan Work Ethic -we work hard now in order to buy future shares inhappiness.  For a man, it's part of the no-pain,no-gain, no-such-thing-as-a-free lunch philosophy. So stop waiting for happiness to happen and thinkabout what makes you happy NOW.CONTACT: SUSAN de VERETel: +44 (0)1703 255245M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

I wasprivileged to meet some of the veterans whosesacrifices won our freedom.  They were so unassumingthat it was difficult to realise that they had -quite literally - save  the world from tyranny.  Butthat is precisely what they did."VE Day and VJ Day left a lasting impression on meand I found myself wondering during the followingweeks what fitting memorial we could create inScotland, in the 50th anniversary year of thevictorious conclusion of the Second World War, tothose who fought and in many cases lost their livesin that conflict.  Then I became aware of the historyof the former Rowardennan estate on the east bank ofLoch Lomond."Because of its outstanding quality, this land waspurchased by the Government in 1950 under the termsof the National Land Fund 'to preserve the naturalbeauty of the area, safeguard public access andutilise the land for forestry and agriculture'. Today the land is owned by Forest Enterprise and theNational Trust for Scotland.  At my request, thesebodies have agreed to undertake the management of thearea in partnership, with a view to creating a majornational monument. "I am pleased, therefore, to announce our intentionto establish the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park,dedicated to the memory of all those who served ourcountry in the Second World War.  The Memorial Parkwill be based on conservation principles, givingpriority to landscape, nature conservation and quietrecreation.  An integrated management strategy willinclude a project for increasing the native woodlandareas within the park.  It is our objective to ensurethat the Memorial Park is protected for all time asan inalienable national property, permanentlydedicated to this purpose."We shall also be launching a national competition todevise a memorial to the fallen as a focal point tothe park.  Future generations will be able to enjoythis superb environment, while recalling thesacrifices that were made to secure for us ourpresent liberties and quality of life."That inheritance can no longer be taken for granted. Once again our way of life is threatened - this timeby an enemy within.  The drugs epidemic is a scourgeas terrible as any medieval plague.  This countrystrove in unity, as one nation, during the SecondWorld War to defeat tyranny.  We must find that unityagain to crush the drugs menace. "Let us, as a nation, make a New Year resolution that1996 is the year in which we will turn back the tideof drug abuse which is engulfing our young people andthreatening our civilisation.  Our aim is nothingless than to win back Scotland from the drug cultureand liberate a generation.  That is of far moreimportance than any party political objective.  Wemust unite across party lines and across every agegroup to drive the drug barons out of ourcommunities.  This is not a campaign: it is acrusade."We must rediscover the spirit of wartime unity.  Iam delighted that the leaders of all the politicalparties in Scotland are keen to join forces to launcha major new national initiative against drugs. Scotland Against Drugs will seek to unite communitiesin fighting drugs misuse. The success of localanti-drugs campaigns, notably those run by theGlasgow Evening Times and the Paisley Daily Express,has paved the way to a nationwide effort.  Itspurpose will be to educate and dissuade young peoplefrom taking drugs."It will be launched in January under the auspices ofthe Health Education Board for Scotland, linking intothe work of agencies which are already involved inthe fight against drugs.  I hope that it will enjoythe active support of every MP in Scotland, all themedia, the business community and the country atlarge."Scotland Against Drugs will publish the facts aboutdrug misuse; support efforts against local drugdealing; promote drug-free activities for youngpeople; and stimulate community attempts to combatdrugs. If we are to divert young people from drugs,we must spell out one simple message: drugs are forlosers.  But that message will only have credibilityif young people see a real prospect of becomingwinners. We must work together to provideopportunities for the next generation and the key tothat is partnership."In all our endeavours we shall gain strength fromworking together. 1 have enjoyed the six months Ihave served as Secretary of State, despite the heavyworkload, because I have discovered that, in thisoffice, you can make a difference - you can makethings happen. Scotland has huge reserves of talentand enterprise.  But they need to be encouraged andunleashed.  That is my objective: to help Scotlandfulfil its potential."I should like to thank all the people who havealready helped me in this task: the staff of StAndrew's House and everybody across Scotland whocontributed to my consultation exercise.  HighlandRegion and local activists gave invaluable help insaving the Fort William sleeper service.  The ScotchWhisky Association were doughty lobbyists and thefruits of their work were seen in the Budget. All myScottish Conservative parliamentary colleagues stoodunited, without exception, against the Bill tointroduce Double Summer time which would be veryunwelcome in Scotland; this united stance was clearlydecisive in depriving the Bill of Government support. "And there were many other partnerships: with thedoctors and others in the NHS who helped to shape thepolicies that led to the rescheduling of Temazepam;Locate in Scotland's success in securing the Chungwhainward investment project; Scottish Screen Locations,on a shoestring budget, helping to create a promisingScottish film industry; and many more - too many tobe listed here."The Scottish economy is a success story.  The latestexport figures, for 1994, show a leap of almost 24per cent over the previous year to more than GBP 14billion.  We now export more per head than Japan -who would have imagined that ten years ago?"During the last year unemployment fell below 200,000to its lowest level in 15 years; that means a happierNew Year for many Scottish households than was thecase in previous years.  Scotland's unemployment ratehas now been below that of the United Kingdom foralmost four years and long-term unemployment isfalling. "If I had one wish for 1996 it would be that all ofus in politics should realise we do not have amonopoly of good ideas in any one party and that weshould try to find common ground.  I have tried to doso in 1995.  One example is Campbell Christie'ssuggestion of revamping the Scottish Economic Councilto serve Scotland better.  It was a good idea and wetook it on board.  Similarly, many good ideas ondevolution of power to local government werecontained in the paper submitted by COSLA last month. In 1996 we will make some of these ideas reality."My own resolution for 1996 is to make our countrysafer.Maintenance of law and order is the first duty ofgovernment.  That is why, in the year ahead, we shallbe ensuring that the punishment fits the crime andthat criminals do not walk out of prison half-waythrough their sentences.  Drugs can never betolerated in prisons; random drug testing is ouranswer.  We must give strong support to the police. That is why we are putting 500 more officers onto thestreets and giving them the technological help theyneed, such as DNA. testing facilities and automaticfingerprint reading machines.  Let us make aresolution that 1996 will be a very bad year forcriminals in Scotland. "The successes of 1995 point the way ahead for 1996. In a spirit of partnership rather than dissension wemust persevere in securing Scotland's interests andliberating the talents and enterprise of our peopleto make our country stable and prosperous.  That isthe spirit in which I ask you to join with me instriving to make 1996, for everyone in Scotland, atruly happy New Year."CONTACT: Alistair McNeillTel: +44 (0)131 244 2705M2 COMMUNICATIONS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FORINFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN M2 PRESSWIRE.

PCNAmerica, Inc. said that its proposed Personal CommunicationsNetwork would be similar to the PCNs being proposed in the UnitedKingdom and under consideration in Europe and Japan.  Millicom isa member of a consortium (with Pacific Telesis International, MatraCommunications and British Aerospace Space Systems) that hasapplied in the United Kingdom for a license for a PCN.  Licensesare expected to be awarded in a few months, with service by 1992.     The deadline for comments on the PCNA petition is December 18,1989.  Reply comments are due January 3, 1990.     The basic concepts of PCN, said PCNA, are:     1) The network should link persons, not stations;     2) It should allow voice, data and image transmission; and     3) It should make the most efficient possible use of thefrequency spectrum.     Applying these principles, PCNA proposes to install anationwide network of microcell radio base stations wherever peoplecongregate.  These would include business and residentialneighborhoods, and in office buildings.  The PCN technique includeshandoffs from cell to cell permitting slow speed mobility (but notwhile driving).  PCNA proposed low-powered, wallet sized handsetsthat would be activated by a smart card inserted by the user.Since the smart card is personalized to each user, the networkwould recognize the identity of a caller for billing purposes.  Auser away from home would be able to receive as well as initiatecalls if he or she logs in at a network base station and notifiesthe network of his or her willingness to accept calls from all ora particular class of callers.  PCNA said that the intelligence inthe network, combined with the ability to locate any user who haslogged in, will permit the "ability to reach a party with acommunication of a type specifically tailored for receipt by thatparty" regardless of his or her location.  The PCN microcell radiosystem would be well adapted for cordless PABX's in officeenvironments.     The network architecture would be based on the SignallingSystem 7 protocol (SS-7) which will allow such "futuristic"features such as selective call ringing and rejection, virtualprivate networks, "wide-area" Centrex, and ISDN features.  Tomaximize spectrum reuse, PCNA proposes to use CDMA or similarspread-spectrum techniques, rather than the TDMA used in DECT orthe FDMA used in the British CT2 system.     The Chief Engineer of the FCC, Dr. Thomas Stanley,  commentedthat his agency welcomes proposals such as this, and is alreadyengaged in an in-depth study of the concept of personalcommunications systems.  He said that the FCC expects to issue aNotice of Inquiry in the spring of 1990, and the PCNA petitionwould be considered in the context of that inquiry, along withanother petition filed by Cellular 21, Inc. for a CT2-typeTelepoint system.     PCNA  has proposed a service that is far in advance of theCT2-based  Telepoint system being implemented in the U.K., andproposed for the U.S. (see separate stories), and could cut intothe cellular market if it can be brought in at a reasonable price(only the market for the cellular users who must have phone servicewhile driving will be immune).  CT2 does not allow for calls to bereceived, and cannot be used for data or fax transmissions, farless allow the Centrex-type features promised by PCNA.     PCN would have convenience and cost marketing advantages overcellular.  As a low-powered radio (around 10 milliwatts) thehandset would be much smaller than current  models - around halfthe size and weight of the Motorola 950 Microtac model, if theBritish Telepoint phones are a guide, and its batteries would lastperhaps ten times as long.  PCNA did not estimate the cost ofeither hardware or service over the proposed PCN, but sincehardware prices and investment costs per subscriber of a CT2microcell system are far below those of conventional cellular, itseems likely that a PCN could significantly underprice cellular.     Installation of a nation-wide PCN is not around the corner,but must await the conclusion of the FCC inquiry into personalcommunication systems.  According to Dr. Stanley, that inquiry willprobably take about a year from its start in the spring.  If theFCC then approves the concept and allocates frequencies,applications for licenses will be accepted.  Some kind of lotterysystem is likely if the volume of applications is great.  Onlyafter some applications are granted would construction of thenetwork start, and this timetable could be set back if the FCCdecides to await the outcome of the World Administrative Radio(WARC) conference scheduled for 1992.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROCELL REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1990U.S. COMPANIES PLANNING MICROCELL NETWORKS   In addition to Millicom, Inc. (see lead story), at least threeUnited States companies are  preparing to set up microcellcommunications systems - two using the CT2 technology developed inGreat Britain, and one seeking to overlay a microcell radiotechnology on existing cellular systems.  A third approach toTelepoint based on the Digital European Cordless Telephone standard(DECT) is slated for trials on an interim basis by Ericsson Radio,Inc.  All of these approaches have potential to create Telepointnetworks across America.  CT2 has the advantage of being alreadyoperational in the U.K. and of requiring very low capitalinvestment, but has little or no radio spectrum immediatelyavailable.  Additionally, as an out-bound only system, CT2 may notsatisfy the needs of U.S. users.  The existing cellular systemsalready have frequencies available and are two-way, but addingcells is expensive, and cellular operators may not be willing togive up frequencies for a lower-priced service.  DECT isintermediate between the CT2 and cellular concepts.  It usesmicrocell technology to provide two-way call, but is more expensivethan CT2, and cannot be used while driving.  Each approach has itsproponents, and the competition between them will be worthwatching.  The two major differences between CT2 and cellular-- CT2is outgoing only (outside of the home), and cannot be used whiledriving -- means that Telepoint's target market will be differentfrom that of cellular.  Additionally the anticipated low cost ofeach handset (perhaps $150 at first, eventually going to $75 orbelow) focusses Telepoint's appeal on a different segment of thepopulation than cellular.     The companies initiating trials are:Corporate Technology Partners     CTP is a group of venture capitalists in San Diego seeking toassemble capital, technology and know-how for a Telepoint networkbased on the CT2 system in operation in the United Kingdom.  Itclaims to have most of the capital and hardware arrangements inplace for a trial system.  Tests of a prototype will begin in thefirst half of 1990, claims Charles Mason, the president of CTP.The test will use handsets and base stations purchased from aBritish manufacturer, transmitting in the same 864-868 MHz as theU.K.,band on an experimental basis.  If the trial is successful CTPanticipates installing Telepoint systems on a city-by-city basis inthe United States.International Mobile Marine.     IMM is preparing to conduct a test of a Telepoint system incooperation with a cellular telephone operator, using cellulartechniques and frequencies.  Initially one microcell will beestablished then a pilot program with several cells in ametropolitan area.  George Calhoun, President of IMM, which isbased in Philadelphia, said that he expected the experiment to beconducted in the first half of 1990.  While his company has alreadyconducted some one-cell trials in Philadelphia, he wants to have amore realistic test using many more handsets in an urbanenvironment.  IMM's experimental system will use TDMA digitaltechnology, with separate transmit and receive channels, and usingcellular frequencies.  The initial trials will focus on voicecapability only, but eventually , according to IMM, Telepoint willaccommodate data transmission up to 128 kbs and fax.     IMM's aim is to develop a base unit, not the handset.  IMMseeks the best parameters of a system that will work in congestedurban areas.  Calhoun said that while some cellular operators wouldnot want to give up any of their precious frequencies to set up aTelepoint system, if the peak period for cellular traffic turns outto be different from the peak period for Telepoint traffic, thencellular  frequencies could be economically used for both services.Cellular 21.     Like CTP, Cellular 21, of Rutherford, N.J., will be workingwith CT2.  Matthew Edwards, the president, said that it has alreadyreceived experimental licenses at 864 MHz, and is conducting fieldtests with 1,000 Ferranti Phone Zone telephones.  Additionally,Edwards plans field trials in New York City, on the street and inthe subway system.  He said that if the pocket telephones couldprovide acceptable transmission quality in the noisy subwayenvironment, and on the street directly below the huge radio and TVtowers on top of the Empire State Building, he could be assuredthat they would work anywhere.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROCELL REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1990BRITISH TELEPOINT NETWORKS LAUNCHED     In the United Kingdom, two of the eventual four Telepointmobile phone services have started in London and, hesitantly, inother cities too.  British Telecom was first with its Phonepointnetwork, followed by Ferranti's Phonezone.   MercuryCommunications' Callpoint is due to appear within a few weeks, andthe fourth service from BYPS, a consortium of Philips, BarclaysBank and Shell, will follow in early 1990.      Handsets currently cost the equivalent of $310 or so, sign-onfees are $40 and monthly subscriptions to a service cost $14 (itvaries only a little between the services) although costs areexpected to drop gradually during 1990.  The usage rates are 13cents per minute local and 37 cents per minute national, about 20%above coin phone rates.  They are considerably below cellularrates, which are 60 cents per minute, local and national.Telepoint Features     So far there are just two Telepoint handsets, the Phonezone'sand one made by Shaye Communications being used by both Phonepointand Callpoint.  BYPS expects to offer CAI standard phones from dayone - the reason they cite for their later launch timetable.  Alsoto offer handsets in 1990 is Obitel, a joint venture of Racal andPlessey.     Telepoint handsets operate at 864-868 MHz with 40 channels perpublic base station although most base stations will initiallyoperate with 2-4 channels activated until traffic picks up.  TheCT2 technology uses FDMA digital transmission between handset andbase, which permits interference-free calls with high audioquality.  The small size of the cells allows high spectrumefficiency, since the 40 channels allotted to Telepoint will bereused at each cell.  In dense urban areas, the cell size can bereduced from the standard 200 meters, allowing more users persquare kilometer.  Features of the handset can includenational/international call barring, remote disablement of lost orstolen handsets and self diagnostics on base stations.Networks are Growing     Both the live services have started small, with some 300 basestations in London and one or two other areas at their launch,though both have increased the base station population since then.Phonepoint, for example, has raised its end 1989 forecast to 1500base stations in operation.  However both services have promisingbase station contracts.  Phonezone for instance has a contract toplace base stations in all London Underground (subway) stations -62 in the central city area alone.  Post Offices have been signedby Phonepoint and both have contracts with hotels, service areas,airports, banks and restaurants.    Nevertheless, it seems to usthat in the race to be first, Telepoint may have been tempted intolaunching prematurely.     The eventual target for full saturation is for the user tonever be more than 500 meters from a Telepoint in urban areas orten minutes' drive on main roads. To achieve that would requirehundreds of thousands of sites across the UK - Phonepoint says thatagreements already in place give them potentially 30,000 or more.Both services admit that users will be slow to come forward untila critical mass of sites exists, but there is no concurrence onwhat that level may be.  Projections for 1995 usage by Telepointoperators and financial analysts have ranged from 800,000 to 6million subscribers.     Another major block to growth is the lack of standards - thefirst three Telepoint services are incompatible.  A Common AirInterface (CAI) will allow handsets to be used on more than oneservice when it comes into existence in mid-1990, but users willhave to subscribe to both services, increasing the cost.     The government license obliges all Telepoint services tointroduce roaming, though it could be two years away yet.  Thensubscribers to one service will be able to use another service'sbase stations, presumably at slightly higher call charge rates thanusual.Back to Headline List CopyrightMICROCELL REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1990PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENT OF U.K. TELEPOINT SYSTEM   The following table is an estimate of the financials of a U.K.Telepoint operator, neither the largest nor the smallest of thefour Telepoint operators.  An underlying assumption is that therewill be approximately two million Telepoint subscribers in the U.K.by late 1995.     Service revenues include registration fees, monthly subscribercharges and usage fees, and expenses include sales/marketing costs,customer service (including billing), system operation andmaintenance, network charges, G&A and depreciation.

The UK's four network operators added a total of 1,886,009customers in January to December 1995 -- a 22-per-cent increase over the1,544,033 added in the previous year.  But in 1995 the demand wasspread out more evenly.The aggressive competition between dealers, retailers and off-the-pagecompanies during 1995 soaked up much of the demand for cellulartelephones in advance of December.  ``In 1995, it was a sale everymonth,'' said Nigel Salomon, marketing director of service providerSecuricor Cellular Services, ``how much more could happen atChristmas?''Executives say that many of the telephones bought in December 1994 weregift purchases which led to disconnection when their new ownersreceived their first bills.  They hope this December's new customerswill ``churn less but make more calls,'' according to David Savage,chairman of service provider Astec Communications.Who's number one? Vodafone's market leadership is under pressure fromits nearest rival Cellnet, which by the start of this month had only33,009 fewer subscribers.On January 1, Vodafone had a total of 2,333,009 subscribers compared toCellnet's figure of 2,300,000.  Cellnet has been gradually eroding itsrival's lead.  December was the sixth consecutive month in which itconnected more net new customers than Vodafone.  In December it gained89,100 net new customers compared to Vodafone's 53,800.Vodafone faced a major challenge from Cellnet this time last year butresponded aggressively to see off the challenge.  It will be hopingthat last week's launch by service providers of its restructured GSMtariffs will have a similar effect this year (Mobile Communications,185/1).Cellnet is thought unlikely to respond immediately to Vodafone's newpackage of per-second billing and ``bundled'' tariffs, which aresimilar to the existing packages offered by Orange.  Bundled tariffsoffer customers a certain number of calls as part of their monthlysubscription charge.  Cellnet has tested such tariffs but does notappear close to a launch.Cellnet last month withdrew its under-performing Frequent Caller PlusBudget Plan, the bundled GSM-only tariff for business users which hasnot proved popular.  The tariff will no longer be offered, althoughexisting subscribers can stay on it.  It offered a monthly subscriptioncharge of #45 in return for either 100 minutes of calls at peak rate or200 minutes at off peak, or a combination of the two.Orange's dream Christmas: Although Cellnet is Vodafone's main rival interms of total subscribers, one of the main reasons for the slowdown inits performance is the competition it faces from smaller rival Orange.Orange is focusing on the business market, which is much more importantto Vodafone than it is to Cellnet.  In December, Orange made 50,000 netnew connections, making this the third month in a row that it haspushed Vodafone close on new connections (Mobile Communications,183/7).Orange now has 380,000 subscribers and is close to overtaking itsnearest rival, Mercury One-2-One.  This company, which signed up 30,000subscribers in December, now has 397,000 subscribers.Overall, Vodafone trailed Cellnet on total connections over the 1995calendar year, with 695,009 against 740,000.  It also lost out to itsrival in 1994, making 585,911 connections compared to Cellnet's664,122.Last year, Orange and One-2-One added 280,000 and 171,000 net newsubscribers respectively.  This compares with figures of 100,000 and194,000 respectively in 1994, reflecting a considerable advance byOrange but a disastrous slump for One-2-One.Third quarter: Vodafone lost out particularly badly in the most recentquarter, October-December, when it connected 143,000 net newconnections -- well down on the predictions of industry analysts --against Cellnet's 215,000.  These compare with figures of 186,000 and281,200 respectively in 1994.Cellnet, however, showed a significant increase in churn in the lastquarter of 1995 compared with the same period last year -- although itsnet figures were down on 1994 its gross connections were up over theprevious year, 379,500 compared to 369,500.  Vodafone's churn alsoincreased.  Gross connections for the last three months of 1995 were286,000 compared to 313,000 last year.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996SPAIN FOLLOWS ITALIAN MODEL IN CELLULAR COMPENSATION PLANSThe Spanish government has drawn up a series of proposed measuresdesigned to compensate Airtel, the country's second GSM digitalcellular operator, for the Pta85 million ($702 million) fee it had topay to secure its licence.The government, which is understood to have finished putting togetherdraft proposals on December 28, is currently working with Airtel toproduce a final version of the plan.  The two sides expect to reach anagreement by the end of next month, if not before.This rate of progress so far appears to have been acceptable to theEuropean Commission, which had originally told the Spanish governmentto come up with a compensation plan by the end of December (MobileCommunications, 183/1).The Italian government, which was set a similar timetable by the EC, isone step ahead.  It has already completed its package of similarmeasures to compensate Italy's second GSM digital cellular operator,Omnitel, for its L750 billion ($475 million) licence fee.  Thispackage, which was announced on December 22, was worked out inagreement with the EC and is expected to receive its formal approval atthe end of this month.The two governments would have faced legal proceedings before theEuropean Court of Justice if they had failed to comply with the EC'sdemands.Spanish plan: The Spanish proposals centre on three core measures:reducing by up to 50 per cent the interconnection rates that Airtel hasto pay to use the network of the state-controlled Telefonica; allowingAirtel to build its own infrastructure or to use alternative infrastr-ucture; and awarding Airtel a concession to build and operate apersonal communications network (PCN) based on the DCS-1800 standard.The first two measures are based on suggestions put forward by Airtelitself last summer (Mobile Communications, 176/3).The proposals have been drafted under the aegis of Rienaldo Rodriguez,the director general of the communications branch of the ministry oftransport and communications, who was appointed to the task at thebeginning of November.At the moment it is unclear whether the Spanish government intends toadopt a mixture of all three measures, although this is consideredhighly likely given that the Italian government's EC-sanctioned packageis based on a combination of almost identical elements.Airtel -- which is owned by Airtouch of the USA (15.8 per cent), BT (6.3per cent) and a group of leading Spanish banks, utilities andconstruction groups, and which  launched commercial services on October3 (Mobile Communications, 179/1) -- had connected 8,000 subscribers byDecember 1, and 15,000 by the start of this month.  Telefonica Moviles,the cellular arm of Telefonica which was charged no fee for its GSMlicence, launched its digital service in July, and had connected 23,000customers by December 1 and 37,000 by January 1.The EC told the Spanish government last July that it would have to comeup with measures to enable Airtel to compete on an equal basis withTelefonica Moviles.  It placed a similar requirement on the Italiangovernment in respect of Omnitel and its state-controlled counterpartTelecom Italia Mobile (TIM).The EC considers the imposition of steep licence fees on new entrantsto the market to be potentially discriminatory if the incumbents do nothave to pay fees for the licences they already hold.  It says that inorder to rectify the situation, the governments concerned should eitherextract a licence fee from the incumbent cellular operators, orintroduce measures that will compensate the new entrant for the moneyit has already paid.Italian package: The Italian package, which was announced bytelecommunications minister Agostino Gambino, provides for Omnitel'sinterconnection fees to be reduced by 25 per cent this year and by thesame amount next year, which is expected to produce savings in theregion of L60 billion over the two-year period.  The first reduction ininterconnection fees took effect on January 1.Omnitel will also be granted a licence to offer PCN services based onthe DSC-1800 standard, and will be allowed to use alternativeinfrastructure as soon as legislation is in place to enable this.Omnitel says it is ``happy'' with the compensation package, a reactionthat has surprised several analysts who do not consider it aparticularly good deal.  Telecommunications analysts with merchant bankRobert Fleming Securities note that the L60 billion savings fromreduced interconnection fees hardly match the L750 billion that Omnitelpaid for its GSM licence in March 1994 (Mobile Communications, 146/3).In respect of allowing Omnitel to use alternative infrastructure,analysts point out that this is allowing Omnitel no more than thefreedom to which it would be entitled anyway, given that the Italiangovernment says it wants to liberalise alternative infrastructure thisyear in line with the timetable being pushed through by the EC (TelecomMarkets, 277/1).The Italian government has already stated its intention to awardlicences for PCN services by the middle of this year (MobileCommunications, 181/1).  But when Gambino announced the plans inOctober there was no indication that a licence would automatically beawarded to Omnitel.  At the time it was said that one licence would beautomatically granted to TIM and a second put out to competitivetender.Under the new deal, Omnitel will not be allowed to offer commercial PCNservices until 1998, and neither TIM nor any other competitor will beallowed to start PCN services before Omnitel has done so.  This putsback the start of PCN by about a year.  Last October, Gambino intimatedthat services would start on January 1 1997.Omnitel -- whose major shareholders include Olivetti (41.3 per cent),Airtouch (11.7 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (11.6 per cent), and whichstarted commercial services on December 7 (Mobile Communications,184/6) -- says that by January 7 it had signed about 50,000 subscribers. TIM had 417,855 GSM subscribers on January 1, and says that onDecember 22 alone it signed 23,633 new digital subscribers.Omnitel is now is the process of expanding its Spazio Omnitel retailstores.  The first four were opened on December 15 in Milan, Florence,Genoa and Brescia.  A further 20 stores are scheduled to be openedthroughout Italy by the end of this year, many through franchisingagreements.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S MOBILE DIRECTIVE IS FINALLY ADOPTEDThe European Commission yesterday (January 10) adopted the Article 90directive to liberalise mobile services and networks (MobileCommunications, 184/3).  A political decision had already been taken onDecember 20 but formal adoption was delayed by translationdifficulties.The directive will come into force before the end of February.  Once itcomes into force, the member states will be given nine months in whichto notify the Commission of the appropriate national measures taken toimplement the provisions.The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive andspecial rights in the mobile communications market and, wherever thishas not yet been achieved, to establish open and fair licensingprocedures to authorise the launch of GSM, DCS-1800 and DigitalEuropean Cordless Telecommunications (Dect) standard services.  Thenumber of licences should only be limited by `essential requirements'such as spectrum efficiency.Restrictions on current licensees will also have to be raised to allowthem to extend their services from one frequency into another.In particular, the entering into force of the directive will mean thatmember states will not be able to refuse to allocate licences forpublic access or telepoint applications for systems operating on thebasis of the Dect standard.Similarly, member states will not be able to restrict the combinationof mobile technologies, in particular where multistandard equipment isavailable.Nor will member states be able to refuse to allocate DCS-1800 licencesto either new operators or existing GSM operators.  But this aspect ofthe directive will not come into effect until January 1 1998.  Thedelay is being granted in order to give member states the option ofallowing new DCS-1800 operators time to establish themselves beforeexisting GSM operators jump in.Operators will also have the right to provide their own infrastructureand to make use of alternative infrastructure provided by third partiessuch as utility companies.  The Commission believes this to beparticularly important as it estimates that the cost of leasingtransmission capacity currently accounts for between 30 per cent and 50per cent of the revenues of a second operator.Member states with less developed networks -- Portugal, Greece, Spainand Ireland -- will be able to apply for derogations of the directivefor up to five years.  Luxembourg has already made it clear that it isnot interested in any derogation.Alternative networks: The Article 90 directive to open up alternativenetworks and establish full competition is currently being examined byvarious working groups and is likely to be adopted in February (MobileCommunications, 184/3).Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996OLIVETTI SHARE ISSUE FULLY SUBSCRIBEDOlivetti says that last month's L2,257 billion ($1.42 billion) shareissue, which closed on December 15, was almost fully subscribed with99.8 per cent of the offer taken up.  It intends to invest asignificant proportion of the money in Omnitel.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996LUXEMBOURG GETS SET TO AWARD SECOND GSM CELLULAR LICENCEThe Luxembourg ministry of communications this week invited potentialbidders to register initial expressions of interest in the country'ssecond GSM digital cellular telephone licence, which is to be awardedlater this year.  It says that eight or nine parties have already comeforward.The ministry will not reveal who the parties are.  But the Luxembourg-based Millicom International Cellular confirms that it has expressed aninterest in the licence while Airtouch of the USA says it isconsidering doing so.Interested parties will eventually be asked to put forward proposalsfor an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service.  But the ministry says that itwill award an integrated licence only if it receives a submission whichis sufficiently convincing.  Otherwise the licence will be GSM-only.However, the ministry will not be able to issue a tender, let alonegrant the second GSM licence, until parliament has agreed to end themonopoly of cellular services that is currently enjoyed by the state-owned P&T, which is already operating a GSM network alongside an olderNMT-450 analogue network.The cellular monopoly will be broken through enacting a newtelecommunications law which is intended to liberalise the country'sextremely closed market in advance of the European Union deadline ofallowing full competition by January 1 1998.The new telecommunications law will among other things create anindependent regulatory authority.  However, the ministry ofcommunications says it has no immediate plans to allow new operatorsinto any sector other than digital cellular.The government expects to present the new legislation to parliamentthis spring, and is confident the bill will be passed by the summer.At this point it will be able to issue an official licence tender,leading to the award of two GSM licences later in the year.  One willautomatically be given to the P&T, while the other will be awarded on acompetitive basis.The P&T will be eligible for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 licence.  Butlike the bidders for the second licence, it will have to put forwardproposals to justify this.  Otherwise it will get a GSM-only licence.The ministry has not yet revealed detailed licence terms, but it didgive a broad overview of certain elements when it announced its licenceplans towards the end of last month.  The process will involve thepayment of a competitive licence fee, although the ministry stressesthat this will be just one aspect of the selection procedure and thatit will not be running an auction.  Other important elements willinclude the speed of each bidder's proposed network roll-out and thenature of its tariff proposition.The P&T will have to pay a licence fee to match the one paid by the newentrant.  If both operators get the same type of licence, the fees willbe the same.  If one gets a GSM licence, and the other gets a GSM/DCS-1800 licence, then the P&T fee would be adjusted appropriately.The ministry is considering an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service becauseLuxembourg, with a population of 390,000, is too small a market tosupport two GSM networks and two DCS-1800 networks as well.The P&T's GSM network, which was launched in July 1993, had about27,500 subscribers by the start of this month.  The NMT-450 system,which was launched in 1983 and has been in decline for some time, hadabout 160.The only private involvement in the cellular market at the moment isthrough four service providers, which sell GSM services but notanalogue ones.  One of these, Mobilux, is equally owned by the P&T andby MIC.  The other three -- CMD, LTM and Satcom -- are wholly private.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996WEST EUROPEAN MARKET HITS NOVEMBER SLOWDOWNNovember proved to be a disappointing month for the west Europeancellular industry, with a relatively slow rate of growth, according tofigures collected by Mobile Communications.These show that the market added 769,721 net new subscribers during themonth, taking the total from 20,797,135 to 21,566,856, representinggrowth of 3.56 per cent.  The end-month total is 63-per-cent higherthan the 13,231,421 reached at the end of November 1994.The November growth figure compares with the October figure of 808,689(4.05 per cent) and the September figure of 708,037 (3.67 per cent).The equivalent growth figure for November 1994 was 494,680 (3.7 percent) (Mobile Communications, 162/5).The figures would have been influenced by the slow rate of growth inthe UK -- Europe's largest cellular market.  In the UK the Novembertotal of net new subscribers was 158,500, much the same as in November1994 when 165,000 were added (Mobile Communications, 162/2).  The UKgrowth rate for November was 3.15 per cent.Not all UK operators are experiencing the same growth.  DCS-1800operator Orange is adding almost as many customers as the much largerVodafone (Mobile Communications, 185/2).  Orange added 30,000 net newcustomers in November (to take its total to 330,000) compared to 42,500for Vodafone (to take its total to 2,279,209), 69,000 for Cellnet(total 2,210,900), and 17,000 for Mercury One-2-One (total 367,000).An increase in GSM handset prices in Norway following the end of a``commission war'' has caused growth to slow to about 3.83 per cent,well down on the spectacular growth rates over the summer (MobileCommunications, 179/6).The fastest growing markets in November were Ireland (9.36 per cent),Luxembourg (7.17 per cent), Spain (6.05 per cent), the Netherlands(5.48 per cent), Italy (4.69 per cent), Cyprus (4.40 per cent), France(4.21 per cent), and Germany (4.08 per cent).The Irish market has been particularly boosted by the growth of GSMsubscriptions.  The price of handsets has fallen substantiallyfollowing an increase in commission payments by Eircell, which ispreparing to face competition for the first time following the award ofa second GSM licence to Esat Digifone last October (MobileCommunications, 182/1).  Increased coverage has also boosted theattractiveness of GSM.In Italy, Spain and the Netherlands the launch of new GSM services hascontributed to the growth of local GSM markets as well as stimulatingcellular markets as a whole.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996INDIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY AWARDS REGIONAL GSM LICENCESThe Indian government has finally issued cellular licences for all ofthe 18 regional concessions where bids were placed, a process that wasthrown into disarray by the imposition in November of a cap on thenumber of licences that any one operator could hold.Several groups have not yet paid the first instalment of their licencefees, which were due on December 18.  But the delays are understood tobe temporary and therefore not a cause for concern.Groups that have yet to pay include Modicom for its Karnataka grade Alicence circle for which it offered Rs13,930 million ($393 million),the third highest bid placed (see table).  The Modicom group has alsonot yet paid the first instalment of its Punjab grade B licence circle,which cost it Rs12,660 million.All of the second-highest bidders have agreed to the government'srequirement that they match the fee placed by the highest bidders, asset out in the initial tender process (Mobile Communications, 179/3).Under the terms of the licence cap, a single operator can hold no morethan three licences in the grade A and B licence circles, which are themost attractive.  But there is no limit on the number of licences itcan hold in the less attractive C circles (Mobile Communications,183/4).The only groups hit by the cap were the US West-BPL group and Modicom.US West-BPL originally looked set to win five licences and Modicom fourlicences, all in grade A and B circles (Mobile Communications, 177/1).The operators were obliged, when decided which licence options to giveup, to retain those in circles where they had been the highest bidder.Modicom originally bid the highest in Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan andUtter Pradesh East.  So it had the choice of which of these licenceoptions it should give up.  It decided to relinquish its option on theRajasthan licence, which passed to Aircell Digilink, and to hold on tothe other three.But it was forced to give up Utter Pradesh East because its net worthdid not meet the minimum holding limit set down by the Department ofTelecommunications for any operator wishing to hold more than two ofthe top ranked licences.US West-BPL bid the highest in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and the secondhighest in Gujurat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.  So the group wasobliged to keep the first two, and then had the option of decidingwhich of the second two to relinquish.  It chose to retain the licencefor Maharashtra (Mobile Communications, 185/16).Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996CZECH GSM LICENCE CONTEST ATTRACTS WIDE INTERESTThe competition for a 49-per-cent stake in one of the two GSM digitalcellular telephone licences that are being awarded in the CzechRepublic has attracted initial expressions of interest from a total of18 companies (Mobile Communications, 180/1).The list of companies which have put in requests for tender documentsand submitted contributions to the consultation process containsseveral leading operators from Europe and North America and a number oflocal companies.The potential bidders include DeTeMobil, the McCaw Internationalcompany run by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, TelesystemInternational Wireless of Canada, TeleDanmark, France Telecom, RWETelliance, Skoda-Mannesmann, Southwestern Bell International, Telenor,Telecom Finland, Stet International, AirTouch, Vebacom, Tokyo-basedcommunications company Domen, Czech energy distributor Czechkom Plus,Czech energy generator CEZ, and two other Czech companies JITY andTelekomunikace Montaze.Many of the companies on the list are now involved in negotiations toform consortia before the final deadline for applications at thebeginning of February.  TeleDanmark and Telenor have already announcedthat they will be making a joint bid, with TeleDanmark taking the lead.A government-appointed committee will evaluate the bids during Februaryand March.  Following the submission of its recommendations a finalgovernment decision is expected to be made before the end of March.The winner will become the junior partner to the state-controlled radioinfrastructure operator Ceske Radiokomunikace, which has already beengiven a 51-per-cent stake in the new operating organisation that hasbeen awarded one of the GSM licences.The other GSM licence has already been promised to the existing NMT-450operator Eurotel -- which is owned by Czech telecommunications operatorSPT (51 per cent), US West (24.5 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (24.5 percent).  A 27-per-cent stake in SPT is held by a joint venture betweenKPN of the Netherlands and Swiss PTT Telecom.Bidding process: Any consortium bidding for the 49-per-cent stakealongside Ceske Radiokomunikace will have to be controlled by a foreigncompany because the government has specified that a leading role mustbe played by a `qualified operator' with a minimum of 300,000 cellularsubscribers.According to Vladimir Sedlacek, director of telecommunications policyat the ministry of economics, the main criteria for choosing thewinning consortium to partner Ceske Radiokomunikace will be the abilityto deliver low tariffs, good coverage, quick roll-out and high levelsof investment.  The licence fee will be set low to reflect thesepriorities, at about $12 million or $13 million.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996POLISH GSM CONTEST LIMPS ONMeanwhile, there has been a much less enthusiastic response to thecontest for two GSM licences in Poland, with only three consortiasubmitting bids by the closing date of January 3.One consortium contains Polish oil refiner Petrochemia Plock, coppermining group KGHM Polska Miedz and the Polish Power Grid Company inpartnership with TeleDanmark and AirTouch.Another includes Polish state-owned chemical company Ciech Warszawa,together with smaller Polish partners alongside Stet.The third is led by Polish trading company Elektrim together with othersmaller partners and US West.The winning bidders are expected to be announced by the end ofFebruary.The number of contenders has been limited partly by the shortage ofsizeable Polish partners capable of taking the required 51-per-centdomestic stake that a bidding consortium must have in order to qualifyfor the contest (Mobile Communications, 180/9).  Another factor hasbeen the size of the licence fee, with bidders being asked to payEcu100 million ($78.54 million) at the outset and additional annualpayments after that.Bidders may also have been frightened off by the legal dispute betweenthe Polish government on the one hand, and France Telecom and Ameritechon the other.  The two foreign operators, which partner the state-ownedtelecommunications operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) in thecountry's existing NMT-450 Centertel cellular operator, say that thegovernment has gone back on a promise to award Centertel one of the GSMlicences (see below).One potential contender which did not submit a bid was the consortiumheaded by Polish computer company Optimus and including TelecomFinland, Veba Telecom, Kinnevik of Sweden and Millicom InternationalCellular of Luxembourg.  This group collapsed just before Christmasafter the foreign partners pulled out, citing the high licence fee asthe reason.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996CELLULAR LOSERS MOUNT LEGAL ACTIONThis week France Telecom followed Ameritech in announcing that it wouldtake legal action against the Polish government for failing to honour a1991 pledge to grant Centertel a GSM licence (Mobile Communications,180/9).Both operators have asked the International Court of Justice in theHague to set up arbitration proceedings.France Telecom is seeking around $500 million in damages to compensateit for investment in Centertel's infrastructure as well as the loss offuture earnings.The Polish government is believed to have suggested to the Centertelpartners that it could instead offer them the DCS-1800 licence it isplanning to award towards the end of 1996.  However, the decision ofthe two foreign operators to initiate legal action suggests thatneither was impressed by this proposal.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996THIRD GSM OPERATOR FOR ESTONIAA third GSM licence was awarded in Estonia on December 18 to theRitabell joint venture between Millicom International Cellular (48 percent) and Estonian media company Levicom (52 per cent).  Luxembourg-based Millicom International Cellular has management control over thejoint venture.  The new service will be launched in the second half of1996.There are already three networks in Estonia, run by two operators.Semi-state-owned Eesti Mobiiltelefon -- which is a consortium of EestiTelecom, Telia and Telecom Finland -- runs an NMT-450 network (launchedin 1991) and a GSM network (launched in 1993).

At the beginning of October,Estonia had a total of 25,400 cellular subscribers and a penetrationrate of 1.6 per cent (Mobile Communications, 183/5).Millicom says that Estonia may be a small country but that it isshowing a lively rate of growth and is capable of supporting a thirdGSM operator.  It suggests that a GSM network in the region may requireonly 10,000 to 15,000 subscribers to be viable.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996FCC STAGES BILLION-DOLLAR PCS FREQUENCY AUCTIONThe second Federal Communications Commission auction of PersonalCommunications Services (PCS) radio frequencies in the USA hadattracted top bids totalling $1.38 billion by the end of last week.The largest single bid of $225 million was submitted by North CoastMobile Communications for the New York licence area, the largest onoffer covering a potential 18 million users.The highest total bids came from PersonalConnect Communications, theventure backed by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, with offerstotalling $278 million in five licence areas.In this `C' block auction, which is aimed at entrepreneurs rather thanmajor telecom-munications players, the country is divided into a totalof 493 licence areas, known as Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  The winnerin each BTA, roughly the size of a US county, will receive 30 MHz ofradio frequencies.Last year, the FCC sold off 30 MHz of radio frequencies in its `A' and`B' block auction but in far larger licence areas known as MajorTrading Areas (MTAs).  This auction, which attracted bids from theindustry's major players and lasted three-and-a-half months, raised atotal of $7.73 billion (Mobile Communications, 168/8).The C block auction, which started in December and will probably runfor at least another month, started with 293 companies and still has255 on board.  When it is finished, the FCC will decide when to selloff the smaller D, E and F frequency blocks of 10 MHz each.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996LATIVIAN AUTHORITIES TO SELECT WINNER OF GSM LICENCELatvia: Meanwhile, the Latvian authorities are due at the end of thismonth to select the winner of the contest for a second GSM licence.

Its decision to award only four leaves two nationalblocks of frequency unallocated -- one of 30 MHz and one of 10 MHz.  Noofficial explanation has yet been given for the decision.  But IndustryCanada is due to publish a report later this month outlining itsreasons and also giving details of the licence conditions and thespectrum transition policy which have not yet been released.The Industry Canada decisions also represent a more mainstream approachthan expected.  During the contest, the department had stressed that itwished to encourage innovation and competition as priorities, and thatit was willing to consider dividing up the frequency blocks on aregional basis (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  But it is believed tohave been disappointed by the lack of new ideas exhibited in thesubmissions.  These tended to be fairly similar, retaining a stronghigh-mobility voice-telephony emphasis.  As none of the outsidersdistinguished themselves sufficiently technologically, the licencesended up going to the safe options.Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network were generally held to be two of thethree main candidates for national 30 MHz licences (MobileCommunications, 181/6). The third favourite, TeleZone, a telepointlicensee in which Bell Atlantic and AirTouch are strategic investors,received nothing.  It has already announced that as a result it will belaying off half of its staff.  It is believed that the company isconsidering an appeal and may close down completely if it does notobtain a licence.  Industry Canada says that there is no formal appealprocess, but that it is always possible to make representations.Commentators suggest that TeleZone did not win a licence because it didnot provide a sufficiently regional focus to its application.Clearnet PCS is a Canadian operator of enhanced specialised mobileradio (ESMR) services in which substantial stakes are held by Motorolaand US ESMR operator Nextel.  Clearnet has still to make a technologychoice.  It has been trialling Nortel's GSM-based PCS technology andMotorola's Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in Ontario.Microcell Network is a telepoint licensee (Mobile Communications,163/6) with shareholders including National Telesystem (which has acontrolling stake in international operator Teleglobe), Sprint Canada,CUC Broadcasting and others.  Microcell Network is thought likely toopt for a GSM-based PCS system although no technology decision has yetbeen announced.Existing cellular operators Rogers Cantel and Mobility PersonacomCanada did as well as they could expect with 10 MHz each.  They wereunable to apply for 30 MHz blocks because they are subject to aspectrum cap (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  No technology decisionshave yet been announced by these two operators.  Both are expected tomake use of the new spectrum to relieve areas of high congestion ontheir existing networks.There is speculation that the 40 MHz of spectrum that Industry Canadahas held back might also end up going to Rogers Cantel and MobilityPersonacom Canada once their spectrum caps expire in three years' time. According to one industry commentator this solution would give newoperators Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network a head start but wouldthen at the end of the three-year period create a level playing fieldwith each of the four PCS operators ending up with 30 MHz of spectrum.PCS services are expected to be launched by 1997 at the latest,initially in the main urban areas of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.This would initially involve cellular voice services although moreinnovative applications are likely to be introduced at a later stage.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996TWO COULD BE COMPANY FOR VODAFONE AND AIRTOUCHA merger between AirTouch of the USA and Vodafone of the UK, theworld's two leading international cellular operators, would offerconsiderable benefits to both, according to an investment report fromUK securities house Robert Fleming.The report, published at the end of last month, argues that a mergerwould create major economies of scale, particularly in Europe where thenew company, which Robert Fleming calls AirFone, would run cellularnetworks in virtually every country.  Airfone would also have a majorpresence in the US and Asia-Pacific regions.In Europe, the merged company would be in a strong position to extractbetter interconnection terms from fixed network operators or even,depending on EU regulations, to build its own long-distance andinternational links to carry cellular traffic between its nationaloperations.  Such a move would substantially improve margins on calls.In addition, a merged company would be able to generate increasedrevenues from users roaming across Europe by requiring its customers toroam only to its own networks, thus reducing the scale of outpaymentsmade to other operators.The two companies would also have a stronger say in the running of theGlobalstar satellite venture, in which both are currently involved asindividual shareholders.Robert Fleming foresees little opposition to a merger from existingshareholders, many of whom, such as US financial institutions Fidelityand Capital Research, are already investors in both companies.Discussion of the merits of a possible AirTouch-Vodafone alliance --which is not thought to be an imminent prospect -- is the result ofinvestor concern over the weakness of Vodafone's share price sinceNovember.  This weakness, which has been largely caused by fears aboutthe increased level of competition that Vodafone is facing in the UK,has led to concern that the company could be becoming undervalued,prompting analysts to examine a number of ways in which the real worthof the company could be more properly realised.  But any proposal for amerger would probably have to wait at least until the retirement ofVodafone's chairman and chief executive, Sir Gerry Whent, in two years'time.Other recent analyst suggestions on how to unlock Vodafone's value haveincluded proposals for a demerger of its international business fromits UK operation.  It is argued that this would allow the hidden valueof the international business to be realised.  But a demerger isdismissed by Robert Fleming as unrealistic, on the grounds that such amove would run counter to the global trend for consolidation in thecellular industry and would also expose Vodafone's relatively weakposition in the UK.More likely is the idea of spinning off individual foreign operationsin which Vodafone holds a stake.  Aside from profitability, Vodafonewould also have to secure the support of other shareholders before aflotation could take place.  Candidates for such a strategy, whichwould not happen at least until next year, would include Greek GSMoperator Panafon and Vodafone's Australian GSM operator, which is alsocalled Vodafone.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996ONE IN FOUR USERS UNHAPPYOne in four of those cellular users who pay their own bills now regretbuying their telephones, according to a survey by the Consumers'Association which criticises poor quality service and unreliableequipment.

This is already the subject of an Office of Fair Tradinginquiry (Mobile Communications, 184/1).

These will now be bridged byproviding coverage on major roads linking its regional networks -- anarrangement which is allowed under Wavelength's regional licences.The company will continue to target the traditional pamr market oftransport or service companies and will not attempt to branch out toconsumers.``Wavelength's move should boost competition in the UK pamr market,''said one observer.  ``National Band Three has better coverage andcapacity because it has more transmitters and leased lines.  ButWavelength, with less infrastructure, might be cheaper.''Wavelength, which has 5,000 users, has been expanding since itstakeover in 1994 by Telesystem International Wireless (TIW), a Canadiancompany that invests in mobile communications ventures (MobileCommunications, 156/6).In the autumn of 1994, TIW won six out of nine regional pamr licencesawarded by the Department of Trade and Industry (Mobile Communications,159/5).Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996UK RADIO AGENCY SET TO LICENSE DIY SERVICESThe Radiocommunications Agency will next week (January 18) allow UKusers to run their own limited mobile radio services when it issues thefirst licences for Short Range Business Radio (SRBR) services.The new licences, which will cost #30 for three years, will enableusers to use analogue SRBR handsets to provide themselves with radioand paging services over a range of up to 400 metres, without the needfor infrastructure.  The technology is suitable for locations such asbuilding sites, hospitals or industrial estates.The agency expects eventually to be issuing about 500 licences a year,although by this week it had received only one application.The licences should prove attractive since the only cost of the newservice, after having paid the licence fee, will be the purchase ofhandsets and paging units.  Users do not incur any airtime, connectionor rental costs.Motorola will next week launch Handie-Com, the first SRBR productrange.  Motorola was one of the main manufacturers behind the much-delayed technology.SRBR is linked to a similar technology, known as Digital Short RangeRadio (DSRR), which the Department of Trade and Industry had wanted tosee implemented as long ago as 1990 (Mobile Communications, 184/11).Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996GERMAN GROUP WINS IN AUSTRIAThe O-Call consortium, led by Deutsche Telekom (25 per cent) andSiemens Austria (19.8 per cent), has won the licence to operateAustria's second GSM digital cellular telephone network.

In introducing Mobile Communications Report, we're respondingto the clear mandate of our satellite readers to expand ourcoverage of nonsatellite mobile communications.  The mobilesatellite industry always has been best understood within thecontext of its "allied and competing" industries (as we had dubbedthem in our regular Mobile Satellite Reports feature).  Now,responding to your requests and to the rapid changes taking placein mobile communications as a whole, we have created MobileCommunications Report.     Our mission is simply stated:  To continue to provide theindustry with the sharpest, most concise and most accurate news andanalysis anywhere.  It's what Warren Publishing has been doing formore than 50 years.  We will remain the acknowledged authority onthe mobile satellite industry.  We'll apply the same standards toour fuller treatment of terrestrial mobile communications.     A final pledge:  Mobile Communications Report, like all ofWarren's publications, never will be something that adds to yourburden of keeping up.  You already have "too much to read."  Wepride ourselves on providing newsletters that our readers want toread -- because our work is thoughtfully planned, accuratelywritten and meticulously edited.

Warren     Associate Publisher and         Senior EditorBack to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SECOND FCC PCS AUCTION AT TWICE BIDDING PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEARAGO     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace, with 293companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds 2 weeks ago,easily eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richercompanies sought 99 licenses.  Round 4 ended Dec. 21 with$1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs. $678.9 million through same stagein earlier auction.  Although licenses cover same territory,industry observers suggested smaller service areas in Block Ccoupled with repeated delays in launching sales may be contributingto faster pace.  "There is a lot of pent-up demand for theselicenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC Auctions Div.  Auction wasto resume Jan. 5 if govt. shutdown has ended.     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" andFCC was forced to move Stage 2 bidding rules until after holidaybreak, Ham told us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with$166.9 million in net revenue from high bids, although AtlantaTrunking's erroneous bid of $125 million skewed numbers.  Withoutwithdrawal of payment owed by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is$60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham said Stage 2 rules require companiesto bid on 75% of eligible pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, orface reduction in eligibility.  Auction staff will review biddingpace after sale resumes -- Jan. 2, if govt. has reopened -- shesaid.     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushedback start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,with further one-week delay in first govt. shutdown.  Ham saidpent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probablycontributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief MicheleFarquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in smallpackages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also maycontribute to speed of bidding in current sale.     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smallerterritories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused onrevenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered morethan one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is gearedto Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reasonfor size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for bigcompanies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, usingability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority Partner. "This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," hetold us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he saidU.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, hasbacking from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wirelessentrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-ConnectCommunications of Seattle.  To qualify, companies had to haverevenues under $125 million for last 2 years, and assets below $500million, but Shosteck said several companies had up-front payments-- in cash -- of more than $50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 millionand NextWave, which is thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79million.  At end of auction, he said, small companies that bid"will sell out" to larger companies, leading to news stories onsuccess of entrepreneurs.     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop comparedwith other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) inWashington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million forL.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  InBlock A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. andSan Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Mostpaid $10-$15.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996U.S. POSITION ON FUTURE STRUCTURE OF INTELSAT IS IMMINENT     U.S. is set to finalize position on future structure ofIntelsat as soon as it returns from shutdown, Michael Fitch ofState Dept. Office of International Communications & InformationPolicy (ICIP) told recent FCBA conference in Washington.  When U.S.position is completed, he said, process of changing organizationcan be accelerated.  U.S. has proposed creating one or moreseparate Intelsat affiliates to compete for new services such asmobile, direct-to-home, VSAT, other broadband applications. PanAmSat has said organization should be split into 3-4 companiesto ensure fair competition.  ICIP head Vonya McCann said "there'sno question that if member governments created [Intelsat andInmarsat] today, they would be different."  She said belief wheninternational satellite organizations were established that singlenation or company couldn't operate satellites has been "shattered"by advances in technologies and economies.     PanAmSat lawyer Henry Goldberg said that "given themarketplace, we don't need intergovernmental treaty organizations"to provide satellite capacity.  Comsat Gen. Counsel Warren Zegersaid current plan would have 51% of affiliates owned bynon-Intelsat signatories.  Similar Inmarsat affiliate -- ICO -- isowned almost entirely by Inmarsat and its signatories.  Zeger saidissues involving ownership and governance of affiliates should beresolved in time to conclude situation at Assembly of Parties in1997.  Goldberg told us after panel that he doubts U.S. is stillconsidering divestiture, but is hopeful it will decide on creatingmultiple affiliates instead of just establishing single affiliatefor new services.     On separate issue, industry again rejected auctions as meansof resolving mutually exclusive applications in satellite area. Auctions in U.S. "could set off a chain reaction" across world,Iridium Vp Leo Mondale said.  Systems such as Big LEO that Iridiumproposes "will never get investors because of the uncertainty" ofcosts and ability to acquire licenses in auctions, he said:  "Whatwe're really concerned about is the open-endedness of the auctionprocess."  Auctions in more than 200 countries could kill satelliteprograms, Comsat's Zeger said.     Mark Grannis, FCC International Bureau legal adviser, saidauctions are fast and efficient and asked whether there's betterway to resolve mutual exclusivity.  While panelists didn't offeralternatives, we're told industry was prepared to offer several atBureau's scheduled policy roundtable that was cancelled because ofgovt. shutdown.  Roundtable tentatively has been rescheduled forJan. 10 at FCC hq.  Sources said members of Satellite IndustryAssn. haven't reached consensus on what policies to advance, socompanies will offer their ideas individually.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BOEING'S ZENIT-BASED SEA LAUNCH VENTURE GETS ORDER FROM HUGHES     Hughes ordered up to 10 launches from Boeing, which plans touse Ukrainian Zenit rockets launched from sea-based platform tobeat prices offered by other providers.  U.S. signed agreement onDec. 15 that will allow up to 20 American-built satellites to bedeployed on Ukrainian boosters.  Under accord, Boeing-led SeaLaunch consortium can launch up to 15 satellites and Ukraine itselfas many as 5.  Boeing is lead partner in Sea Launch, which plans tomarket launch service to global customers.  Hughes, which saidfirst flight will be in 1998, was awarded $1-billion contract tolaunch satellites of Inmarsat affiliate ICO, which Hughes isbuilding.  It said it's considering using Zenit for one or more ICOsatellites.     Hughes signed similar agreement with McDonnell Douglas to useits planned Delta 3 rocket for up to 10 launches in 1998-2005period.  "Sea Launch is another solution to what we see as a needfor assured access to launch vehicles and launch slots over thenext few years," Hughes Space & Communications Chmn. Donald Cromersaid.  He said Hughes launch costs will be reduced because, amongother things, Sea Launch will maintain home port in nearby LongBeach, which will reduce shipping expenses.     Sea Launch consortium will be licensed under authority ofFAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), Dir. FrankWeaver told reporters Dec. 19.  Home port for Sea Launch is LongBeach and launches will be from special ship operating ininternational waters using Ukrainian Zenit boosters.  Weaver saidOCST derives its authority over company because Boeing is U.S.corporation that has critical role in project.  Situation isdifferent from Lockheed Krunichev Energia (LKE) venture thatlaunches Western payloads on Russian Proton, Weaver said, becauseLockheed's role is limited to marketing.  OCST doesn't license LKElaunches.  Weaver said OCST will inspect Sea Launch hardware andprocedures to ensure safety, and additional approvals may berequired from other U.S. agencies such as Coast Guard and MaritimeCommission.     Ukraine is allowed to launch up to 20 U.S.-built satellites,Weaver said, but final number depends on how robust internationallaunch market is over next few years.  He said low-end projectionsindicate there will be about 20 internationally competitive flightsper year, with high-end figure around 30.  Under agreement, ifmarket averages 24 launches in 1996-1999, Ukraine can fly up to 5satellites itself and international joint venture with key U.S.partner (such as Sea Launch) can send up 11 geostationary birds. If there are 24 or more launches per year on average during period,Ukraine can fly up to 6 satellites, while venture has authority tolaunch 14.  Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites will be handledseparately, but Weaver said U.S. intends to ensure that Americanproviders are given "fair consideration."  Globalstar has deal(part cash, part contribution of services) to launch several of itsLEO satellites on Zenit.     Meanwhile, Weaver said OCST plans to release first part of2-part notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in March on proposalsto streamline and simplify procedures at federal launch ranges andto detail financial responsibilities of govt. and private sectorfor commercial launches.  He said date for release of 2nd NPRMhasn't been determined, but OCST will propose rules for proceduresat "purely commercial spaceports," which have been proposed in 5states.  It also will include proposed safety rules for plannedreusable launch vehicles, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wirelessinterconnection that would mandate interim use of "bill-&-keep" asreimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep, each carrier terminatescalls for others at no charge.  Commissioners said at final meetingof 1995 that bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is ofessence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economicallyperfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissionersthat interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as theinfrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency isconcerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rulesrequire "mutual compensation" but don't set more specificrequirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administrativelysimple," Keeney said.  It doesn't require setting up new billingsystems.     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaningLECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but thatsituation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, havecomplained that LECs are charging them inflated prices forterminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCCaction, telephone companies will be able to impede development ofPCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,Commission will seek comments on other options such as settinguniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs toterminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up withbetter system "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got tobe speedy."     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCCcompensation proposal that it said would result in decreased feesto wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said thatunder current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECsfor terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECsdon't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIAPres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECsmore than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee canonly act to impede development of wireless as a competitive localexchange service," he said.     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren'tstepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to setcompensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as waseagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationshipwith the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affectingstate PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastatetraffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adoptinterconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatorycommissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.     Commission tentatively concluded that information onLEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public andwill take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, publicdisclosure report or other approach.  Agency also will seek commenton whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECsand all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited toarrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellularand specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules tointerconnection between LECs and PCS providers.     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Goldencalled FCC action "an important step for making a right thatexisted in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applaudedCommission for "doing something fast and simple" rather thanfollowing "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC hastaken so far to promote local telephone competition."

In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) in Oak Brook, Ill.on December 14 filed a petition with the FCC to establish anationwide air-to-ground data network.  In-Flight was established by Jack Goeken, the founder of Airfone,which has installed passenger phones on thousands of airplanes.Goeken also was one of the founders of MCI Communications Corp.  The company has asked for a developmental/experimental license thatwould be the forerunner of a commercial digital data-only service in1990. IFPC plans to install a 6" x 4" LCD on the back of each seat,above the drop-down tray. Buttons that are dedicated to specific dataapplications would be positioned around the screen. Also, an RJ-11jack would be installed next to the LCD.  A small phone -- dramatically smaller than the current GTE Airfonemodel -- would be attached on the side of each seat, says DimitriosLalos, vice president of engineering at In-Flight. A raisedalphanumeric keypad and cursor keys would be included on the back ofthe phone's handset. A PC to control the onboard network would beinstalled on the aircraft.  In its FCC filing, the company says six data services forpassengers will be test marketed:  1. Stock quotations selected  by passengers from New York andChicago exchanges.  2. Video games, where passengers use cursor keys on the telephonehandset to control the actions. To avoid complaints by passengers whomight be bothered by the sounds emanating from the games, users willhave to use headphones. The game chips probably would be stored inIn-Flight's onboard PC.  3. Connecting flight information that might be displayed 30 minutesbefore the plane lands.  4. Radio paging for passengers who register with In-Flight viatheir seat computer after boarding the plane. Passengers couldreceive alphanumeric pages from callers using a toll-free telephonenumber. IFPC would control the airborne paging operation; the companyhasn't discussed any tie-ins with existing national or local pagingcompanies.  5. Obtaining airline information from the North American OfficialAirline Guides.  6. Miscellaneous services, such as catalogue shopping, accessingdatabases with laptop computers and sending faxes. Initially, faxeswill only be outgoing, from an In-Flight fax machine on the aircraftor through a passenger's own PC-based fax card.  The company also sees a large demand for making or reconfirminghotel and rental car reservations. The LCDs will include severalbuttons that are dedicated to specific applications, includingreservations. Step-by-step instructions would be shown on the LCD.  In addition to these third-party services, the airline crew coulduse the system for transmitting messages to passengers. Thesemessages could include the traditional pre-flight safety spiels, thechoices of meals and beverages and, possibly, advertising.  The prices for many of these applications haven't been set, but thecompany is looking at about $2 per transaction, says Bob Rubens, vicepresident of airline relations at IFPC. For example, $2 would becharged for confirming or reconfirming hotel or rental carreservations. Receiving radio pages during the flight might becheaper, perhaps $2 for an unlimited number of messages, says Rubens.Additional charges might be assessed for priority service to skipahead of the queue.  The first network would operate with frequency shift keying at1,200 bits/second, upgrading in 1991 to 9,600 bits/second, saysLalos. In-Flight's proposal calls for building 25 ground stationsnear major airports and 17 at other locations in the United States.All the stations would be near GTE Airfone base stations.  IFPC has requested the use of one subchannel from each of tenchannels used by Airfone under Airfone's experimental license. Thechannels would be in 849/850 MHz and 894/895 MHz. Each of the 800 MHzchannels is divided into 31 subchannels, but the first subchannel isnot now used by Airfone, Lalos says.  Every subchannel pair would be 6 KHz incoming and 6 KHz outgoing --for a total of 120 KHz. Airfone has been allocated a total of 4 MHzfor its phone service.  In-Flight is requesting this relatively small bandwidth allocationbecause it wants to get up and running as quickly as possible; byusing Airfone's existing network, it can do so. IFPC is concernedthat other companies could beat it to the punch with services to keeppassengers entertained.  Methods of providing in-flight movies, games and informationservices have been under development for several years by suchcompanies as Avicom International, Air Vision and Transcom. They'veall explored tie-ins with air-to-ground telephone service.  (Mobile Data Report's first issue in September 1988 featured anitem on Air Video, a Toronto firm developing an "Entray" computerizedgame screen.) In-Flight has discussed the possibility of jointventures with these firms.  "This revolution in the in-flight aircraft environment cannot berealized, however, without the development of an ATG [air-to-ground]network which can provide the data communications necessary tosupport new services sought by the airline industry," says IFPC's FCCpetition.  Although In-Flight has asked the FCC to use Airfone's frequencies,Goeken really prefers to obtain his own channels. After five years ofservice, Airfone's allocation is still considered developmental. TheFCC is expected to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Februaryor March that would provide a permanent allocation.  The possibilities include: giving the entire 4 MHz to Airfone,allocating 2 MHz to Airfone and 2 MHz to another licensee or allowingseveral companies to share the 4 MHz. Obviously, Airfone would preferto receive the entire allocation. In-Flight also wants a piece of thespectrum for voice service.  In August, IFPC filed comments at the FCC for an air-to-groundservice that would use 2 MHz. The comments replied to a Notice ofProposed Rulemaking issued by the Commission. IFPC is also talking upthe sharing option, where possibly more than two companies wouldoffer service on 4 MHz.  In addition, In-Flight is considering the possibility of offeringits services via an existing satellite vendor, says Rubens. Hedeclines to name the vendor, but Inmarsat's satellite network couldprobably transmit the data.                              *********                   Goeken's Travails With Airfone  For years, Jack Goeken has been talking publicly and privatelyabout offering data and other value-added services over Airfone. Whenhe was at the helm, Airfone had conducted a few experiments withtransmitting data. The company used modems to transmit electronicmail and electrocardiographs. A few years ago, Goeken had announcedthat the "next generation" of Airfone telephones would include an RJ-11 jack.  However, GTE decided not to provide a computer connection. In fact,it decided not to offer a variety of services that Goeken had wanted.In February 1989, he resigned from the company and filed a breech ofcontract suit against Airfone, seeking release from the non-competeclause of his contract.  The DuPage County [Ill.] Circuit Court ruled in favor of Goeken,stating that GTE Corp. and GTE Airfone had "committed numerousmaterial breeches of the stock purchase agreement." As a result,Goeken is free from all of the stipulations in his contract and islegally able to establish a competitive air-to-ground network.  GTE Airfone is working on reply comments for the FederalCommunications Commission on In-Flight Phone Corp.'s data networkand, therefore, won't discuss Goeken's plans. However, "we definitelysee that there is a demand out there [for air-to-ground dataservices] and we're cognizant of that fact," says Kevin Petschow, apublic relations spokesperson for Airfone.  What type of data services would Airfone offer? "We're still in theearly stage of figuring that out," Petschow says.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE DATA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1990HUGHES AIRCRAFT ENTERS MOBILE DATA MARKETAS SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR FOR RUGGEDIZED USES  A familiar name in the military hardware market is entering themobile data industry as a systems integrator. Hughes Aircraft inCarlsbad, Calif. is developing a line of "portable informationequipment" for military and commercial applications that generallyrequire rugged products and relatively fast data rates.  The new venture is under the aegis of Hughes' industrial productsdivision and will capitalize on the company's expertise in buildingcathode ray tubes and other types of displays, test equipment and avariety of electronic gear.  As part of its entry into mobile data, Hughes obtained theexclusive worldwide rights to develop military and heavy-dutycommercial products using Reflection Technology's Private Eye display(see Mobile Data Report, September 11, 1989).  Private Eye allows users to view a 12-inch image floating in frontof one eye while looking through a tiny display with the other eye.The display, which features red characters on a black background, iscontained in a 1" x 1" x 3" device that can be held up to the eye orattached to headsets, eye glasses, etc.  Reflection Technology sees its product as supplementing orreplacing a variety of displays or hard copy output, such as pagerLCDs, laptop computer screens and paper printouts from facsimilemachines.  By wearing the device attached to a headset, doctors could seereadouts from medical monitors or scanned images, stockbrokers couldwatch especially important real-time data without having to look at aspecific CRT and military field commanders could scan computerprojections and maps while watching the battlefield action.  Eliminating traditional displays or paper output wouldsignificantly reduce the size and weight of computer devices whileincreasing the battery life, says Jim Bradley, assistant divisionmanager of Hughes' industrial products division. Bradley is programmanager for the company's portable information equipment venture.Private Eye offers a "unique way" of displaying images with asatisfactory resolution in a small package and with low powerrequirements, he says.  However, Hughes won't "fall in love" with any display; it will usewhatever is appropriate, Bradley says. Another appropriate technologyfor certain mobile data is computer voice recognition. By building adevice that recognizes voice commands, the keyboard could beeliminated. This further decreases size and weight.  These advances in display and voice recognition technologies willproduce new types of products that will create new markets for whichtoday's heavier computers are now unacceptable, he says.  Although the military is an obvious market for portable datadevices, "we know it takes ten to 12 years to get anything into thefield," he says. There's good and bad news for companies that want tosell this type of equipment to the military. On one hand, funding fornew projects is less than in previous years. On the other hand, theDepartment of Defense (DOD) is placing increasing emphasis oncomputer-aided maintenance and logistics.  For both military and commercial use, Hughes sees a significantmarket for "portable maintenance manuals," ranging in size fromproducts that can hang on a belt to more sophisticated handhelds.With radio frequency links, maintenance personnel can access hostcomputer databases. Indeed, some DOD people have been describing themaintenance manual of the future as a laptop computer that you carryaround, says Bradley.  Agilis Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. has been talking about thisapplication since the company was founded. Agilis' rugged mobilecomputer is the type of product that Hughes has evaluated. NeitherHughes nor Agilis will comment on the potential of a formalrelationship.  However, if Hughes wants products that can be attached to a belt,Agilis would have to develop smaller products. Interestingly, RogerHiggins, vice president of marketing at Agilis, has been speculating(just humorously?) about "computers that you wear."  Hughes isn't an expert in commercial RF networks; "we're a hardwaremanufacturer," Bradley says. He's is especially interested in spreadspectrum transmission because it doesn't require a license from theFederal Communications Commission. Agilis and Telesystems SLW in DonMills, Ontario are among the companies with spread spectrum productsfor mobile local area networks.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE DATA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1990IBM MIGHT DEBUT TERMINAL IN FIRST QUARTERFOR HIGHER-END TERRESTRIAL, SATELLITE DATA  IBM, which has been working on a mobile data system forConsolidated Freightways, will publicly announce its new mobile datacomputers sometime during the first quarter of this year, says JohnPemberton, program director for mobile technologies at the GartnerGroup, Inc. in Stamford, Conn. In an online alert to his clients,Pemberton says Geostar Corp. might be the first customer for IBM'svehicular PCs, which would supplement Sony Corp.'s satellitereceivers.  An article in the January 3 issue of The Wall Street Journalreported that IBM's product is likely to replace Sony's receiver.That was a misquote, says Pemberton. IBM's computer will be targetedat customers who want a more powerful machine, he says. (Of course,IBM is known for developing numerous products in its laboratoriesthat are never commercially marketed or are sold only to a limitednumber of customers.)  Sony is "definitely in the [mobile satellite terminal] business forthe long haul," says Shelley Donlon, marketing administrator at Sonyin Park Ridge, N.J. The company will continue to develop terminalsfor Geostar, though it has no plans to produce units for othersatellite vendors, she says. Sony won't comment on IBM developments.  Before releasing his predictions, Pemberton didn't receive anydirect confirmation from IBM, he tells Mobile Data Report. That'scertainly not unusual, since IBM rarely says anything about productsbefore they are announced. What was somewhat unusual to Pemberton,though, was that sources at the computer giant not only didn't refutehis claims but seemed to have encouraged him to publish them, hesays.  Pemberton says he was spurred to make the announcementsome of his clients who were briefed by IBM about the product. Forexample, IBM contacted a delivery company with more than 50,000vehicles that might participate in a pilot program. Several companiescontacted by Mobile Data Report said IBM had asked them to visit BocaRaton, Fla. where the developmental work is being conducted.  It's no secret -- though the parties involved have treated it asone -- that IBM has been developing a mobile computer forConsolidated (see Mobile Data Report, September 11, 1989). Some 100vehicles in Cincinnati are testing the system, which includesdispatching and vehicle location. For Consolidated, Etak isdeveloping a positioning system based on map matching and Loran-C.  IBM's mobile units supposedly will work with satellite positioningnetworks and terrestrial systems. The computers probably will becompatible with specialized mobile radio networks, such as Motorola'sCoverage Plus data system, Pemberton says. Coverage Plus wasannounced last year -- possibly to counter the publicity over RamMobile Data's 50-city Mobitex network -- but will not be availableuntil later this year.  Pemberton says today's 20,000 mobile data terminals have created amarket of $50 million. By 1995, two million mobile satelliteterminals worth $4.15 billion might be sold. IBM could realize morethan $1 billion from the sale of terminals, he says. The computerfirm's entry into the market would bring the benefits of its SystemsApplication Architecture and electronic data interchange into themobile environment, says Pemberton.  Other mobile data companies -- such as Motorola, ElectrocomAutomation and Kustom Electronics -- promote their compatibility withIBM systems. But IBM's ability to provide a total host computer-to-mobile workstation solution, integrating software and hardware, wouldbe a powerful incentive for existing IBM shops to choose Big Blue'smobile PC. The majority of traditional mobile data customers, intrucking, delivery, public safety and field service, use IBMproducts.  Also, if sources are correct, IBM's product will be sort of adownsized PS/2. Though Motorola and Electrocom provide the abilityfor portable PCs to access their proprietary mobile data systems,they do not offer a DOS machine. Only Agilis now markets DOS-compatible mobile computers. Agilis' product is a portable that canbe mounted in a vehicle; IBM's computer is expected to be a vehicularunit, not a portable.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE DATA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1990SUCCESSFUL BETA TESTING REQUIRES CAREFULPLANNING, INTEGRATION FOR TRUCKING FIRM  The key to developing a worthwhile test of a satellite messagingand location network is to quickly integrate it into a company'sexisting computer dispatching system -- not to use just onestandalone PC. That's the view of Tom Burns, senior director ofquality, at Midwest Coast Transport (MCT), which is testingTranstrack's meteor burst network (see Mobile Data Report, November15, 1989).  In June 1989, the Sioux Falls, S.D. trucking company tested amobile satellite network. It was either Qualcomm or Geostar, butBurns declines to identify the company. Equipment was installed ineight of MCT's 600 vehicles. The host software was installed on a PCwhich wasn't interconnected to MCT's computer dispatching system.  As a result, dispatchers had to leave their seats to use the PC,which would display the trucks with the satellite equipment.  "Unfortunately, it just sat in a corner....No one ever used it,"Burns says. The trucking company employs about 20 dispatchers duringpeak times and they were just too busy to spend much time at the PC'skeyboard. However, the standalone PC method might work better atsmaller firms, where the dispatchers aren't as busy, he says.  This time, Midwest aims to conduct a much better trial and is"doing a lot of upfront work" to determine how to implement the test.Most importantly, Transtrack's communications/messaging software willbe integrated into the IBM 38 computer terminals that are used by MCTdispatchers. A dedicated PC will be needed, but only as a linkbetween the IBM 38 and Transtrack -- not as a dispatch terminal.  Also, all of Midwest's dispatchers will be taught how to use thesystem. During the previous test, only a few dispatchers weretrained.  To accommodate Midwest and other customers, Transtrack is modifyingits network to provide real-time transmission of messages fromvehicles to dispatchers. Currently, customers' host computers have todial Transtrack's networked 80386-based PCs to obtain messages."That's one of the things that I do not want," he says. Receivingmessages quickly is important to Burns, but the modifications arebehind schedule.  In general, though, he's pleased with Transtrack's service andresponsiveness. "They're very customer oriented....They are very niceto work with," he says. He's also pleased with the company's pricing,which is significantly less than Geostar's or Qualcomm's.  Transtrack's onboard equipment will cost some $2,500 less thansatellite messaging and vehicle location systems, says Burns.Transtrack charges about $2,000 for its onboard terminal, $30/monthfor system access and six vehicle location updates an hour, $.10 forshort, pre-programmed status messages and $.02 per character for freeform text, says Jim Feeney, president at Transtrack. On average,customers pay $45/month for airtime.  Dispatching over any RF network is "going to cut down on our phonebill tremendously" because drivers won't have to use a payphone tocontact the office, Burns says. Monthly telephone bills of $30,000-$35,000 are not uncommon.  MCT also expects the system will let its truck drivers get moresleep. Today, drivers can put in a full day's work and have to stayawake late at night until notified when another load is available.With Transtrack, the driver could sleep in the cab until he isnotified. Burns has suggested to Transtrack that it increase thesound level of its alarm. With an idling engine and a snoring driver,the present alarm isn't loud enough, he says.  Other companies scheduled to test the network include the Denny'srestaurant chain and USX, a delivery service. Transtrack's primarycompetitor in providing lower cost location and messaging services isPegasus Message Corp. in Herndon, Va. Like Transtrack, Pegasus'network is based upon meteor burst transmission.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE DATA REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 2, 1990INTERCONNECTING DIFFERENT TERMINALS, LAPTOPSTO STANDARD COMPUTER PROTOCOLS TO MARK '90S  Maps and specialized databases on CD-ROMs, faster cellular modemsand new SMR hardware and software are some of the developments justintroduced or expected in the early 1990s.  Predicting certain mobile data trends is not difficult. Customersgenerally want to integrate their existing host-computer softwareinto any mobile network. Also, existing and potential users areincreasingly interested in taking advantage of the power of laptopcomputers for mobile applications. And, the network operators andmanufacturers are going to give them much -- if not all -- of whatthey want.  From the presentations of speakers at Waters Information Services'"Connectivity in Mobile Data Networks" conference -- representingmany of the industry's leading-edge network operators and hardwarevendors --  it was obvious that compatibility with existing softwareand computer protocols are major goals. At the conference inWashington, D.C., even Motorola emphasized its desire to allow anyterminal -- dedicated or laptop -- to access its Data Radio Networks.  Compatibility with IBM mini and mainframe architectures, local areanetwork architectures and the Open System Interface platform is beingpursued vigorously. Yet no single mobile data standard is likely toemerge for the foreseeable future. For example, companies that arewell known for landline computer products, such as modemmanufacturers, are introducing their own error correcting standardsinto the mobile arena.  Few, if any, mobile data technologies during the next couple ofyears will be appropriate or inexpensive enough for the mass market.However, the introduction of lower cost vehicle navigation productsas part of a driver information system installed in higher-endautomobiles will generate consumer awareness in the early to mid1990s.                                Etak  The president of Murdoch Magazines, which owns the map making firmof Etak, knows "instinctively" that drivers will want more travel-related information in the 1990s. "I don't believe you can researchthese things," says John Evans, president at Murdoch. In the 1990s,perhaps in 1992, at least one automobile manufacturer will beginoffering driver information systems that contain databases on CD-ROMs, says Evans.  Evans declines to discuss which company will offer such a system,but General Motors is Etak's exclusive licensee in the United Statesfor providing equipment to the automobile marketplace. G.M., alongwith virtually every other major automaker, has been working on cars-of-the-future containing cellular phones, facsimile machines,navigational systems and a host of computer-related add-ons.  Using Etak's digitized maps and map software, companies will beginoffering databases on CD-ROMs, including the location of andinformation on hotels, restaurants, gasoline stations, touristattractions and do-it-yourself tours catering to specializedinterests. The data will be displayed on either stand-alone CRTs orbuilt-in monitors. The success of his vision is dependent upon thecommercial introduction and acceptance of computer displays invehicles.  He envisions motorists being able to obtain subscriptions to a typeof CD-ROM-of-the-Month-Club. Advertiser sponsorship of CD-ROMs willbe vital to generate revenues to sustain this market's growth, Evanssays.  As a subsidiary of one of the largest publishing firms in theworld, Murdoch Magazines has a great deal of experience in sellingnewspaper and magazine advertising, he says. The publishing firm ownsfive automotive magazines in the United States and Europe, whichcould be used to promote a vehicle location/CD-ROM system.                               Modems  "We think having a higher speed modem is very critical to thesuccess of the mobile office," says John Fox, senior program managerat Telebit, Inc. in Oak Brook, Ill. With Telebit's Cellblazer modem,the company wants to create entirely new markets and "revolutionizethe way business is done," says Fox.  Telebit sees the market for Cellblazer for such applications as:on-site insurance adjustment, for faster settlement of claims; fieldsales, for faster processing of orders and for verifyingavailability; field maintenance, for accessing mainframe databases;government use, for Internal Revenue Service agents to access recordsand for security agents to check photographic I.D.; and forestablishing temporary office communications.  The Waters conference was the first public introduction ofTelebit's modem (see Mobile Data Report, December 4, 1989). InNovember, Microcom had announced its MNP 10 modem that was designedfor "adverse environments," such as cellular (see Mobile Data Report,November 20, 1989).                        Electrocom Automation  A new marketing strategy for penetrating the Specialized MobileRadio (SMR) industry is under development at Electrocom Automation inArlington, Texas. More than a year ago, the company unveiled ageneric dispatching package for E.F. Johnson SMRs that would useJohnson's modems in conjunction with Electrocom's software and mobiledata terminals.  But a massive reorganization at Electrocom resulted in layoffs,including the person charged with selling the SMR system. This hasplaced the program on hold. However, Electrocom has just completed amajor survey of the SMR industry and will be rolling out a newmarketing strategy in 1990, says Roy C. Emory, a senior staffengineer at Electrocom.  Rather than offering a generic dispatching package for allpotential users, the Texas company is developing a targeted approachthat will focus on individual niche markets. Products will have to be"cheap," says Emory. A customer who pays $1,000 for his radio doesn'twant to pay more than that for a mobile data terminal, he says.                             ***********                       Impact of Higher Speeds                 On Transmission Time Over Cellular                               1,200 bits/sec.       16,800 bits/sec.  1 screen graphics              2.8 min.              11.9 sec.  160,000 bits  20 pages text                 10.4 min.              44.6 sec.  600,000 bits  360K disk                     62.5 min.               4.5 min.  3,600,000 bits  1 megabyte file                2.9 hrs               12.4 min.  10,000,000 bits                   Source: John Fox, Telebit, Inc.                             ***********                          CONFERENCE BRIEFS  * Modems Plus, Inc. in Atlanta has sold its first mobile datasystem, Commrad, to the Duke Power Company in North Carolina, says H.Thomas Thorsen, president at Modems Plus.

The cellular industry has come a long way,changing and growing along the way.  And as 1996 begins, many arereflecting on the impact 1995 has had on the industry and what the newyear may hold for cellular--domestically, internationally andtechnologically.  Several issues raised in 1995 will continue toaffect the industry in 1996.  Instead of rehashing bygone issues ofMPN, we will let a few industry insiders reflect on 1995 and what thenew year has in store for the wireless industry.  ...From a National Brand Point of View     "The lesson we learned [in 1995] was the same we have learned--and learned from--the past 11 years:  Start with your customers," saidCellular One Group Executive Director Richard Lyons.     "Looking forward, the new year holds one promise:  excitingchange.  The telecommunications industry will continue itsmetamorphosis--the evolution of the telecommunications revolution. From the brand perspective, such as Cellular One's, that means thateven in the presence of the immense amount of change that drives theindustry, the key challenge will be to not lose touch with our currentcustomers and to anticipate the needs of our potential subscribers.     "In looking at the issues facing the cellular industry as the newyear begins, one stands out:  the need for the cellular industry tosolidify and expand its positioning in the larger telecommunicationsmarketplace.  This is a direct result of the increased competitionthat will occur from the introduction of new wireless technologies,such as PCS, as well as the entrance of new players into the wirelessindustry.  In 1996, the competition could become even more fierce whenCongress passes the telecommunications bill.  Consequently, in 1996,Cellular One will look at broadening its product and serviceofferings.     "This increase in competition has made the strength of a brandname more important than ever before.  Consumers have strong brandpreferences and make purchasing decisions daily based on the strengthof a brand name."  ...From a Resale Point of View     National Wireless Resellers Association Executive Director DavidGusky predicts resellers will profit in 1996 if 1995 is anyindication.  "[Last year] was a good year for wireless resale in thatmore and more companies seeking to enter the wireless marketplace sawresale as a legitimate means of market entry."Nineteen ninety-six should see this trend continue, especially whenyou consider the changes in store for the industry.  As an increasingnumber of PCS carriers, both broadband and narrowband, open forbusiness, creating greater competition and network capacity, the stagewill be set for a real boon in wireless resale. Competition will drivedown prices and shrink profit margins, meaning carriers will belooking for efficient, low-cost distribution channels.  Thissituation, together with the excess network capacity that is bound tooccur as PCS carriers build out their systems to comply with FCCtimetables, will prompt carriers to turn to resellers in increasingnumbers to distribute their products and services.  Resale todayaccounts for just 3 percent of total revenues in the cellularmarketplace.  When you consider that long-distance resellers accountfor 10 percent of their industry's revenues, or more than three timesthe market share of their wireless counterparts, and that the wirelessindustry will soon take on characteristics of the long-distanceindustry in terms of competition and network capacity, we expect goodthings to happen in wireless resale in 1996 and for a good many yearsto come."  ...From a Software Solutions Point of View     Eric Johnson, president and CEO of Coral Systems Inc., had thisto say about the year ahead.  "We will see in the United States, theemergence of competition into the whole wireless industry.  In thepast, we had the luxury of being able to focus on subscriberacquisition in a duopoly environment. ...  [In 1996], we will see awhole different tier of users ..., which will change the way thewireless industry does business. ...  We're not just cellular anymore. We're a wireless industry comprised of many different standards. [Nineteen ninety five tells us that] wireless carriers need to focuson customers."     Internationally, global system for mobile communications (GSM)operators are going through the same problems analog carriers in theUnited States went through in the early stages of cellular, he said. But they are "close to having the majority of them solved.  I think wewill see a dramatic increase in GSM in 1996.  We'll see similar thingswith CDMA [code division multiple access].     "I'd like to say we'll have a resolution between the standards,but there will probably be a further entrenchment [of differences]. Ericsson will be very aggressive in promoting time division multipleaccess (TDMA) and GSM.  Competition among infrastructure providerswill increase.  We may see those who have announced what standard theyare going with, reversing [their choices]."     He said it is unlikely dual-mode phones will pair CDMA, GSM andTDMA, but rather each of those standards will be paired with analog. "Analog will emerge as the common unifier amongst [all the digitalstandards]."     Reflecting on trends that emerged in 1995, Johnson said, "I thinkthat there has been an enormous increase in fraud awareness."  Hedescribed it as oneof those problems that has always been around, but now thatcompetition isbecoming more serious, carriers are paying more attention to theissue.  Also, he said 1995 saw widespread acceptance of selecting afraud strategy or platform.  A platform of different fraud solutionsallows carriers to put unrelenting pressure on criminals, which is themost effective strategy.     Another trend to emerge in 1995 was the formation of nationalalliances.  PCS PrimeCo L.P. Johnson said is a significant examplebecause it shows how the industry has "reached a phase where yourenemies become your friends."     What does 1996 hold for Coral Systems?  "We will be announcingsome large strategic relationships early this year that show ourstrategic vision, which is basically to give carriers the tools theyneed to manage their businesses."  ...From a Domestic Services Point of View     In looking at 1995 and the future, Comcast CellularCommunications Inc. President Don Harris reflected on the industry'sbeginnings.  "When the industry first got started, cellular--althougha tremendous advancement in and of itself--was fairly primitive bytoday's standards.  Phones were bulky and very expensive.  There wasno such thing as value-added features and services, and carriersoffered relatively few choices for customers.  Today, cellular hasbecome an incredibly sophisticated industry, offering customers adazzling array of equipment and feature options, and more choices thanever before. ...  With 30 million subscribers and more than 10 percentnational penetration, [the cellular industry] is a classic Americansuccess story."     "Now, there are as many descriptions of what this wireless futurewill look like as there are pundits who observe this industry.  Fromour perspective, though, the future is all about being able to respondto virtually every customer segment with wireless solutions thatenhance productivity and make people's lives easier and moreconvenient," Harris said.  "We are emerging as a single-sourceprovider of wired, wireless and [TV] program content to customers herein the United States and around the world."  ...From an International Services Point of View     According to AirTouch International President and CEO Arun Sarin,highlights of 1995 included the launch of AirTouch cellular service inItaly, Spain and India, expansion of its presence in Japan throughseveral joint ventures, opening of a European headquarters and in thethird quarter of 1995, growth of its international subscriber base by130 percent compared with the third quarter of 1994.  Looking ahead to1996, Sarin said he expects AirTouch to bid for licenses in Poland,the Czech Republic, Brazil, Taiwan and possibly China.  Also, heexpects AirTouch to increase profitability of its operations in Asiaand Europe as well as launch services in South Korea, India and Japan.  ...From a Technology Point of View     TDMA Forum Project Manager John McQueen says TDMA is still thebest kept secret in digital cellular.  The Forum grew from 14 to 44members in 1995 without any formal promotion, McQueen said.  "We havebuilt the most thorough protocol conformance specification, softwareand test procedures to ensure full operability and functionality ofIS-136 mobiles."     Also in 1995, the Forum uncovered and solved a major analogcompatibility problem that would have kept almost 4 million analogphones from working on digital networks, and it began discussions onmerging IS-136 and GSM standards.  In 1996, the forum plans major IS-136 deployments in the first quarter, and will launch an Internet website, sign up new members and improve TDMA functionality.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE PHONE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FCC PROPOSES `BILL AND KEEP' FOR CMRS-LEC CONNECTIONS     To speed competition in both the wireless and local exchangeservice markets, the FCC proposed at its December meeting an interim"bill-and-keep" compensation plan for interconnection of commercialmobile radio service (CMRS) and local exchange carrier (LEC) networks. In initiating CC Docket No. 95-185, the commission also tentativelyconcluded that information about CMRS-LEC interconnection arrangementsshould be made public, and it is seeking comments on whether torequire tariffs, public disclosure reports or some other alternativeto private contracts.     For CMRS-LEC interconnection through dedicated transmissionfacilities, the commission proposed a compensation plan based onexisting flat-rate access charges for similar facilities.  The FCCfurther proposed that CMRS providers be allowed to recover accesscharges from interexchange carriers in the same manner the LECs do.      Telcos generally have opposed bill-and-keep compensation forinterconnection with any type of competitor--wireline or wireless. Under a bill-and-keep system, each service provider terminates theother carrier's traffic without imposing an interconnection charge. The LECs contend that they will be terminating significantly moreoutside carrier calls than will other carriers.       Commissioners wanted to hear about other types of compensationplans, but they generally seemed convinced that bill-and-keep was thebest interim choice because of its ease in administration and therelatively small market share of wireless competitors.  Chairman ReedHundt said those proposing another compensation method should "thinkhard about the economics and relative market powers of incumbents thatcontrol wireline networks."     The notice also seeks views on the FCC's jurisdiction in settinginterconnection polices affecting intrastate terminating traffic.Industry Responds To FCC Proposal     Soon after the FCC announced its bill-and-keep proposal, ComcastCorp. President Brian Roberts released a statement applauding the FCCfor its actions.  "[The proposal] may be the single biggest step theFCC has taken so far to promote local telephone competition," he said. "This proposal could make wireless an economically viable way tocompete for all customers."     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association President ThomasWheeler also released a statement favoring the proposal.  "The wire-less industry commends the FCC for its action today, which will leadto greater competition in the local telephone market and lower chargesto customers. ...  In 1994, wireless customers paid LECs more than$800 million to terminate their calls.  Such a fee can only act toimpede development of wireless as a competitive local exchange ser-vice.  Reciprocal Termination is the solution to this anti-competitiveinequity, as the FCC has wisely proposed."FCC Simplifies Radio License Application     At a brown bag luncheon in December, FCC WirelessTelecommunications Bureau (WTB) Chief Michele Farquhar said she hasapproved a simplified, one-page version of Form 600, which is used toapply for mobile radio licenses.  Farquhar said the Office ofManagement and Budget has 120 days to approve the Form 600 EZ beforeit can be made available to applicants.  Judy Dunlap, chief of theFCC's Data Services Branch, said that up to 85 percent of applicantsshould be able to use the new form.  In January, the commission alsowill begin accepting Form 600 electronically.     In other FCC news, former Commercial Wireless Division ChiefRosalind Allen is now associate bureau chief.  David Furth, formerlydeputy chief, will become acting chief of that division.  Larry Atlasand Daniel Phythyon, formerly associate bureau chiefs, will move tothe Common Carrier Bureau (CCB) to work with former WTB Chief ReginaKeeney, who now heads the CCB.  Coming from the CCB, Karen Brinkmanwill join the WTB this month to assist with local competition issues. Farquhar also expressed interest in creating a new divisionspecializing in public safety issues.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE PHONE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SUBSCRIBER GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA OUTPACES OTHER REGIONS, STUDY SAYS     The cellular subscriber base of Latin America will reach 22million by 2000, according to Pyramid Research Inc.  Its report,"Cellular and PCS Markets in Latin America and the Caribbean,"projects an annual growth rate of 40 percent between 1995 and 2000.     The report claims that subscriber growth is outpacing all otherregions.  That surge is driven by tremendous growth in Brazil andColombia as well as continued growth in Mexico, Argentina andVenezuela.  Privatization is racing through the region; non-basicservices including cellular are the first markets to open up, followedclosely by basic services markets, the study said.  Argentina, Chile,Mexico, Peru and Venezuela have witnessed total privatization of theirtelecom sectors.  To illustrate the penetration of competition intothese markets, the study takes note of how many competitors there arein each.  Chile has four separate mobile phone operators, Colombia andArgentina each have six and Mexico has 10.  In Central America (asidefrom Mexico), where competitors are fewer, granting cellular operatorlicenses is a top priority for governments.     Operators serving Colombia were surprised by the demand, thestudy said.  In the first nine months of operations of the cellularnetworks in the country, subscribership totalled 150,000, which isnearly half of what the operators had predicted Colombia would have infive years.  Venezuela also was greeted with more demand thanexpected, so much so that government officials are consideringlicensing a third operator and speeding up the buildout of personalcommunications service (PCS) networks.     Demand is high even in markets that are not yet privatized.  Forexample, in Brazil, where state-owned companies still maintain amonopoly, the number of subscribers grew by an average of 283 percentbetween 1991 and 1995.     Why is demand so high?  Cellular often serves as a solution topublic networks unable to meet demand for telecom services. "Backlogged demand for basic service and heightened competition havecontributed to strong growth in the region's cellular markets," saidreport author Linda Barrabee, a senior analyst at Pyramid Research. This demand also will benefit equipment vendors. Between 1995 and2000, the market for cellular and PCS infrastructure is expected togrow from $1.5 billion to $3.7 billion.  Digital equipment willdominate in the equipment market for the region.  Revenue for digitalis expected to grow from $87 million in 1995 to more than $2.7 billionin 2000.     Proponents of time division multiple access (TDMA) and codedivision multiple access (CDMA) technologies are battling for marketshare as the region moves closer to a migration from analog to digitalnetworks.  Many countries have selected TDMA because it was availablefirst, but some of the larger markets--including Argentina, Brazil andMexico--have delayed their decisions until the next generation of theTDMA and CDMA standards are available.  "Many of the larger marketsare serving as test-beds for a range of digital cellular ... standardssuch as TDMA, CDMA, E[nhanced]-TDMA, and the GSM-based standard DCS-1900," Barrabee said.  The migration to digital is inevitable becausethe current demand for service cannot be met by analog systems.     The total number of PCS subscribers will be 4 million by 2000. But Barrabee says that "cellular operators should not be threatened byPCS operators in the short-term.  The window of opportunity is farfrom closed.  After all, with or without PCS, by the year 2000, Brazilwill log on 9 million cellular subscribers, Argentina will top 2million and Mexico will surpass 4 million."Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE PHONE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996UNITED STATES CELLULAR LICENSES TELE-GO PRODUCT FROM GTE     United States Cellular Wireless Communications (USC) signed anagreement with GTE Mobilnet to license GTE's Tele-Go brand technology.

(HES Group), were dismissed asdefendants in a lawsuit alleging cellular telephones cause braincancer.  Motorola Inc., WTR (formerly known as the Scientific AdvisoryGroup), the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)and CTIA Senior Vice President-Public Affairs Ron Nessen are theremaining defendants in the suit (MPN, March 13, 1995, pages 1-2). The judge is expected to deliver a written opinion deciding the matterthis month (January).     Last March, plaintiff Debbra Wright alleged that use of cellularphones had caused her benign brain tumor and that the defendants hadconspired to withhold information from the public about the allegedconnection between cellular phones and brain tumors.  The lawsuit,filed with the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., is Debbra Wright v.Motorola.  As a real estate manager for Bell Atlantic Mobile, Wrightsaid she used cellular phones from one to six hours per day betweenFebruary 1988 and March 1994.     "[On Dec. 18] Illinois Judge Paddy McNamara ruled that eventhough Wright had obtained a vast amount of information in the lastyear about Dr. Carlo, HES Group and the scientific program that Dr.Carlo is leading, she had not come forward with any evidence that Dr.Carlo and HES Group were involved in the alleged conspiracy," saidJames Baller, chief litigation counsel to Carlo, the HES Group and WTRin the case.     "Judge McNamara also is expected to rule in March 1996 on similarcharges [filed] by Wright in September directed specifically againstthe independent scientific organization WTR," Baller said in astatement.  "WTR believes that these allegations should also bedismissed by Judge McNamara as they are based on the same key factualissues the judge has now resolved.     "WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wastefulattacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of theresearch necessary to answer the public's questions ... and that thesetactics could themselves pose threats to public health if they delayimplementation of any interventions that may prove necessary," Ballersaid.     "CTIA and the others have also filed a motion to dismiss and thatshould be heard sometime early in the new year," said Nessen.  "Justas the [motions of Carlo and HES Group] one by one have been dismissedfor lack of scientific evidence, we expect the court will also dismissthis case."

And 1995 was a whirlwind year.  "The most significant developmentwas the emergence of mobile satellite communications as a majorsatellite service," said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Space andCommunications Co..     "I expect we're going to see phenomenal growth, evidenced fromalmost day one," added John Farrell, president of Canada's TMICommunications.  TMI's MSat satellite is slated for launch in March.     But despite some executives' positive outlook, regulatory issueswill remain a big variable as companies enter 1996.  "The true hurdleof this business is not the market, not the technology.  It's regula-tory," said Stephen Morgan, director-business development for LittleLEO Starsys Global Positioning Inc.          Indeed, although the recently concluded World RadiocommunicationConference (WRC-95) eliminated much of the spectrum uncertainty thathas plagued the mobile satellite service (MSS) industry, theconference is only a prelude to the global task of acquiring licensesin individual countries.     However, several observers doubted that the difficultiesencountered at WRC-95 will re-emerge in countries' licensingproceedings.  "As far as I know, there's nothing that will affect thelicensing process," said Lloyd Rezler, managing director of satelliteservices for Globalstar L.P. partner AirTouch Communications Inc..     For the second-round Little LEOs, "a holding pattern is a goodanalogy," Morgan said.  "Although the planes are moving, they're goingin circles while the traffic controllers work madly."  Any solutionwill come at WRC-97, he said.     But in a year which will bring launches including Inmarsat'sthird- generation satellites, TMI's bird and the first Iridium Inc.satellites, many expressed enthusiasm for 1996.  "This is going to bean interesting year for us," said Barry Bertiger, director of MotorolaInc.'s satellite communications division.  "First launches are alwaysexciting."     The initial Big LEO launches "should serve as an indicator as tohow quickly and effectively these new systems can be brought online,"observed industry consultant Ed Martin.     However, the launch failures of 1995 do not bode well for the newyear.  "The failure rate has got to come down and stay down, orambitious plans like the Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. will have aterrible time rolling out," said Tim Logue, space and telecom analystfor Washington law firm Reid & Priest.     But while groundbreaking companies such as Iridium and OrbitalSciences Corp. prepare their initial or follow-on launches, othersplan significant preparatory deals for the first part of this year. Odyssey, the Big LEO backed by TRW Inc. and Teleglobe Inc., expects toseal its strategic partners as well as handset and launch vehicleplans beginning in the first quarter.     Odyssey launch vehicle candidates include the Ariane, Long March,Proton and Soyuz rockets, while TRW has letters of intent for handsetdevelopment with OSC's Magellan Systems Corp., Japan Radio Co. andPanasonic Corp.    Further, look for Starsys--which is about to close its acquis-ition deal with GE American Communications Inc.--to award satellite,launch vehicle and handset deals soon.The FCC's Internat- ional Bureauhas a full mobile agenda for 1996, although its work has been haltedby the federal government's shutdown.  Issues include its twice-delayed satellite policy review, as well as its Ka-band rulemaking.      The three remaining Big LEOs, deferred last year for lack offinancing, also are slated for an FCC decision by Jan. 31., althoughthis may be delayed.  Ellipso has entered into talks with RockwellInternational Corp. , as well as Telstra Corp., Australia's largestcarrier, while Constellation Communications Inc. and American MobileSatellite Corp. have remained guarded.    But even the current MSS leaders still have significant financework left.  However, the satellite industry's growth will easefinancing, Hughes' Cromer said.  "I believe financial backing willcontinue to become available as more satellite programs are proven andbusiness cases are demonstrated," he said.      Overall, "It will be a year of realistic thinking," AirTouch'sRezler said.  "The weaker companies just simply won't get the funding. The stronger companies will be facing the realities of implementation. [By year-end], it will be a very strong industry with respect to theremaining competitors."Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE SATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996APMT COMES TOGETHER WITH STRONG CHINESE AND SINGAPOREAN BACKING     Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT), the latestaddition to the Asian regional mobile satellite fray, revealedsignificant support from Chinese and Singaporean companies in afounders' agreement announced in late December.    People's Republic of China organizations China Aero-Space Corp.(CASC), China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, ChinaTelecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp. (managed by China'sMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications) and China Unicom SatelliteTelecommunication Co. Ltd. are involved in the $640 million deal. Additionally, Singapore Technologies Telemedia and SingaporeTelecommunications Ltd. have a one-third stake between them.    APMT, incorporated in Singapore as APMT Satellite Pte. Ltd., willbe funded by its six founding members, with local service providersexpected to dilute founders' shares as they take equity stakes.       Asia Mobile Telecommunications (Thailand) has received Thairegulatory approval and reportedly will take a 10 percent equity stakein APMT.  Additionally, APMT also has joined with Japan's MitsubishiCorp., and is talking to potential partners in four other countries,reported the South China Morning Post.    APMT currently is evaluating turnkey space/ground segment bids; areport from an Asian correspondent had Hughes Space and CommunicationsCo. entering into final negotiations.  Hughes officials had nocomment.  ...Courting the Asian Tigers, Or a Three-Ring Circus?    APMT will join two other regional MSS projects, as well as thefour global MSS ventures, to vie for Asian subscribers starting in1998 to 1999 (MSN, Sept. 21, 1995, p. 3).  And despite some concernsof overcapacity, MSS companies--all with relatively limitedcapacities--will enter a booming Asian mobile arena.    Indeed, a 1995 study by Economic and Management ConsultantsInternational Inc. (EMCI) predicts 78.8 million Asian cellularsubscribers in 2000, up from 10.7 million in 1994.  Japan will remainthe largest market in 2000, at 32.3 percent, but China will move tosecond-largest, at 26.8 percent, EMCI said.    But despite a promising market, APMT's entry still may affect thejockeying of its competitors to develop strategic relationships inChina, particularly among the global MSS companies.      Although having contracts in China isn't a precursor to doingbusiness there, "China very distinctly insists on some level ofparticipation, generally above and beyond providing services," saidIridium Inc. spokesman John Windolph.    Both Globalstar L.P. and Iridium have launch contracts withstate-owned China Great Wall Industry Corp.  Iridium also has arelationship with Long March developer CASC--also an APMT partner--which will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for Iridiumservice in China.      But London's ICO Global Communications Ltd. has the strongestties of the global systems: China's Inmarsat Signatory Beijing MarineCommunication and Navigation Co. recently upped its equity commitmentsin ICO to $103 million.    Globalstar, through partner AirTouch Communications, still isdeveloping its Chinese connections.  "[China] is the only majorterritory that's very much up in the air with respect to their inten-tions," said Lloyd Rezler, AirTouch's managing director-satelliteservices.    One potential wrinkle as companies seek to boost their Asian tiesmay be the uneasy political situation between China and Taiwan.  "Sofar, that's not been an issue, and we're hoping that the developmentwon't become a political issue in that respect," said Rezler.  "It's awin-win for everybody to have these systems up and running."    Added Iridium's Windolph, "They are distinctly separateterritories, and consequently they are being treated as such."Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE SATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996WRC-95 OPENS THE DOOR    The Big LEOs and Teledesic Corp. both achieved strong results atthis year's World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95), held inGeneva by the International Telecommunication Union.  Teledesic woundup the surprise winner after a strong international campaign to raiseawareness of its system, while the Big LEOs capped off their successat 1992's conference with solid feederlink allocations.  ICO GlobalCommunications Ltd. had some difficulties due to the crowded nature ofits 2 GHz bands, but succeeded in its primary goal: advancing theglobal availability date of its spectrum to 2000.    The Little LEOs had to contend with the challenges of littlepreparation time for WRC-95 and spectrum scarcity in bands below 1GHz.  However, they succeeded in a small global allocation--as well asmore bands in the Americas--and improved their recognition by othercountries.    Overall, WRC-95 showcased growing regionalism among ITU membercountries.  Aside from the usually cohesive European bloc, thecountries of the Americas joined on many items, as did the African andArab regions to a lesser extent.  Although European unity may spurother regions to join on issues, observers noted that regionalism alsomay be the only way the ITU can function with the ambitious agendasand accelerated, two-year schedule of the WRC meetings.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE SATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996COMMERCIAL SERVICE:  AMSC AND ORBCOMM BREAK NEW GROUND    Despite developmental activity on all MSS fronts, 1995 alsobrought commercial rollouts from American Mobile Satellite Corp.  andOrbital Sciences Corp..  OSC launched its first two Orbcomm birds inApril and currently is marketing non-real-time telemetry applicationsuntil it launches the rest of the 36-satellite system next year.  Inturn, AMSC began Skycell commercial voice and data service at the endof the year.    Both companies' technical hangups prior to beginning service showthe challenge of setting up satellite systems, as well as the effectstart-up problems have on investor confidence.  AMSC's and OSC'srespective glitches prompted uncertain diagnoses from the companies,while both stocks suffered on Wall Street.  But even as the twocompanies opened the way to providing MSS from dedicated satellites,Qualcomm Inc. aggressively boosted the international rollout of itsOmniTracs fleet management service.  After breaking 100,000 totalterminals sold by the first quarter, the company established aMalaysian subsidiary and expanded its operations in Mexico and Brazil.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE SATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996MSS COMPANIES WATCH THE BOOMING IPO AND BOND MARKETS FROM AFAR    The strong results of initial public offerings (IPOs) and bondsin 1995 offered no solace to MSS companies attempting to enter themarket.  Underwriters scaled back the Globalstar L.P. IPO prior to itsrelease, only to see the stock sink, while both it and Iridium Inc.cited high costs in pulling their high-yield debt offerings.  MSScompanies' forays to the credit market show that exceptional riskinevitably will bring demands for high returns.      On the equity side, the unestablished nature and nonexistent cashflow of MSS companies give stock analysts few reference points.  ButGlobalstar illustrated how news-driven MSS stocks are, when its solidWRC-95 results pushed its stock price up more than 80 percent aboveits pre-conference level.    The exception to the MSS companies' public financing trials wasICO, which parlayed its Inmarsat heritage into $1.4 billion in privatecommitments, while satellite vendor Hughes Space & Communications alsoinvested $94 million.  Both Iridium and Globalstar also turned tointernal backers as well in the wake of their attempted debtofferings.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE SATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996LICENSING:  U.S. LEADS THE WAY, WHILE EUROPE CHOOSES ITS COURSE    The Big LEO regulatory marathon of 1994 ended in January when theFCC deemed Globalstar, Iridium and Odyssey qualified to build theirsystems.  Look for a ruling on the deferred LEO systems, Ellipso,Constellation and AMSC, next month.  Little LEOs Starsys Global Pos-itioning Inc. and Volunteers in Technical Assistance gained licensesin July and November, respectively.  Starsys ended its foreigninvestment impasse with the FCC by dropping its French ownership to 20percent, while satellite giant GE Americom bought 80 percent.      Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) adopted a proposal tohave a final MSS regulatory structure in Europe by March 1997. Although the process is incomplete, observers said it likely will be acomparative-hearing proceeding, including spectrum availability andreciprocal market access issues.  Separately, the EC's competitivenessdirectorate requested commercial information from Globalstar, ICO andIridium to ensure "level playing fields" for MSS in Europe.  The Asian Regional Market Shapes Up    Along with strong Asian telecom and broadcast satellite activity--as well as high cellular growth--three new Asian regional MSS systemsarose in 1995.  These alternatives to the global systems promptedconcerns of MSS overcapacity in Asia, but optimists said thepotentially huge market may dwarf systems' capacities.  Given theregion's low teledensity and per capita income, look for the economicsof low cost equalling high volume to play heavily in any MSS shakeout.

Construction is now ahead of contractual schedule; Iridiumsponsor Motorola Inc. chose to continue its buildout plans despitespectrum uncertainty prior to last year's World RadiocommunicationConference (WRC-95).  "From a construction standpoint, things areactually going quite well," said Barry Bertiger, Motorola corporatevice president and general manager of its satellite communicationsdivision.       Bertiger lauded Motorola's relationship with its Iridiumsubcontractors.  There have been "a couple cost claims" on the fixed-price development subcontracts, but they are "all very minor," hesaid.  The main subcontractors are Lockheed Martin Corp., RaytheonCo., and rocket manufacturers China Great Wall Industry Corp.,Khrunichev and McDonnell Douglas Corp..    Motorola has two qualification spacecraft built, as well as thefive flight models in its Chandler, Ariz., plant.  For the Iridiumproject Motorola introduced a "five-day, dock-to-dock" timetable forturning satellite components into a complete spacecraft.  Currentlythe company is holding a seven-day cycle time for initial production,with the five-day goal set to begin with the 20th of the initial 72Iridium satellites and spares, Bertiger said.    After the early production run, Motorola will defer constructionuntil results are in from the first flight tests.  Regarding manuf-acturing changes ifnecessary, Bertiger said the productionline is "reasonably flexible.  Minor changes we can handle fairlyeasily."      In-orbit "tweaking" is also possible, since the satellites'software is programmable, he added.  Iridium will begin in-orbittesting with three satellites in one plane, to test crosslinks betweensatellites and L-band and gateway links with the ground.  A secondlaunch of two satellites will enable plane-to-plane crosslink tests.    Despite Motorola's aggressive satellite construction campaign, thedevelopment schedule for Iridium's novel dual-mode handheld phoneswill not be a issue, Bertiger said.  "Fortunately, that's all underone umbrella here," he said.  Motorola has a working handsetprototype--"not portable, but transportable," with plans for a fewhundred prototype portables by 1997, he said. Motorola Signs for Five More Delta Launches     Last month, Motorola added a five-launch Delta 2 order to itsexisting $400 million, eight-launch contract with McDonnell Douglas. The follow-on launches, of three satellites each, will replenish theinitial 66-satellite, six-spare Iridium constellation.  Launches ofreplacement satellites or spares will begin in 1998 or 1999,"depending on when we need the satellites up," said Stephanie Nowack,Motorola Satellite Communications Division spokeswoman.  ...Mac-Dac Develops New Delta Components to Handle Iridium Launches    Building a launch vehicle fairing to hold five satellites is afirst for McDonnell Douglas, said Will Hampton, a program manager withMcDonnell Douglas.  To accommodate the Iridium satellites atop itsDelta 2 rocket, Mac-Dac created a new fitting to interface with thesecond stage, as well as a new satellite dispenser.  Meanwhile, thewhole assembly will be encased in a new composite (rather thanaluminum) fairing.  The Iridium launch vehicle production is in theexisting Delta production flow and is on schedule, Hampton added.    Motorola and McDonnell Douglas officials declined to givespecific dates for the first launch, although a manifest from theOffice of Commercial Space Transportation shows an Iridium launchslated for September.    Hampton said the satellites will arrive at the Vandenberg AirForce Base launch facilities five weeks before launch.  The Iridiumprogram is "much more streamlined in terms of vehicle processing," he said.  "They've donevery impressive work in terms of the amount of time they've been ableto reduce."  ...Globalstar Cutting Metal, While Odyssey and ICO Prepare    Globalstar L.P. ICO Global Communications Ltd. and Odyssey, thetwo other Big LEO consortia, also are proceeding with their satellitedevelopment plans, although all are behind Iridium to varying degrees.    Globalstar space segment manufacturer Space Systems/Loral hasbuilt a prototype satellite, as well as basic elements of the flightmodels, said Globalstar Executive Vice President Tony Navarra.  Thefirst flight model is due this fall, he said.  Navarra acknowledgedIridium's progress, but said he expects Globalstar will be first tomarket, since its system can operate (at reduced capacity) with only32 satellites.  But regarding Iridium's groundbreaking launch, "We'reabsolutely looking forward to it," he said.    Meanwhile, Odyssey sponsor TRW Inc. and ICO (through itssatellite builder Hughes Space and Communications Co. remain embroiledin their well-known squabble prompted by TRW's patents of the Odysseyconstellation.      Hughes is in the early stages of the recently awarded ICOprogram, although satellite construction has not begun.  Regardless,"We're not waiting for any patent considerations here," said a companyspokesman.    In turn, TRW is concluding development of the Odyssey satellites'internal propulsion, and has successfully tested the Odyssey L-bandantenna design.Back to Headline List CopyrightMOBILE SATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 11, 1996DEFENSE MERGER WILL KEEP SATCOMS SEPARATE     The $10 billion Lockheed Martin Corp.Loral Corp. merger announcedthis week will keep the defense giants' satellite communicationsbusinesses separate, the two companies said.  "Loral now will be aleading space and communications company," said company ChairmanBernard Schwartz in a statement outlining the merger.  The new LoralSpace and Communications Corp. will retain its 31 percent stake in BigLEO Globalstar L.P., as well as its 33 percent stake in manufacturerSpace Systems/Loral (SS/L).  Additionally, Lockheed Martin will invest$344 million for a 20 percent equity share of Loral Space.  However,the two may find some commercial overlap.  While SS/L is the primarybuilder of Globalstar's satellites (and owns 37.5 percent ofGlobalstar), Lockheed Martin is leading the construction of IridiumInc.'s satellites.  On the broadband side, Loral and Lockheed Martinhave their respective Cyberstar and Astrolink projects.

Lockheed Martin billed the event as the first use of satellitecrosslinks; ordinarily, traffic is transferred between satellites by"double-hopping" via ground stations.  When fully operational, theMilstar system will relay high-priority voice, data and video trafficto fixed, mobile and man-portable units.    Several commercial systems have specified crosslinks in theirdesign, including Iridium Inc., the Motorola Inc.-sponsored Big LEOthat counts Lockheed Martin among its contractors.  "Iridium is basedsomewhat on the technology developed for Milstar," said LockheedMartin spokesman Eric DeRitis. "It gave us the knowledge to producethe crosslinks for Iridium."    The parallel is not exact.  The two Milstar satellites (four morewill be launched, starting in 1999) relay traffic between theirrespective central Pacific Ocean and continental United States orbitalslots, while Iridium only will send traffic through adjacentsatellites in its 66-satellite network.  Further, the Milstarcrosslinks operate at 60 GHz--for security, since stray signals areabsorbed by the atmosphere--while Iridium's crosslinks are at 28 GHz.    "We've never been all that concerned about intersatellite links,"said Barry Bertiger, general manager of Motorola's satellitecommunications division.  "They're pretty straightforward point-to-point microwave links."  The links have been fully tested on theground, he added.    However, even the Milstar system does not have crosslinks betweensatellites in different planes (and moving in different directions),as Iridium does.  ...Crosslinks Offer Security Advantages for the Milstar System     By using intersatellite links, the Milstar system reduces theU.S. military's reliance on potentially vulnerable (and expensive)ground stations outside the United States.  However, innovation comesat a premium.  Unclassified funding for the Milstars and missioncontrol as of Sept. 30, 1994, was $6.4 billion, according to oursister publication SPACE BUSINESS NEWS.    Lockheed Martin designed Iridium's crosslinks, with Com Devmanufacturing antennas and Gorca Systems Inc. providing systemsengineering.  Although crosslinks have obvious military benefits,Iridium's have led its competitors, among others, to assert that itwill bypass local networks in routing calls to end users--a scenarioIridium officials vehemently deny.  Iridium maintains that its networkis designed to interconnect with all existing telecom systems.Back to Headline List WT03-B13-12IA086-000622-B039-273http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te124.html 205.156.212.5 19970122051353 text/html 29330HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:12:01 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:32 GMTContent-length: 29143Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te124.html Sample Issue Copyright MULTIMEDIA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNet January 8, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES *LATEST NEWS* INTERACTIVE TV MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED (810 words) ATM, ETHERNET WILL COEXIST IN THE SHORT TERM (724 words) 1996 MAY BE BIGGEST YEAR YET FOR VIDEOCONFERENCING (738 words) MSNBC BRINGS MICROSOFT ONE STEP CLOSER TO TECHNOLOGY DOMINATION (814 words) STRATACOM UNVEILS ATM SVC SWITCHING (476 words) VIDEOSERVER ANNOUNCES MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE SERVER (324 words) FIRST VIRTUAL UNVEILS DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA COLLABORATION PRODUCTS (369 words) CopyrightMULTIMEDIA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996INTERACTIVE TV MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTEDAlthough the promise of true interactive television stillcaptivates the public, analysts now believe it will takelonger to come to fruition than originally expected.Recent interactive TV trials, including a 4,000 hometrial in Orlando, Fla., conducted by Time Warner, havenot gone as well as expected.  Analysts believe thereasons include an immature system, a price point thatis too high for providers to make money, and amarketplace that isn't quite ready to jump intointeractivity.The nascent industry is still trying to overcome itsearly boastful claims about the price and breadth ofservices interactive TV would provide.  Analysts now saythose claims were blown out of proportion and causedconfusion in the marketplace.Telephone and cable companies originally claimed thatinteractive TV would be relatively easy to implement andthat it could be done in a cost-effective manner,explained Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS StrategicDecisions (Norwell, Mass.).  "After a while, thecompanies began believing their own claims and nobodywould admit that it would be harder to implementtechnically and profitably than had originally beenbelieved," he said.One stumbling block to fast adoption of interactivetelevision may be that consumers are not interestedenough or ready for interactive television in its currentincarnation.  As a result, the industry will have todefine a very low-cost entry point for interactivetelevision to become a reality soon, said Tom Maresca,an analyst at Jupiter Communications (New York, N.Y.).The level of sophistication of current interactivetelevision offerings also has been rather poor, whichdoesn't endear consumers to the concept, said WalterMiao, an analyst at Link Resources (New York, N.Y.).Lack of standards and interoperability are other factors."TV viewers today are accustomed to being passive withour TV sets.  The only thing that has even been a littleinteractive up until now has been the remote control ora video game," Miao explained.  "If interactive TV isgoing to catch on, we need to define new levels ofinteractivity, and we need to do it slowly.  You have tostart small, which is part of the mistake so far.  Asmuch as I admire Time Warner for putting in a full-service network in Orlando, they are trying to doeverything.  That's a mistake, and it's expensive."Starting small may mean creating an entry-levelinteractive system just for games, Miao said.  "Show mean interactive TV system I can just do shopping andtransactions on.  Then define that system as a scalablesystem so I can scale it up from 20 to 200 households andthen to 2000 households.  Then I can start adding newinteractive services.  That's the way you can ratchetthings up."The best way to deliver interactive television is to doso incrementally, agreed Penhune.  "Reality is that morelimited forms of what we would call interactive TV willdeployed to more people over the next year or so.  We'llsee a scaled-down version of services.  You are going tosee more high-end pay-per-view TV from cable people andnear video-on-demand, where instead of being able tochoose any of 2,000 movies and run them instantly at anytime with stop, fast forward, and rewind, you will havea choice of 50 to 100 movies, delivered at 15 minuteintervals.  The industry will see that there will be noproblem providing those types of servicescost-effectively."THE FUTURE OF INTERACTIVITYIt may be that in the end, interactive television, theInternet, and on-line services will all be meldedtogether.  "You are starting to see video and audio on-demand on the Internet.  It is getting to the point whereit is starting to resemble TV more than it ever hasbefore," Maresca said.Ten years from now, people probably will be accessing theInternet in a much more robust fashion than via their TVsets, "but this will be an Internet that has multimedia,video, audio, and a heavy look and feel to it," Marescapredicted.  Many of the services that are starting to bedone over the Internet now, including banking andshopping, will most likely grow, and those same types ofapplications eventually can be extended to the televisionenvironment, he said.The industry will have to mature a little more beforeconsumers can receive interactive television servicesthey will value at a cost they will pay, Miao added.  Andtoday's world is primarily an analog world, whileinteractivity is best suited to a digital world.  Thesefactors mean that the beginnings of true interactivetelevision probably won't happen until at least the endof 1996, Miao said.WORLDWIDE SHIPMENTS OF INTERACTIVE TELEVISIONSUBSCRIPTIONS (Source:  Dataquest)1993:     6,0001994:    10,0001995:    25,7601996:    54.0961997:    97,3731998:   223,9571999: 1,363,219(KAREN D. SCHWARTZ)Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996ATM, ETHERNET WILL COEXIST IN THE SHORT TERMLONG TERM UNCERTAIN:  IN THE SHORT TERM, ANALYSTS EXPECTAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Ethernet each tohave a secure place in the networking arena because eachserves a unique purpose.  On the desktop, Ethernet is theclear protocol of choice, both in terms of efficiency andprice, said John Morency, an analyst at The Registry, aconsultancy in Newton, Mass.Ethernet on the desktop, both at 10 megabits per second(Mbps) and 100 Mbps, has a bright future, Morency said.Fast Ethernet meets the capacity demand and appears tohave the support of virtually all of the major hubvendors, including Cabletron, Bay Networks, and 3Com.Most people will continue to deploy Ethernet to thedesktop because it is most cost-effective to do so, saidDave Passmore, an analyst at Decisys (Sterling, Va.), anetwork consulting firm.Ethernet on the desktop also is popular because users donot have to worry about support for ATM LAN emulation."All the current software people run on their desktopmachines today assumes a broadcast LAN environment likeEthernet, and if you go to ATM, you open a Pandora's box"of LAN emulation with ATM, the standard for which isrelatively new, Passmore explained.  But when it comesto linking Ethernet switches together, ATM comes intoplay.  Decisys sees ATM as the backbone to link thoseswitches together.Just as Ethernet seems to have a lock on the currentdesktop, ATM is currently best suited to the backbone,or the pipe that provides quality of service alongmultiple virtual connections, allowing the user toprocess voice, video, and data simultaneously.  For thenext three years, Passmore advised counting on ATM as thebackbone to tie routers and switches together.ATM prices are declining fairly rapidly, which bodes wellfor the technology, said Mordechai Fester, ATM productmanager for Cisco Systems.  "In some situations, thatcould make it tougher for Ethernet.  You could easilyimagine a scenario where if ATM had stayed at $2,000 perserver the way it was a year or two ago, people would bedelaying implementation of ATM and might favor anothertechnology," he said.More important than declining prices for ATM is therollout of the next generation of ATM switching.Production-ready ATM backbone switches will hit themarket this year, prompting many companies to move to ATMas a mainstream backbone technology, Fester said.ATM on the desktop will happen eventually, but don'texpect to see it in most commercial organizations untilthe year 2000 at the earliest, Passmore predicted."We really don't see desktop ATM really taking off to anysignificant extent in 1996," agreed Morency.  "Technologywill still be too expensive and there isn't going to bereal interoperability to exist to make network managersfeel comfortable enough.  It will take time for it toreally mature."1997 AND BEYONDAlthough 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps Ethernet have their place,something much faster is on the horizon.  GigabitEthernet will supply full-duplex fiber links over 20kilometers; a copper version will cover shorterdistances.  Although the impact of Gigabit Ethernet onthe market in 1996 is negligible, it may take off in1997, when the specification is expected to be released.Gigabit Ethernet is still quite new, and it isn't clearwhether it will meet distance limitations, Passmore said."Today, if you are going to the trouble of putting fiberin to give you any kind of distance, you might just aswell use ATM," he said.When Gigabit Ethernet finally arrives, it may give ATMa run for its money.  But because ATM has been aroundlonger and is more firmly entrenched, it may win out,Passmore speculated.  Ethernet is more of a knownquantity on the desktop, though, and users may turn toit.  "They might not like the idea of moving to a totallynew technology, therefore choosing the safety andfamiliarity of Ethernet," Morency said."If we are at the point next year where ATM LAN emulationreally hasn't taken off, ATM desktop connectivity isstill too expensive and not very interoperable, there maybe a lot of shops that may look to Gigabit Ethernet toprovide a short-term tactical implementation to get theadvantage of higher performance," he said.(KAREN D. SCHWARTZ)Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 19961996 MAY BE BIGGEST YEAR YET FOR VIDEOCONFERENCINGBill Gates, who has as many opinions as he has millions,has said that videoconferencing, although a promisingtechnology, cannot compete with personal contact.  "Aface-to-face meeting is still a better way to collaboratethan the most ideal videoconferencing solution," he hassaid.For once, analysts agree with Gates.  But althoughnothing can compete with a face-to-face meeting, it isn'talways possible or practical.  In those cases,videoconferencing may be an ideal solution, especiallyas the technology matures and standards designed tosupport it are put into place.1996 will be the year videoconferencing comes into itsown, predicted Sarah Dickinson, president of Dickinsonand Associates (Cambridge, Mass.), a videoconferencingconsulting firm.More and more companies are entering thevideoconferencing market, and as large companies becomemore involved, the market will begin to accelerate, saidTony Paradiso, director of marketing in PictureTel'spersonal systems division.  PictureTel has a 50 percentmarket share, but it is smaller than many of itscompetitors.  A growing installed base of PC users andlarge companies like Intel and British Telecom, whichhave recently entered the market, will help bringvisibility to the technology.  Such large companies helpeducate the market and help accelerate the technology'sacceptance, Paradiso said.STANDARDS WILL HELP ACCEPTANCE... AND PRICEAs standards for videoconferencing loom on the horizonand the technology becomes simpler and less expensive,the videoconferencing market will grow more quickly,analysts believe.The standard that will have the largest effect onvideoconferencing's expected boom is H.324, which willcreate an integration of videoconferencing within thedomain of the home PC, Paradiso explained.  Approved lastmonth, H.324 is the standard everyone will build to, hesaid.  It will force the quality of video to improve andprices to become dramatically lower, and will fosterinterest by the consumer market.H.324 also will allow videoconferencing to be used withregular telephone lines, but the jury is still out onwhether people are going to be interested in usingvideoconferencing that way, Dickinson said.  Mostimportantly, H.324 will bring videoconferencing into amobile environment for laptops and business travelers.That capability is critical to widespread acceptance, shesaid.Another standard crucial to widespread acceptance ofvideoconferencing is H.323, which allows forvideoconferencing over a local area network.  H.323 willmakes video over the LAN a very popular application,Dickinson predicted.  It is expected to be approved bythe International Telecommunications Union (ITU) by theend of this year.  And on the horizon is a plannedstandard for videoconferencing for ATM, currently beingdiscussed at the ITU.Such standards will lead to cost decreases, predictedParadiso.  "In the past, AT&T and other companies hadvideophones, but they were $1,500, [they had] terriblequality, and they were proprietary," he explained.  "Butwith these standards, two videoconferencing users can buyequipment from two different vendors.  You will beginseeing PC vendors adding videoconferencing capabilitiesto their platforms, and you will be able to do video overstandard phone lines.  All of this will bring the pricesdown and availability up."Last on the standards list is T.120, the information-sharing piece ratified in 1995.  Although some vendorsclaim compatibility, take that claim with a grain ofsalt, warned Steve Kimball, an analyst with META Group(Reston, Va.).  "They have probably tested it on theirown products, but haven't tested it yet with differentvendors' products.  It will be more toward the secondhalf of 1996 that T.120 compliance really getsaddressed," he said.BY THE NEW MILLENNIUMVideoconferencing over the Internet also is an importantadvance, Dickinson said.  Products like Apple's QuickTimeconferencing kit will give users videoconferencingcapabilities over the Internet using TCP/IP or regularEthernet LAN and at the higher end, over ISDN.  Thiscapability will attract a new group of users, which iscrucial for the technology's continued success, she said.As the decade progresses, widespread adoption ofvideoconferencing by businesses will become more likely,Kimball said, but it will take a few years for businessesto realize enough benefit from the technology and for thetechnology to become more affordable.  "If it becomescheap enough that it doesn't matter whether it isinstalled [in PCs] or not, then all of a sudden peopleget used to communicating that way.  At that point, hesaid, it will become a commodity.(KAREN D.

The revolutionary news service,dubbed MSNBC, is designed to take advantage of NBC'snewsgathering expertise and Microsoft's strength incomputer technology, both through its software and itsfledgling on-line service, Microsoft Network.As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said when the deal wasannounced, people want to be able to call up news ondemand at their convenience.  While watching breakingnews on television, consumers want to be able to getaccess to more in-depth information on items of interest.The deal with NBC will help create innovative interactivenews content and an integrated media experience, heexplained.The deal calls for Microsoft to invest $220 million overfive years for a 50 percent stake in the all-news cablestation.  Both Microsoft and NBC will invest $200 millionover five years to fund the cable channel and asupporting on-line service.Areas of special interest for Microsoft includeinteractive television and on-line computer services,both of which will be incorporated into the MSNBCventure.Gates apparently wanted to enter the news business verybadly: when a deal to acquire a large stake in TurnerBroadcasting Service went awry last August, Microsoft gotback in the saddle and spent the next several monthscontemplating and executing a plan to get what it wanted.With the MSNBC deal, it may have done just that.A BETTER PLANThe MSNBC venture is a much better way to go thanMicrosoft's previous idea, which was to form its own newsorganization, said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst withArlen Communications Inc. (Bethesda, Md.).  Microsoft hadhired more than 20 reporters, who would form the genesisof what might have been Microsoft's unique newsorganization.But the current plan allows Microsoft to have a buffer."Not only does Microsoft get to provide state-of-the-artnews, but it also doesn't get taken to task as a newsagency, which might have been very difficult from acorporate point of view," Krasilovsky said.The MSNBC venture will have to prove that there is amarket for people who want to customize this type ofinformation, said Peter Bernstein, president ofInfoNautics Consulting Inc. (Ramsey, N.J.).  "I thinkthere is a small segment of the population that would beinterested in doing that, but the question is whetherthey will be willing to pay a stiff price for it," hesaid.  "Will the perceived value be there for the serviceto get the kind of penetration it will need to besuccessful?"At this point, it is difficult to envision that peoplewho are accustomed to getting information one way willchange their behavior so radically as to heavily use theservice MSNBC plans to provide, Bernstein said.  "ButMicrosoft and NBC have plenty of money, and if they wantto back it to the extent that it will probably need tobe backed to change people's behavior, they can do it.It's a question of marketing, and Microsoft has provenitself very good at marketing."By entering into this deal, Microsoft is covering allbases, trying to position itself as a premier contentprovider.  This agreement, along with Microsoft Networkand Microsoft's strong interest in interactivetelevision, is Microsoft's move into the real-timecontent business.  "They honestly believe that contentis going to be king in the future," and Microsoft wantsto own a large part of that empire, Bernstein said.Content is key, agreed Jim Penhune, an analyst with BISStrategic Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  Microsoft has mademany alliances for content, including the defunct dealwith Turner Broadcasting and its relationship with SKGDreamworks.A STEPPING STONE TO INTERACTIVE TV?Some say that providing on-demand news is an interim steptoward gaining a foothold in the interactive televisionmarket.  Microsoft is hoping that MSNBC will be theinteractive TV vehicle for news information, somebelieve."You can't go wrong with content because all of it isfairly leveragable," Penhune explained.  "A year ago, oreven now, there is a lot of talk about [deals like this]giving Microsoft content for interactive TV.  But evenif it doesn't, it gives them content for all these othermedia as well, so it isn't like they are going to bestuck with something they can't use."Although projects like the MSNBC venture take plenty ofMicrosoft's energy and money, they will not distractMicrosoft from its core projects, Penhune said.  Thosecore projects are all targeted at the consumer market,"and if you accept the premise that they are consumer-and not business-oriented, then doing something like thisis not a distraction.  It is another way of addressingthe consumer market," he said.(KAREN D.

StrataCom ATM SVCsignaling also includes compliance with both ATM UNI 3.0and 3.1 with translation between these standards.The company also said it will support ATM SVC signalingfor ATM Frame UNI (FUNI) and ATM Inverse Multiplexed(AIMUX) interfaces with the delivery of these productsin the first quarter of 1996.  It will also support theInterim Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol (IISP) whichprovides interoperability with other vendor's ATMswitches and the Interim Local Management Interface(ILMI) protocol for ATM connection management.Unlike frame relay, ATM is widely viewed as theunderlying transport technology for multipleservices -- making ATM SVCs fundamental in supportinglarge numbers of users and high volumes of traffic.  SVCsare the foundation for several new ATM-based servicessuch as LAN interworking over ATM using LAN Emulation andMulti-Protocol Over ATM (MPOA) standards.  These serviceswill require the ability to rapidly establish andtear-down large numbers of connections.While permanent virtual circuits or PVCs must be pre-established and manually configured, SVCs make use of ATMsignaling information within each ATM cell allowingconnections to be automatically set up on-demand byswitches as ATM calls are requested by the user.ATM SVCs provide an ideal foundation for multimediaapplications, according to Stratacom.  While routerarchitectures aggregate many users' traffic, the use ofATM SVCs permits a separate connection for each pair ofusers and each application.  This allows quality ofservice guarantees which are essential for multimediacommunications.Though PVCs remain attractive for customers with alimited number of interconnected devices, as many moreusers come online -- as is evidenced by the growth of theInternet -- SVCs become a critical requirement.  SVCssignificantly reduce network administration byeliminating manual configuration of connections whileincreasing the flexibility by which devices can be addedto the network providing quicker connectivity to allother devices.The company is working on enhancements designed to scaleSVC capacity per switch to support millions of concurrentSVC connections and thousands of SVC call set-ups persecond.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996VIDEOSERVER ANNOUNCES MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE SERVERVideoServer Inc., a provider of H.320-based multipointcontrol units (MCU), announced availability of a newmember of its Multimedia Conference Server product familytargeted at large corporate users and service providers.MCUs mix audio and switch video signals to eachconference endpoint, allowing each participant to seeanyone else in the conference and hear the completediscussion.  Multipoint technology is critical formultimedia conferences to approach the efficiency andflexibility of face-to-face meetings, minus the hightravel costs.  Without an MCU, multimedia conferences arelimited to only two sites, hindering effectiveness asvirtual meetings.The dual-bus Model 2020 is the most powerful offering inVideoServer's Series 2000 family, which ranges fromentry-level MCUs to high-capacity units.  Withhigh-capacity, dual-bus design, the new model is targetedat large corporate sites and conference serviceproviders, supporting up to 32 sites using internalinverse multiplexers (IMUX) in 336 Kbps or 384 Kbpsconferences.Most cost effective for large corporate videoconferencingnetwork usage charges dominate the life cycle cost of anyvideoconferencing solution.  Over a five-year life cycle,it's not uncommon for these charges to exceed equipmentcosts by a factor of ten to one.  The challenge forvideoconferencing managers, then, is to deploy conferencenetworks that use MCUs to minimize network charges andwill scale with future demand.While small, distributed MCUs keep phone costs down inlow-volume scenarios, large corporate facilities benefitfrom large, centralized MCUs.  For organizations withmore than three or four hours of videoconferencingbetween any two sites each day, running leased T1 or E1lines from each remote site to a centrally located Model2020 yields substantially lower network costs thanswitched digital services.  In addition to lower overallnetwork costs provided by leased lines in higher volumescenarios, the cost of conferences between satelliteoffices that are connected through the centrally-locatedModel 2020 is essentially free.  Management costs alsodrop when the MCU is centralized.Back to Headline List CopyrightMULTIMEDIA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996FIRST VIRTUAL UNVEILS DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA COLLABORATIONPRODUCTSFirst Virtual Corp. announced several products targetedat business users interested in desktop multimediacollaboration.The company's FIRST-Multimedia Switches deliver ATM tothe desktop at switched Ethernet prices, according to thecompany.  The family is built with a "stackable/modular"architecture allowing for a variety of scalableconfigurations and can scale to support eight to 24 usersper switch; 120 users per stack and can further providescalability through the backbone.The cost is $300 per 25 Mbps ATM port.  The switches aresupport multimedia through modular options including: 25Mbps ATM for the desktop, Ethernet, token ring for LANaccess, and 155 ATM OC3 for server or backbone switchaccess.The switch complies with ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and 3.1Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) signaling and LANemulation standards to ensure interoperability withexisting LAN data applications and other vendors' ATMproducts.The ATM telecom gateway has been enhanced to includePRI/TI support.  The Gateway Server is an ATM-TelecomGateway which distributes high-quality, remote H.320videoconferencing streams from the Telco WAN to thedesktop over a local ATM network.  It addshigh-performance ISDN PRI and T1 WAN rates, enablingroom-system quality wide-area videoconferencing andgreater capacity for multimedia traffic and users.The FIRST-WWW Server enables Internet users to cachedata, graphics and video streams off of the web in theFIRST-Multimedia Storage Server.  This storage cachehelps facilitate fast access and high quality playbackby users on the ATM or LAN network.  Users can store andshare commonly-used video streams, as well as documentsthat incorporate video, data and images using standardInternet browsers.In addition to being a QoS manager for out-of-the-boxapplications running over ATM, MOS now enables live videostreams to be encoded into MPEG-1 real-time, thendistributes them to various desktops within theorganization using ATM's point-to-multi-point features.PC users can receive high-quality, broadcast video whileperforming any network activity.FIRST-H.320 introduces development capabilities, via aSoftware Developers Tool Kit (SDK) for store and forwardof H.320 streams. This will allow applications such asVideo-Mail and Video Session storage.  Videoconferencingusers will have the same benefits as voice mail users,namely, the ability to leave a video message.Back to Headline List WT03-B13-13IA086-000622-B040-31http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te130.html 205.156.212.5 19970122051549 text/html 304390HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:12:29 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:30 GMTContent-length: 304202Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te130.html Sample Issue Copyright NETGUIDE via NewsNet January 1, 1996 Vol. 3 No. SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NET.JANUARY Net.January: We look at the future of the Web, and ponder the online gender gap (500 words) NET MAIL Net Mail: The Ones That Got Away (329 words) Net Mail: Sharing Wares (83 words) Net Mail: No Integration?

(1105 words) CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net.January: We look at the future of the Web, and ponder the online gendergapThe beginning of the year is a traditional time to think aboutthe future, and in the net biz we have more than a little futureto look forward to. In four years, we'll have reached the milleniuma nice round number that's as good a place as any to aim for.We sent Karen Heyman out to talk to a bunch of Smart Peopleabout what the Web will look like in the year 2000. Everyonehad their own ideas, but they all agreed on two things: thatthe Web is here to stay, and that it will look nothing likewhat we've got today. The story's called "Web 2000," and itstarts on page 52.You've Got MailBut for now, we're still dealing with the net as we know itand for most of us, that means e-mail. Kevin Reichard surveyedthe world of Windows and Mac e-mail clients, and found a lotof excellent programs for not a lot of money. "Push the E-MailEnvelope," starting on page 60, tells you what we picked asthe best of a good lot.Weaving a WebThe first question about the Web is generally, "How do I writemy own home page?" The second (and more important) questionis usually, "Where do I put my page so people can see it?"The three biggest online services have been slow to let theirusers become part of the Web. That's changed, as America Online,CompuServe and Prodigy now give their clients Web space anda simple non-HTML means to create pages.Of course, neither all pages nor all online services are createdequal. Frequent contributor Joel T. Patz clues us in on whichone is best. The story about "Pre-Fab Home Pages" starts onpage 76.Women OnlineOne of the enduring questions about online life is where allthe women are. The latest survey shows that about one-thirdof the people online are female, but that's significantly lessthan the half of the population that are women. Judith Broadhurst,an expert in the field of women online, spoke to many womensome connected, some not-and got them to explain what it isthey're looking for. "Bridging the Gender Gap" starts on page84.And Also Net.News this month offers tips on how not to be a victim ofonline scams, reminds you how to tell the difference betweena denizen of California's Silicon Valley and New York's SiliconAlley, and clues you in on your phone company's plans for Internetaccess.In Workshops, you'll learn the ins and outs of IRC, how to getyour small business online, what graphic tools you really need,and what the top 10 planning issues are that Webmasters needto pay attention to.And, of course, don't forget our columnists, the reviews inNet.Results, and the customary 300 ratings and reviews in CyberGuide.Happy New Year!Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net Mail: The Ones That Got AwayIn the November 1995 issue of NetGuide, you provided a rathercomprehensive review of the more popular and current versionsof browsers ("New Directions for Browsers," page 56). Why notfollow up with something about the grandfather of them all NCSA Mosaic and Cello. These two browsers have been aroundfor quite some time. They are not as flashy as Netscape, butthey will work on the millions of computers manufactured before1995 that have been sold with 4 MB of RAM or even less.Howard BinghamHoustonI didn't see any mention of CompuServe's Spry Mosaic in thearticle and wasn't sure what that means. I'm also confusedabout the term "Mosaic" when it's used by itself or as "SpryMosaic." Is this the same browser?Jack GallowaySnohomish, Wash.I was dismayed to discover that you did not include OS/2 WebExplorerin your survey of Web browsers. I would have liked to see howit stacked up against the several Windows/Mac browsers youdid include in your review. WebExplorer has been availablefor a year now. What are you waiting for?Charles HenrichNew YorkNCSA's "Mosaic" was the first graphical browser in widespreaduse, and its core technology was licensed widely in early 1995.That's why so many browsers have the name Mosaic, even thoughthey're evolving in very different directions. That confusesyou, and it confused us. Spry Mosaic accidentally dropped outof our November roundup; we did, however, review it in Decemberas part of the excellent Mosaic In A Box.NCSA Mosaic and Cello didn't appear because they are now secondtier products whose technology has been passed by. We didn'tinclude WebExplorer because there is no other major browserfor the OS/2 platform; if you're running OS/2, you don't havemuch of a choice, and if you're not using OS/2, WebExplorerisn't enough of a reason to change your mind.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net Mail: Sharing WaresIn "Party Girl Lets Loose on the Net" (October 1995, page 29),Ron Bel Bruno refers to the software program CU-SeeMe as a"public-domain shareware program." Being a shareware authormyself, I find it astounding that two very different typesof software would be combined into one. I suppose that "publicdomain shareware" is something akin to "military intelligence"and "journalistic research," no?Brad StowersRaleigh, N.C.CU-SeeMe is freeware, but its copyright is held by Cornell University.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net Mail: No Integration?As one who came to the Internet through one of those user-friendly,convenient online services, I have recently been surprisedto discover an almost complete lack of integrated softwarefor accessing the Internet. It seems to me that one or moresoftware engineers would recognize this as a golden unservedmarket niche and dive in with a new product, yet I continueto be told that no integrated suite or all-Internet "frontend" exists. Frankly, this is astonishing to me.David RitterAngwin, Calif.You're told wrong. We'll be reviewing these so-called "box solutions"in the near future.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net Mail: Wrap MusicRegarding the November 1995 Net.Mail letter "Wrapping It Up,"I'd prefer to add slightly to the "waste disposal problem"and receive my monthly issue in one undamaged piece. Enclosingthe magazine in plastic makes it just a little tougher forthe U.S. Postal Service to destroy.Jim BarberLakewood, Colo.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net Mail: ColumnyThe last paragraph in Mark Eckenwiler's Net.Law column (November1995, page 39) says that it should trouble us all that a personserved with a subpoena would have to choose between self-incriminationand contempt of court. How about being honest and telling thetruth? What really troubles me is that because the criminalconspirators of the example were co-workers, we're supposedto bend the law and become co-conspirators to help them getaway with their crimes. Honest people don't have to lie orworry about self-incrimination.Herb ZiemanI commend Dan Rosenbaum for his use of the immigrant metaphorin his November 1995 column on the new wave of Internet users(page 17). I found it both apt and imaginative. However, thereis another source of hostility that will continue to existon the net that has far less to do with the clash between newand old than it does with the human animal.The Internet is the great equalizer of this era, and we areall potential Davids against our perceived Goliaths. Peoplelash out on the Internet because they can-because they areinsulated and safe behind their screens-and this is an unfortunateby-product of an otherwise indispensable form of communication.But I suppose this is simply another example of the Internetparadox: Just as the system unites us, it keeps us very muchapart.Andrew MaddenSan FranciscoBack to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net Mail: Immorality in CyberspaceI would like to congratulate the authorities who caught thoseresponsible for trafficking child porn and seducing minorsonline ("FBI Thwarts E-mail Porn Ring," December 1995, page21). It is those [people] who give online services and theInternet a bad name. While I believe in free expression onthe Internet, I also believe that it's an absolute disgraceto abuse this exciting technology. Once again, the crimes ofa few are ruining it for the rest of us.Brian HeddenOld Bridge, N.J.In response to a letter written by Stephen W. Nicholas in theNovember 1995 issue (page 11), I must say that Mr. Nicholas,who claims we must "prevent the tyranny that comes from toomuch freedom," seems to be barking up the wrong tree.What is "frightening" about "the fact that the average citizenhas access to a numbingly vast amount of information"? Freeinformation access sets humans free from any oppressors.Government regulation will not prevent immorality from invadingcyberspace. The only way to have nothing to fear is to educatepeople to understand their fears and to take individual actionto protect against them.Mark D.

Assuming there is, I sometimeswonder if I really want to be a part of it.Depending on whose abacus you use, there are either about 8million, 15 million, or 20 million of us online geeks in theUnited States. As far as the worldwide Internet populationis concerned, you'll probably get a shrug for an answer, butan estimate of 30 million seems fair.That's a lot of people-on the scale of New York, Mexico City,or Tokyo. Populations like that are in a weird netherzone.They're not big enough to make a serious demographic dent.A television show with 8 million viewers, for instance, ison the fast track to cancellation. But 8 million people canmake a lot of noise, especially when they're equipped withcomputers and modems.It's the noise that worries me. There's always been a certainamount of noise on the net, a side attraction to the greatinformation that's available for the mining. The noise levelrose and fell with the season (early fall and midwinter wereusually the worst), but it was generally possible to ignoreor tolerate it.In the last year, the noise level has risen dramatically. Spamsand e-mail bombing are a weekly occurrence. What was once theoccasional appearance of a chain letter has become an unremittingcadence. Constant struggles continue between regular participantsof some newsgroups and those people who seem intent in drowningout the group's charter simply because they have a spare week.This behavior is not new. I have fond memories of the "cats"conference in the earliest days of the BIX online service,which devolved quickly and hilariously (if somewhat tastelessly)into a debate between cat fanciers and cat haters. Perhapsthe exact point is that the same people were frequently onboth sides of the "battle." In this particular case, the noisewas the signal.Not very long ago, any material that was even remotely salaciousor offensive would be "rot-13"-ed, the letters substitutedfor others 13 letters away: "a" becomes "n," "b" becomes "o.""Sheesh" becomes "furrfu," and vice versa. (Try it, it's fun!)Newsreaders could translate a posting into a rot-13ed textwith a single keystroke, protecting even the daintiest sensibility.Yet, anyone could read such a posting if desired.Rot-13 still exists on Usenet, but its use is now nearly archaic.People just post what they want to say. The rights of the personwho might not want to see something inappropriate or upsettinghave been almost totally overtaken by the rights of a posterhell-bent on free expression.I'm hardly the only person worried about this. You may or maynot realize that the technical basis for the Internet is aseries of Requests for Comments that have been circulated widely,discussed, and agreed upon. RFCs are what make the net work.Most of them deal with abstruse technical questions of datacommunications and message formatting. But there is now anRFC 1855, which attempts to codify netiquette. Created by SallyHambridge at Intel, RFC 1855 is a lengthy and detailed discussionof the dos and don'ts of the net. It is so detailed, in fact,that most newbies will never hear about it and never read it.There's another problem with RFC 1855: The coarsening of thenet has little to do with newbies. It's not newbies who crosspostchain letters across the world. It's not newbies who take overnewsgroups. It's not newbies who set electronic robots looseto cancel posts they deem "wrong." It's sophisticated users,operating sophisticated tools, who are making the net a worseplace to be.Of course, it's the rowdies who often affect how a communityis perceived. If a town is full of graffiti, or if the grasson the highway berms is unkempt, the town will look neglected,and reality will usually follow the perception.That's why I'm so worried about the future of The WELL.The WELL-Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link-has long been one of thespecial places on the net. It can trace its lineage directlyback to the Community Memory project, in which customers ofthe San Francisco-area Whole Earth stores could type essays,thoughts, commentaries, or just plain ramblings into strategicallyplaced computer terminals.Other people could respond to those postings, or start off onentire new topics of their own. It was an experiment in interactivity,in community, in communications. A commercial success it wasnot. But Community Memory was an important piece of the mosaicthat became the online world.One of the great things about The WELL-perhaps the single greatestthing-is its clientele. Among its several thousand customersare the very people making the electronic revolution happen.It's a notoriously tough audience: Know what you're talkingabout when you post, or you risk getting reduced to cinders.On the other hand, The WELL's conferences read like a historyof online communication. It was the place where Time magazine'snotorious cyberporn story got debunked, and it's one of theplaces that helped track down hacker Kevin Mitnick.It used to be hard to get to The WELL. It's in the San FranciscoBay Area, and for the longest time it required a long-distancecall if you weren't in the neighborhood. Even after the serviceallowed access over the Internet via Telnet, The WELL remainedsteadfastly terminal-based. No graphical interfaces here. Ifyou wanted to participate in a conference, you had to learnan admittedly arcane command structure. The users seemed tolike it that way. Keeps out the bozos, they said.But this past fall, The WELL introduced a new interface basedon the World Wide Web. Now, for $5 a month, you can fire upyour Web browser and dive in. The WELL is now simple and uncomplicatedeven if the users are still a tough audience.But if The WELL becomes easy to use, easy to get to, and easyto afford, what's to keep it from getting overrun by the samevandals who seem intent on ruining the rest of the net? Arewe on the verge of losing one of our special places?The folks at The WELL say no. What will protect them, they say,is their sense of community. That doesn't mean keeping outall outsiders. Quite the opposite; they seem to believe stronglyin the need for new blood I wrote about in this space two monthsago.The answer, they say, lies in the concept of community. It'sabsurd to believe that 20 million people form any sort of communityjust because they happen to inhabit the same non-space. Insome ways, I have more in common with the person who worksin the office next to mine than I do with my upstairs neighbor;in other ways, the reverse is true.We all belong to many communities, and the ones defined by proximityor distance have become for many of us-particularly those ofus who are online-the least important. If a community is bestdefined as a group of people with a common interest, the netis awash with overlapping communities. And communities defendthemselves.This is not necessarily a popular concept online. More thanonce, I've seen angry exchanges between people who post inappropriatelyand someone trying to correct them. Inevitably, the originalposter will send a sentence like, "Who appointed you the NetPolice?" At that point, of course, most useful discourse betweenthe parties in question has ended.But the question is worth following. We're all the net police.We all need to defend our online communities against the thoughtlessand destructive elements who are undeniably there. The netis not some anarchic outpost where people can do what theywant. Its very existence is predicated on and depends uponcooperation. If the larger online community of more than 30million is to survive, people in the smaller communities willhave to stand tall and take the necessary measures to keeptheir areas the way they want them.You would do as much in your home, you would do as much whereyou work, and you would do as much in your town. If you believein the online community, you need to do as much on the net.@Dan Rosenbaum is editor of NetGuide.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net.News: Been Scammed?

Or how you could repair a bad credit recordby just paying the right people? Such bogus claims are thestuff of which online scams are made.Whether its investment fraud, money-making pyramids, illegalcredit repair offers, or even false software reseller fronts,the net's shadowy anonymity is a real lure for scam artists.According to the Federal Trade Commission, frauds commonlyappear as classified advertising or forum or bulletin boardnotices. These postings are disguised as testimonials aboutthe quality and performance of a particular product or service.Unscrupulous marketers even use chat rooms to pose as "satisfiedcustomers" who extol the virtues of fraudulent goods and services.Thankfully, the same warning signs of a shady deal that you'dlook for in the physical world also apply to online scams.Exaggerated claims, urgent sale closing deadlines, promisesof quick and easy profits, disclosures of insider trading information,and unsubstantiated claims are a few of these dead giveaways.In fact, the FTC's Web page at http://www.ftc.gov/ lists theseand more tips on how to distinguish a scam."It's in a new forum, [but] the old rules still apply," saysLynn Collins, spokeswoman for the National Advertising Divisionof the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB). Recently,the division's authority to evaluate false or misleading advertisingwas extended to the net.The most popular online scams, according to the FTC, resultfrom consumers ordering software online from vanishing vendors.To avoid such a bilk, Lee Peeler, associate director of advertisingpractices at the FTC, says it's best to authorize a creditcard purchase only after you've had a chance to review theproduct, or until it's received. Thanks to the shareware movement,a reputable software vendor will offer either a demo of theapplication or a trial period if you ask for it.Here are some additional tips for checking out a potential onlinescam:Procure a physical address. "This is important if a complaintis to be filed or action is taken against the company. Consumersshould always be wary of P.O. box businesses," Peeler says.These addresses, he says, are often the proxy for individualsusing their home computers as agents of fraud.Do your homework. Peeler suggests using newsgroups and chatrooms to get references before making a purchase. (However,it's important to verify the source of at least two or threesuch references, to make sure they're not false claims plantedby scammers.) When in doubt, the FTC also suggests you contactyour Internet or online service provider with information aboutsuspicious sites or promotions.To check financial or investment offers, consult the Securitiesand Exchange Commission at the Office of Consumer Affairs.The commission can tell you if an investment is registeredor if a salesperson is licensed to sell what's being offered.Use a credit card. Despite the security issues of releasingcredit card information over the Internet, Peeler says, "Whenyou go outside the credit card purchasing system, you loseprotection. There aren't any billing-disputes rights to protectyou from unauthorized purchases or theft."Make that call. Online fraud is clearly a global issue, thoughits enforcement remains a regional duty. Report suspiciousbusinesses or individuals to your local Better Business Bureau,Consumer Protection Agency or Attorney General's office. TheCBBB is adding a complaint form to its home page and plansto add an Internet scam alert section. If you feel a particularadvertisement is either misleading or completely false, theCBBB will evaluate your claim. If it determines the complaintvalid, it then will ask the advertiser to comply with ethicalstandards before taking legal action. The National Fraud InformationCenter's toll-free phone service, at 800-876-7060, takes fraudreports and answers consumers' questions about online scams.Report all losses. Collins urges consumers to report deceitfulbusinesses, no matter how little the loss. "You can help othersin the future to determine which businesses are ethical ornot," Collins says. "Scam artists depend on that $20 or $30from thousands of people the same as if they have received$1 million from [one] individual."Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net.News: The Nielsen Survey Says By:Judith H.

Microsoft even feels it deserves some credit forwhatever overall improvements the market experiences. "Thefact that Microsoft entered the business, in some ways, raisedthe bar for online services. Suddenly, they're improving theirservices and coming up with more friendly user interfaces,"says Naveen Jain, MSN senior technical marketing manager.Microsoft remains mum on exact subscriber numbers, but industryanalysts estimate MSN acquired more than 400,000 subscribersafter its first two months in business. Before MSN launched,some analysts predicted up to 10 million users would sign onby the end of 1995. Meanwhile, Microsoft evangelists are keepingto a more modest goal-1 million subscribers by the end of itsfirst year.Early reviews of MSN criticized its alleged lack of bells andwhistles. This is not unusual, according to Jupiter Communicationsanalyst Adam Schoenfeld. He believes that while Microsoft did"a bad job of rolling MSN out, it would have been impossibleto live up to the hype surrounding it."In an attempt at maximum quality control, Microsoft maintainsit will cap its MSN subscriber base at 500,000 temporarilywhile it works out any bugs.

It wasthe victim of the cluelessness engendered by the very samenational online services that are busily hyping themselvesas purveyors of the Internet.When Catherine Yronwode, an America Online subscriber, was deniedUsenet posting privileges by the mail2news@cs.utexas.edu gateway,she posted a long, threatening letter of complaint to news.admin.miscand a dozen or so other newsgroups.The response of gateway-keeper Fletcher Mattox, who'd been responsiblefor providing this free-for-use, unfunded resource for a decade,was that of any sensible, overworked system administrator supportinga volunteer project. He pulled the plug. (Yronwode's activitywas not the sole cause of his decision. Her outburst, however,was inarguably the event that caused Mattox to decide it wastime to call it quits.)Many of the unofficial but valuable resources in the pre-delugeInternet and Usenet were similar labors of love. So, as theyget shut-or shot-down, how can they be replaced? And as newservices get offered, how can they be funded in ways that areself-sustaining? Well, it depends on what kind of informationresource you're talking about. Once you pare away the servicesthat we'll gladly pay for, like BusinessWire or Dow Jones,you've got sites offering sales and marketing information fromthe likes of Apple, IBM, Sony, and others that will gladlypay to hawk their wares. What's left? A large middle ground,comprising commercial advertising and sponsorship.With sponsorship, businesses subsidize the online content wedo want, in return for attaching their own messages somewherewithin the content (it's the same theory as commercial TV).During the past year or so, sponsors have discovered the Internet,and the Internet has discovered the money font of sponsorships.In fact, there's no shortage of resources soliciting sponsorship.(For a list of prices for links and sponsorships, see http//www.netcreations.com/ipa/adindex.htm; for a list of "sponsorable"sites and resources, see http://www.trafficresource.com/.)However, few companies are willing to sponsor sites withoutfirst getting some information about the site's traffic-preferablyevidence of "readership." In current Internet jargon, thatmeans counting hits. Sponsors want reassurance, and sites wantto command top price.Mandatory registration is one scheme that gathers user IDs andpasswords-along with demographics, in some cases-for the serviceprovider. This arrangement, initially employed by sites likeGNN, HotWired and others, has proved less than fruitful. Mostof us are already drowning in passwords and IDs. What's more,if these systems are so smart, why can't they validate us basedon information from our browsers?But why keep people out when your goal is to rope them in? Onlyinterested parties will stay for more than a screen's worthor two anyway. Sites like HotWired have adopted flexible strategies,putting enough of the information outside the "IDs required"zone that we can, at least, get a taste without having to gothrough registration first.Meanwhile, advertisers want hits. So sites run counting programs,which usually watch downloads of a graphic near the top ofan entry page. Companies like Nielsen and I/PRO have announced"site monitoring and hit reporting/analysis" services to sliceand dice this traffic data.There's only one problem. The data's meaningless. For one thing,lots of people aren't downloading the hit-triggering items.They may have their browsers set to "no-graphics" mode, toexpedite page-getting.This method doesn't count users employing a non-graphics browser,like Lynx, which doesn't even touch graphics (unless you'reusing a shell-enhancer like SLIPknot or I-Comm, or findingand grabbing images "by hand"). This situation alone invalidatesmost count figures.Yet another, more practical issue: A user may come in via theside door, by zooming below the top page to something on alower page, never triggering the graphics. Add this user tothe pile of visitors the hit-counters won't catch.Some Webwatchers out there don't rely on watching one or twopieces, but instead watch all requests. Does this mean datawe can count on? Once again, no. Many users have their Webwareset to cache-that is, to save retrievals on disk. Many sitesuse "proxies" that cache these retrieval requests. So if UsersB, C and D request a Web URL that User A's already asked for,B's, C's, and D's requests will be fulfilled locally-from thecached copy-instead of dragging duplicates across the Internet.This scheme helps reduce unnecessary load on a site's Internetconnection. That's a good thing, since three or four Mosaicusers grabbing weather maps can saturate a 56-kilobit-per-secondline. But for advertisers, it means site visitors are seeingthe content they sponsor without being counted.One solution would be Web servers and browsers that could sendback hit reports whenever a URL was examined from a local cacheinstead of being retrieved again. If Webware would check aURL's "last-modified" data automatically before deciding whetherto retrieve or use what's cached, hit-counters could get thisas by-product.But all this still begs the question-because it's not a donedeal-are hits the appropriate currency to assess Web usage?Even those actual download-based hits don't mean anything.The Web is bursting with people looking at sites because of"coolness," or just cruising at random. "Sure, it's nice tosee tens or hundreds of thousands, even millions of hits ina Web log," says Larry Chase, president of The Online Ad Agency(http://advert.com). "But what's the sense if all they do ishit your home page and bounce off into the atmosphere, neverto be heard from again?""The trick is attracting qualified leads that eventually leadto conversions," Chase says. Conversions may be immediate orders,or requests for brochures or prices, but they indicate definiteinterest in the company and its offerings.Companies shouldn't read too much into hits per day, or evenhit levels after specific announcements. "Some sales cyclesare longer than others," Chase points out. "800FLOWERS has a short sales cycle, while Liberty Mutual Insurancehas a longer one. The key is tracking from when the conversionscame, not the hits. I'd gladly pay more for a stream of qualifiedprospects that are apt to turn into conversions than less forthousands of meaningless visitors, who'll forget I ever existedthree clicks after they left my site." Any site that can reportconversions and customers, not just a lot of hits, is boundto make the short list when a company is evaluating which sitesto sponsor.But there may still be a role for hit-watching. For example,good hit reporting can track derivative information, like howmany visitors become customers or how long it usually takes(do they buy on the first or fourth visit?). This can helpa site manager re-evaluate and fine-tune the selling part ofthe Web.If you still think hits can be meaningful, here are two Internettools I've conceptualized: HitMaker and BrowserBeater. IMHBCO(In My Humble But Correct Opinion), these products would renderhit-counting meaningless. HitMaker would take a list of URLsand "hit" them with specified frequency-a great way to inflatehit counts. It wouldn't be long before the credibility of hitcounts would suffer. The flip side of the coin would be BrowserBeater.This anonymous Web browser would work in tandem with a proxyserver to shield your identifying information. To access IDrequired sites like HotWired, BrowserBeater would "borrow"names from appropriate lists of pre-registered IDs and passwordsfor such Web sites.The HitMaker and BrowserBeater could skew a site's hit ratesignificantly. But even if they're never developed, I don'tthink it would change hit-counting's diminishing status. Ifsponsors are going to require "proof of value" from sites,let's give them a meaningful metric.Daniel P. Dern (ddern@world.std.com) is an author, speaker,and analyst based in Newton Centre, Mass.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net.MediaBy:Michelle SlatallaPhil Gramm waves an American flag in my face. He hopes it'llremind me of him. Pat Buchanan compiled an archive of patriotichistorical documents for me to read.And Bill Clinton? He keeps offering to show me photos of himand Hillary ladling in a soup kitchen.The 1996 presidential campaign season is going to be differentfrom all previous years, for one reason-the candidates aresetting up Internet headquarters. It makes sense, in theory,because it finally will give them a way to bypass the media,to shovel unlimited amounts of information directly at voters.A candidate can put up reams of transcripts of his speechesand put his own spin on these and other facts he disseminates."The Internet is perfect for Pat, because his message rightnow is not getting past the media. There's a media blackout,"says Linda Muller, the Internet coordinator for the Buchanancampaign. "I think people are tired of the media's digestionand regurgitation anyway. We don't need someone to tell uswhat we just heard. Let us draw our own conclusions."The candidates will rush to cyberspace in the coming months.I expect that the Old Media-newspaper, TV, and radio reporterswill have to start monitoring the net for news. Already, dozensof Web sites are conducting straw polls on the candidates andon issues. Those results might become fertile fodder for news."Reporters are still trying to figure out what it means to us,what it means in terms of doing a complete job covering thecampaign," says Susan Page, White House correspondent for USAToday. "It's good when people can get information unfiltered,like they can by watching C-SPAN, for instance. Then they don'thave to have a reporter, who may or may not be smart, filterit."In fact, there's a name for the act of cutting out the mediaand connecting the viewer with the source. It's "disintermediation,"one of my favorite big words. Good for using at a cocktailparty. Disintermediation is what the Internet is all about.Newspapers are limited by space; TV broadcasts are limitedby time. But the net has no time or space constraints. Youcan find as much information as you want, whenever you wantit.New kinds of media emerging online will most likely providethat detailed level of data. Congressional Quarterly, somethingI formerly used as a reference for term papers, could becomean influential media player in this new world, via a Web site.As far as the candidates are concerned, the Internet's highlyeducated voter population-12 million Americans with a penchantfor poring through reams of raw data-are exactly who they wantto reach. This could be a very good thing for us as voters,since we'll have more direct access to the candidates. We willno longer have to rely on The New York Times or the networks'newscasts to give us a quote from last night's rubber-chickendinner policy speech. Instead, we can log into a candidate'shome page and read the full text, then click to a hyperlinkthat tells us how he voted on the same issues in the past.For candidates trailing in the polls-those who can't afford30-second ad spots on prime-time TV shows-the Internet willbe a great equalizer. Setting up a home page on the Web ischeap. Case in point: A campaign volunteer designed Buchanan'sfor free and hung it on a server for only 50 cents a monthper megabyte of data (the first 5 MB are free)Candidates with deeper pockets will be able to experiment withthe Internet more intensely. For instance, a Boulder, Colo.based Web site called Votelink (http://www.votelink.com/) ishoping candidates will be willing to pay from $2,500 to $15,000a month for a package that includes surveys of voters' perceptionsof major issues and the candidates' platforms. Votelink onlineforums let the candidate (or his aides) sit at a computer andanswer voters' questions directly.But let's take a deep breath before we start predicting thatonline campaigns will totally transform the political landscape.Before I looked at any of the presidential candidates' homepages, I toyed with the idea that the net would elect the nextpresident. But the current state of cyberspace campaigns temperedmy enthusiasm.So far, most of the candidates' pages are unimaginative-a clickover to AT&T's site was exciting in comparison. There's a communicationsproblem here if I'd rather read about how switches work thancompare the candidates' abortion platforms.Maybe it's because the whole Web thing is new to them; afterall, they've been doing it for only a few months. The presidentialcandidates figured out the first step back in mid-1995: Getonline and that will be enough of a novelty to garner a frontpage story in The Wall Street Journal.The next step will be far more difficult. These politicians,who for the most part aren't too computer-literate themselves,will have to learn how to use the Internet more creativelyto deliver their messages.For now, the candidates seem content to mimic each other, withstraightforward text blocks dryly explaining their views onabortion, the budget, taxes, and other topics that could usesome multimedia effects.The candidates' personal idiosyncrasies manage to peek through,of course. But I wonder if that's even something they did onpurpose. Lamar Alexander-who pundits expect will rally withone of the more savvy net campaigns, since he's an outsiderlooking for a new medium for his message-wallpapered his page(http://www.nashville.net/~lamar/) to resemble his signatureflannel shirt. Buchanan's home page (http://www.buchanan.org) has a definite colonial style to it, with an emblem of anAmerican Eagle and the Buchanan Brigade Library, an onlinearchive of documents that includes stories about Paul Revere,poems, and prayers.Clinton's family photos on the White House's official home page(http://www.whitehouse.gov/) have the studied feel of a projectthat 50 editors signed off on. I got the same feeling fromwatching his biographical video at the Democratic Conventionin 1992. He has so many handlers that it is becoming increasinglyimpossible for him to convey anything authentic about himselfas a person.The same can be said for Bob Dole, judging from his home page(http://www.dole96.com/), where the hyper-glossy images ofhim smiling benignly recall those circa-1957 agricultural filmstripswe all had to watch in high school.Gramm's page (http://www.gramm96.org/), in comparison, is arelief. Despite the not-exactly-original American flag motif,it loads more quickly than other pages, and offers a straightforwardmenu of Gramm's stance on dozens of issues."You really want to avoid looking too blow-dried," says BerkeleyInternet Connections president Eric Davis, who designed Gramm'spage. "I sort of view the Internet as a place for scrappy youngmen and women, and I designed the page to appeal to peoplelike me, 25-year-old political junkies who know a lot abouthow the net works."Actually, if you're looking for trenchant political commentary,there are a few very witty sites to peruse-the many parodypages satirizing the candidates. The best fake Dole page (http//www.dole96.org/) is subtly wallpapered with Dole pineapplecan labels. Likewise, on one fake Buchanan page (http://www.buchanan96.org) you'll find that the candidate allegedly opposes abortionbecause "every fetus is a potential taxpayer. Each abortionreduces the tax base of the federal government."Some political consultants think candidates will remain cautiousabout their online images. For one thing, there's no hard evidenceabout who exactly reads these home pages and how the informationaffects voters' opinions. That kind of feedback won't be gathereduntil after November."How many voters can you reach? And how many net users lookat the political home sites in the next 90 days? Those arethe kinds of questions that need to be answered, because fornow the candidates still feel like they can probably reach20 times more people with TV," says Joel Benenson, a politicalconsultant at Penn & Schoen, which conducts polls on behalfof the Clinton campaign.These points are undoubtedly true. But how many of these citizensvote?Michelle Slatalla recently completed a suspense thriller aboutthe Internet.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net.LawBy:Mark EckenwilerOne of the wonderful things about cyberspace, generally speaking,is that each of us can create a new persona.Moreover, fanciful user names and the proliferation of anonymousremailers let us interact with other denizens of the globalelectronic village in near-total anonymity. In the future,it seems, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes.But while it may be true that (in the words of the now-famousNew Yorker cartoon) on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,the promise of anonymity also carries an undeniable downside.For every CancelMoose performing the public service of cancelingUsenet spam, there's another equally anonymous (but far lessbenign) poster-like the CancelPoodle, canceling articles thatcriticize the Church of Scientology. It's surely the best known,or more accurately, unknown offender.The cluster of issues surrounding online identity and pseudonymityprovokes legal questions as well. And while U.S. courts havehad little opportunity to analyze the legal status of electronicanonymity, the case of a disgruntled Ohio taxpayer's grassrootsprotest sheds some helpful light on the First Amendment's protectionof anonymous speech.At a 1988 public meeting, Margaret McIntyre expressed her oppositionto a proposed school-tax increase by handing out leaflets.McIntyre signed some of these leaflets "Concerned Parents andTaxpayers" instead of using her name. Although the flier containedno false or libelous statements, McIntyre found herself theobject of unwelcome attention-and the recipient of a $100 finefrom the Ohio Elections Commission.Her offense? She violated an Ohio election law that made itillegal to circulate written materials endorsing or opposinga candidate-or even a referendum issue-without the author'sname and address. While an Ohio trial court struck down thefine, two state appellate courts (including the Ohio SupremeCourt) decided that the First Amendment did not protect McIntyre.On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court voted overwhelmingly (7 to2) to strike down the statute. Writing for six members of theCourt, Justice John Paul Stevens noted that "under our Constitution,anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice,but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent It thusexemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of theFirst Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individualsfrom retaliation-and their ideas from suppression-at the handof an intolerant society."Even Justice Clarence Thomas, ordinarily not an overly zealousdefender of First Amendment rights, agreed with the outcome.Thomas noted that the Federalist Papers themselves-issued underthe name "Publius"-are among the most famous pseudonymous worksin American history.The McIntyre decision marked the culmination of a series ofSupreme Court cases that have found a right to anonymity underthe First Amendment. The Court laid the groundwork for thismodern trend in NAACP vs. Alabama (1958), holding that thestate of Alabama could not compel the NAACP to disclose itsmembership list. The strong likelihood that doing so wouldexpose NAACP members to threats and retribution meant, in theCourt's view, that compelled disclosure would harm the members'right to associate freely.Two years later, the Supreme Court enlarged the scope of FirstAmendment privacy in Talley vs. California. In that case, theCourt considered-and struck down-a Los Angeles ordinance prohibitingthe distribution of any anonymous leaflet, holding that a blanketban against anonymity violates the right to free speech underthe First Amendment.The importance of McIntyre is that it took a much narrower lawone regulating only certain types of anonymous publications(those advocating election causes)-and held it invalid underthe same rationale. Moreover, the reasoning in McIntyre andits precursors applies directly to anonymity (and pseudonymity)on the Internet.Those who would attempt to ban anonymous e-mail or Usenet articlesoften complain that such messages are of dubious worth withoutauthor attribution. Internet service providers and online servicesremain free to prohibit the sending of anonymous messages,as a number of prominent private universities have attemptedto do. (These efforts have been largely in vain.) The McIntyredecision, however, made it clear that a broad-based legal banon anonymous messages would not be shielded from constitutionalchallenge.Specifically, the majority view assesses the value of a realsignature, as opposed to a pseudonym. "In the case of a handbillwritten by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient,the name and address of the author adds little, if anything,to the reader's ability to evaluate the document's message,"says the Supreme Court. Moreover, as the Court observed ina footnote, readers are not stupid. When they see an anonymousor pseudonymous message, they can and will take its ambiguoussource into account when assessing its verity. This observationis, of course, borne out a hundred times a day on Usenet, whereanonymous articles often meet with a skeptical reception.According to their opponents, anonymous online messages facilitatelibel, fraud, and the sexual abuse of minors. (Indeed, lastyear in an overwrought article attacking the use of anonymousmail servers, the author of The Wall Street Journal's PersonalTechnology column railed against each of these allegedly ubiquitousproblems.) What these critics often omit entirely, or giveshort shrift to, are the positive aspects of anonymous speech.With their identities unknown, political and ethnic minoritiesunder oppressive regimes can speak without fear of reprisal;religious dissidents, whether criticizing a state-sponsoredreligion or a vicious cult bent on harassing apostates, cando likewise; and survivors of rape or sexual abuse can joinin anonymous online discussions.The Supreme Court has recognized these beneficial uses. As thejustices observed in the Talley case, "anonymous pamphlets,leaflets, brochures, and even books have played an importantrole in the progress of mankind It is plain that anonymityhas sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes."Moreover, the Court has adopted this rights-protective stance,despite its recognition that anonymity can shield libel orfraud. In both McIntyre and Talley, the Court freely concededthat such misconduct may be punished appropriately. However,the Court also has ruled that the First Amendment won't allowblanket bans on anonymous speech-bans that would indirectlypunish such libelous or fraudulent offenses.To be sure, anonymous speech may have some limitations placedupon it. The McIntyre decision leaves open the possibilitythat some narrower categories of anonymous speech could bebanned. A second, seemingly contradictory line of Supreme Courtcases upholds the power of the government to require disclosureof the names of contributors to political campaigns. Thesecases make it clear that even in the realm of political speechat the core of First Amendment protections-the Court mightin the future endorse legislation narrowly targeted at anonymousspeech sponsored by campaign organizations.In fact, the California Supreme Court did essentially that inNovember 1994-before the McIntyre decision-when it upheld finesimposed on Daniel Griset, a candidate for the Santa Ana, Calif.,city council, for circulating pseudonymous fliers attackinghis opponent. The state court took pains to point out, however,that its ruling did not address the constitutionality of banninganonymous speech by individual citizens. The fact that theU.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in Griset's casefive days after issuing the McIntyre decision suggests itsapproval of this outcome.Finally, it is useful to note what is not protected by McIntyre.If an anonymous remailer keeps track of its users and theirpseudonyms, nothing would prevent a U.S. court from orderingthat information to be disclosed in a related lawsuit. Nothing,that is, unless the remailer is outside the United States,but even that's no guarantee of safety. Last February, Finnishpolice forced the administrator of the best-known anonymousserver, anon.penet.fi, to reveal the identity of one of hisusers.

Wetested the IBM-compatible model 3C872 with a V.34 fax/modem,which lists for $749. 3Com's digital-only models list for $549each. Regardless of platform, all units incorporate both theNT-1 terminal needed to make an ISDN connection and an analogvoice port for attaching phones, fax machines, and answeringmachines to the ISDN line.No-Sweat SetupThe 3Com Impact is easy to install: You simply attach it toa serial port just like a standard modem. (3Com highly recommendsthat IBM-compatible systems be equipped with a high-speed 16550UART and run DOS 3.1 or later; Macs should use an 8-pin serialport and System 7 or higher.) The straightforward Windows-basedsetup and diagnostic software made short work of configuringthe unit. All procedures are simple and well-documented.Net SpeedUsing the Trumpet Winsock DLL and Netscape Navigator, we connectedto the Internet using both digital (ISDN) and analog (standard)services. The Impact worked smoothly and seamlessly with whicheverconnection we chose, but that's not to say that the resultswere the same: With ISDN operating at full capacity, our connectionspeed was more than four times that of a typical V.34 (28.8Kbps) connection. Here's how it works.Uses Two ChannelsThe Impact lets you use an ISDN line's two 64-Kbps "B" channels("business channels") simultaneously-in a couple of differentways. To achieve maximum Internet throughput, Multilink PPP(a special variant of the serial Point to Point Protocol) caneffectively combine the two into a single connection of 128Kbps capacity.Then again, the built-in analog phone port lets you attach anduse a phone, fax machine, answering machine, or other telephonydevice in tandem with an ISDN connection on the other channel.In fact, a feature called dynamic bandwidth allocation letsyou place an analog phone call even while a Multilink PPP connectionis active.We've waited close to 15 years for ISDN to become a reality.If the 3Com Impact is any indication of what we can look forwardto, the wait will not have been in vain. While this hardwareis far from budget priced, what can we say? It works seamlessly,giving us Internet connections beyond our wildest serial dreams.For more information, visit 3Com's home page at http://www.3com.com.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Inside Track Turns CompuServe Into a Portfolio ManagerBy:Theresa W.

Thus they can connect LANs in physicallyseparate offices or-much more likely in the SOHO context-connecta LAN to the Internet, giving everyone on the LAN a high-speednet connection.ISDN service consists not of a single digital line transferringdata at 128 Kbps, but of two 64-Kbps "B" channels that canbe used individually for data or voice connections. You canplug phones, modems, or fax machines into the Pipeline 25 anduse them for both incoming and outgoing calls-one B channelper call. The Pipeline 25 can even accept incoming calls whenboth B channels are already in use. It simply drops one datachannel, allowing the new call to ring the phone. This givesa single ISDN line the potential to support a small office'sentire voice and data load.Setting up the Pipeline 25 and getting an ISDN account can betedious, but Ascend and ISPs like PSINet (Herndon, Va., 800827-7482) can handle much of this for you.

Then suddenly,horribly, you realize just how long that pile's been stackedup-because nobody has used the term "Web" for years. - Whatwill the Web be like in four years? John Fleming, a medievalistand former chairman of the English Department at PrincetonUniversity, looks back for inspiration in predicting the future."I see it as a dramatic extension of something that's alreadyhappened-the invention of movable type" Fleming says.The invention of movable type changed the world as it was thenknown. It disseminated academic knowledge and transformed apredominantly oral culture-in which scholars memorized entirebooks-into a literate one. The combination of the 15th century'sinvention of the printing press and the 16th century's translationof the Latin bible into vernacular languages led to the ProtestantReformation. Given these examples of the Law of UnintendedConsequences, it's safe to say that as far as the Web is concerned,we still don't know what we have here. And we won't for atleast another generation.A Clear Technical SightIronically, the technological path of the Web is somewhat easierto determine than its cultural impact. Espousing a preferencefor "seamless applications," everyone from Tim Berners-Leeto Microsoft marketers forecast that we'll connect directlyto the net. No longer will we be stuck in the kludgy four-stepprocess of open application on hard drive, log on to ISP, searchthe Web for data to place into an application, manually placedata in application.As Berners-Lee explains, "People will not have to concern themselveswith where things are stored, whether [they're] on a localor remote disk, for example. All one will do is specify thespeed and reliability you need for access to a copy of a document,and the machine will decide, in negotiation with other machines,where to keep copies."The desktop and the Web browser should become one," BernersLee continues. "The folder, hotlist, and hypertext documentobjects will all become objects that you can change, drag thingsinto, publish, and send to people." And, he says, the appearanceof objects on screen "will depend less on what software youhave bought shrink-wrapped and more on where you have beenbrowsing recently. As you browse, your computer will acquirethe software it needs to interact with the information youare using."The important things will be: who has access to an object,how fast, and how reliably," he says. "I might see a news articleand say to the system, 'save that,' meaning 'ensure I haverapid and reliable access to that until I tell you otherwise.'The system will decide how many copies to keep where. We shouldn'tbe aware of file names in five years' time."This also explains why you're reading an article entitled "Web2000." The Internet as we currently know it, divided by applicationsoftware into distinct areas, like IRC and Usenet, will continueto merge through extensions to Web protocols into one seamlessmultimedia something. The closest thing that "something" willbear resemblance to is the Web.Web designer David Siegel, one of whose pages was a runner-upfor Cool Site of the Year, suggests that by 2000, we probablywon't even call it the Web, or even say "I'm going to go onthe Web." Consider the awkward phrases used when PCs were born "I'm going to do my paper on the computer" now sounds as redundantas "I'm going to watch Babylon 5 on television."The Web already has split into professional and amateur sites,a gap that is likely to widen as HTML becomes increasinglycomplicated and programmer-only tools-like Sun Microsystems'Java-come online. Adobe's Acrobat and Netscape's tables haveonly just begun to make the Web an attractive environment fortop graphic designers. As more artists design for the Web,the visual sophistication of professional Web sites will increase.As a result, amateur sites may start to look more and more"homemade" by comparison.OK, so maybe we can't make any grand proclamations about theWeb's impact on world culture until the 2030s. But until then,there's a great deal of history to be made. Here, in the fieldsof education, media, politics, and law and commerce, we depictsome of the changes instant worldwide distribution can bringabout.Law and CommerceThe cobwebs are taking longer to leave your brain, as they haveever since 1998, when caffeine became a controlled substance.Desperate for a hit of Jolt, now only available by prescription,you sit down at the keyboard of your NetBox and say "Tijuana,"since you're in no shape for typing. Once inside the virtualMexican pharmacy, you see that they moved the Jolt. "Bringme to Jolt," you mutter. A quick digital cash-card swipe throughthe keyboard's built-in slot, and in a few hours, UPS makesa no-questions-asked, same-day delivery.Law and commerce have frequently met in many a cultural analysis,but they are practically inextricable on the net. We've chosento combine these topics because so many of those we intervieweddid. There's a growing feeling that Internet commerce willthrive-that is, if it isn't regulated out of existence.The good news is that an estimated $7.2 billion online marketplacewill exist by 2000, according to Jupiter Communications' 1996"Home Shopping Report." ($4.5 billion Web-based, $2.7 proprietaryonline services.) But right now, some very ominous threatshail from Washington. Says Mike Godwin of the Electronic FrontierFoundation: [They] "are afraid of this new medium. The federalgovernment is afraid of digital cash, since the FBI has increasinglyrelied on traceable transactions. Anti-pornographers like [Edwin]Meese want to make distributors of online information liablefor that information."Thus, ISPs can be held liable in their legal role as publishers.For example, The WELL would be at risk simply for admonishingpeople not to discuss Pentiums on a Macintosh forum. "Do wewant laws that force services into one or the other?" Godwinasks. One solution is to try to define ISPs and proprietaryproviders as "distributors," like bookstores and libraries."If NetGuide publishes libel, you can't sue Barnes & Noble,"Godwin says. "Yet a mystery bookstore can make the editorialdecision not to sell science fiction."The greatest unresolved online issue linking law and commerceis copyright. The National Writers Union and the Writers Guildof America are concerned about what ease of distribution (asin information for sale online) will do to copyright law. However,Lance Rose, an attorney who specializes in online law, won'tbe a digital vendor for now: "I don't have my book up there,"he says. Among the growing number of proposed answers to theproblem are digital payments, a proposal that makes the electroniccommerce crowd very happy. In fact, one writer has signed upwith NetCheque, one such digital payment system.At IBM's infoMarket Internet division, Jeff Crigler, vice presidentand managing director, describes the service's own solutionto the copyrights-in-commerce issue. "We were focused on thewrong problem. It wasn't copying. It was payment assurance."To remedy the problem, IBM has created what it calls "cryptolopes,"encrypted capsules of information which require a recipientto pay for data electronically before accessing it. This ensuresthat the copyright holder keeps receiving payment whenevermaterial is re-distributed. A cryptolope functions as sortof digital shrink-wrap-your browser can decrypt it, but everytime you send it on, "the price tag stays on it" and it mustbe decrypted again-and paid for-by whomever you send it to.Nevertheless Crigler admits, cryptolopes can make bootlegging"very hard, but [not] impossible." He can easily see SoutheastAsian bootleggers distributing CD-ROMs of downloaded musicand videos. To help law enforcement, IBM also is working ona digital watermark that will encode the address of the originalrecipient into the material.PoliticsThe NetBox has its advantages-it's always on, just like telephonesused to be, and the little dumb terminal was cheap. OK, itwas 500 bucks, but that's still less than the money you spenton an ISDN card alone back in the '90s. Staring at the flatpanel screen, you marvel that anonymous electronic paymenthas survived this long. Your thoughts are interrupted by aMary Hart-like blonde. "Remember to disable auto-avatars,"you think, as she chirps on about your party's new campaign.Funny, she looks an awful lot like the blonde the presidentdenied having sex with in that now-famous videoconference.Call the White House press office to get a quote on the futureof the Web in politics and guess what? They'll tell you tofax that request. Such moped-like activity from the folks whostuck us with the term "information superhighway" notwithstanding,Steven Singer of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Governmentis optimistic. He suggests we will see candidates reachingmuch more directly to the electorate in 2000 by campaigningto online communities, in much the same way they discoveredtalk shows in the 1992 elections. Candidates might even circumventtelevision's sound bites: Imagine a candidate saying, "No NewTaxes-See www.me.org!"But if there is a greater opportunity for unfiltered communication,the downside for candidates, says David King, also of the KennedySchool, is that candidates lose wiggle room for issues thatweren't anticipated during the campaign. "If you can go andfind online transcripts, there's a direct comparison that tendsto become binding," King says. A further downside for the candidatesis that political reporters can go straight to the people,too. Now, instead of printing just one or two damaging quotes,entire documents can be placed in front of the world. Awardwinning investigative reporter Steve Pizzo is already doingjust that over at Web Review (http://gnn.com/wr/)Meanwhile, over at the Democratic National Committee, one verywired Democrat has some thoughts on how to use the Web fororganizing. Dick Bell, the committee's interactive media specialist,started out in the trenches-literally (he used to dig the holesfor candidates' lawn signs). Granted, nobody wants junk e-mailcoming from candidates, but he suggests that you can run listservsfrom candidates' Web sites-it would be voluntary and non-intrusive."You can think of things for people to do sitting where theyare. If people don't have to drive to meetings, you can broadenthe base of who gets involved. If you go to a campaign officenow, you'll only see students and senior citizens. We couldfinally include more working parents," Bell says.The availability of Java and VRML likely will mean many simulationscould be run either by campaigns or online newspapers. Shouldyou vote for that new bond issue to expand the freeways? TheLos Angeles Times Web site could let you experience "before"and "after" traffic congestion. Meanwhile, the downside ofsuch multimedia tools is obvious: It becomes even easier tofudge data in a simulation.Although it is unlikely to happen by 2000, one of the currentblue-sky dreams is electronic democracy. The biggest stumblingblock is that it would be too easy-for some of the population.The concern is that election results could be skewed by thosewho had to do nothing more in the middle of a freak early Novemberblizzard than sit down at their keyboards. Yet, we may stillsee an even more divided electorate, split between those whoget their information from TV sound bites, and those who willbe able to read everything available about the issues on theWeb.EducationHappy day! UPS just showed up. Ahhh, warm Jolt and cold pizza,a nice traditional breakfast to start the new millennium. NetBox,ShmetBox-that first hit has you pumped for some serious hardware.Like that Intel P9 box you gave yourself for Christmas that'sgot more power than a Cray, and weighs less than those clunkyold laptops. Synched to your 3-D video projectors, it's perfectfor entering the University Bio Lab and finishing your projecttelerobotically-or knocking off a round of Doom 2000.Secondary schools in Watchung, N.J., have wired all their classrooms,teachers receive all their daily memos by e-mail, and parentsare clamoring to have all those permission slips and PTA noticese-mailed home. Students in Princeton, N.J., are required tocomplete a multimedia project in order to graduate-from sixthgrade. But Watchung and Princeton residents have some of thehighest per capita incomes in the country. In a country thatstill bases most public school funding on property taxes, poorcommunities will continue to lag behind. Even middle-classcommunities feel it: Green Brook, N.J., which borders Watchung,considered wiring its school system, until somebody actuallymultiplied the cost of putting only one $2,000 PC in each classroomin the district.At a public meeting of the Advisory Council on the NationalInformation Infrastructure, the biggest question from the audiencewasn't access to the Internet-it was access to computers. Period.Now, Compaq recently announced it will create a $500 box withnet access. Perhaps by 2000, it will actually exist. But evenat that price, it will be beyond the reach of many families.Perhaps they will be able to rent dumb terminals connectedto servers as we once rented telephones, and be charged fordownloaded applications on a per-minute basis. Perhaps.The situation is further complicated by infrastructure. Theonly wiring in most American classrooms exists to turn on thelight switch. Yet there is optimism on the horizon. In October,President Clinton called for "a high-tech barn raising" witha four-point set of goals: Modern computers will be accessible to every student. Classrooms will be connected to one another and to the outsideworld. Teachers will be ready to use and teach technology. Educational software will be an integral part of the curriculum.Not surprisingly, it is expected that most of these goals willbe met with private-sector help. The president cited the stateof California, where by the end of the school year, all K-12schools will have access to the Internet. He was referringto Pacific Bell's Education First initiative.Most encouraging of all is the creation of Tech Corps, a PeaceCorps for the '90s, according to its founder, Gary J. Beach.Tech Corps seeks to enlist technical professionals as volunteersto wire America's classrooms to further the spread of computerliteracy. Information about Tech Corps can be found on itsWeb site (http://www.ustc.org)MediaThe caffeine has hit optimum cruising speed through your veins,and you really should be working.

Oh, no! Now some nerd'sinsisting on speaking Klingonese to her. Sigh. Some thingsnever change.Dr. Clifford Neuman, an expert in authentication and creatorof the NetCheque system of digital payment, sits in his officeat the University of Southern California's Information SciencesInstitute. He views The Spot (http://www.thespot.com), an onlinenarrative site often likened to an Aaron Spelling TV show,for the first time, and comments, "The Web phenomenon is verymuch not the technologist's phenomenon but what the artistsdid with the phenomenon. If I were asked 10 years ago, couldyou use TCP/IP to send images like this, certainly the answerwas clearly yes. But if I'd been asked, 'Is this what we shouldbe doing with it?" he laughs. "I wouldn't have anticipatedthis!"Neither did Hollywood. Berners-Lee sums up the media's myopiaAfter the phrase "Interactive Television" in a correspondent's .sig file, he types, "an oxymoron surely. :-)" Hollywood producersare now trying to make up for lost time, and by the time youread this, any number of sites will have been approached anddeals made-or more likely, fallen through."I don't see the level of vision and commitment. I think a numberof them still feel it's going to be cable," says Guy Morrisof Cracks in the Web (http://www.cybertown.com/cybertown/cracks.html),referring to Hollywood's persistent belief that a TV with aset-top box will be the device of the future. "But they feelthat they should be doing something. The market is going toget ahead of them, but they can always jump in once the marketis mature."For Web creators, and for traditional Hollywood types, ambitionslie in two directions. A Web site can be a relatively low-costway to try out new ideas for an episodic television series.Previously, there was no other way to do that than to spendmillions to put a show on the air, and to hope for the best.Now a cast and plotlines can be road-tested before a networkmakes a major investment. Without revealing details, ScottZakarin, one of the creators of The Spot, confesses, "We seedoing this type of thing as lab work. [Hollywood] productioncompanies are talking to us about it all over the place."Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Push The E-mail Envelop--It's the single most popular serviceon the net-the universal application. But are you getting allyou should out of Internet e-mail?By:KEVIN REICHARDHow quickly we forget. Most Internet users-especially thoseof us who have logged a zillion hours on the net-simply takee-mail for granted. We've lost that sense of wonder and excitementat the magic of messages that circle the globe in seconds.It's a shame, since e-mail is the universal Internet servicethe one that provided the initial impetus for the net's creationand is still the most popular single online activity.But the real bottom line is that many of us don't take fulladvantage of the capabilities of Internet e-mail. We thinkwe're cool when we quote an original message in a reply orattach a file to a message from time to time. But there's muchmore to today's Internet e-mail. It's not a static technology;it's evolving all the time. And you can find plenty of affordablee-mail client software packages out there that can widen youre-mail horizons-particularly the ones highlighted in this feature.Great ExpectationsWhat should you expect from an up-to-date e-mail package? Forstarters, a well-organized user interface that doesn't requirea lot of time and effort to master. But that's just the beginning,the sine qua non. Here's a list of important features thatgood e-mail software provides:Signatures: Signatures let you automatically affix a file ortext tag to every outgoing message. Multiple signatures arenice because they allow you to attach one signature, say, toyour work messages and another to your "play" messages. Andthere's no rule that says signatures have to be text-Emissary,for example, lets you attach a GIF or JPEG file as your signature.(If you think those florid 30-line signatures are bad, waituntil everyone starts attaching their photos to their outgoingmail. Oooh, that shrinking bandwidth!)Address books: Address books should allow you to store bothindividual Internet users and groups or "mailing lists." Areally good Internet mail package will automatically add addressesfrom incoming mail to your address book.Attachments: Attachments-at least Internet mail attachmentsactually are formatted to be part of the mail message, thoughthey appear separate to the end user. The most popular attachmentformat is MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). A mailpackage that supports MIME translates a binary file into text,putting markers at the beginning and the end of the text. Thebeginning marker contains the name of the file and the specifictype of attachment (there are MIME types for audio, binaryprogram files, text, and more). When a mail package receivesa message with a MIME-formatted attachment, it translates thetext back into a binary file, stores it with the file namespecified in the marker (usually while giving you the chanceto specify a new file name), and displays the name of the fileas well as its size and an icon representing its originatingapplication.Two other attachment formats are in common use, both similarto MIME. BinHex is popular in the Macintosh world, but notwell-supported in the Windows and Unix worlds. Most of themail packages we review also support uuencode/uudecode, anolder format still widely used in the Unix world.Inbox/outbox: Inboxes and outboxes are de rigueur for e-mail,of course. But a single inbox for storing accumulated messagesjust doesn't cut it today. You should be able to easily createmultiple mailboxes or folders, the metaphor used by most packages.This lets you keep all work-related messages in one box, forexample, and all personal messages in another. A really upto-date package like Quarterdeck Messaging Center allows folderswithin folders, so you can store messages in a hierarchicalfashion.Filtering/routing: Filtering or routing lets you set up rulesfor dealing automatically with incoming messages. These rulestypically key off of the subject line or some part of the address(To:, From:, Cc:), sometimes even the message text. The rangeof actions that can be carried out depends on the individualpackage, though most packages with this feature at least letyou route incoming mail to a specified folder based on messagecontents. For example, all mail from your boss could be routedto your ReadFirst folder. Some of the packages add to thiscapability. Eudora Pro, for instance, lets you change or createa new subject line to both incoming and outgoing mail automatically,or send a stock reply ("I'm on vacation," for example) to everyincoming message.Universal mailbox: Universal mailboxes let you retrieve mailin one place from several different sources besides the Internet.We review two such products: E-Mail Connection (for Windows)and Claris E-Mailer (for Macintosh)What We ReviewedIn this roundup, we didn't attempt to look at every availableInternet e-mail package. Rather, we chose products that areboth affordable and worth your serious consideration. Thismeans software priced at less than $100 that provides a reasonablycomplete selection of up-to-date e-mail capabilities, bothbasic and advanced. (There are some first-rate corporate-styleTCP/IP mail packages-Z-Mail, for example-that sell for upwardsof $300 a pop.) Our list includes both Macintosh and Windowsapplications, and one that runs under DOS as well. (The Windowsapps all run under Windows 3.1 and Win95.)To use any of these packages, you'll need a direct connectionto the Internet, either through a dial-up SLIP or PPP account(using accompanying software, such as Trumpet Winsock or MacTCP)or a direct network connection. Some of these packages, suchas Emissary or Quarterdeck InternetSuite, contain the softwareneeded to make this connection, but most don't.You'll also need an account on an Internet mail server thatruns either POP3 or IMAP. (The server is where your incomingmail is stored.) IMAP is the newer of the two protocols andoffers some advanced features (both for users and system administrators)that POP3 and the older POP2 do not. (For example, with anIMAP server, you can choose to leave mail on the server ordownload it to your local system, whereas with POP servers,all mail is downloaded automatically when you log on.) Noneof the packages we review is written specifically to take advantageof the IMAP protocol, though all work just fine with IMAP servers,since there's backward compatibility between IMAP and POP3.Your service provider or system administrator may provide youwith two e-mail addresses: a POP3 or IMAP server for incomingmail, and an SMTP server for outgoing mail. Very often, though,these two addresses will be the same.And speaking of service providers, some of the publishers ofpackages we review here, most notably Quarterdeck Corp., havearrangements with service providers that simplify or eliminatemany of the configuration problems encountered in connectingdirectly to the Internet.So, peruse the reviews that follow, and see our sidebars onfree e-mail ["Internet Free-Mail," page 74] and mail serviceprovided by commercial online services ["The Online ServiceConnection," page 66], and set yourself up to get the mostout of this wonderful resource-one of the 20th century's greatcontributions to communication. Oh, and don't forget to dropus an e-mail (netmail@netguide.cmp.com). It is, after all,ridiculously easy and inexpensive.Claris E-MailerClaris E-Mailer 1.0.2 is a universal e-mail inbox, for the Macintoshonly, with links to the Internet, America Online, CompuServe,eWorld, and RadioMail. Claris E-Mailer works from a dial-upInternet connection (in this case, using MacTCP) to check formessages.Perhaps the most compelling reason to look at Claris E-Maileris its simplicity. You won't drown in a sea of confusing configurationoptions when dealing with E-Mailer, and you'll appreciate thetidy interface. All of E-Mailer's elements (inbox, outbox,filing cabinet, address book) are organized by tabs in a singlebrowser-style interface. Moving between elements is simplya matter of clicking the tabs.Once you've mastered the interface, you've pretty much masteredE-Mailer. To sort your messages, you click a column; the sortingis keyed to the entries in that column. Click the Date column,for instance, and the entries will appear in the order theywere received. You can sort in ascending or descending order.The address book is similarly easy to use. You can set up bothindividual and group addresses. Addresses are presented ina single list, regardless of source (Internet, AOL, etc.).If your address list is long, you can use the Filter featureto locate an address by typing in the first few letters ofa name. Once you've located the desired address, you can eithercreate a pre-addressed message or drag and drop the addressinto the message space.E-Mailer also can be set up to process incoming mail automaticallybased on the contents of the message. For instance, E-Mailerautomatically could forward all messages from a particularcorrespondent to your assistant. While you're on vacation,E-Mailer can send an "I'm on vacation" response to all incomingmessages.And, of course, there are the things that Internet mail junkieswould expect, such as MIME attachments, quoted replies, andautomatic signatures.For Mac-based net surfers who want an easy-to-use Internet mailpackage, E-Mailer is a good choice-you'll be up and runningin no time, and with the program's powerful routing feature,you can make sure your mail always gets delivered to the rightplace.Claris Corp.; Claris E-Mailer 1.0.2 (requires 68020-based Macintoshor better, System 7.0 or better, 1.5 MB of RAM); $80; 800-5448554, ext. 311; 408-987-4000; http://www.claris.com/E-Mail Connection 3.0Once you become more than a dabbler in the online world, youquickly tire of switching between software packages to retrieveyour mail from the several services you inevitably find yourselfusing. You writhe in despair at tracking down messages savedamong different mail packages.That's why ConnectSoft's E-Mail Connection 3.0-the originaluniversal mail package-is such a powerful tool for busy Windowsbased e-mail users. In addition to handling Internet mail,it lets you send and receive mail via such services as CompuServe,MCI Mail, America Online, and Prodigy, and/or over a localarea network using any of the popular transport protocols.You even can use E-Mail Connection to handle your faxes.This not only makes e-mail easy to get at, it makes mail usagetransparent to end users; you don't need to think about whichmail system you're interacting with. When E-Mail Connectionlogs on to the Internet and downloads your Internet e-mail,it's automatically sent to your inbox along with all otherincoming mail. (This is mostly a blessing, but also a minorcurse: It would be great to be able to set up multiple inboxesand route mail to them depending on who sent it or where itcame from.) The same holds for replies: The sender's electronicaddress is logged in E-Mail Connection's address book automatically,and your reply just goes there.E-Mail Connection compares favorably with any of the dedicatedpackages reviewed here. It handles all the basic functions,such as managing MIME file attachments, with aplomb. (For example,a received message clearly shows all attachments by file name,file size, and originating application.) And if you're workingwith a lot of mail, you'll appreciate the advanced search capabilities.You can search through a specific folder or all folders, seekmessages from a specific source or all e-mail sources, andlook for specific text strings in the text or the Subject field.Finally, it's one of the few packages to offer sophisticatedmessage security-in this case, RSA encryption.As for price, E-Mail Connection just makes our cutoff for affordableInternet e-mail. But if you work a lot with e-mail from multiplesources, you'll find that it's worth every penny. (Alternatively,you can grab the free Version 2.5.03 of E-Mail Connection,scaled down for Internet-only usage, from ConnectSoft's Website.)ConnectSoft; E-Mail Connection 3.0 (requires Windows 3.1 orbetter); $99.95; 800-234-9497; fax: 206-822-9095; http://www.connectsoft.comEmissaryEmissary 1.00 from The Wollongong Group Inc. is like a VolkswagenBeetle that's been outfitted with the cockpit of a Boeing 747 There's a lot of control provided for what is essentiallya simple task, but it's the perfect setup for those who areinto precision flying.The design philosophy behind Emissary is clear-that the distinctionsamong the Web, mail, and news are mostly artificial, and thatmost users would benefit from software that combines thesefunctions into a unified interface. By and large, this approachsucceeds, but it makes for a rather busy interface-hence theBeetle/747 comparison.To begin with, the modest downside of this design philosophy First, you have to wade through a lot of interface to getat your mail, and second, if you're already committed to anotherWeb browser or newsreader, it simply may not be worth the effortto bring Emissary onstage just for e-mail.If the interface doesn't turn you off, though, there's a lotto like about Emissary's holistic approach to the Internet.All the basics are here, some executed with flair. For example,there's a well-designed address book, complete with alias andmailing list capabilities. If you have a lot of messages, Emissarylets you search through them efficiently.Other, more advanced tools can make your life even easier. Theseinclude the automatic message filter, which can route messagesfrom a particular sender or with a specified subject to thefolder of your choice. You also can exercise extensive controlover how Emissary interacts with your mail server, even tothe point of specifying the lengths of timeouts if the serverfails to respond to various portions of a communications session.There's even a diagnostic function that lists the version numbersof your various Emissary resource files (or DLLs), a featurethat will be handier in the future as more advanced versionsof Emissary are made available.Emissary is one of those e-mail software packages that's inyour face, challenging you to get the most out of it. And eventhough you might be confused, even annoyed, by the interfacewhen you first encounter it, you'll find it's well worth mastering.The Wollongong Group Inc.; Emissary 1.00 (requires Windows 3.1or better, 386-based PC or better, 4 MB of RAM); $99; 800-8728649; fax: 415-962 0286; http://www.twg.comEudoraAvailable in both Windows and Macintosh versions, Qualcomm Inc.'sEudora is probably the single most popular Internet e-mailpackage among PC users.A note here about Eudora's several versions: Eudora Pro is thecommercial software; Eudora Light is freely distributed byQualcomm Inc. at ftp.qualcomm.com and is also bundled by NetscapeCommunications in its Netscape Navigator Personal Edition.Eudora Light lacks a number of important features-such as spellchecking-that are found in Eudora Pro. Incidentally, the Macintoshand Windows versions of Eudora are identical in both the Lightand Pro versions.A quick tour of Eudora Pro shows why it's so popular: Installationis a breeze. All you need to do is enter your server addressesand your own user information. To create mail, you select NewMessage and enter the appropriate addressing information (recipient,any carbon copies, subject). If you want, you can specify afile to be attached, and you have your choice of MIME, BinHex(popular in the Macintosh world) or uuencode (popular in theUnix world) formats. You also have a choice of signatures,as Eudora supports both main and alternative signature files.When you're done writing your mail, Eudora Pro brings up itsspelling checker and the completed message is then shippedautomatically to a mail server. Eudora will check your mailserver at regular intervals if you like, but you also can electto check on the spur of the moment. In addition, you can setup Eudora Pro to route mail to specific folders, so that youcan, for instance, send all messages from your significantother to your personal folder.So what would make Eudora Pro perfect? For starters, a bettersearch mechanism, as Eudora Pro allows only for simple textsearches, and does not provide wildcards or allow you to winnowdown search criteria (such as searching only through the inbox)If and when Qualcomm makes this improvement, it will be welcome.Meanwhile, Eudora Pro is about as good as it gets in the Internete-mail world, in both its commercial and freeware incarnationsso good that you probably won't even mind the less-than-stellarsearch tools.Qualcomm Inc.; Eudora Pro 2.1.2 (requires Windows 3.1 or better,Mac Plus or better, System 7 or better); $80; 619-587-1121;fax: 619-452-9096; http://www.qualcomm.com/NetShark 1.0.4Integrating a Web browser with a mail module makes perfect sense,as these are the two most heavily used Internet services. That'sthe philosophy behind InterCon Systems Corp.'s NetShark 1.0.4,available by download in both Windows 3.1 and Macintosh versionswhich, though not identical in organization and interface details,do offer similar features. (Be warned that this product isupdated frequently. Even as NetGuide went to press, new versionswere being posted on InterCon's Web site.)NetShark's mail/browser integration is complete on the Mac:To access the mail functions, you simply choose Mailbox whilein the Web browser, whereupon you can send and receive mail.Under Windows, however, NetShark Mail and WebShark (the Webbrowser) are separate, but linked, applications.In either case, once you get to the mail package, you'll findthat NetShark Mail is a pretty complete offering. The importantInternet mail tools, like signature files and MIME attachments,are all supported. You can sort your messages by a number ofcriteria, such as date, order received, status, and subject.And the package has some fairly advanced search tools. Forinstance, you can search for all messages that either do ordon't contain a specific text string, and you can use the *and ? wildcards to expand your search.NetShark also provides a sophisticated set of automated processingactions that can be applied to mail. For instance, you canuse wildcards (*) or other expressions to expand or narrowa criterion that triggers an action. These actions can involveautomatically filing messages to specific folders, deletingmessages, or marking them as read. About the only functionit can't perform is respond automatically to every incomingmessage when you're away or on vacation (a feature that ClarisE-Mailer offers)For Mac users, NetShark is a powerful, easy-to-use mail packagethat easily rivals anything else on the market. For Windowsusers, the integration of mail and Web browser is a hard oneto pass up-considering the many amenities NetShark Mail offers.InterCon Systems Corp., NetShark 1.0.4; $39 (registration fee);800-INTRCON; http://netshark.inter.net/Pegasus MailOne of the neatest things about the Internet is seeing the contributionsthat individuals have made to the community at large. A goodexample is David Harris' creation, Pegasus Mail 2.10, whichcomes in Windows, Macintosh, and DOS versions. Not only isP-Mail a first-rate product, it's free, and Harris keeps itup to date by regularly releasing new and more powerful versions.You have to order the manual (for a reasonable cost), and technicalsupport is offered via e-mail.Free products are inherently attractive, but P-Mail's popularityultimately rests on the fact that it's a pretty darn good pieceof software. Designed to run in both the Internet and NovellNetWare environments, P-Mail has lots of power when it comesto configuration and usage, offering features like mail filtering(you can route all messages from Bill Clinton to a folder calledPresident, for instance), advanced configuration options (likenot automatically downloading mail that exceeds a certain size),and more standard features such as signature files, spellingchecker, and quoted replies. You can choose your favorite methodof encoding outgoing attachments; MIME, uuencode, and BinHexare all supported. It even lets you encrypt mail for bettersecurity-still an unusual capability.P-Mail also has a unique feature called noticeboard, which isakin to a low-rent Lotus Notes-type bulletin board on a localarea network. With noticeboard, users can add comments to athreaded conversation, and discussions can be nested withinother conversations. Noticeboard discussions are organizedin the same manner as mail folders, so users can switch betweenthem easily.Unfortunately, P-Mail's power is hidden behind some very unhelpfulicons and a sometimes-confusing organization. Also, you'llwant to know at least a little about how networking and Internetmail work before you tackle a P-Mail configuration. Still,with a willing spirit (and some help from the adequate documentation),you'll find that P-Mail is a surprisingly satisfying pieceof software.Pegasus Mail 2.10; freeware; http://www.cuslm.ca/pegasus/QuarterdeckYou can get lost in the Quarterdeck Message Center (which shipsas part of Quarterdeck InternetSuite 1.0), but in a good way.Quarterdeck Corp.'s QMC offers a wealth of configuration optionsbeyond the basic mail tools we expect to see in an up-to-datepackage.A tour of the Preferences dialog box shows why: Don't like howQMC is displaying the messages in your inbox? You can chooseto sort by sender, date, size, or subject. Want to poll fornew mail every minute? You can change the default setting (10minutes) to suit your needs. Want to be notified with a beepwhen mail arrives? You can add a beep. Want to set the timeoutson your mail-server communications to make sure you're notwaiting too long for a balky server? You can tweak the default(normally 60 seconds) to fit your technology. Want to hangonto your trashed messages for a week or so? You can specifythe number of days mail is allowed to sit in your trash folderbefore it's purged.If some of these settings seem nit-picky, remember that forexperienced e-mail users, those minor details can make a majordifference. About the only important detail missing from QMCis a way to search through message text for a specific string(which is almost mandatory for those who work with lots ofmessages). There's even a utility for working with TAR (TapeARchive) files, a Unix archiving format common on the Internet.Of course, you don't need to be detail-oriented to get the benefitsof QMC; if you're just looking for an inexpensive, easy-touse mail package, QMC can give you what you need right outof the box.

You also canchange the location of your mail inbox, which can be convenientwhen using I-Box over a network.The absence of certain features, however, makes SPRY Mail aquestionable choice for business-oriented use. For example,there's no mechanism for searching through your messages. There'sone weakness from the personal user's point of view as well You have to work online. People with networked connectionsprobably don't care whether they're connected while they compose,read, and reply to mail, but private users who are paying aservice provider would rather do these things offline.Still, for right-out-of-the-box performance, SPRY Mail has fewequals.

Realistically,any of the reviewed packages here should serve most of yourneeds; we picked them that way. But these are our choices:Cross-platform: Eudora Pro for the Mac and PC. If yours is amixed shop, large or small, you really can't go wrong withEudora Pro: Its interface is the best of the packages reviewed,but it doesn't sacrifice any power.Macintosh: Claris E-Mailer. While there are a few things we'dlike to see added to Claris E-Mailer-most notably a way tosearch through the contents of your inbox-it's nonethelessa solid choice for Macintosh users.Windows: E-Mail Connection. This is the strongest package wereviewed, both in terms of ease of use and flexibility. It'snow a truly universal inbox, encompassing both e-mail and faxcommunications.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. The Online Service ConnectionBy:Kevin ReichardWide-area e-mail has been available for many years to subscribersof dial-up online services-most notably CompuServe. Despitethe easy availability of affordable Internet connections today,online services still handle a lot of e-mail-including Internete-mail. How good a job do these services do with Internet email? What are the trade-offs?You can send e-mail across the Internet from any of these onlineservices, and receive it, too. Furthermore, these serviceshave recently cleaned up their addressing schemes (a significantbugaboo in the past), allowing you to use a "real" name foryour Internet address (like Kreichard@prodigy.com) as opposedto vendor-assigned service IDs (like 73670,3422 on CompuServe). On the other hand, of this group, onlyAmerica Online can match the varied features found in fullfledged Internet mail service provided by the packages reviewedhere. Here are capsule summaries of the capabilities of theBig Five: America Online is the most evolved when it comes to Internete-mail, by virtue of its support for MIME attachments-thoughit can handle only one attachment per message. In addition,AOL effectively integrates Internet addresses into its addressbook, treating them just like standard AOL addresses. Thus,you can create mailing lists in AOL that let you send hundredsof messages to the Internet. CompuServe supports only straight text in Internet e-mail messages.It doesn't support file attachments at all, but you can sendindividual binary files across CompuServe's Internet gatewayas separate messages. CompuServe subscribers use a number ofdifferent front ends (WinCIM, MacCIM, and Golden ComPass),so there's no standard handling of address-book matters. MCI Mail supports MIME-formatted text attachments to messages,but chokes on other MIME formats, such as image or audio files.However, MCI Mail automatically uuencodes and uudecodes fileattachments sent via the Internet. Depending on the front endyou're using (like CompuServe, the service is text-based atits core), you can create mailing lists that incorporate Internetaddresses along with other addresses. Microsoft Network uses the Exchange client provided in Windows95 to send and receive Internet mail, but doesn't fully takeadvantage of it: Exchange supports MIME attachments when usedwith an Internet mail server, but the Microsoft Network itselfdoesn't support MIME. However, it's very convenient to haveall your e-mail centered in one client, which is the biggestadvantage of MSN and Exchange. Prodigy features the best message-creation tools among theonline services-its address book doesn't differentiate betweenInternet and Prodigy users, and there's even a spelling checker.However, Prodigy doesn't yet support MIME attachments, whichmeans you're limited to text-only messages.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Internet Free-MailBy:Kevin ReichardAll e-mail packages reviewed in this feature require you tohave a direct connection to the Internet, and millions of youare paying service providers for such connections, anywherefrom $5 to $50 a month. But this is America and entrepreneursare vying for your business (so to speak) by offering you Internetmail service completely free of charge.The catch? Advertising.At press time, two companies-FreeMark Communications, in Cambridge,Mass. (http://www .freemark.com/), and Juno Online Services,in New York City (http://www.juno.com/)-are busy launchingfree Internet e-mail services. By the time you read this, bothexpect their services to be up and running. We checked outthe interactive demos at each vendor's Web site and lookedat the beta versions of their client software.On the face of it, these companies really do appear to be offeringfree e-mail: There are no limitations on the number of messagesyou can send or receive; there are no long-distance phone chargesfor accessing your mail; and there are no online charges. Indeed,even the access software is free.In both cases, however, your every e-mail-related move willbe accompanied by some form of advertising. With FreeMark,each message you send will be "sponsored" by an advertiser,and the advertiser's logo will be present as you retrieve,read, and write messages. At the bottom of both outgoing andincoming messages, you'll find links to offers from advertisers,online coupons, or some other promotional messages.Advertising will be the prime source of Juno's revenue as well,though the company promises to supplement this with some onlinemarketing research, tooYour Money's WorthTechnically speaking, neither system is true Internet mail.You're not directly accessing the Internet; instead, you dialinto the FreeMark or Juno computer to upload or download mailnot unlike the MCI Mail system.Further, you're limited by the capabilities of the proprietarysoftware supplied by the service providers. FreeMark isn'tplanning to support file attachments, and if the online demosare an accurate indication, neither company will support quotedreplies or signatures. The only concession to standard Internetmail conventions will be an address book.Finally, both services are limiting their offerings to the Windowsworld, though Juno says it may develop a Mac version if there'senough interest.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Pre-Fab Home Pages--The major online services want to give youa space on the Web-no programming requiredBy:Joel T. PatzEarly in the Internet game, getting a Web page up and runningwas technically complex. You had to delve into HTML code justto create a sentence someone could read online. Learning theprotocols for Web page layout was confusing. And how on earthwere you going to be sure that links would really take surferswhere they were supposed to go? Without a lot of dedicatedequipment-and "extra" time that few of us have-personal Webpages were little more than a fantasy.Well, times change and fantasies become realities. The threemajor online services-America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigyhave paved the way, not just to creating Web pages, but toputting them on the Web without setting up your own serveror signing on with an Internet service provider. HTML knowledgehas been replaced by filling in the blanks, some basic wordprocessing skills, and simple point-and-click operations.Prodigyscratchpad 1.0, the tool Prodigy provides for building personalWeb pages, is available to any service member using the onliner'sbrowser and following the directions on its Web home page.Getting started couldn't be easier. Simply enter your name,a user ID (which becomes part of your personal URL), a password,your location, and your Prodigy ID-and you're off and runningwith your first Web page. You begin by giving it a title and,as suggested in a text box that automatically appears on yourscreen, supplying details you want people to know.Suppose, for example, you're a cook and want to develop an onlinerecipe file. Here's your chance to share your favorite dishesand discuss results and refinements with others. Include acouple of your favorite food-related URLs to add interest foryour readers and click Submit. You've done it.You can create up to seven separate Web pages on Prodigy and,if you want, develop an index that links the items in them.There's a template that lets you effortlessly share your 10favorite Web sites, and another where you can profile the bestclubs, restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, museums, etc.,in your town. Still another template lets you share detailsabout your business. If you're curious about how many visitsyour site gets, you can add a counter to any page. (The helpfile will tell you how.) It's updated automatically.Prodigy provides an Image Library-containing animals, flags,and signs of the zodiac, to name a few-so your page can includegraphics from the get go. A variety of symbols is availableto call attention to hypertext links, such as a MailTo symbolfor e-mail; sound and movie symbols to identify links to audioand MPEG video clips at other sites; and even symbols to indicatethe size of an image or file to be downloaded.And while the current version of Scratchpad doesn't let youinclude video or sound clips in your pages, you can includeJPEG, GIF and virtually any type of bitmap image files.With Scratchpad, you don't have to worry about the mysteriesof special syntax and layout provisions. The templates do awaywith all major design chores. To establish a link to anotherdocument, just fill in the URL field. Headlines, section headings,and body text are formatted automatically. If you include youre-mail address, Scratchpad will tag it so visitors can sendyou mail simply by clicking.That Special TouchCopying your documents to a floppy disk (which can be done usingthe Prodigy browser's Save button) lets you see the HTML tagsadded to your document. You'll find this interesting and instructive.Those who know some HTML and want to refine documents by addingtheir own special touches can use the Freeform template topaste in any material created with an HTML editor.Some size restrictions apply to Prodigy-based personal pages Text boxes (individual blocks of text) are limited to about4,600 bytes each, and a page can't contain more than 20 KB.Each Prodigy member is allocated 1 MB of free server spaceand can get up to 10 MB for an as-yet undetermined nominalcharge.You must be logged on to the Prodigy service to build your Webpage, and the regular charges against your monthly membershipapply. If you exceed your allowable hours, the extra time isbilled to your account. In contrast, CompuServe and AOL letyou work offline to save money.COMPUSERVEthe beta version of CompuServe's Home Page Wizard, which wetested shortly before its release, does a first-rate job ofhelping you create sophisticated-looking Web pages.A series of dialog boxes gets you started. Give your page atitle, then fill in personal information, such as name, cityof residence, occupation, and hobbies. This data, which canbe displayed, if you choose, at the top of your home page,is to give visitors to your site some idea of who you are.With these prelims out of the way, you can choose to work witheither a blank page or a template-a prefabricated page thatyou'll modify as you develop your own. If this is your firstWeb page, templates provide a welcome assist.Pull-down menus plus a selection of icon buttons across thetop of the screen constitute the major page-development tools.The buttons automatically apply HTML formatting to elementsof your document. You can either click on a button to activateits function or drag and drop it to the place on the page whereyou want to work. Either way, a dialog box opens to acceptyour input.Want to create a headline? Drag the Headline icon to the topof the page; in the Edit Headline dialog box, type your textand click on the Styles tab to choose the desired type sizeand alignment (left or center). Do the same to add body text(except that you don't have a choice of type size). With text,you can opt to have items centered or bulleted. Adding imagesis easy, too. Choose a file from the limited selection providedin Home Page Wizard, or import your own GIF or JPEG image.Home Page Wizard lets you adjust image height and width bypixels.To forge links to other parts of your Web document, first enterthe link text, which is what visitors will click on to makethe jump; then click on the internal location, such as pagetwo of a multipage document. Setting up a link to another Website involves no more than supplying link text, typing in theURL of the other site, and clicking OK.If you want to get reactions and comments from your readers,you can set up an e-mail link that provides them with a preaddressed message form that will automatically go to your emailbox.To view your page, click the Test button, which launches yourWeb browser. When everything is just as you want it, clickthe Publish button or select Publish Pages from the File menu.The Publishing Wizard takes care of the rest.The Home Page Wizard is available for free download, and CompuServemembers can place their Web pages online at no cost duringan introductory period. Remember: You'll have to pay the usualconnect time charges during the publishing, or posting, process.AMERICA ONLINECompared to the fill-in-the-blanks simplicity of Prodigy's Scratchpadoffering, and the drag-and-drop richness of CompuServe's HomePage Wizard builder, America Online's initial foray into personalWeb page building technology is problematic. The tool itself,GNNpress, is a product of NaviSoft (a recently acquired AOLsubsidiary); we looked at a beta version. Although you candownload GNNpress from AOL, you'll need an account on GNN (GlobalNetwork Navigator, AOL's Internet service subsidiary) to publishyour page; your AOL membership is of no use here.Editor or Creator?The program is billed as a combination authoring tool and Webbrowser, but we found it to be more a first-generation HTMLeditor than an easy-to-use Web page creator. The current versionis not intuitive for first-time users, and even fairly seasonedWeb page authors probably would prefer not to hassle with thecomplexities imposed by GNNpress. For example, during our testing,we were frequently unable to reach the GNNpress server usingits browser.Creating a Web page with GNNpress is a lot like using a wordprocessor. As you work, you choose the appearance factors ofyour document-heading sizes, bulleted lists, and paragraphformatting, for example. And if you're editing a document,just highlight text and delete it, or highlight it and begintypingyour new text.Pull-down menus control most formatting. If you want to rendera title in bold characters, highlight it, choose Format, andselect Bold. Menu choices let you remove formatting, unlinkitems, and create numbered, un-numbered, or "definition" lists(like glossaries)Spicing It UpYou also can draw borders around elements and include preformattedtext on your page. Dress up your page with horizontal rulesthat span the entire page, but there's no way to specify theirplacement or define their thickness.GNNpress lets you create multiple pages and establish linksbetween them, but creating links to external Web sites, whilepossible, isn't simple. To do this, you have to use the builtin browser to navigate to the desired page, click the CopyURLbutton, create the link on your Web page, and paste in thecopied name. While it ensures accurate http addresses, it'sa lot of work-especially if you knew the address already.You can build an e-mail form by copying text from a sample pageincluded with GNNpress, but again, there's no simple way tocreate one on your own. If you wade through the HTML code,you'll find that the mailto: command is used to do this, butwe couldn't find it explained in the documentation.On the other hand, a number of GNNpress features are perfectlyeasy to implement. For example, you can highlight a plain textlist and instantly convert it into a bulleted or numbered list.Further, multiple text lines can be block indented (click BlockQuoteformat), block indented with italics (Address format), or singlespaced (Preformatted format). Simple commands turn text intobold, italic, underlined, or fixed pitch. And you can easilyimport JPEG and GIF files.Link-WatchGNNpress provides one especially cool feature-the Check Linksoption, which launches the GNNpress browser and checks to makesure that all jumps are functioning as they should. The programalso includes some clip art, but it falls mostly into the bulletsand arrows category.GNNpress' documentation is adequate, but not exceptional. Sincethe help system is an HTML document rather than a Windows helpfile, searching for a topic is slower than in a typical Windowsapp-despite the file's table of contents. And while AOL letsyou design offline, you must be online to use the help system,thus incurring the standard AOL fee.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Tips for Fledgling PagemastersBy:Joel T. PatzAs you plan your personal Web page, keep in mind the followingconventions and requirements that affect Web authors at alllevels: Storage space. Text doesn't take up a lot of room, but graphicsand especially sound files can eat up the disk space the providerallots per user. Be sure to first find out what your storageallotment is. Next, check the size of any images and soundclips you're considering including on your page. Then you canfiddle with the balance of space requirements to come up withyour best possible page. Considerate content. A Web page is not the place to insultand alienate people. (If you must indulge in rancor, Usenetis a more appropriate venue.) Hence, it's a good idea to avoidpotentially objectionable material, such as obscene or sexuallyexplicit language, bigoted or racist assertions-not to mentionanything outright illegal. Copyright infringement is anotherarea to be wary of: If you're using someone else's material,make sure you're free to do so and give them credit for it. Design integrity. You face built-in design constraints in creatinga Web page, mostly imposed by the limitations of HTML. Forexample, you can't change the font style for different paragraphsin the same document. But as HTML continues to develop-andHTML 3.0 is a big improvement-different backgrounds, colors,fonts, lines, and more complex audio and graphics elementswill be added to our design palettes. "Browser shift." Different browsers see Web pages differently,depending on which HTML features they support. As a result,not everyone who views your page will necessarily see it exactlyas you do, particularly where special effects are concerned.Some browsers might have difficulty reproducing backgroundsand colors; tables and forms might pose a problem for others.Solution: Test your page with several browsers. Usually, you'llget a clear indication that major parts of a page aren't viewablewhen you call it up; you might see an icon, for example, wherea full graphic display is supposed to appear.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Bridging the Gender gap--Sometimes it seems there are aboutas many women online as you'd find in a Foreign Legion camp.An expert on the topic explores some causes of the online gendergap.By:JUDITH BROADHURSTThe numbers are perplexing. Though women represent approximately51 percent of the U.S. population, a recent Nielsen study showsa 2-to-1 male/female ratio of Internet users. Other recentstudies of both online services and Internet users report thatwomen represent between 30 and 37 percent of total users. Thoughthese numbers reflect a significant improvement over 1994 statistics,which pegged the female online population at 15 to 20 percent,they're hardly encouraging. n One knowledgeable observer questionsthe validity of the statistics. "What does that mean?" asksRuth Kaplan, a research assistant at the Institute for theFuture, a think tank based in Menlo Park, Calif. "Do they meanwomen who have been online once? And does that mean they'regoing online to download a map of San Diego because they'regoing there next week, or are they participating in a Usenetnewsgroup about a health problem they have?"On the surface, this gender gap doesn't make sense. After all,even if you buy into the stereotype of women as technophobes,that doesn't explain the disparity that exists even on theeasiest-to-use commercial services, such as America Online,eWorld, and Prodigy. And even though more women are onlineand using these big-name services, they're still not takingfull advantage of what's there, or using resources resourcefully."I can't stand the Internet. I see it as a huge time-waster,"says a disillusioned America Online subscriber, who actuallyhas never used the Internet. She requests anonymity, however,because her job requires her to eventually master such tools.Nurture Fights NaturePart of the reason women find themselves disenchanted with theonline experience stems from cultural influences.Men tend to see computers as technotoys, which means fun, butwomen think of them as mere machines related to work. Thesecontrasting mindsets developed during childhood, says Dr. MaryFrances Stuck, a sociologist and assistant dean of arts andsciences at the State University of New York at Oswego. "Boystear things apart and use them in different ways than whatthey were intended for," Stuck says, "but girls tend not toexplore. They're very task-oriented."Children often are introduced to computers by shred-em and shootem computer games, which turn girls off. According to a recentFind/SVP study, however, this pattern appears to be shiftingbecause women-now more involved in buying and using home computerstend to choose educational rather than game software for theirchildren.Nevertheless, the prevailing attitude is still that computersare "a male thing." "These kinds of biases are deeply ingrainedin our society," says Chuck Huff, an associate professor ofpsychology at St. Olaf College, in Northfield, Minn.And in the workplace, women largely are reticent about viewingthe computer as more than office equipment. The sample of womenwe interviewed repeatedly say that they feel guilty if theyuse their computers at work for anything other than what isobviously "work." They seldom see browsing online servicesfor information as "real" work. Instead, many of them thinkof it as the equivalent of chatting with a friend by phoneon company time.But all that's just background for the nine principal factorsthat inhibit women's online involvement. Admittedly, most ofthem involve misperceptions and stereotypes:1. Lack of timeTo many women, computers are hardly a necessity. At work, differencesin time-management styles play a large part in this misperception."Men delegate far more, thus free up time," Stuck says. "Mendelegate, women do." And at home, "It's because women are stilldoing the dishes and putting the kids to bed and doing theerrands during the evening hours when most people are online,"says Janet Attard, who leads business forums on both GEnieand America Online.2. Dollars don't make senseThen there's the combination money-indulgence factor. "Computersare perceived as a luxury technology, and women still don'tmake as much as men, even in the same jobs," says Ellen Balka,assistant professor of women's studies at the Memorial Universityof Newfoundland."Women are less eager to spend money on hobbies," adds JudyHeim, author of I Lost My Baby, My Pickup, and My Guitar onthe Information Highway and Internet for Cats. "We considerit self-indulgent. We feel guilty, thinking we really shouldbe spending the money on our kids or other loved ones."3. Negative mediaOne of the major reasons more women are not online yet-alongwith lack of time and money-is media mythology. A search for"women" and "online services" on any magazine or newspaperdatabase invariably turns up a list of predictable storiesabout sexual harassment, pedophiles, stalkers, cybersex, onlineromances gone wrong, and the risks of using credit cards foronline shopping. These make for juicy copy, but the sensationalizedstories that distort reality have scared many women away.4. The graphics-are-good fallacyGraphics, though simple to use, don't necessarily offer theallure you'd think. "I'm anti-chat and anti-graphics becauseI think those are the most inefficient uses of online services,"says Teresa Mears, a journalist, editor, and newsletter publisherin Miami. "I use online networks to get information and makecontacts with people, and it takes more time to do that inlive chat or if you have to wait for graphics.""More user-friendly and more graphical are not necessarily thesame. We fooled ourselves into believing that," Memorial University'sBalka says. "Fancy graphics are for marketing. They help sellproducts, but they don't enhance the quality of interactionwith my colleagues."5. Combat is not hospitableEspecially in Usenet newsgroups, women find the atmosphere hostile,intimidating, or childish. Words like "one-upsmanship" and"mental masturbation" come up a lot when women talk about theirimpressions of online discussions. Lisa Kimball of The MetaNetwork sums it up: "Women don't think of conversation as acontact sport."6. Technology's not a turn-onSome men seem to equate the power of their computers with realpower, and see bandwidth, RAM, megahertz, and hard-drive sizeas something akin to sexual prowess. But women are unimpressedwith technology for its own sake. As Paula Span wrote in TheWashington Post magazine, "Women treat computers like reliablestation wagons: Learn how to make them take you where you wantto go, and as long as they're functioning properly, who caresabout pistons and horsepower? Whereas guys-even those who neverlearned how to change an oil filter-are enamored by computers,want to play with them, upgrade them, fix them when they falter,and compare theirs with the other guy's."7. The "geek chic" stereotype"Before I was online," says Esther Gwinnell, a psychiatristin Portland, Ore., "I'd imagined it as mostly people who buildcomputers, with pocket protectors and many pens. Boy, was Iwrong!" The techies are there, of course, but this is simplyan outdated, off-base impression that persists among the uninitiated.8. Fear of an alien nationWomen are more worried than men that we're headed toward a societyin which people communicate mostly electronically. Many alsoassume that communicating by computer is cold, impersonal,rather weird, and the preoccupation of social misfits. Partlyto counter this, the online industry co-opted the term "community"to hype chat rooms. Not coincidentally, that's where theseservices make the most money, aside from online gaming."It sounds good, because it's a feel-good, '90s mentality, but'community' in that sense is used as a marketing ploy," saysLeslie Regan Shade, a doctoral candidate at McGill Universityin Ottawa, who is doing her dissertation on gender and virtualcommunities.9. Misdirected marketingMarketers haven't figured out quite how to cater to women online."Women don't want to be ghettoized; they don't want a separateset of services. If you set aside a finance forum for women,they feel like something's missing there and go to the regularfinance forum instead," says Jodi DeLeon, product manager forthe Microsoft Network.As Regan Shade observes, "Women don't want recipes and fashiononline. We want ways to use the technology in productive, constructiveways. We want breast cancer information and support groups,and sites like Virtual Sisterhood [on the Web] and the kindof things that are coming out of the Beijing conference [theU.N.'s Fourth International Conference on Women]. [Contentdevelopers] think all content for women should be consumeroriented."What's most important to know is that women want to be talkedto as individuals, not just as women, says Carol Wallace, aspokeswoman at Prodigy. "[Women] don't go online to have a'woman experience'; they go online like anybody else."Ironically, not one commercial service has made an effort toreach out to women at women's conferences, associations, orconventions of women business owners. Yet Echo, a small NewYork City BBS founded and run by Stacy Horn, rivals all ofthe multimillion-member services in percentage of women membersand half of Echo's sysops are women. Horn says she goes outof her way to actively recruit women. "We send each new femalemember a letter asking if they'd like to be assigned anotherwoman on Echo as a mentor," she says. "The mentors teach themnot just the commands, but the culture."A More Integrated Future?As women have moved into corporate management, women have influencedthe shift to the popular model of management by consensus,which involves everybody affected in decisions. Memorial University'sBalka says she hopes for a similar humanizing influence asmore women participate online; this influence, she believes,will result in less flaming, posturing and preening, and moretrue communication.The Institute for the Future's Kaplan adds that more consciouschoices about the content, culture, and structure of the onlineworld and related public policies need to be made. She andothers want to see a diversity of voices plan the Internet,with steps taken to ensure people of all ages, genders, andeconomic levels get easy, affordable online access and feelwelcome.No medium of communication and information since the telephoneand television is likely to have such a profound impact oneducation, politics, and the way we live and work as this one.That's why it's so important that women-who are traditionallysaid to be more verbally adept and better communicators-helpguide its direction rather than dismiss it all as hype andhoopla.On a more practical note, being online is becoming a must forprofessionals. "If you're not wired or in some way reachableonline, you're going to fall out of so many informational loopsthat are available," Echo's Horn says. "You used to have togo to luncheons and cocktail parties to network. Now you haveto be online."To be sure, men haven't posted any "No Women Allowed" signsonline. It's the sensationalized media hype, outmoded and offbase stereotypes, and plain stubborness of women themselvesthat are the likely culprits.It's not merely a matter of career consequences, or even thegrowing distance between the haves and have-nots. Ultimately,it comes down to power-but of the medium, not the machine.Two decades ago, Michael Korda wrote in Power: How to Get It,How to Use It: "The person who controls the computer is thusin a singular position of power." That person gains power overnot just information, but people, he said.Korda's book was published just three years after the firstpublic demonstration of what we now call the Internet, andfour years before the oldest commercial service, CompuServe,existed. It's now up to women to put aside their own skepticism,wariness and "yes-but" attitudes and heed his words.@Judith Broadhurst, a free-lance writer in Santa Cruz, Calif.,is the author of The Woman's Guide to Online Services.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. For Grrls' Eyes OnlyBy:Judith H. BernsteinThere's a lack of women online, you hear? You wouldn't knowit from this New York City group.In a loft in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, women chat as they arrangefolding chairs into rows and put out refreshments. Aliza Sherman,wearing her Cybergrrl T-shirt, is seemingly everywhere at once,greeting guests as they arrive to take part in a New Mediaphenomenon.This is a meeting of Webgrrls, which may be the oldest establishedpermanent floating organization for women in new media: Itwas founded by Sherman last April. Back then, Webgrrls' firstmeeting drew six participants; this meeting has drawn closeto 100. Founding the group was the culmination of Sherman'seight years online and part of her professional commitmentto the field. (She also started CG Media, an online communicationsand marketing company, a year ago.)The purpose of Webgrrls, Sherman tells the women at the meeting,"is to share; not to be competitive with each other, but tooffer others opportunity." Thus, the meeting is an open forumin which each participant introduces herself, then declareswhat skills, information, or support she seeks from the organization,as well as what resources she can give in return.In that spirit, business cards and e-mail addresses are tradedas one participant after another speaks: The Webmaster fromScholastic needs HTML designers. Julie Denny, an AssociatedPress reporter and a director/mediator with the Alliance forMediation & Conflict Resolution, wants to learn how to usethe Web to dig up research on conflict resolution in the workplace.Attorneys, financial consultants, students, artists, designers,editors, writers, techies, and the admittedly Web-cluelessare in attendance, as well as those looking for a sense ofcommunity. "I'm looking for support from other working moms,and I can give back my knowledge on the background and historyof the net," one woman says.Sherman's regular e-mailings to members, as well as FeMiNa,her "Yahoo-type" search tool of links appealing to women, andCybergrrls, her own Web site (http://www.cybergrrls.com/),round out Webgrrls' resources.It's Webgrrls' open forum, created to curb inhibitions, thatcompels the group to limit its membership to women, accordingto Sherman. "This is for women, about women. Women have differentneeds in a group professional setting [than men do]," she says."This gives them an opportunity to open up in a noncompetitiveatmosphere. Women are more likely to want to share with eachother."Does this approach seem exclusionary? "Women say, 'You're ghettoizingus; pigeonholing us.' But not one woman who has attended thesemeetings has said that," Sherman contends. In fact, Shermancites inquiries from women across the United States and aroundthe world about starting Webgrrls chapters in their own communities.Sherman also says she's working on a survey of women on theWeb. And, despite the commonly cited statistics on the dearthof women online, she says, "Companies should target women nowand offer them things to attract them to come online. I'm doingthis now, regardless of the numbers [of women actually online]."Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. FAQ: All the News That's Fit to Speak -- Talk all day if you wantall it takes is knowing the IRC codeBy:David A. HarveyOther than searching for ways to get out of paying taxes, thesecond most human of qualities separating us from the animalsis conversation. We can't get enough of it.Digital chatter is as old as the net, but its first implementationswere limited to Talk, a grotesque one-on-one protocol run fromthe Unix command line. It wasn't until 1988 that the digitalBabel known as Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, began. Designedby Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi) as a replacement forTalk on his BBS, the protocol and its clients spread to 60countries and through a series of linked servers that now servehundreds of channels, thousands of topics, and tens of thousandsof responsive, real-time, live conversations.For the technically curious, the workings behind IRC are definedin the Network Working Group's Request For Comments (RFC) Number1459 (ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/irc/support/rfc1459.txt)What counts is that IRC allows one-to-one, one-to-many, andmany-to-many conversations. In IRC parlance, IRC itself refersto the protocol; a server is a specific box (usually linkedto other servers) that implements the IRC protocol, along withany server-specific rules; and a client is the software youuse to tap into IRC's scintillating discourse.Channel Me InThe oldest and most trafficked IRC system is EFnet (http://irc.ucdavis.eduefnet/), a cacophony of 11,000 users linked by 100 servers.A band of netizens-sensitized to perceived privacy breechesand lack of available bandwidth-staged an early revolt againstEFnet to form the UnderNet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/undernet), a smaller and more tight-knit community of IRCers. On average,UnderNet includes 27 servers and a little less than 3,000 users.Another IRC system, DALnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/dalnet/),started as a role-playing-game alternative network. It's relativelysmall and consequently cultish, averaging 130 users and 16servers.IRC networks are composed of channels, which are the equivalentof chat rooms you can find on America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe.These networks carry thousands of channels dedicated to topicsranging from cooking to high-energy particle physics.Each channel is ruled by a channel operator-called a channelopor op. Operators must maintain topicality, rid the channelof abusive persons, and handle basic IRC functions. There'sno limit to the number of operators; most channels have several.Time for Good BehaviorIf you jump into the middle of an IRC channel and begin hurlinginsults, you're likely to be booted from the channel, flamed,or even banned from an entire server. Anonymous IRC conversationsaren't a ticket to repealing basic etiquette.Neither does IRC etiquette stop at the obvious. Different channelshave different purposes and different rules, so listen beforeyou speak. Be especially mindful of structured channels (usuallybusiness and academic) that may be set up to hold a news conference,host a lecture, or field a structured Q&A session.True privacy does not exist on IRC. Anybody can see what youtype, though the latest IRC clients make it possible to holdfairly private, one-to-one discussions. Never type in passwords,credit card numbers, or strange commands that a "helpful" strangersuggests.Before diving into IRC, it would be smart to read the IRC primer(http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRCprimer/IRCprimer/IRCprimer.html) for a thorough discussion of IRC basics. If you want todelve deeper, zip over to an excellent compendium of IRC resourcesat both http://urth.acsu.buffalo.edu/irc/WWW/ircdocs.html andhttp://www.escape.com/~ward/ircstuff.html. And, if chattingis becoming a lifestyle, head to the alt.irc.whatever newsgroups You'll find topics that cover everything you need to know.Executing ConversationsLike everything on the net, IRC requires a program that massagesyour information to conform to the IRC protocol. The latestand greatest is known as an ircII client; it supports everythingfrom chatting to exchanging files via DCC (Direct Client toClient), playing sounds, and zapping a URL to a Web browser.If you run Windows or Windows 95, browse over to Stroud's ConsummateWinSock App List (http://cwsapps.texas.net/phone.html) fora roundup of IRC programs. Other platforms are stuck checkingthe otherwise lame IRC FAQ (http://www.kei.com/irc.html)Long-time IRCers disparage anything but plain, command-lineIRC programs. Ignore them. I mean, if you really would rathertype in /WHO #Twilight_Zone and watch a list scroll by at netspeed, fine. Personally, I'd rather point and click any dayof the week.The best and easiest-to-use IRC clients run on graphical interfacesand offer icon-driven support for the wealth of features supportedby ircII. These clients use scripting extensively; for uptightservers, this can be a problem.In the lingo of IRC, a script (or any other self-maintainingprogram) is called a robot, or just a bot (http://www2.undernet.org8080/~cs93jtl/unet_bot.txt). Bots are forbidden on some servers,so, as a result, attempting to link to one of these serverswith an advanced ircII client may be impossible. If you getan error message exclaiming, "Bots are not allowed" when you'reusing a script-driven client, try another server location.Windows users have been blessed with a cornucopia of superbircII clients. Best known is mIRC (http://sunsite.nijenrode.nlftp/pub/mirc/index.html), a multichannel-capable program thatsupports file exchange, URL launching, audio, and operatorfunctions through pull-down menus and buttons. Netscape recentlyreleased Netscape Chat (http://home.netscape.com/), which isoptimized to deal with URLs. It supports standard IRC and NetscapeIRC servers.Unix heads are in good shape: You have a slew of command-lineircII clients with full support for both interactive-only andscripted IRC sessions. X-Window users are served by a smallbut growing number of graphical clients.If you're on a Mac (or another operating system, like VMS orOS/2) it's slim pickings: the mostly command-line clients,mostly unscripted support for IRC on these OSes pale besideWindows and Unix.Into the FutureI have seen the future of IRC, and it is virtual interactive3-D. But don't take my word for it-check out Worlds Inc. (http//www.worlds.net) and its latest Worlds Chat, now at Version8. Worlds Chat calls on all the advanced features of ircIIclients (DCC, audio, and URL launching), and adds the abilityto navigate a fully 3-D world model using an avatar stand-in.Another new effort, AlphaWorld, is found on CompuServe (youcan also get it from Stroud's list). AlphaWorld ups the 3-Dante to include flying around and improved scenery. TribalVoice's PowWow (http://www.tribal.com/) stays 2-D but addsin tours of the Web and voice.What is clear is that, even more than the Web, IRC is evolvinginto a true virtual community. With the ability to exchangeURLs, voice and data alongside real-time conferencing, IRCis poised to become a prime focal point for the next generationof Web usage.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Navigator: Getting Your Small Business Online--The world can be your smallbusiness' marketplaceBy:Kate GerwigFrom a 300-square-foot shop in Pasadena, Calif., the ownersof Hot Hot Hot run a global business, shipping more than 100kinds of hot sauce all over the world. In the process, they'rea model for small businesses that seek to burst the confinesof locality.Further north, from a 10-foot by 10-foot basement room, VirtualVineyards opened its cyberdoors 14 months ago and began shippingwine-supplied mostly by small California wineries-worldwide.If you're thinking about placing your small business online,or opening a virtual business, it pays to study the practicesof those that have gone before. Both Hot Hot Hot and VirtualVineyards have a lot more in common than the pursuit of gastronomicexcellence. Both are small businesses that successfully sellproducts over the Internet. Their Web sites are friendly, informative,and easy to navigate, and are persuasive enough to make themost timid of taste buds try sauces like Nuclear Hell or encouragethose who confuse zinfandel with gew rztraminer to order specialslike "$99 of Wine on the Wall."Because all Web sites are equally accessible, startup businessescan exist alongside the Fortune 500 on a virtually level playingfield. But only a fraction of the more than 5 million small and medium-sized businesses in the United States are usingthe Internet as an advertising, marketing, or sales tool.Ticket to the WorldIf done properly, a small business' Web site can give a oneemployee shop global presence with a few clicks of a mouse.Hot Hot Hot proprietors Monica Bosserman Lopez and Perry Lopez,who founded their walk-in business two years ago, say sharinginformation with your clients is the essence of business successon the Web."If you think you can put up a Web site and just get stuff [in],it's not going to happen," Bosserman Lopez says. "You haveto understand what works because it's a very different styleof selling. Really successful Web sites give something back."Both the hot sauce and wine online locations let you place orders.Hot Hot Hot's site (http://www.hot.presence.com/g/p/H3/index.html)generated 20 percent of the company's revenue last year. VirtualVineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/), which exists only asan online business, could be in the black in about a year,according to company co-founder and self-described "cork dork"Peter Granoff.To develop a successful site, businesses first need to decidewhat they want from an online location. Figure out whetheryou want to enhance the company's image, generate sales leads,or actually close sales. "You have to know who your targetmarket is, how you will contact users who express interestin your product, and, if you're planning to close sales onthe net, how your customers will pay for online orders," saysJoel Maloff, an Internet consultant and author in Ann Arbor,Mich.Be realistic about the number of buyers vs. browsers at yoursite. Bosserman Lopez says about 1 percent of the 30,000 surferswho visit Hot Hot Hot each month actually place orders, "whichis as good as direct mail response rates."A common lament from large and small businesses that load theirpromotional materials on the Web is that nothing happens. "Justputting up a site is like setting up shop in the middle ofa desert," Maloff says. Put your Internet address on your businesscards and stationery, he suggests. Then begin marketing yoursite in ways that take advantage of the interactive medium.At Virtual Advantage Inc. (http://www.virtualad.com/), a Webdesign company in San Diego, founders Julie Bryant and ChristineSheppard have created sites for several small businesses, whichuse quizzes, competitions, cartoons, and e-mail to entice peopleto revisit. "When you mess up a home page, it will be hardto get people to come back again," Bryant says. Web pages needto be quick, snappy, and compelling. Pages with too much textturn visitors off.Some Web designers have suggested that Virtual Vineyards redesignits site using more complicated graphics. Virtual's Granoffsays he'd love to, but not until average modem speeds are fasterthan 14.4 kbps. "Lots of stuff on the Internet is too richin graphics," he says. "If it takes you 30 minutes to accessa site, it's like inviting them into your store and then makingthem wait half an hour."Buy or Lease?An effective Web site doesn't always come inexpensively, accordingto Granoff, though he declined to say how much he's spent.Virtual Vineyards has links on America Online and Prodigy,a co-marketing agreement with CompuServe, and more online arrangementsin progress. The site is registered with search tools likeYahoo and Lycos, and is thinking about doing some Web banneradvertising, Granoff says.Still, cash-strapped businesses might be able to strike a deal.Hot Hot Hot, for example, was able to work out a monthly paymentplan for being the first customer of Presence Information Design,a Web design firm in Pasadena, Calif.There are other creative ways for cash-poor small businessesto get online. Gregory Wester, an analyst at the Boston-basedYankee Group, suggests hooking up with an online restaurantor shopping guide in your area. Boston's restaurant guide (http//www.bWeb.com/) is a good example.Some Internet access providers also have started offering specialpricing packages to small businesses. CERFnet offers smallbusinesses a 99-hours-for-$99 monthly package that includesthe tools for a basic, do-it-yourself Web site.Global Village Communication Inc. (http://info.globalvillage.com), a Sunnyvale, Calif., modem maker and Internet access provider,has staked out the small and medium-sized business market withturnkey net access packages that include an online templatefor a plug-and-play Web site. "Most people don't have the internaltechnology, so we provide a complete solution," says StevenEng, senior product marketing manager for Global Village'sInternet Services division. Performance Technology Inc. (http//www.perftech.com/), in Austin, Texas, also sells a turnkeysystem called Instant Internet, which provides a small-business'network with secure Internet access via modem, ISDN, or a fasterconnection.Deciding where to store pages is another issue for small businesses.Web pages designed by Virtual Advantage are stored for customerson servers at CERFnet (http://www.cerfnet.com/), a Californiaand Arizona regional access provider. This means CERFnet'snetwork guarantees pages will be accessible to users sevendays a week, 24 hours a day. CERFnet spokesman Andy Markemsuggests small businesses stay out of the server purchasingand maintenance business, comparing it to publishing a magazinejust to advertise your products and services.Virtual Vineyards, however, owns its own server and does itsown engineering work in-house. It helps, of course, to knowthat Virtual co-founder Robert Olson was an engineer at SiliconGraphics Inc. before he shifted to the online wine arena.Regardless of the hardware you use and the search engines youlist with, having a well-designed site may be the best advertisingyou can have, according to Hot Hot Hot's Bosserman Lopez. "Othersites will want to link to you-and your customers will comeback," she says. And that's a good step on the road to growinga small businesses into a larger one.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Power Tools: Your Site's Got the Look--Your page can look sharp with theright background, clip art, and iconsBy:Rich SantalesaTake any visually rich site, strip the background out, pop theicons off and dump the pictures out, and what remains? Basically,the equivalent of a piece of typed paper. Plain text, plainscreen.In any media, graphics make the difference between a merelyinformative work and one packing the visual punch of a primePicasso. Luckily, the Web and every online service is stuffedwith useful graphic tools, libraries, and resources. If yourWeb page or site is on the visually anemic side, a solid strategyfor tuning and tweaking is as simple as B, C, I.No, BCI isn't a scandal-ridden bank. Rather it stands for Background,Clip art, and Icons. Adding the right doses of all three cancompletely make over your Web site.Loading Up on BackgroundsWhen building a house, you need a solid foundation. The sameholds for your Web site, where the page background acts asa common foundation for your site. One of the smartest enhancementsto hit the Web, background images are an effective way to stampyour site with a coherent corporate or personal seal.If you haven't seen backgrounds, you're likely using an ancientbrowser. When fed a small graphics file, the background tagseamlessly tiles the graphic to create a wallpaper effect. Withthe right graphic, logo or image, the results can be stunning.Keep in mind that different platforms can and do map colorsdifferently. I've seen background images that looked perfectlyfine on a Mac yet were completely washed out, or displayedunexpected colors, on a PC, and vice versa. Don't just assumethat if you see the image fine everyone else will also. Testas much as you can with different browsers and systems.Also, keep your background file small. A good role of thumbis to never exceed 40 KB for any page image. If your graphicfile is larger, then consider using two separate versions-alow-resolution image to speed loading and a high-resolutionfile that can load in the background or when clicked.For its part, Microsoft, in true Microsoft style, has addeda modification to the background command in its Internet Explorer2.0 that lets you create what Microsoft dubs "watermarks."A watermark is simply a background that stays put. With traditionalbackgrounds, whenever you scroll the screen you scroll thebackground.By adding a bgproperties=fixed option to the background tag,Explorer recognizes that the background image should stay putwhen using a corporate logo or ad, for instance. It's easierto visualize than to explain. For more details on Explorerand its new tags, pop over to http://www.microsoft.com/windowsie/ie20html.htm.Though any GIF can be considered background material, the Webholds many collections of background pages that should helpyou in your quest for the perfect background and texture. Netscapeitself maintains a basic background collection at http://home.netscape.comassist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html. None of Netscape's backgroundswill win your site an award, but they're better than nothing.For seriously cool backgrounds, you'll need to dig a bit deeperinto the online world's art archives, or consider creatingyour own images. As always, a good place to start your questis at the doorstep of the net's various search engines, suchas Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com), Lycos (http://www.lycos.com),Excite (http://www.excite.com), InfoSeek (http://www.infoseek.com),or Webcrawler (http://www.Webcrawler.com). Each has a varietyof graphic categories, and searching on the keywords backgrounds,clip art and icons will turn up numerous pages offering backgrounds,such as the Terry Gould graphics collection (http://www.netaccess.on.ca~kestrel/list.html.)Coloring Your Clip ArtOnce you've fitted your page with a sizzling background, it'stime to perform some graphic fine-tuning. Using graphic elementsabove and beyond backgrounds typically means turning to existingimages or clip art libraries and collections.If you're comfortable using Photoshop or another graphics program,it's an easy matter to whip up batches of your own images.When you look at your page and start dancing because thingslook so cool, it's a safe bet you've hit upon what you want.An easy way to start feeling that happy foot-tingling is tofly into the Web Weavers Warren page, which is one of the bestcollections of links to graphics, backgrounds, icons and art(http://fox.nstn.ca/~tmonk/weaver/iconimag.html). If you can'tfind something of interest here, then it's time to hang upyour Web browser.Another longtime collection of clip art is Sandra's ClipartServer at http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/sjl/clipart.html. Mostof the images offered aren't going to set your heart fluttering,but for graphics in a pinch Sandra's served up some fillingselections. Likewise, Grahame's Graphics for Home Pages athttp://www.computan.on.ca/~grahame/graphics.html contains hundredsof useful buttons, icons and other graphics.Don't overlook the obvious when searching for graphics. Checkingfor art at the home pages of graphic software companies isa smart and safe bet. For instance, MetaTools (formerly HSC)at http://www.hsc.com, Corel at http://www.corel.com and othersdisplay and demo a wide variety of art created with their programs.Each also sells inexpensive, yet well-done, collections ofclip art on CD-ROM.Icons GaloreWhile clip art adds context and meaning to your Web site, icons,graphic lines and buttons provide the graphic glue to tie yoursite together. As hard as it is to believe, there are peopleon the Web who seem to do nothing but create free art for othersto use. Take advantage of their generosity.For instance, a good starting point for gathering icons is,again, the Web Weavers Warren page, or the Icon Browser page(http://www.cli.di.unipi.it/iconbrowser/icons.html). Thoughthe Icon Browser page isn't well designed in terms of usage,with a bit of effort you'll walk away with whatever you need.Last, if you come across an icon that you simply can't livewithout, send the page's owner an e-mail asking for permissionto use it. More often than not you'll be pleasantly surprisedto find the owner doesn't mind if you grab a copy for yourself,but always ask.Tools for AllIn the end, the best sites all use some home-generated art.If you don't already have a collection of graphic tools, converters,and add-ons, try the following software and shareware librariesVirtual Software Library (http://vsl.cnet.com)-a massive gatheringof 130,000 software files from the 22 largest shareware andfreeware archives on the Internet; The Father of Shareware(http://www.halcyon.com/knopf/jim)-a site by one of the fathersof the shareware scene that links to many other shareware collections;and The Software Site (http://softsite.com/)-a killer collectionof software for all platforms. If you only visit one graphictool site, this isn't a bad choice.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETGUIDE via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996  Vol. 3  No. Webmaster: Long-Range Web Planning -- Plan hard or watch your Web sitedie. It's the new Webmaster codeBy:Jonathan GrossNothing moves faster than the computer industry. Yesterday'shot system is today's ho-hum computer, and today's "standard"is tomorrow's forgotten application programming interface.The same rule holds true for emerging Web technologies.During the next 12 months, Webmasters will face the difficulttask of deciding which of the up-and-coming Web technologiesshould be on their sites. They'll also have to figure out howto pay for them, and, even more vital, how to best manage itall. Choose right and you'll ride the wave of the next year;choose wrong and your site will be forever playing catch-up.What do you need to keep in mind? Here are the top items tofactor into your Web planning.HotJavaHotJava promises to bring sophisticated animation and more tothe Web via "applets," or programs written in the Java programminglanguage. Applets are included (like images) in HTML pages.What does this mean to the person hosting a large Web site?Not much, actually. Since the Java code is downloaded and runon the client system, there is no additional overhead placedon the host CPU. Java applets also are a bit smaller than manyimages, and so the bandwidth requirements are minimal. Writingapplets, however, is a different story. If you intend to addHotJava to your site, start scoping out the local C++ talent.For more information, visit http://www.javasoft.com/faq2.html#g1,or find a copy of John Decembers' book Presenting Java fora general overview of Java.SecurityAs the Internet has grown, commercial-grade security has becomevital. Whether you're talking about a firewall that protectsyour entire internal network or a secure-transaction Web server,security is never far from a Webmaster's thoughts.As a matter of course, firewalls come in two flavors-packetfiltering and proxy-based. The correct type for your networkdepends on the security decisions and policies you set. Althoughthe software needed to build a firewall on the Internet canbe obtained for free, configuration is a serious business-evenfor the network savvy.Turnkey firewalls that combine hardware and software as a unifiedpackage start at around $10,000. That may seem expensive, butit's a solid and often cost-effective alternative to piecingtogether your own.Netscape's server, as well as others, allows secure transactionsto be made between client and server, enabling credit cardorders and other sensitive information to be passed via theHyperText Transfer Protocol. Right now there are many applicationsthat use credit cards as a possible method of payment. Thiswill be a field of development to watch closely.Hardware and TechnologyAs always, outside developments in hardware and technology meansteady planning back at the server. As faster modems replacethe existing base of V.32 and V.32bis modems, space hogs suchas video and audio files (MPEG, AVI, etc.) will begin floodingserver drives. Seriously audit your disk space usage, as wellas your line bandwidth capacity.Control and RegulationAs the net grows, so will the need for regulation and control,though it may not fall in the hands we'd like. For instance,as aspects previously under government control move over tofor-profit organizations, such as the InterNIC, a $2 billionU.S. government defense contractor in control of the root nameservers,the Internet will change steadily. The recent imposition offees for domain names is one example of the type of chargesthat might be imposed and gradually applied to other aspectsof the Internet. It behooves all system administrators andWeb presence providers to stay abreast of developments in thearena.Database IntegrationIf you're not running a database behind your Web pages, you'remissing one of the best Web tools around. Numerous databasesolutions are available now, such as Next's WebObjects andMiniSQL and its W3 query interface W3_mSQL, which is a singleCommon Gateway Interface program that acts as a query generator.In certain situations, storing all Web elements in a databasecan be an effective way for the Webmaster to control revisionsand content, and ease the task of Web site administration.Storing your Web contents in a database also can offer an extradegree of security in various circumstances.However, keep in mind that if the query engine and the databaserun on the same system as your Web server, there could be asignificant draw on the CPU power of that machine. All right,perhaps not a significant drain if you happen to be runningyour Web server on an Onyx or DEC 300-MHz Alpha. But for thoseof us making use of the Intel flavor of Windows NT, smallerSun workstations, Linux, or another desktop-sized machine,this will be a consideration.VRMLVirtual Reality Modeling Language is an ASCII-based languagethat describes three-dimensional worlds. VRML isn't a weekendproject. Object inlining will be used in VRML even more thanin HTML documents, so the load placed on the server, especiallyas multiconnection browsers are developed, will be high interms of bandwidth, CPU load, and, of course, disk space andaccess. Large VRML worlds may have to be distributed acrossseveral servers in order to achieve acceptable load limits.If you are going to be implementing VRML on a large scale, youwould be wise to look into additional servers. More informationis available from the VRML Architecture Group (http://vrml.wired.comVAG/) and the VRML Repository (http://www.sdsc.edu/SDSC/Partnersvrml/)HTMLFor almost two years, various organizations have been pushingto create a single HTML standard. Various drafts of these proposalshave circulated: HTML+, HTML 2.0, and now HTML 3.0. But evenas these standards are argued and mulled over, non-standards,such as Microsoft's and Netscape's extensions to HTML, arebecoming pervasive.As America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, the Microsoft Network,and other online services increasingly supply access to Internetservices, there will be a corresponding increase in hits bytheir proprietary browsers. These browsers are mostly HTML2.0 compliant, and are fairly picky about interpreting HTMLdocuments per the standards set out at the World Wide Web Consortium(http://www.w3.org/)To reach as many people as possible with your pages, test yourdesigns using as many browsers as possible. Though Netscapeis the browser king, your documents are certain to be viewedby a number of browsers that do not cope well with Netscapeextensions. Plan accordingly.As the end of this year looms on the horizon, make time to scopeout the year that lies ahead. Plan your network configurationscarefully, keep up with new innovations, build something worthwhile,and most of all, have a good time doing it.Jonathan Gross is editor of WEBsmith magazine, and is involvedin building Web sites, Internet security implementations, andscuba diving.

Suddenly youwere out of touch if you weren't plugged in.Vinton Cerf was there at the beginning. A principal programmerfor the ARPAnet project in the 1960s (a precursor to the Internet)and a co-developer of the now-ubiquitous networking protocolTCP/IP, he more recently served as president of the InternetSociety and was named one of People magazine's "25 Most IntriguingPersons" in 1994. The 52-year-old Cerf was already pluggedin when some of us were in diapers.Currently MCI's senior vice president of data architecture,Cerf is a thin, mercurial man who seems energetic enough topower his own laptop. He sat down at a small conference tableand talked to us practically non-stop about what has been forhim a crusade as well as a career.Q: Is the phrase "surfing the net" derived from your last name?A: There was a company in San Diego called General Atomics thatgot into the networking business and decided to call itselfsurf.net. It turns out another company in the Netherlands hada similarly named service. So these guys called themselvesthe California Educational Research Foundation Network.Q:That spells cerf.net.A: Exactly. Then somebody thought, "Hey, what if Vint minds?"So I got a call and I confess that I hesitated a minute beforehappily signing off on it. Soon after that, out in San Diego,they were hawking T-shirts with "cerfing the net."Q:Were you there for the net's birth?A:There are different views of when things are born. Last yearthere was a big celebration of the 25th anniversary of theInternet, though ARPAnet and the Internet were kind of blurredin that.Q:Wasn't ARPAnet the beginning?A:Partly. In 1969, as part of the Department of Defense, ARPA[Advanced Research Projects Agency] was exploring packet switchingin the hope of keeping its computer networks up in case ofnuclear war. Around 1972, packet radio and packet satelliteprograms also got started at ARPA, and it was only in the contextof these and other networks that the whole question of interconnection,or "internetting," came up.Bob Kahn, who had been one of the chief architects of ARPAnet,recognized the need for this interconnection and came out toStanford, where I was teaching. He posed this problem: Howcould all these things be interconnected without allowing anyof the networks to be changed or any of the host computersto know what was going on inside the networks while being connected?Well, we came up with TCP/IP. So I think the birth of the Internetwas 1973. Others think it started with Paul Baran's originalpacket switching papers in 1962. I suspect the public thinksit started in 1994, when it was suddenly thrust upon theirunsuspecting consciousness.Q: You've been at this since the stone age of computers. Whydid you initially get involved?A: I'm a programmer in my bones! I get a rush making a complexartificial world do what I actually program it to do. Now,imagine trying to get a diverse set of computers and networksall over the country to internet seamlessly so that a programrunning on one machine could effectively interface with a programrunning on another, and without having to know what was goingon inside of either and to be robust and to work when partsof the network were being blown up or an enemy was using jammingdevices.Remember, this was originally intended for military applications.Not only did I have to make it work, but work during and aftera nuclear war. Well, show me a more complicated challenge thanthat!Q:The Electronic Frontier Foundation gave you the Pioneer Awardin 1993. It seems to be the guardian of a certain moralityon the Internet. I wonder if you embrace its precepts.A: First, let me substitute the word "ethic" for "morality."I feel more comfortable with that.Second, you have to realize that the origins of this whole thingevolved in the academic community. ARPA provided the money,but it was the academic community that did the research, whichwas at first a very big problem. Every year, all these scientistswould ask for their own computers, plus they would jealouslyguard their research. The situation became so competitive withoutsharing that it was almost anti-productive.Well, ARPA wanted to get more research for its buck, so it insistedthat ARPAnet be used as a tool in the research-in other words,a way to get on the other guy's computer and run his softwareon it without ferreting out his choicest secrets.A marvelous side effect occurred. With this technological safeguard,people started to loosen up. They started to cooperate. Frankly,that's how you make progress in science: You share your resultsso other people can validate them. In fact, that's how youmake progress anywhere. Well, this ethic of cooperating andsharing, for the most part, continues on the Internet today.Q: You wrote an article for the Internet Society called "Lifein a New World." How different will life in the future of cyberspacebe?A: Very different. The net is a new infrastructure, blendingmass media and personal interaction. So we will have to learnhow to adapt our behavior and our laws to cope with that, especiallygiven the Internet's global qualities. Someday in the nextdecade, the Internet may be comparable in size to today's telephonenetwork. At that scale I'll bet there'll be many, many, moresurprises-surprises we won't be able to imagine.One day we may be wearing computers-and think of the wonderfulword play that will create: softwear, hardwear, and so forth.And as these devices become more common, it will be quite sensibleto network them. So in the middle of the next decade, we mayhave networks to download a new program for our microwave tomake it smarter about how it softens the ice cream. Thingslike that.Life will become a software rather than hardware thing-and ourhuman flexibility and facility and evolvability will be forcedto change dramatically to accommodate being so "plugged in."Contributing editor Bob Berger is the author of the Dr. Riskmystery series, published by Dell.Back to Headline List WT03-B13-14IA086-000622-B040-62http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te116.html 205.156.212.5 19970122051639 text/html 56658HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:14:16 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:28 GMTContent-length: 56471Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te116.html Sample Issue Copyright NETWORK BRIEFING via NewsNet January 05, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES THREE-WAY SPLIT TO COST AT&T $4,000M (388 words) GE TO SPIN OFF EDS (175 words) ARTISOFT DIVERSIFIES WITH TRITON BUY (303 words) COURT HEARS HAYES REORGANISATION PLAN (100 words) NET LICENSING DEAL WITH CISCO EXPANDED (215 words) TYLINK OFFERS HDSL MODULE FOR MR2300 (280 words) INTERNET ACQUISITION COMPLETED (65 words) STRATACOM ADDS SVC SUPPORT TO BPX (263 words) IBM DEVELOPING NEW FAST ETHERNET TECHNOLOGY (117 words) STARWORKS FOR HP-UX ANNOUNCED (200 words) NOVELL SHIPS WEB SERVER EARLY (107 words) NORTEL TO SELL STRUCTURED WIRING BUSINESS (157 words) NOTES 4 TO SHIP THIS WEEK (90 words) FRANCE TELECOM MULLS POLISH LEGAL ACTION (280 words) US TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL IN DOUBT (78 words) JSB REFOCUSSING SEES IT BETTING ON THE CORPORATE INTRANET (513 words) V4 OF IBM INTERNET CONNECTION FOR WINDOWS RELEASED (146 words) NEW WEB PAGE GENERATOR FROM ART (175 words) HOT-JAVA ON SCHEDULE (71 words) C/NET DREAM TARGETS ADVERTISERS (121 words) INTERNET COMMERCE TO TAKE OFF (101 words) C&W TRIES TO HURRY YOUNG & ROSS PAYOFF (163 words) NTT AND KDD SHOULD MERGE, SAYS MINISTER (77 words) Austria (26 words) China (53 words) Czechoslovakia (92 words) Croatia (52 words) Germany (156 words) Hong Kong (55 words) Hungary (55 words) Pakistan (48 words) Russia (50 words) Sri Lanka (44 words) Thailand (71 words) UK (86 words) USA (196 words) Zimbabwe (49 words) FastComm Communications Inc has reported second quarter net (41 words) Internet Communications Corp reported third quarter net losses of (40 words) Oracle Corp reported second quarter net profits up 45.8% at (58 words) Standard Microsystems Corp has reported third quarter net profits (51 words) Telco Systems Inc reported first quarter net losses of $2.6m, (28 words) American Internet Corp, Bedford, Massachusetts supplier of (101 words) Compact Devices Inc, founded in early 1995 to develop and market (51 words) Vixel Corp, Broomfield, Colorado, develo-per and manufacturer of (89 words) COMPUSERVE MADE TO LIMIT ACCESS...

Around 30,000 ofthe redundancies will be compulsory, following a poor response byemployees to its voluntary buy-out package at the end of lastyear. Around 70% of these cuts will be made by the end of thisyear, with the rest following within three years.After tax, the charge - which covers facility close-downs andasset write-downs as well as layoffs - will result in a charge of$4,000m, or around $2.50 per share. As the company reportedprofits of $4,700m for 1994, it may still manage a positiveresult despite the charge. The charges include around $2,600mpre-tax for redundancy pay and related costs, $1,700m in assetwrite-downs, and $1,100m for closing, selling or consolidatingfacilities.Most affected by the announcement will be the company that is tokeep the AT&T name - the telephone service company - and the newsystems and technology company. AT&T Global InformationSolutions, formerly NCR, escapes relatively lightly, thanks tothe fact that it cut 8,500 people from the payroll in September.The majority of the cuts will be in US-based operations and willinclude around 100,000 corporate-wide jobs in areas such asinformation systems, personnel and financial operations.The company also plans to reduce the value of some assets,including its Unitel Inc Canadian telecommunications venture andseveral international units. It will modify some serviceofferings, entailing the write-down of the value of someproprietary software and hardware, and will also write down thevalue of some unneeded network facilities such as microwavetowers and will refocus its undersea cable operations.The cuts were in line with expectations and were well-received bythe market, where shares jumped $2.75 to $67.50 in early tradingafter the announcement.AT&T also says it is on track to file with the Securities &Exchange Commission for an initial public offering for thesystems and technology company, and still expects to complete thetransaction by the end of the year.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETWORK BRIEFING via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996 GE TO SPIN OFF EDSElectronic Data Systems (EDS) Corp, based in Plano, Texas, couldbe an independent company again as soon as the end of next month:the US Internal Revenue Service has given its confirmation thatthe proposed spin-off of the company to its Class E shareholdersby its parent General Motors (GM) Corp will be tax-free. GMannounced its intention to spin off EDS last August (issue 186)following fruitless talks about a merger with BT Plc in May 1993(issue 072) and Sprint Corp a year later (issue 123).The deal still needs shareholder approval, and that could prove aproblem since GM Class E shareholders will see their sharesconverted into those of the stand-alone company, but GM and ClassH holders have to approve the deal as well.

According toArtisoft, a "substantial" percentage of the purchase price forTriton, and for the recently- acquired Synergy Solutions, Inc, isattributed to in-process technology and will be charged tooperations in the current fiscal quarter.Triton Technologies was founded in 1985. Under the CoSessionbrand name, it produces remote control software allowing PCs tobe controlled remotely for OEMs including IBM Corp, NECTechnologies Inc and Zenith Data Systems Corp. CoSession forWindows 6.0, Triton's latest product release, began shippingearlier late last year, offering increased file transfer rates,multitasking capabilities and multiprotocol call waiting.According to Artisoft, the Triton remote control technology fitswell with its recently-acquired modem/phone line sharingtechnology.Kurt Scheel, vp and cfo for Artisoft, sees the acquisition is anatural extension to the company's strategy announced last year,to exit the hardware business and focus on software: thatdecision culminated in Artisoft's decision to divest itself ofEagle Technologies Inc (issue 159) which it had bought it justone year previously.Sales channels were another reason why the fit was good,according to Scheel - since  Triton has concentrated on OEMsales, Artisoft feels that it can open up new markets by sellingTriton products through its existing channels, and conversely,the deal will give Artisoft a foot in the door of the OEM marketfor its existing product range.Scheel denies that the diversification represents any de-emphasising of Artisoft's flagship LANtastic network operatingsystem: "we're not de-emphasising that business so much asdiversifying our dependence on it" he says.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETWORK BRIEFING via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996 COURT HEARS HAYES REORGANISATION PLANThe US Bankruptcy Court of Georgia is in the middle ofconfirmation hearings for Atlanta, Georgia-based HayesMicrocomputer Products Inc's reorganisation plan, although itwill be some time before any decision is reached, due to factorssuch as the speed of testimonies, and the US government shutdown.Hayes representatives have been on the stand, but no decisionwill be reached before the Court has also heard the alternativeplans put forward by US Robotics Inc (issue 197) and DiamondMultimedia Systems Inc (issue 204).The next hearing has been set for Thursday January 11th.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETWORK BRIEFING via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996 NET LICENSING DEAL WITH CISCO EXPANDEDRedwood City, California-based Network Equipment Technologies(NET) Inc has expanded its six year-old agreement with CiscoSystems Inc by licensing the full suite of the latter'sInternetwork Operating System (IOS), and agreeing to resell thefull range of Cisco products globally.

The product is designed to allow users to take advantageof their existing unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling, toachieve data rates of up to T1 (1.544Mbps) over distances up to12,000 feet.According to TyLink, it works by allowing the delivery of anoutbound signal on the same pair of wires on which the returnsignal is received: the transmitted signal is cancelled by thereceiver by precisely predicting the amount of signal echo andsubtracting it from the overall input signal. HDSL-based productsare designed to tolerate crosstalk and operate not only oncontinuous unobstructed pairs of wires, but also on cables withmixed wire gauges and bridge taps.The TyLink MR2300 HDSL Module supports data rates from 672Kbps upto 1.544Mbps, with the timing derived from an internal DTE clock.The company says its MR2300 HDSL Module allows customers tostandardise on a single line driver for fibre-optic, STP, and UTPapplications. Different modules can be mixed and matched in asingle rack-mountable MR2300 chassis which can house up to tencards. Alternatively, the same modules can be used as stand-aloneunits for remote sites.The MR2300 HDSL Module costs $1,695 for the card version and$2,695 for the stand-alone version; both are available now.* TyLink also announced the appointment of Dick Swee as vicepresident of engineering.

Sopowerful is his word, it reckons, that between now and the end ofthis month the world will have begun to clamour for Intranetproducts.Steve Purdham, managing director of JSB's European division, saidthe biggest problem facing the company is educating informationtechnology people that the Intranet concept is simple but veryeffective - and has nothing to do with Notes. He said manycompanies using internal E-mail believe they already have anIntranet, but are not harnessing the Internet-style technology todisseminate corporate information. For example using ordinary E-mail, the company would mail a document to all users, regardlessof its use to them. Using Web technology, the company wouldmerely mail users a message, telling them which Web page containsthe relevant document.JSB's Intranet suite will consist of what the company calls an'end user-comfortable' interface, as distinct from an icon-basedgraphical interface. Purdham says the icon-based interface wasthe best that could be done with low resolution screens andexisting technology, but now there is no need to be bound by itas a standard. JSB is offering a multimedia kiosk-styleinterface, written using the Internet HyperText Mark-up Language.This approach enables users to see a photograph of their office,with doors leading to the accounts department for example, whichthey can click on for access to the accounts system on theserver. Within the accounts department they may see photographsof an order book, an invoice book, a customer book, and thenchoose which book they wish to use.Each company can customise this interface by scanning in picturesor photographs appropriate to its own operation. Behind thekiosk, JSB has written its own Web browser using Mosaic Websoftware licensed from Spyglass Inc. The fully integrated suitealso consists of E-mail, and the File Transfer Protocol. HoweverJSB said that each is available as a component, and any companyalready with a Netscape Communications Corp World Wide Webbrowser would still be able to use this, with other componentsfrom JSB's suite.The kiosk-style front end is also for sale as a separate entity.The kiosk, available any day now, will run under Windows 3.X, 95and NT. The rest of the client suite, Web browser, mail and FileTransfer Protocol, will be available for Windows95 and NT only,at the end of the month. JSB will also offer a server suite, forSanta Cruz Unix and AIX at present, which includes an alphabrowser for users with dumb terminals.

The decision was made after German government officialsinvestigating illegal material on the Internet, including childpornography and other pornographic material for adults,identified the newsgroups as illegal under German law.CompuServe, which provides Internet access in over 100 countries,says it does not have the capability to suspend materials on acountry-by-country basis - but the lock-out could raise bigfreedom of speech issues in the US if the Germans ever get aroundto enforcing their onerous laws in the same manner, because manyright-wing US news groups would likely be deemed to beunacceptable.The freedom of speech issues are mitigated by the fact that anyGerman wanting to access the banned newsgroups can simply go invia an Internet access provider not operating in Germany.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETWORK BRIEFING via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996 NETSCAPE PROMISES THERE WILL BE "DOG-FIGHT" WITH MICROSOFTNetscape Communications Corp has promised a high-profile "dog-fight" as Microsoft Corp unwraps a dozen Internet-relatedproducts for what many are calling 'the platform of the future.'The day after Microsoft's wide-ranging Internet productannouncement last month (issue 204), Netscape CEO James Barksdaletold the Price Waterhouse software industry forum in RedwoodCity, California, "It will be a dog-fight, no doubt about it." Hedoubted, however, that Netscape would ever have the dominance ofthe Internet that Microsoft has of the operating system market:"We don't propose that we're ever going to be the 800-poundgorilla."But at Microsoft's launch the day before, CEO Bill Gates wascareful to avoid the name of the one company that leads mostInternet stories. "To write Microsoft out of the Internetequation, as many people have done, was pure lunacy," saidStephen Auditore, President of analyst firm, Zona Research Inc."More important than what was said at Microsoft's announcement,was what was not said - Netscape."Gates wants to use Microsoft's overwhelming dominance of theoperating system sector to become a leading player on theInternet. But Barksdale was not put out. "I think they(Microsoft) will have to win out on features and functionality,"he said, adding that Microsoft's operating system, whichdominates 80% of the world's computers, did not justify its claimto be able to command whole segments of the software industry."Most people are tired of being obligated, controlled by,licensed by and tied down to one company. It's a tough fight -I'll grant you that. But we're brave," he said, introducing apreviously unknown player: "We're well financed and we believethat God is on our side."Separately, Netscape has announced the first winners of its 'bugsbounty', a programme that rewards users who tell Netscape ofmajor faults in its software (odd that a company should soproudly boast its underachievement). A pair of software sleuths -Scott Weston from Australia, Paul Kocher from San Francisco -each won $1,000 for finding security gaps in Netscape Navigator.Weston found that Sun Microsystems Inc's on-line languageJavaScript could extract the history of a user's on-line session,including credit card information. Cryptography expert Kocherfound holes that would enable people to crack the Public Keyencryption by timing exactly how long each encryption was taking- a method known to reveal some encryption keys. Kocher iscurrently working with Netscape to help patch the fault.The bounty programme hastily followed September's successful hackinto the security code of the Navigator software, unearthingsupposedly secret credit card transactions. As a result of this,the company decided to offer cash to anyone who could come upwith similar bugs in test versions of Navigator 2.0.Thus far, Netscape claims the two winners are the only ones tocome up with significant security bugs, although it also awardedgifts to 50 other entrants for reporting other bugs. All knownbugs are now fixed, it claims. "By rewarding users for quicklyidentifying and reporting bugs back to us, this programme isencouraging what is perhaps the most extensive, open review ofbeta software in the industry," the company proudly boasted.Back to Headline List CopyrightNETWORK BRIEFING via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996 AOL PREPARES FOR ITS UK LAUNCHAmerica On-Line Inc is gearing up for its UK launch this monthwith prices low enough to give European Internet access providerscause for concern. The European service, christened AOL UK toavoid confusion with rivals UK Online and Europe Online, willundercut prices severely for infrequent users of the Internet.Exact prices are confidential, but the company claims they willbe lower than those in America, where customers pay no membershipfees, a monthly fee of $10 for five hours, and $3 for each hourthereafter. This compares with prices among UK providers of #10to #15 a month, many of which charge a flat start-up fee of up to#50.But CityScape Ltd's managing director, Clive Feather, who charges#50 start-up, #15 a month for unlimited access and 1Mb of Webspace for subscribers, does not worry about AOL UK. "People onlyneed to use the Internet for 10 hours a month to make theseprices comparable to ours," he said. "Our studies suggest peoplespend an hour a day on the Net."AOL UK disagrees, suggesting an average of seven hours a month,although it admitted to some accounts spending up to $1,500. "Wehave our own therapy groups on AOL," said a spokesperson. Amerger of proprietary services, such as CompuServe Inc, with theunregulated Internet is the future for on-line customers,according to newly installed AOL UK md, Jonathan Bulkeley. "We'realready the largest Internet provider in the world," he said,alluding to the four million subscribers who have access to theWorld Wide Web through the AOL browser - or any other. "If youdon't like our browser, use someone else's," said Bulkeley.In line with its US founder, AOL UK will target consumersexclusively - "it is not our intention to target businesses,"said Bulkeley - with a completely re-vamped interface for Europeincluding the voice of actress Joanna Lumley and the ability forconsumers to publish their own pages with AOL UK's own publishersoftware, NaviSoft.

Thisreport projects that the value of the industry's output in1990 will rise 5.7% over the previous year to reach nearly23.98 trillion yen. A breakdown by product category showsthat industrial electronic equipment production is expectedto expand 9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen, and will playleading role in the overall growth of production. In termsof value, this market will account for half of theelectronic industry's total output. Production ofelectronic components and devices is expected to rise 3%,to 7.83 trillion yen, though the rate of growth will belower than last year's. The forecast for consumerelectronic equipment shows production edging up only aslight 0.9%, to just u nder 4.20 trillion yen.    Total production of the electronics industry in 1989 isestimated at 22.68 trillion yen, a gain of 6.7%on the year. Meanwhile, the consumer electronic equipmentsector and general electronic components sector are notexpected to show such rosy results compared with theforecasts made a year ago. But thanks to the growth seenfor industrial electronic equipment and semiconductors,the overall output of the industry in 1989 is estimated toexpand pretty much as initially forecast.    An outline of the 1989 production estimates and 1990forecasts for the,electronics  industry is given below.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW ERA: JAPAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 19901989 Production Estimates+      The Japanese economy sustained steady growth in1989, supported by increased capital investment in theprivate sector and strong consumer spending. The U.S. andEuropean economies also continued to expand, but at aslower pace. With this economic environment as a backdrop,the output of the Japanese electronics industry showedrobust growth.     Looking at individual product segments, production ofindustrial electronic equipment is estimated at 10.92trillion yen, an increase of 10.2%, which reflects vigorouscapital spending. This segment is now approaching an 11trillion yen  market in annual terms. The main drivingforce behind the expansion in this sector is thedouble-digit growth seen for computer equipment includingoffice and personal computers. Production of electroniccomponents and devices is estimated at 7.6 trillion yen,a rise of 7.5% over 1988. This figure reflects sluggishdemand, from consumer electronic equipment manufactures,despite the growth in sales of components for industrialelectronic equipment and for new multi-function,compact product offerings. Production of consumerelectronic equipment is estimated at 4.16 trillion yen, adrop of 2.4% from the previous year's level. This declineis due to the downturn in domestic demand, which had shownfavorable expansion in previous years, and to increasedoffshore production volumes by Japanese manufacturers. Forthe first time ever, consumer electronic equipment isexpected to account for less than 20% of the electronicindustry's total output.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW ERA: JAPAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 19901990 Production Outlook+     The annual output of the electronics industry isprojected to rise 5.7%, to nearly 23.98 yen.     Projections made for individual product sectorsindicate that industrial electronic equipment will onceagain be the leading factor behind the industry's expandingoutput. Production in this sector is projected to climb9.4%, to 11.95 trillion yen. This increase reflectsvigorous capital investment plans for information systems,including computers and communications equipment.     Production of electronic components anddevices is expected to stand at 7.83 trillion yen, asthe annual growth rate drops off to 3.0%. Thisslowdown is attributed to the bottoming out ofthe growth rate for semiconductors and toincreased production of electronic equipmentoverseas. These factors will more than offset thecontinued expansion of demand for industrialelectronic equipment components, the growingrange of component applications and launches ofhigh value-added products.    Consumer electronic equipment production isexpected to remain almost flat, edging up only bydeveloping new products that are tailored to 0.9%, to4.20 trillion yen. This minuscule growth the needs ofconsumers and serve to enrich their projection reflects thecontinuation of expanding imports and sluggish exports dueto rising production volumes overseas, as well as theabsence of any factors that could substantially boostdomestic output. Bright spots in the outlook are expectedto include the growing popularity in the domesticmarket of new products, such as camcorders and video diskplayers and expanding demand both at home and abroad forhigh value-added products.     The supply-and-demand structure in the globalelectronics industry is gradually being transformedworldwide. Some of the factors at work here include therising offshore production volumes of Japanesemanufacturers, the growth of competitors in the newlyindustrializing economies (NIEs) of Asia and the stepsbeing taken to cope with integration of the EC market in1992. Amidst these changes, the production system in thedomestic market is also undergoing a period of transition.While future growth is expected in all product segments, itis projected that growth differences among various marketsectors will become more obvious in 1990's productionfigures.    The following is an outline of the forecasts made forindividual product segments.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW ERA: JAPAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 19901990 Production outlook -2- +(1) Consumer electronic equipment     In the domestic market for consumer electronicequipment, steady growth is expected for video equipmentowing to the spreading popularity of such new media assatellite and high-definition broadcasting and video diskplayers. Products like camcorders and CD players, whichincorporate state-of-the-art technologies, are alsoprojected to show strong advances. Offsetting these growthfactors will be a gradual decline in exports due tothe continued expansion of production overseas. As aresult, output of consumer electronic equipment is expectedto edge up only a slight 0.9%, to 4.2 trillion yen.Although worldwide demand for high value-added productswill continue to advance, and there are numerous productswith excellent growth potential, these factors will notbe strong enough to boost production in the domesticmarket.     Domestic production of consumer electronic equipmentis now at a major turning point as a result of theexpanding offshore production volumes of Japanesemanufacturers. An important challenge facing the Japaneseelectronics industry in the years ahead will be tostimulate demand by developing ne products that aretailored to the needs of consumers and serve to enrichtheir lifestyles.(2) Industrial electronic equipment     The 1990 forecast for industrial electronicequipment calls for production to rise 9.4%, to 11.95trillion yen.  The projections made individual categoriesare outlined below.     1)Radio communications systems          Output of radio communications systems in1990 is expected to increase 11.1%, to 987.7 billion yen.Backed mainly by strong domestic demand, this increase willexceed 1989's growth rate. Private-sector demand for radiocommunications equipment is projected to show double-digitgrowth, reflecting strong demand for car telephones, pocketpagers and terminal equipment, as well as the increaseddemand for base stations. Moreover, the launching ofprivate-sector communications satellites (JC-SAT andSuperbird) will usher in an era of full-fledged satellitecommunications.   This is expected to stimulate increaseddemand for satellite communications equipment in certainbusinesses, including the education field, and also amongcable TV companies for the supply of programming. Strongdemand for radio communications systems is also expectedfrom the government sector, particularly from the DefenseAgency.          Production of mobile communications equipment forvehicles is projected to rise 19.3%, to 177.8billion yen. This segment is expected to see the startup ofnew cellular telephone companies in the Tohoku, Hokurikuand Hokkaido regions, intensifying competition with NTTover car telephone services and rates. This should lead toa more active car telephone market and further penetrationof car telephone services. The MCA radio communicationssector is presently facing a line capacity shortage in theTokyo metropolitan area and a new system operating in thequasimicrowave bandwidth is scheduled to be implemented in 1990.          Demand for marine communications equipment isexpected from the merchant shipping and shipbuildingindustries as a result of increased cargo movement due tothe economic upturn.  While demand from the Defense Agencyis projected to drop off gradually, other governmentagencies are expected to place new and replacement ordersfor experimental and training vessels. As a result, theoutput of marine communications equipment is projected toincrease 4.8%, to 24.1 billion yen.          Stable demand is forecast for aircraftcommunications equipment, centering on the Mid TermDefense Program of the Defense Agency.          Production of radio application equipment isexpected to advance steadily to 285.8 billion yen, up 11%over 1989, reflecting strong demand from the New KansaiInternational Airport project, in addition to orders fromthe Ministry of Transport and other government agencies.     2)Electronic application equipment          The forecast calls for electronic applicationequipment production to increase 11.3%, to nearly 7.3trillion yen. Within this sector, output of computers andrelated equipment is expected to reach 6.36 trillion yen,up 11.6%, about the same growth rate as In 1989. Thisincrease will be supported by continued active demand forpersonal and office computers and other core products.          Production of TV monitors for industrial use isexpected to show a 12% rise, climbing to 136.7 billion yen.Supporting this growth will be a double-digit increase indomestic demand for monitors used in supervisionapplications (e.g. traffic control systems, productionlines, financial institutions and retail stores) and ininspection and measurement applications (e.g. automation ofvisual inspection systems and dimension and profilemeasurement systems). Output of ultrasonic applicationequipment is projected to climb to 181.9 billion yen, afavorable advance of 10.8%, centering around medicalequipment demand.     3) Electric measuring instrumentation     The 1990 forecast for electric measuringinstrumentation production calls for a firm gain of 7.2%,with output rising to 698.2 billion yen. Oscilloscopes areexpected to register double-digit growth supported by anincrease in more sophisticated models as a result of thefurther penetration of digital oscilloscopes and thedevelopment of new office automation and factory automationequipment. However, due to the bottoming out of growth inthe semiconductor sector in 1990, demand is expected to besluggish for electronic tubes, semiconductors and ICmeasuring devices, which, together, account forapproximately 30% of the electric measuring instrumentationmarket. As a result, this market will slip to single-digitgrowth in contrast to its double-digit expansion in 1989.     4) Electronic business machines     Production of electronic business machines is expectedto rise 6.2%, to 1.08 trillion yen, led mainly by continuedstrong demand in the domestic market.     Electronic calculators are projected to show continueddouble-digit   growth, sustained by product offeringsfeaturing expanded functions, such as electronic memobooks, and by consumer preferences for more sophisticatedproducts.     Word processor output is expected to show favorablegrowth, buoyed by firm domestic demand. Copy machineproduction is projected to grow favorably overall. Ordersin the domestic market are likely to rise as a result ofincreased demand from small and medium-sized businessesand replacement demand stemming from the shift to highergrade models. This will be offset, however, by slowerexport growth as Japanese manufacturers expand theiroffshore production volumes. Production of cash registersis forecast to show solid growth, supported primarily bydemand for point of sale terminals, as the special demandfor new equipment capable of handling sales taxcomputations has run its course.(3) Electronic components     The 1990 forecast for electronic components calls forproduction to rise 2.9% over the previous year, to 3.29trillion yen. Demand is expected to remain strong forcomponents used in industrial electronic equipment, suchas office automation, information processing andcommunications systems. A key point in this segment will bewhether the introduction of new products can rejuvenatedemand in the video and audio equipment markets.      Passive component production is projected to show asmall 2.6% increase, rising to 1.24 trillion yen. Furtheradvances are expected for highdensity surface-mountedequipment and composition technologies, in response tochanging equipment needs. Manufacturers will be workingto concentrate technologies, enhance reliability,diversify product lines and create higher valueaddedproducts.     Production of functional components is expected toregister a slight gain of 1.7%, rising to 416.4 billionyen. The forecast for mechanical component production callsfor continued solid growth, with output rising 4.7%, to1.07 trillion yen.(4) Active devices     The 1990 production forecast for active devices showsa rise of 2.2%, with output advancing to 4.35 trillion yen.Semiconductors, which account for nearly 80% of thismarket, have tended so far to show a four-year growthcycle. Based on past experience, 1990 is expected to be theyear when active device production bottoms out.     In the macroeconomic picture for 1990, the U.S.economy is expected to experience a soft landing, whiledomestic demand remains strong in Japan. As a result, aperiod of moderate adjustment is foreseen, with a downwardtrend overall. The production trend for active componentsis expected to follow this basic pattern, as a shallowbottoming out is projected to occur in mid-1990, followedby an upturn during the second half of the year.     In the electronic tubes category, domestic productionis expected to shift from cathode-ray tubes for colortelevisions (CRTS) to cathode-ray tubes for color displays(CDTs). Output of the former tubes is expected to decline,owing to expanding offshore production volumes of Japanesemanufacturers and growing competition with the Asian NIES,while production of the latter tubes is projected to showsteady growth due to the increase in high value-addedproducts. Production of display tubes, which has continuedto show relatively high growth, is expected to sustaindouble-digit expansion, supported by solid demand forindustrial electronic equipment and the widening range ofapplications for these tubes. As a result, output ofelectronic tubes in 1990 is expected to remain firm,registering a slight increase of 0.9%, to 684.5 billionyen.     Discrete semiconductor devices are projected to show aproduction gain of 1.8%, rising to 665.3 billion yen. Thisforecast reflects a slowdown in demand for consumerelectronic equipment, which should be partially offset byfavorable demand in the industrial electronic equipmentmarket.     Production of semiconductor ICs is forecast. at2.75 trillion yen, up 2.4%, but sharply off from the 18.7%growth rate in 1989. While output is not likely to decline,1990 is seen as being a period of moderate adjustment.     MOS digital ICs are projected to show sluggishproduction expansion, rising only 2.9% in 1990, far belowthe 1989 growth level of 28.2%. Demand should be stimulatedby the introduction of more sophisticated microcomputerICs, such as 32-bit, high-speed, multi-gate devices, andhigher valuueadded memory products, including faster, morehighly integrated devices. However, the market as a wholeis expected to grow slowly because of uncertaintiesregarding the supply-and-demand balance and future marketconditions.     Output of hybrid ICs is projected to grow steadily in1990 to 252.5 billion yen, an increase of 5.4% over 1989.Because of the nature of custom-made products, demand isnot expected to be influenced significantly by overallmarket conditions.     Production of liquid crystal devices is pro jected toshow strong growth of 27.7%, climbing to 185.6 billion yen.This favorable expansion will be supported by the rapidshift from watch and calculator applications to large LCDsfor personal computers, word processors and other products.Another supporting factor will be the growing demand forcolor LCD devices.                                           (No. 103. 1 - 1)Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW ERA: JAPAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INTRODUCTION OF THREE NEW DIGITAL RADIO SYSTEMS+    -- Technical Requirements for Introduction ofthree New Digital Radio Systems --On January 22, the Telecommunications Technol-ogy Council (TTC) submitted its final report tothe Ministry of Posts and Telecommunicationsconcerning "Technical Requirements for FixedDigital Microwave Radio Networks". The reportrecommends the introduction of three new sys-tems: a medium-capacity systqm that providesincreased circuit capacity for public service net-works, a system for telecommunications enter-prises that uses the existing submicrowave band,and a new small-capacity system to replace thecurrent public service system.       Microwave radio is used for private communi-cation, by national and municipal self-governingbodies and public   institutions for disaster preven-tion and maintenance of public order, and by commercialentities for provision of electric power, gas and railwaycommunications. At present, public service have practicaluse of up to the telephone circuit equivalent of 576channels. However, in order to respond to the recent rapidincrease in amounts of information transmitted and theneed for image transmission due to integration of socialactivities and the developing information society, theintroduction of a new radio system that provides about 1.5times larger capacity than the existing system is desired.      In addition, due to the rapid increase in demand formobile communication, as well as for car telephone service,there is a significant shortage of available frequenciesfor mobile communication service, so use of part of thesubmicrowave band (2 GHz band) is being considered formobile communication service. Therefore, it has becomenecessary to sequentially shift the small-capacity,fixed circuits used for telecommunication service andpublic service in the submicrowave band to higherfrequencies. For these reasons, the TeleommunicationsTechnology Council concluded in its final report that thetechnical requirements for introduction of three newsystems should be as listed in Table 1.      For telecommunication service use, however, alarge-capacity digital radio system that utilizes theworld's first 256 quadrature amplitude modulation system,an epoch making technology developed by NTT, has been inoperation since December of last year.

(Total subscriptionsfor the 30 new pocket pager companies: 1.05 million.)      NTT's pocket pager service started in the 23  wardsof Tokyo in July 1968, was extended to Osaka in 1969, andto Nagoya and Yokohama in 1970. At present, it is availablein most cities throughout Japan.     The number of pocket pager subscriptions  exceeded 0.5million in FY '75, reached 1 million in FY '80, passed 2million in FY '85, then broke the 3 million level at theend of December last year.      Introduction of new services included the  start ofdual-call service in 1982, numeric-display pocket pagers inApril 1987, and fixed-statement display, pen-type andcard-type pagers in December 1988. There have also beenreductions in usage charges and deposits. In addition.NTT had been developing various new services, such asmulti-area service, since November of last year.     A breakdown of the 3 million subscriptions shows thatabout two thirds of them are for "call only" (tone-only)service, but there has recently been a significant increasein the number of subscriptions for numeric-display andpen-type pagers.      NTT is planning to reduce its monthly charges forpocket pager service on March 1 of this year. Charges fortone-only service will be reduced from 2,500 yen to 2,000yen, for numeric-display service from 2,900 yen to 2,600yen, and fixedstatement-display service from 3,300 yen to2,900 yen. In addition, those subscribers with contractsfor 31 or more units, will no longer have to pay a  depositfor the 31st and succeeding sets. The monthly charge fordual-call service will be reduced to 100 yen from thecurrent 250 yen, and from 1,700 yen to 1,400 yen forportable receivers.Back to Headline List CopyrightNEW ERA: JAPAN via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1990NTT to Purchase Base Station Transmitters for Pocket Paging Service from Quintron of the U.S.+      On February 5, NTT announced that it will  purchasebase station transmitters for radio paging service fromQuintron Corporation of the U.S., marking the first timefor the company to buy pocket paging service equipment froma foreign source.

NTT has been conducting research on optical fiberamplifiers to enable direct amplification of opticalsignals through the use of optical fiber injected witherbium (erbium-doped fiber). Thus, NTT's prototype systemuses erbium-doped fiber manufactured using vapor-phaseaxial deposition (VAD) technology developed by NTT forproduction of low-loss optical fiber and a newly devel-oped semiconductor laser to supply energy to the opticalfiber amplifier. The volume of the prototype device is 36cc, which is about one third the size of a pack ofcigarettes.     When this amplifier is put to practical use, it caneasily be set up in a narrow space, such as inside opticaltransmission equipment or optical relay devices. It is alsoexpected to contribute significantly to the extending ofrelay distance and to the increasing of transmission speedto the ultrahigh-speed range. With its broad generalpurpose capabilities, this amplifier should have a wideapplication range, including CATV and various opticalmeasuring installations.     NTT has already succeeded in doubling the repeaterspacing (to 212 kilometers) of its current opticaltransmission system using an optical fiber amplifier at 1.8Gb/s, which proves the effectiveness of optical fiberamplifiers.

According to the agreements, both BT and MCI will setup digital voice switching devices (ICXs), which KDD wasthe first in the world to develop, as their core facilitiesfor this service. The ICX is a switching system thatprovides for various  type of communication, such asfacsimile and voice communication, as well as messagecommunication. The system enables construction of aneconomical international incompany communication networkthat can easily and quickly respond to user demand usingfacilities installed in KDD, BT and MCI, without thePort-PLAN user being required to posses related facilitiesnormally required for an international communicationnetwork.     Port-PLAN is a ready-made network service thatutilizes a previously established KDD leased circuitservice in response to user's demand, and was started onAugust 1, 1989.     Until now, in order to utilize Port-PLAN, the user hadto provide his own facilities on the overseas side.Now, however, the offering of PortPLAN by BT and MCI makesit possible for the application of a global network thatintegrates various communication media in three countries(Japan, England and the U.S.A.). In addition, maintenanceof the network is provided on a 24 hour basis for thehighest reliability.     The leased system that is the core for the networkprovides individual ports and trunks by media, includingvoice, facsimile, data and teletype, with each leasedsystem connected by high-speed digital leased circuits(Hi-BITLINK), which has extremely high reliability. Userscan easily and quickly construct a leased network just byconnection through a domestic circuit to the center facil-ity in each country. In addition, the system can flexiblyrespond to an increase or decrease in the amount Ofcommunication handled , or expand/update the networkconfiguration just by changing ports or trunks, thusallowing users to apply the communication system that mosteconomically merits their demand.

The new radiosystem gives the central earth stations the capabil-ity to transmit both video and data signals, as wellas increasing maintainability.    The system is capable of transmitting multiplecarrier data signals and a broadband video signal atthe same time, so it is expected to have positiveeffect on the promotion and diffusion of satellite-based multimedia communication networks, whichare considered to have serious potential in thefuture. Until now, it has been necessary to transmitand receive the two types of signals using separatesystems.    The satellite communication central earthstation provides the core functions for the datacommunication network and controls the network,which is composed of multiple VSATS. Therefore,the equipment used must provide high perform-ance and be highly reliable. Recently, there hasalso been increasing demand for reduction ofrequired installation space. That is, what isrequired now is a more compact system withincreased maintainability.    The same is true for satellite-based multi-media communication networks. That is, construc-tion of such a system requires development ofa small earth station capable of transmitting bothmultiple carrier data signals and a broadband videosignals.    Matsushita's new system has been developedin response to these requirements. Its primaryfeatures include (1) a compact system with excel-lent maintainability that can be set up andoperated in simple mini-shelters. (2) capabilityto simultaneously transmit both data and videosignals for construction of a multimedia communi-cation network, and (3) a future-oriented designthat provides flexible system configuration andhigh performance capable of sending high-defini-tion TV signals. The system is expected to findsignificant application of these features in (1)central earth stations for VSAT data communica-tion   networks,    (2) central earth stations forsatellite news gathering (SNG), and (3) satellitecommunication entral earth stations for variousprivate networks.

Someimportant questions are being raised:"What is the relationship between ATM services and the carriers'pre-broadband SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) andframe relay services?""Who will be the leaders in the ATM market?""What is the relationship between private and public ATM?"Answering the first of these questions is made more difficult by theinsistence, in most discussions of ATM, that ATM is one thing whenit really is two.  ATM is a switch/multiplexing technology that maybe deployed in the central office or on customer premises.  ATM isalso a future service provided by a carrier.  As a service, ATMprovides access to an ATM switch-ing/multiplexing fabric in muchthe same way that ISDN provides access to an Nx64 Time-DivisionMultiplexed (TDM) switching fabric.As a switching/multiplexing technology there is no conflict betweenATM, on the one hand, and frame relay and SMDS, on the other.On the contrary, ATM switches are the ideal switching technologyto underpin frame relay or SMDS.  StrataCom, the company thatpioneered frame relay switches, is well advanced in transitioning itsnon-standard cell-based switches to ATM, for example.  But as aservice, ATM is a potential serious rival to SMDS and frame relay.Even at this early stage of ATM development, this rivalry isbecoming apparent.  Sprint won its ATM service contract with theDepartment of Energy and the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration in competition with AT&T and MCI, both of whichapparently planned to service the contract with SMDS or somethinglike it (see separate story).And the overlap between ATM and earlier services has becomegreater because of the recent specification by the ATM Forumwhich includes a DS-3 (45 Mbps) interface to ATM.  Previously, theonly standard interfaces to ATM were the CCITT's OC-3 (155Mbps) and OC-12 (620 Mbps) interfaces defined for the ATMLayer of Broadband ISDN.OC-3 and OC-12 are overkill for today's wide-area networkapplications.  DS-3 is about right.  SMDS also works at rates up toDS-3.  In fact, the ATM Forum's DS-3 interface and the SMDSinterface both borrow heavily from the work done for the IEEE's802.6 Metropolitan Area Network.  Frame relay still operates atrates of DS-1 and below, but BT North America (and perhaps othercarriers) may force frame relay up to DS-3.DS-3 SMDS and "native" ATM services operating at DS-3 rateshave a lot in common.  But it remains unclear how well SMDSwould support applications involving real-time voice and/or real-time video.  There probably would be no major problem withrunning voice/video over SMDS, but SMDS is being marketedprimarily as a data-oriented LAN (local area network)internetworking service, while ATM specifically was designed tosupport virtually every kind of communications mode.  Many peoplebelieve that multimedia communications--a combination of voice,text, still-image, animation, and full-motion video--will be the "killerapplication" for ATM.Sprint is well positioned to exploit the multimedia-over-ATMopportunity.  Not only will it be supplying the Energy Departmentand NASA with ATM services, but it is also a major participant inthe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's MAGIC testbed.  Here Sprint will supply ATM backbone service for avisualization application (visualization networking has many of thesame characteristics as multimedia).Finally, Sprint is the market leader in the videoconferencing servicesbusiness.  And videoconferencing may well emerge as a vitalcomponent of multimedia.But the die is not yet cast.  MCI and AT&T have well-advancedbroadband plans, although ATM does not seem to be as central totheir plans as to Sprint's.  WilTel, on the other hand, has alwayssaid that it wants to have an ATM backbone in place by 1993, andWilTel's role may take on new significance if it forms a relationshipwith British Telecom as expected.  Also, at the time of writing, theSprint DOE/NASA contract was not absolutely finalized.  So,Sprint's ATM lead still could be lost.The ATM-based public carrier switch market is wide open.  Of thethree major central office switch vendors--AT&T, NorthernTelecom, and Siemens Stromberg-Carlson--none has yet toannounce the availability of a full-scale ATM central office switch.In fact, the nearest thing to an ATM central office switch these daysis Fujitsu's FETEX-150.Fujitsu never has had a presence in the U.S. central office switchmarket, but it has used its early adoption of ATM to leverage theFETEX-150 into several important broadband trials--including U SWEST's COMPASS trial, which some believe will help set thepattern for future Bell company broadband switch purchases.  TheFETEX-150 is also in trials with BellSouth and NYNEX.  A coupleof months back, NYNEX installed a FETEX-150 in its R&D lab,claiming that it had the "world's first hybrid/ATM fabric."It seems that almost every telecommunications equipment andcomputer company has plans for an ATM product of some kind.There are lots of plans, but few products.  And, of course, most ofthe products are aimed at private networks rather than the publiccarriers' networks, which brings us to the final question raised at thebeginning of this article:  What will be the relationship betweenATM equipment in the public network and ATM elements inprivate networks?ATM began as a technology for public networks--the transporttechnology for broadband ISDN.  Now, however, it is believed thatATM will find its first commercial applications in multimedia LANsand in private network hubs.  The truth is that ATM probablysimultaneously will start to appear in islands in all segments of thenetwork, with public data carriers accounting for a significant sliceof ATM activity.But despite all the fuss about ATM and promises of ATM productsand services, the fact is that ATM in any form is still not quite hereas a widely available commercial reality.  That will not happen until1993.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992SPRINT WINS $50,000,000 CONTRACT TO UPGRADEENERGY, NASA RESEARCH NETWORKS TO ATMThe Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration have selected Sprint Corp. to provide broadbandcommunications services needed to upgrade three of their nationalresearch data networks to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)technology.  Estimated to be worth more than $50,000,000 over thenext five years, the contract makes Sprint the first carrier to providewide-area ATM service, DoE said.Slated for the upgrade are DoE's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet),and NASA's AEROnet and Science Internet systems.  Thesenetworks provide high-speed, nationwide, and international datacommunications to support various open research and educationalprograms in energy, aeronautics, space, and earth science.ATM service will be provided to the ESnet on an "early availability"basis, while it generally is "not expected to be widely commerciallyavailable before 1994," Sprint said.  The activity is funded under thefederal High-Performance Computing and CommunicationsProgram.  Working with Sprint on the contract is TRW of RedondoBeach, Calif., which will provide new broadband access switchesdeveloped by its Space Communications Division; Cisco Systems ofMenlo Park, Calif., a manufacturer of network routers; and DigitalEquipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992BELLCORE ISSUES ATM/BROADBAND ISDNGENERIC REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTS FOR COMMENTPublic network deployment of Asynchronous Transfer Mode(ATM)/broadband integrated service digital network (BISDN)capabilities came another step closer with Bell CommunicationsResearch's issuance of three technical advisories.  It releaseddocuments on "broadband switching system generic criteria" (TA-NWT-001110); "broadband ISDN physical interface specifications"(TA-NWT-001112); and "broadband ISDN transfer protocol genericcriteria" (TA-NWT-001113).The first document describes the telecommunications switchingsystem capabilities required, including user and network interfaces,internetworking, services supported, operations functions, usageparameter control, and performance.  The second proposes thegeneric requirements for the BISDN user-to-network interface andthe network-to-network interface.  And the third provides proposedgeneric requirements on how information is carried through theBISDN network.  It focuses on services provided by each layer ofthe protocol, functions performed to provide these services, andinteractions between functions.The advisories are being circulated for industry comment beforebeing finalized as Bellcore Technical References, and Bellcoreexpects that work will continue into next year.  Steve Walters,Bellcore's BISDN project manager, said that the advisories "are acritical step in BISDN deployment in that they contain genericrequirements needed by suppliers so they can build initial BISDNnetwork equipment."Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992FRAME RELAY FORUM RATIFIES NETWORK-TO-NETWORK INTERFACE; SPRINT's TAFFEL IS NEW HEAD OF FORUMThe Frame Relay Forum has ratified a network-to-network interface(NNI) implementation agreement for permanent virtual circuit(PVC)-based frame relay networks.  "The effect of this milestoneagreement will be to extend the geographic reach of frame relaynetworking by permitting both public-to-public as well as private-to-public network interconnections," said Alan Taffel, the forum's newPresident and Chairman.  Mr. Taffel, Director-product marketing atSprint Corp., succeeds Thomas H. Jones, formerly of Netrix Corp.Mr. Jones recently resigned his forum post when he left Netrix tobecome Vice President-marketing for Microdyne Corp., which is nota member of the forum.The NNI agreement is based upon a similar user-to-networkinterface (UNI) implementation pact approved by the forum earlierthis year.  "The NNI agreement, however, addresses new areas suchas bi-directional procedures for PVC management signaling andcongestion control," the forum noted.  The agreement now will beforwarded to the Open Systems Interconnection Implementor'sWorkshop (OIW), including the OIW's Asian and European arms,for ratification.  It also will be submitted for inclusion in theGovernment Open Systems Interconnection Profile, as was donepreviously for the UNI agreement.  According to the Frame RelayForum, this approach "is likely to be followed by other industryforums, such as the ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) Forum."Meanwhile, the Frame Relay Forum's Technical Committee hasgenerated draft implementation agreements on multiprotocolinterconnection over frame relay and on switched virtual circuitframe relay services.  Earlier, a service description for frame relaymulticast was developed.The forum is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting theacceptance and implementation of frame relay based on nationaland international standards.While the forum is not a standards-making body, its technicalcommittees provide liaison with the standards bodies.The forum just established two new chapters--one based in Rennes,France (for Europe) and one headquartered in New South Wales(for Australia).  There are plans to form a chapter in Asia.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992MFS PRESIDENT SEES FCC's EXPANDEDINTERCONNECTION DECISIONAS `ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK' FOR DISMANTLINGLOCAL TELCO MONOPOLY(At its open meeting Sept, 17, the FCC took several actions that willhasten the end of the local exchange monopoly in the U.S.  Thecenterpiece of its package of decisions was the adoption of rulesallowing telco competitors and users to physically collocate theirtransmission equipment in telco central offices.  The FCC said thatinterconnectors and local telcos would be free to negotiate "virtual"collocation agreements as well.  Telcos were directed to file tariffsoutlining all terms of their special access interconnections, includingcharges.  Interconnection for switched transport is being consideredin a separate FCC proceeding.In an interview at TDR's offices the same week, the head of acompetitive access provider that had urged the FCC to look into thematter discussed the competitive era emerging.)While MFS Communications Co., Inc., President Royce J. Hollanddid not expect a "perfect" FCC decision on expandedinterconnection with local telco facilities, he views the agency'srecent decision as an "essential building block" for dismantling the"$90 billion local exchange monopoly."  Mr. Holland, who also isPresident and Chief Executive Officer of MFS, Inc., described theregulatory process as "analog," not "digital"; he explained thatchanges in the system are "incremental rather than all at once."He predicted a "five- to eight- or nine-year" period before theoutstanding major issues would be resolved and the breakup of thelocal loop monopoly would occur.  He likened the natural monopolyor franchise concept to the Berlin Wall, which was built to keeppeople in as well as out.  "Modern telecommunications should notlook like the old East Germany," he said."We're getting a lot of inquiries today about customized networksolutions throughout metropolitan areas," Mr. Holland said.  "This isprimarily for data transmission, to link workstations and PCs withmainframes, to link workstations together, for shooting images anddata back and forth across town.  In other words, we're talkingabout replacing the automobile as a vehicle for transmission with ahigh-speed link.  With interconnection, we can provide that one-stopshopping to a particular business."For example, he said, suppose there is a business with itsheadquarters in downtown Chicago, a high-speed data center in theO'Hare airport area, and three regional offices in Evanston, Joliet,and St. Charles.  Today, MFS would be able to serve only theheadquarters and the data center with its fiber optic network.  Butwith interconnection authority, MFS could add the three "remote"sites.In other words, the company would be able to interconnect thesesites with the Bell company in the serving wire center for eachlocation, lease DS1 channel termination circuits from the Bellcompany, install its own routers on the customer's premises, andallow the customer to access the mainframes and work stationselsewhere, Mr. Holland said.  He promised that the company's MFSDatanet, Inc., subsidiary soon would begin making announcementsregarding high-speed data projects.Mr. Holland noted a "changing perception" in the industry, wherebylocal telecommunications services "are being regarded as strategicand tactical weapons for businesses to gain competitive advantages."Several MFS customers, in fact, are employing "unique" imageprocessing and other high-speed data applications for services suchas Ethernet and Token-Ring channel extensions, he said.  But headded that confidentiality agreements prohibit him from disclosingmore details.He noted that MFS's goal is not to be the "second telephonecompany."  Rather, the company's objective is to become the"leading nationwide provider of voice, data, and video services tobusinesses, government, and professional organizations," he said.He did not see MFS's role as analogous to that of MCITelecommunications Corp. vis-a-vis AT&T.  He saw it more likethat of IBM Corp. and Electronic Data Systems in relation to theindustry.  "We're more on the trunk side of the PBX than the lineside," he said, adding that the role of the "second phone company" isbetter played by the cable TV industry, which primarily servesresidences rather than businesses.The authority to interconnect to local exchange carrier (LEC)facilities means "significantly expanded competition for specialaccess" services and "LATA-wide ubiquity" in the 14 metropolitanmarkets that MFS currently serves, Mr. Holland said.  He notedthat these "first-tier" cities include the nation's 10 largest specialaccess and private line markets.But with interconnection authority, MFS could justify expanding itsfacilities and even "start looking at second-tier cities" such asNashville, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix, Mr. Holland said.  "Withinterconnection," he explained, "all of a sudden, you now haveLATA-wide ubiquity.  And now you can actually go out and addressthe total market and phase in your network as you get marketshare."Without interconnection, however, only the largest markets willenjoy the benefits of competition, he said.  "In fact, if you werestarting from scratch in the CAP (competitive access provider)business today, you'd want to count the number of stock exchangesin a city.  That probably is directly related to the volume of specialaccess circuits and local private lines--which is probably as good anindicator (of market potential) as any," he explained.Despite the emphasis on large metropolitan areas, MFS has notdivorced itself from what might be called "third-tier" markets servedby small independent telephone companies.One of MFS's customers is the Minnesota Equal Access Network, agroup of independent telcos that is establishing a network that"basically bypasses U S WEST," Mr. Holland said.  "What we do ona city-wide scale, independents are doing on a statewide scale," headded.He said that MFS is involved in discussions with a number ofindependents--"especially those near metropolitan areas that areinterested in using our services to get downtown."  He explainedthat MFS already is providing a certain group of independents with"diverse fiber routing from their territory" to a certain metro area.But he said he could not disclose details because the partiesinvolved were not ready to make an announcement.  He believedthat CAPs and independents are "natural allies" because both have a"difficult time" dealing with the Bell companies.Pointing to a Connecticut Research study, Mr. Holland said that1992 CAP revenues are estimated to be approximately $250,000,000.MFS is "about half the industry; we're going to do $125,000,000 thisyear," he said.  He added that MFS's investment totals $250,000,000--"again about half the industry."  The other half of the CAP industryincludes cable TV companies (approximately 40%) and small,regional CAPs (5%-10%).  Titled "Alternate Local Transport:  ATotal Industry Report," the Connecticut Research study projectsthat CAP revenues will reach $1.2 billion by 1995.  Contact DickTomlinson at 203/659-0009.Mr. Holland said he believes that MFS can maintain its share of theCAP industry because it has the financial resources, can supportnew product development, and has high standards for its ownnetwork.  Following interconnection authority for CAPs, a relativelyrapid resolution of local dial-tone, switched access, interLATA toll,and number portability issues is likely, he predicted.  By the end ofthe decade, he predicted that all of the local exchange market wouldbe deregulated, competitive access would be a multibillion-dollarindustry, and CAPs would have a 35% share of the market.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992FOCUS ON USERSSURVEY SHOWS USE OF MULTIPLE LANs IS UP 30%,BUT SPENDING FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS REMAINSFLATWhile the installation of local area networks has increaseddramatically during the past year, overall spending ontelecommunications has been flat, a survey of nearly 800 NorthAmerican business and government telecom users has shown.  Thetn726fourth annual survey, conducted by Deloitte & Touche'sTelecommunications Group, revealed that more than 90% of therespondents' organizations now have multiple LANs installed,compared to 60% a year ago.Communications managers cited "network management" as the mostimportant technical issue they face today.  Networks are expanding,reflecting the consolidation of separate networks and the merger ofcompanies into single, large entities.  In addition, singledepartments with corporate-wide telecom responsibilities are beingcreated.The survey showed that telecom spending as a percentage ofrevenue increased from 3% to 7%, depending upon the industry,but that actual telecom expenditures generally remained constant,increasing an average of 1.2% in 1991 across all industries.Telecom spending in the government and financial services sectorsincreased the most, 11%.  The manufacturing, services, and retailindustries decreased their telecom spending by an average of 9%.Operating budgets for telecommunications averaged about 4.5 timesthe capital budget across all industries, up from 4 times in 1991.Salaries and personnel costs, the single largest budget component,accounted for 27% of operating budgets.  Long distance, leased line,and local access charges collectively accounted for 45%.  Twice asmany respondents--30%--reported having international responsibilityand coverage as in previous years.Marco Bonilla, a partner in Deloitte & Touche's telecom practice,said that "Despite the fact that 39% of the respondents indicatedthat they had investigated enterprise-wide network managementproducts, not one, single enterprise network management systemcurrently exists among the responding companies."  According to thesurvey, 88% of the respondents have one or more network productsand actively manage voice and/or data communications networks.The most prominent wide-area network products in use are IBMNetview, Racal-Milgo CMS, System Center Net/Master, and Codex.A number of key network management issues were highlighted byrespondents.  These include:The integration of networks and management products thatoriginally were not designed to work together;An historical lack of internal company standards regardingcommunications equipment;An increased investment in telecommunications and therequirement to protect that investment; and a general lack of well-defined, open international standards on which to build networkmanagement systems.As for LAN design and operations, the average number of LANsinstalled within the surveyed organizations was 48, each with 23workstations on average.  Mr. Bonilla suggested that "This portendsan increase in the complexity of network services and expertise thatmust be provided by the organizations responsible for LAN-relatedtechnology deployment and operations, which may or may not bethe MIS/telecommunications department."The use of LANs and LAN-based technology is prevalent withinmost organizations, but "metrics for evaluating the performance,availability, responsiveness, and data integrity of LAN-based systemsare informal at best and frequently don't exist at all," Deloitte &Touche reported.  It said that a "lot of firefighting" has been theresult, and, consequently, companies "are not thinking abouttomorrow."  Yet increased reliance on communications means that"the cost of service interruptions and degradation will rise asproductivity and revenues decline," Mr. Bonilla stated.  Theimplication is that telecom planning and performance measuresmust become a management priority in the near future.While many new technologies have the potential to affect thedirections and strategies for LANs and LAN-based technologies,survey respondents indicated that the following, in descending order,will have the greatest impact:Client/server applications (92%); Electronic image management(91%); and Wireless LAN technology (73%).Client/server applications are being used by 33% of the respondents,though typically not for mission-critical applications yet.  Another56% reported that they are evaluating the potential benefits ofclient/server applications.  Respondents also indicated that suchapplications currently make up less than 10% of their organization'sapplication portfolio (by number of applications).  Glenn James,who developed the survey for Deloitte & Touche, said that"Nevertheless, as the lack of internal expertise and mature productsis overcome, client/server applications will become a mainstreamdesign and delivery mechanism."Deloitte & Touche said that "High-bandwidth metropolitan andwide-area networks (greater than T-1) are not yet extensive in anyindustry other than financial services (banking and brokerageservices) and education.  However, several industries and individualcompanies report that they are investigating or planning suchnetworks within the next two years.  Products including frame relay,FDDI, and SMDS are the most likely means of satisfying thesehigh-bandwidth requirements."Application development, particularly as it relates to the LAN andworkstation environment, and LAN-to-LAN communications willforce the implementation of these higher-bandwidth products andservices.  Projected rapid price decreases over the next few years forsome network services and communications hardware will allowjustification of projects that are currently not feasible or that canonly be marginally rationalized."

MCI's Frame Relay CustomerNetwork Management (CNM) system collects and displays serviceperformance and alarm monitoring information on demand.  "WithCNM, customers obtain a variety of network information includingalarms on network equipment, permanent virtual circuits, and accesslines, as well as statistics on frame and byte counts, input andoutput errors, and comparable information from MCI-providedcustomer premise equipment," MCI said.The information is provided through a CNM server over MCI'sframe relay network to the customer workstation using standardSNMP and MCI's Enterprise-Defined Management InformationBase, which defines the information data base available to thecustomer, MCI noted."Because the information is provided in a standard-compliantformat, customers' existing workstations can be used to process thisinformation and can be configured to support other networkmanagement elements of their wide-area networks as well asmonitor LAN activity.  This eliminates the need for separate LANmanagement systems," it added.CNM became available Oct. 1 on a limited basis and is planned forgeneral commercial availability in the first quarter of 1993.While MCI has not made final decisions on pricing, it noted plans"to charge standard installation fees based on the level ofinstallation support required and recurring charges ranging fromapproximately $300 to $2000 per month, depending upon theworkstation and network management package selected."  MCIplans to enhance CNM capabilities for use with its future virtualprivate data services, and to incorporate it or similar capabilitiesinto other MCI data network management products--such asIntegrated Network Management Service--over time, depending onmarket demand.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992AT&T PLANS TO OFFER INTEGRATED ACCESSFOR PUBLIC NETWORK ISDN/PRIVATE NETWORKSERVICESAT&T has announced a new feature that will allow customers toaccess both public switched ISDN (integrated services digitalnetwork) and private network services on a single high-speed T-1(1.544 megabits per second) facility.  With the new Primary RateInterface Static Integrated Network Access (PRI SINA) feature,"smaller locations that could not justify the cost of separate accessfacilities can be more innovative in their use of applications such aslocal area network interconnection and videoconferencing," saidRichard Campbell, AT&T's ISDN product manager.The cost efficiencies of PRI SINA can be enhanced when used withCall-By-Call service selection, "an additional AT&T ISDN featurethat allows customers to select the switched services to be used oneach access channel on a call-by-call basis," AT&T said.  It alsonoted that "Together with intelligent switching multiplexers, such asthe Teleos NetworkHub, PRI SINA can provide even furtherefficiencies and cost savings.  The Teleos NetworkHub can allocateprivate line overflow onto switched service lines on demand."A trial of PRI SINA and the Teleos NetworkHub currently is beingconducted by 3M, Teleos Communications, Inc., and AT&T.  Begunin May, the trial provides switched and private network connectionsbetween three 3M locations in the U.S.  The Teleos NetworkHubsaggregate traffic onto a single T-1 facility at each location andallocate individual channels at each location to meet the location'svoice, data, and video needs.  The trial's applications combinevideoconferencing, local area network interconnection, voicecommunications, and access to a private X.25 data network.AT&T emphasized that "Instead of buying more private linecapacity for peak traffic overflow, a company like 3M can savemoney by using PRI SINA and the NetworkHub to move peak datatraffic onto public switched network services as needed.  3M also isable to consolidate several AT&T services onto one highlymanageable high-performance digital access facility."  The trial willevaluate "operational readiness and key reliability measures" prior toAT&T making PRI SINA widely available in September.  To usePRI SINA, customers need an M-24 service function in the AT&Tcentral office, AT&T noted.

SRT is an emerging bridge standard for both FDDI(fiber distributed data interface) and Token-Ring LANs.  Itsimultaneously supports user stations employing the "source routing"and the "transparent routing" methods, allowing LANs in mixedenvironments to communicate with each other regardless of theirbridging schemes.RAD Network Devices, of Huntington Beach, Calif., explained that"To network managers and their companies, this results intremendous cost savings by eliminating the need for multiple bridgesand separate lines to support the different LAN internetworktraffic."  The SRT algorithm "allows both the transparent andsource-routing methods to exist within the media access control(MAC) layer," it added.  "SRT handles both the existing MAC layerbridging protocols by differentiating between these two methods ona frame-by-frame basis, as the packet is routed."  The SRT concepthas been adopted by an Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineers standards committee, which is in the process of approvingSRT as an addendum to the existing IEEE 802.1D local bridgestandard.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM DATA REPORT via NewsNetOctober 1, 1992NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR, ADAPTIVE CORP.REACH ATM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENTNational Semiconductor has signed an ATM (asynchronous transfermode) technology development agreement with ADAPTIVE Corp,a majority-owned subsidiary of Network Equipment Technologies,Inc.

The last technical barrier hasfallen. Those who can use a computer can create their own Website using PowerStation's point and click interface andpublish it on the Internet for one full year for just $495."Alan believes that the company's new PowerStation packagerepresents a pivotal innovation in the way businesses andindividuals will participate in the growth of the Internet."Ben Franklin was fond of saying 'Freedom of the pressbelongs to those who own one!"' said Alan. He is convincedthat easy access to the power of publishing on the World WideWeb means added freedom of expression for individuals andbusinesses of all sizes.The Internet's growth is exploding because people arerealizing that it gives them an opportunity to have a voice onthe new electronic frontier.  College students are puttingtheir resumes on the Web, businesses are putting productbrochures and catalogs on the Web, community activists arepromoting their activities on the Web. Most othercommunication tools such as television, radio, and print mediaare very expensive to use. On the World Wide Web you can reachmillions of people, for just a few hundred dollars."Alan predicts that any organization that currentlydistributes information on paper will find the Web acompelling alternative to the US mail. His chief argument isone of economics "When you take a look at the cost ofdelivering information on paper and compare that to the costof delivering information on-line you begin to realize that ashift in the delivery method is inevitable. The only questionremaining is whether you are going to be on the leading edgeor the trailing edge of the trend."The PowerStation program allows users to automaticallygenerate home pages, electronic business cards, resumes,brochures, portfolio pages and interactive order forms. Theprogram also includes Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scriptswhich enables users to receive orders from customers or toprogram graphic images to act like "point and click" maps.PowerStation includes five megabytes of Web site space onElectriCiti's network of high-speed Sun Sparcstations. Thesite can be linked to thousands of other Web sites availableon the global Internet accessible by tens of millions ofInternet users.ElectriCiti's art director Brad Pennock explains that inaddition to automatically generating the HTML programmingcode used to create Web sites, PowerStation guides usersthrough the process of making their sites more visuallyappealing. "The software assists users by providing a paletteof coordinated colors and a large library of professionalquality graphics. A sophisticated interactive multimediaexperience can be created by combining text, full-colorgraphics, entry forms, sound and video."PowerStation was created by an unusual team of softwareengineers-most still in high school and college. Seniorsoftware engineer Timothy Kimball is a sixteen year oldstudent at Gompers High School. Programmer Greg Hamerly workedfull time on the project between graduating from Poway HighSchool and entering Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Donna Whitlockworks full time at ElectriCiti as a systems analyst while on awork practicum from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, believes thathigh school and college students offer an untapped potentialfor developing high-tech progrwns and has given students keyroles since the company's beginning three years ago.ElectriCiti evolved from a community service organizationcomprised of students and programmers who had teamed up topromote technical literacy among grade school and high schoolstudents.Alan named his young group of software developers "TheWatchmakers" in honor of a group of students at MIT who helpedbuild Project Athena, MIT's landmark distributed computingexperiment which established the first campus-wide Internet.The Watchmakers at ElectriCiti, like their namesakes at MIT,work as peers, not underlings. The team continues to play anintegral part in developing the company's cutting-edgetechnology.Alan is most proud of the fact that the PowerStation teamachieved the goal he set out for them-to give people thepower to create their own personal or business Web site withjust a few simple clicks of the mouse.Members of the PowerStation development team are quick topoint out that unlike other Web publishing editors, theElectriCiti package gives users the ability to make their Websites available on the Internet. Other Internet providersfurnish the space but require users to create pages by writingHTML code. In contrast, ElectriCiti's new PowerStationachieves both goals in one easy to use, low priced package.PowerStation is available for the Microsoft Windows and AppleMacintosh and Power Macintosh computer platforms.PowerStation may be previewed on the Internet by accessingElectriCiti's Web site at http:Hwww.electriciti.com.ElectriCiti provides Internet services throughout the UnitedStates.

These diverse groups, at odds lately with eachother over issues of compatibility, met for two days at theHearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibility to Digital WirelessTelecommunications Summit Meeting to discuss and explore avenuesfor creating greater access to wireless telecommunications forthe hard of hearing population.     Jay Kitchen, president of the Personal CommunicationsIndustry Association (PCIA), opened the standing room only summitby emphasizing that the wireless industry undertook the summitnot because it was mandated to do so, but because it was theright thing to do.     Kitchen encouraged attendees to set an example forpoliticians and work quickly to build consensus and findsolutions to the problems of interference and incompatibilitybetween the wireless industry and the hearing impaired community.     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt delivered the summit's openingaddress.  He called the summit the "finest group of its kind thathas been assembled in the area of communications."  He added thathe was proud to see the communications industry come togetherwith representatives from the hearing impaired community to worktogether in a spirit of cooperation.     While new FCC Wireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar andsome of her staff were on hand for Hundt's opening remarks, theycould not stay and participate in the summit  because of thegovernment shutdown, Farquhar and her staff are authorized towork on auctions only and could not stay to add their input andrepresent the FCC in the meetings.     Hundt called the summit the "right time and the right placeto pursue these issues," and he said the FCC will do what thesummit concludes it should do in order to make it possible andpractical for the hearing impaired to use wirelesstelecommunications devices.  The FCC expects specific actionitems to come out of the summit, he said, expressing hisconfidence that the assembled group would find the rightsolutions and that his agency would implement them so that allAmericans can be part of the Information Age. Time is of theessence, Hundt said, as it is imperative that solutions toincompatibility problems be found before the telecom industryprogresses any further.     The companies that comprise the wireless industry faceincredible competitive pressures, Hundt told the audience, and itis hard for those not directly involved with the industry tosympathize with the pressure they are under.  He encouraged thehearing impaired community to work with the wireless industry andto be open to compromise so that a solution that is agreeable toboth sides can be worked out.     The alternative, Hundt obliquely implied, would be havingthe government step in and mandate solutions, which would likelysatisfy no one.  That point was reemphasized later in the day byanother speaker, Dr. Elizabeth Jacobson, deputy director of theCenter for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and DrugAdministration.  Dr. Jacobson's office regulates medical devices,such as hearing aids, and devices that emit radiation, such ascellular telephones.  She said a non regulatory approach tosolving the problem of interference and incompatibility would befaster and cheaper than getting the government involved andencouraged both sides to work together to find their ownsolution.All Wireless Technologies Can Cause Interference, One PanelistSaid     In the summit's first panel, George Schmitt, president ofOmnipoint Communications, said every wireless technology, whetherit is  CDMA, TDMA, DECT or GSM, can, in some circumstances, causeproblems with some hearing aids that are not well designed,because all wireless technologies pulse, thus interfering withhearing aids.  However, he said finding a solution to the problemof interference is "absolutely do able," if mobile phone andhearing aid manufacturers join forces with wireless operators andhelp solve the problem.     Schmitt responded to the charge that the wireless industryhas ignored the hard of hearing population, which some saidcomprises 10 percent of the American population.  Because it is aminority, Schmitt said that he does not believe any wirelessoperator would be "dumb enough" to ignore the 10 percent of theAmerican population that is hard of hearing.     Schmitt told the audience not to forget people with otherdisabilities when discussing issues of accessibility to wirelesstechnology.  People with vision loss and physical handicaps haveas much of a right to use wireless technology as hard of hearingpeople do, he said.  Schmitt added that the problem withinterference between wireless devices and hearing aids has beenexaggerated.  "The problem is not as severe as people make it outto be," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightPCIA BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996Representatives from the Hearing Impaired, Disabled CommunityDiscuss Incompatibility, Interference Issues At SummitTwo afternoon panels at Wednesday's Hearing Aid Compatibility andAccessibility to Digital Wireless Telecommunications SummitMeeting were made up of representatives from the hearing impairedcommunity who were on hand to educate the audience, especiallythose from the wireless industry, about the problems they facewhen trying to use wireless technology.     On the first panel, "Understanding Hearing Loss,"  otologistDr. Stephen Epstein, presented information about the prevalenceand demographics of hearing loss in the United States.     According to Dr. Epstein, 28 million Americans suffer fromsome form of hearing loss and several million of them use ahearing aid or some form of device that enables them to hear.With the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, Epstein said hisfigure of 28 million is likely to double in the coming 10 years.Not only will the Boomers not go into old age peacefully, he saidthey also won't go without their gadgets, further emphasizing theneed to make wireless devices hearing aid compatible.     The following panel, "Access to Telecommunications,"included a taped demonstration of what some hearing aid usersexperience when they try to use wireless telephones.  Dr. MeadKillion, president of Etymotic Research and an adjunct professorof audiology at Northwestern University, conducted thedemonstration using a CDMA phone, a digital cellular phone and aGSM based Sprint Spectrum phone.     By placing a hearing aid that had a microphone implanted init in one of his ears, he was able to demonstrate to attendeesthe kinds of interference that can occur with some wirelessphones.  In a few instances there was no interference, but inseveral others the interference was loud enough to make itimpossible for Killion to hear the person he was calling.Retro Fit Solutions Place a Poor Second to Designing Technologyto Be Compatible From the Beginning, Panelist Said     Deborah Kaplan, vice president of the World Institute onDisability, sat on the "Understanding Hearing Loss" panel.  Sheis a member of the Clinton administration's Advisory Council onthe National Information Infrastructure and an advocate foruniversal design, a theory and practice of designing everythingfrom buildings to telephones that emphasizes designing equipmentand services for the fullest range of human function  in otherwords, creating things that can be used by the largest number ofpeople, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.  Curbcuts, cuts made in sidewalk curbs, are an example of universaldesign, as they allow people who are walking, confined to wheelchairs, pushing strollers, pulling luggage and riding bicycles toget onto and off a sidewalk without having to "jump" the curb.     Kaplan lamented that the summit was focusing on retro fitsolutions to its problems instead of universal design.  Retro fitsolutions place a poor second to solutions that were designed andimplemented before a product ever leaves its testing phase, shesaid.  Retro fit solutions do not tend to be affordable, elegantor terribly useable, she said.  According to Kaplan, the problemof incompatibility between wireless devices and hearing aids isnot just about technology, it is about the wireless industry'sfailure to take its technology out of the laboratory and test iton real human beings.     When developing products for consumer consumption, companiesmust ask themselves who will be using the product before, notafter, they have developed it, Kaplan said.  Failing to ask thatquestion may put companies in the position of having to askthemselves questions about retro fitting:  How much will it costand who will pay for retro fit solutions?  Will it be comfortablefor users?  How difficult will it be to implement?     Speaking to those members of the audience representing thewireless industry, Kaplan advised them to put disabled people intheir focus groups and make them their beta testers, so as toprevent problems like this in the future.   If wirelesstelephones had been designed with hearing aid compatibility fromthe beginning, the industry could have avoided many problems, shesaid.Informal Experiment Finds Some Hearing Aid Users ExperienceInterference, Some Do Not     Brenda Battat, deputy executive director for the educationalorganization Self Help for Hard of Hearing People (SHHH),discussed an  informal and unscientific test she had conductedusing a Sprint Spectrum phone.  She asked people that wore inthe ear hearing aids, behind the ear hearing aids, ear canaldevices and cochlear implants to use the phone and tell her what,if any, interference they experienced.  She said all the behindthe ear device wearers who tested the phone experiencedinterference.  Of the four in the ear device users she polled,two experienced interference and two did not.  Those wearing inthe ear canal hearing devices also experienced interference, asdid the two she tested using cochlear implants.  Battat said shealso had her subjects try the phone using one of the externalphone devices, which are supposed to make wireless phones hearingaid compatible.  While the device did work in that it enabled thehearing aid users to hear the person on the other end of theline, she said it did nothing to mitigate the interference theyexperienced.     Battat also refuted a claim made earlier in the day by TomWheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications IndustryAssociation (CTIA) regarding the number of wireless phonemanufacturers that produce hearing aid compatible phones.Wheeler stated that 25 wireless phone manufacturers are buildinghearing aid compatible phones.  Battat said that only twocompanies produce such phones, while the rest build in hearingaid compatibility as a retro fit.mBack to Headline List CopyrightPCIA BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 05, 1996CNET added four employees to its product development group.CNET added four employees to its product development group.Brian Southwell joined the company as manager of systemadministration and project support.

The bidding competition at this early stage hasbeen fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses will resumeJan. 5.         As predicted by a number of industry insiders (PCS WEEK, Dec. 13,pp. 1-3), the top markets have been the scene of the most furiousactivity.  For example, Washington, D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed afirst round high bid of $11.3 million for the Chicago basic tradingarea (BTA), only to have the lead taken by GWI PCS Inc. in round twofor $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then upped the ante to $61.4 millionin round three.  Round four saw DCR take another shot at the lucrativeChicago license with a bid of $70.3 million, or $8.59 per potentialsubscriber in the market.  Several other markets, such as Miami andNew York, have seen similar activity.         High bids for round four included $203 million for New York byPCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million forPhiladelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc., headed byformer Qualcomm Inc. executive Allen Salmasi; $48.75 million for SanFrancisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by PCS2000.  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction         In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchersand participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. "It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are somany changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at Malarkey-Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants InternationalInc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the end of [theauction, the environment] looks different than when it started."Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst forWashington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was notreading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I thinkthere's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lotgreater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent thatcompanies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auctionenvironment and that there are many bidders that are not quite assophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets maycause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined notto come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some ofthese companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said.   ...What Is PCS 2000?Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been theaggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-basedpartnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry eversince it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of roundfour, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of theEastern United States.  PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners developedand managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and 25 percentowner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was incorporatedfor [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years ago," saidJavier Lamoso, company president.According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limitedpartnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investmentcompanies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[Theinvestors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners ownsmore than 3 percent of the company.Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did notwant to signal the partnership's true motives to other players.  Heexplained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets itwants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "IfI tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCChas interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want toavoid any hint of implied collusion."Back to Headline List CopyrightPCS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996EQUIPMENT SUPPLY DEALS MOVE SLOWLY AS C-BLOCK AUCTION BEGINS     Major PCS equipment contracts and agreements have all but haltedin the months preceding the C-block auction.

The FCC subsequentlyallocated 120 MHz of spectrum in six licensing blocks for broadbandPCS.  The so-called entrepreneurs' block or, simply, the C-block--49330-MHz basic trading area (BTA) licenses--was reserved for DEs.During the past year, however, the courts--in taking a new tack onaffirmative action--threw a wrench into government's efforts to allowsmall players to compete with "deep pockets" in the broadband PCSauction arena.  What follows is the long, strange trip of the C-blockauction that we documentedthis past year in PCS WEEK.  (The dates below refer to the issue datesof this newsletter.)  ...TEC v. FCC    Jan. 5:  The FCC announced that the C-block auction would beginApril 17, or 30 days after the close of the A/B-block auction,whichever was later. Short form applications were due Feb. 28.    Feb. 22:  Telephone Electronics Corp., a rural telephone holdingcompany, asked the D.C. Circuit to bar the commission from setting ashort-form filing deadline for the C-block auction.  TEC challengedthe $125 million cap on annual revenues for C-block applicants as wellas the race- and gender-based preferences for DEs.  In short, TECwanted the FCC to apply the revenue cap to its operating companiesinstead of itself so that it would be eligible to bid.  Arguably, TEC's affirmative action argument was an attempt toleverage its case.    March 22:  The D.C. Circuit granted TEC's stay request and set oralargument for Sept. 28.    April 26:  TEC dropped the case after forging a deal with PCSPrimeCo L.P. to partition the New Orleans/Baton Rouge major tradingarea (MTA).  ...Adarand v. Pena    June 14:  The Supreme Court, in a narrow 5-4 decision, threw awrench into federal affirmative action programs in Adarand v. Pena.  Thecourt ruled that race- and gender-based preferences had to be"narrowly tailored" toserve a "compelling government interest."  Adarand was remanded to theTenth Circuit.    June 21:  The FCC postponed the C-block filing deadline butinsisted that the auction would begin on time--Aug. 2.    June 28:  The FCC granted the A/B-block licenses and adopted aFurther Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate race- andgender-based preferences for C-block applicants.  ...Omnipoint v. FCC    July 26:  In its Sixth Report and Order, the FCC modified the C-block rules to eliminate women and minority preferences, and to expand the"49 percent equity exception" to all eligible applicants.  Thisexception allowed investors, including large companies, to hold 49.9percent ownership stakes in DEs.  Pioneer's preference winnerOmnipoint Corp., owner of the A-block license for the New York MTA,objected.    Aug. 2:  The D.C. Circuit granted Omnipoint's emergency stayrequest.  Omnipoint had argued that the expansion of the 49 percentequity exception to all C-block applicants did not allow enough time for "non-women/mi-nority" entities to take advantage of it.  The constitutional argument wasthat the FCC's decision violated the Fifth Amendment's equalprotection clause.  Omnipoint also argued that the FCC violated theAdministrative Procedure Act by not allowing appropriate time forpublic comment.    Aug. 16:  The FCC postponed the C-block auction indefinitely as theD.C. Circuit set Sept. 28 as the date for oral argument on theOmnipoint case.    Sept. 20:  The House Commerce Committee passed a measure endorsingthe FCC's C-block rules and requiring the agency to begin the auctionby Dec. 4.        Oct. 4:  Following oral argument, the D.C. Circuit lifted itsstay.  In a 2-1 decision, the court essentially decided that Omnipoint, an A-block license holder, would not be harmed by expansion of the 49percent exception in the C-block rules.  Almost immediately, the FCCset Dec. 11 as the starting date for the auction.  ...Cincinnati Bell v. FCC    Oct. 25:  Radiofone Inc. asked the Sixth Circuit to stay theauction in a long-pending case regarding the FCC's cellular/PCS cross-ownership rules.  Brought by Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. [CSN],BellSouth Corp. [BLS] and Radiofone, the consolidated cases attackedthe commission's rules for cellular eligibility, attribution, andstructural separation.  The Sixth Circuit granted the stay until it ruled on the issues.  Under the FCC's eligibility rules, Radiofone was prohibited from bidding on PCSlicenses in three Louisiana BTAs because of its cellular holdings inthe same areas.    Nov. 1:  At the request of the FCC, Supreme Court Justice John PaulStevens vacated the stay imposed by the Sixth Circuit.  And the fullSupreme Court rejected Radiofone's emergency petition to overturnStevens.  Thus, the FCC was able to proceed with the Dec. 11 startingdate for the auction.  The FCC had argued that Radiofone could bid onthe Louisiana BTAs so long as it later complied with any rules thatthe commission adopted.    Nov. 15:  The Sixth Circuit remanded the Cincinnati Bell case, withinstructions for the FCC to conduct further proceedings.  Thecommission decided to proceed with the Dec. 11 auction date.    Nov. 22:  The shutdown of the federal government over the budgetcrisis prompted the FCC to reschedule the auction starting date forDec. 18.  Meanwhile, Radiofone asked the Sixth Circuit to clarify thatits remand order meant that the FCC had to postpone the auction untilthe agency completed a rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-ownershipissues.  Radiofone argued that if it bid on the Louisiana BTAs, therewas no guarantee that it would not be subject to future penalties orforfeitures.     Dec. 6:  The Sixth Circuit issued a mandate, stating simply that ithad remanded the case to the FCC for further proceedings.  The courtdid not address Radiofone's request or even mention the auction.  TheFCC determined that it could proceed with the Dec. 18 starting date.    Dec. 13:  The FCC inadvertently sent proprietary financialinformation from three companies, including Radiofone, to some C-blockapplicants.  Separately, Radiofone again asked the FCC to stay theauction and open an expedited rulemaking on the PCS/cellular cross-ownership rules.  In addition, Radiofone filed a supplementalmemorandum with the Sixth Circuit, arguing that the court had thepower to enforce its mandate via contempt, mandamus or otherappropriate orders or writs.    Dec. 20:  The C-block auction began despite the second shutdown ofthe federal government.Back to Headline List CopyrightPCS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996INDUSTRY CANADA GRANTS FOUR PCS LICENSES, HOLDS BACK TWO     Four Canadian PCS hopefuls received their Christmas presents aweek early when Industry Canada granted them licenses on Dec. 18 (PCSWEEK, Dec. 20, 1995, p. 1).  The Canadian regulatory agency handed two30 MHz licenses to specialized mobile radio (SMR) operator ClearnetCommunications Inc. and MicroCell 1-2-1 Inc.  The two 10 MHz licenseswent to cellular operator Rogers Cantel Mobile Inc. and MobilityCanada--a nationwide alliance of local exchange carriers' cellularsubsidiaries.    The four winners beat 15 other candidates for the licensesostensibly because they came closest to meeting Industry Canada'spolicy objectives for PCS, which included the stimulation ofadditional choices in mobile services similar to cellular and thesupport of new technologies; the provision of new and innovativeservices at 2 GHz, rather than mere provision of upbanded cellularservices; nationwide and worldwide roaming for Canadian citizens; non-discriminatory access to the networks in order to allow third partiesto resell services; and the promotion of jobs and investment inCanada.  ...MicroCell Was Heavy Favorite, Insiders Say    Although many in the Canadian PCS industry assumed that the 10 MHzlicenses would go to Cantel and Mobility Canada, the 30 MHz licenseswere harder to call.  According to a number of sources that spoke tous before Industry Canada's announcement, MicroCell was the heavyfavorite for one of the licenses.    In a news release following the licensing announcement, MicroCellsaid that the government endorsed its open-network concept, underwhich it will allow any company interested in reselling PCS to accessits system.  "We will allow access to our network to all companies andentrepreneurs who want to market PCS," said Andre Tremblay, MicroCellpresident and CEO.    In addition, MicroCell promised to create a $90 million (Canadian)research and development fund "aimed at backing the projects ofentrepreneurs who could not otherwise participate in PCS development. "We are prepared to finance innovative projects," explained Tremblay. "Those who have good ideas for new PCS applications are invited toknock at our door."    MicroCell has chosen the global system for mobile communications-base PCS-1900 technology for its network and has supply agreementswith L.M. Ericsson AB and Northern Telecom Ltd..  ...Clearnet Sees PCS Complementing ESMR    The other 30 MHz winner, Clearnet, believes that it edged out theother candidates based on its preparation for PCS buildout as well asits experience with SMR.    Over the past year, the company has raised more than $250 millionin capital for the construction of both its PCS and enhanced SMR(ESMR) networks.     "We have had an objective to be the third major wireless serviceprovider [in Canada] since the company announced [Motorola's equitystake in Clearnet] in February 1994," said George Cope, Clearnetpresident and CEO, during a press conference conducted the day afterIndustry Canada granted the licenses.  "I think we've now gone a longway to enhance our position there."    Clearnet also views PCS as the consumer complement to its ESMRbusiness services.  The company is in the process of completing thefirst phase of its ESMR system buildout that will cover a region fromQuebec City to Windsor. Clearnet expects to begin commercial servicein mid-1996.    "We have our business communications network--our ESMR network--which is focused ... particularly on enhanced services all in onehandset," said Cope.  "We view PCS as complementing [ESMR] as a product that will be able tofocus on the mass consumer market."    Clearnet also intends to save a great deal on its PCS constructioncosts by combining PCS with its ESMR system wherever possible.  Thesesavings will be passed on to the consumer, Cope said.  "We believethat we also will be the lowest-cost PCS provider of the [two 30 MHzlicensees]," he added.    The Pickering, Ontario-based company built out all of its ESMRsites with the capability to carry PCS equipment as well, Copeexplained.  "A significant part of the total cost in designing awireless system are the soft costs of the sites--we won't have toincur those costs a second time," he said.    In addition, Cope said that Clearnet intends to share some of theleased lines with both services.  Billing services for PCS will comefrom the same company that Clearnet is using for ESMR, he said.   ...What About the Other Two Licenses?    In its news release on PCS licensing, Industry Canada did notcomment on the fate of the remaining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses,leaving many of those companies that did not receive licenseswondering if there still was a chance to get into the market in thenext few years.  Industry Canada retained the right to hold backlicenses if it believed that there were not enough qualifiedcandidates, or if the agency determined that the Canadian market couldnot sustain six PCS players.    According to Kirk Hamilton, vice president of corporate andgovernment affairs for paging operator and PCS applicant TeleZoneCorp., Industry Canada has not given his company any indication ofwhat will happen to the licenses.  "They basically issued the licensesand went off on holiday," he said.  "We hope to get some answers inthe new year."    As for the future, Hamilton said that TeleZone will be looking forother wireless opportunities as they come up.  But in the near term,"our primary objective is to get access to the license that's stillunawarded at this time."Back to Headline List CopyrightPCS WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996CDG COMPLETES TESTS ON 13-KILOBIT VOCODER SPECS     The Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Development Group (CDG)recently finished testing and finalizing the specifications for the13-kilobit per second vocoder algorithm.

Among other things,the guidelines call for five common security requirements, includinguser authentication, the ability to conceal a user's location toprevent eavesdropping, bearer and signalling channel privacy for allwireless terminals, user data stored in "smart cards," and theexchange of security information among different PCS networks.

In its latest annual report, the company disclosed that it plans tomake concurrent public offerings of stock and notes during the firstquarter of 1996.    Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5million and $150 million, respectively.  Cash interest on the noteswill not be payable before 2001.  InterCel also is negotiating a $20million revolving credit facility.  ...Offerings Coincide With InterCel's Buyout of Powertel    The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with the cellularoperator's plans to acquire Powertel, a privately held consortium inwhich InterCel already is a major participant (PCS WEEK, June 28,1995, p. 7).    The three licenses that Powertel won in the A/B-block auction coverparts of nine Southeastern states with 9 million potential subscribersor "pops."  After the initial phase of its buildout, Powertel willserve 55 percent of the pops in its major trading areas, InterCelsaid.    InterCel chose global system for mobile communications-based PCS-1900 as its technology standard last August (PCS WEEK, Aug. 30, 1995,p. 7), but has yet to announce equipment contracts.  ...Equipment Vendor Negotiations Continue     At our deadline, the company was continuing negotiations withequipment supplier candidates regarding vendor financing.  "Thecompany currently believes that vendor financing may provide asignificant amount of the capital required for its PCS system,"InterCel's annual report said.    While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positiveoperating income," InterCel warned that management "expects to incursignificant operating losses beginning in 1996 as it develops andconstructs the PCS network and builds the PCS customer base."Back to Headline List WT03-B13-20IA086-000622-B040-198http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te50.html 205.156.212.5 19970122051941 text/html 27847HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:17:45 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:59 GMTContent-length: 27660Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te50.html Sample Issue Copyright REPORT ON AT&T via NewsNet JANUARY 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES 'NET LOOMS OVER $10B FRAME RELAY MARKET (1258 words) POOR BUYOUT RESPONSE WON'T HURT AT&T'S STRATEGY, ANALYSTS SAY (365 words) COMMISSION GIVES GO AHEAD TO $4 BILLION INVESTMENT IN SPRINT (514 words) AN INSIDERS LOOK: NETWORKMCI SEEKS TO BROADEN HORIZON'S PAST LONG-DISTANCE (1114 words) NETWORK SYSTEMS ACQUIRES PHILIPS' EUROPEAN PUBLIC NETWORK ASSETS (60 words) AT&T AND BIRLA GROUP WIN TWO CELLULAR LICENSES IN INDIA (108 words) SPRINT NAMES FRANZ AS HEAD OF DIVERSIFIED BRANDS GROUP (69 words) AT&T BEGINS LOCAL PUSH IN NEW JERSEY, MARYLAND AND GEORGIA (105 words) LCI ESTABLISHES WESTERN OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA AFTER ACQUISITION (79 words) MCI TO PROVIDE BUSINESS SERVICE IN EASTERN EUROPE, BALTIC STATES (81 words) MCI OFFERS CUSTOMERS TIPS TO PREVENT COMPUTER FRAUD (40 words) CopyrightREPORT ON AT&T via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996'NET LOOMS OVER $10B FRAME RELAY MARKETThe Internet is making a move to de-throne frame relay andprivate networks as the premiere venues for data communications.But fear not.  All is not lost yet for frame relay.  Unresolvedsecurity and efficiency issues are keeping the Internet protocol(IP) networks from competing directly with private networks.  Soby responding rapidly to customer dynamics and keeping an eye onquality, there still is time for the long-distance carriers toscore some cash in this $10 billion market."The Internet would be more of a complement or an augmentationto frame relay," Carolyn Tommie, a product manager with AT&T'sInterspan frame relay service, told The Report On AT&T.Industry players see no signs of the frame relay businessslowing down.  The industry saw triple-digit growth last yearand is expected to grow 100 percent next year."There has been an absolute explosion in this business asbusinesses reorganize and applications are pushed out from thedesktop to the local area network [LAN]," Bart Westberg,director of advanced data services at Sprint, told RATT.One of the things that makes frame relay so attractive to datacustomers, and thus such a hot business, is the cost/performanceratio.  Since with frame relay, data travels in short burstsover the network as opposed to in a steady stream, the customerpays only for the time he uses the network.  Westberg told RATTthat especially for "many-to-many connectivity," the priceperformance of the service is a big selling point.But a wolf is at the door.  A study by Forrester Research inCambridge, Mass., reports the Internet's cost advantage could bejust the arrow that pierces AT&T's heel in frame relay.  Thestudy says the Internet's cost advantage and flexibility willleave private networks without any advantage by 2000.However, Sprint's Westberg is confident that cost isn't the onlyissue customers consider.  Although frame relay is cost-effective, customers value quality of service above price whenchoosing a carrier, he said."You've got to focus on the performance of the service,technical service and network reliability.  You are dealing withinformed buyers, technical buyers," Westberg told RATT.AT&T's Tommie agrees and adds that disaster recovery is anadvantage that frame relay has over the Internet."As customers switch mission-critical data, the carrier must beable to back the service up in a number of ways.  You have togive the customers more than one precautionary option," she toldRATT.  These options don't currently exist on the Internet, sheadded.Furthermore, Tom Pincince, an analyst with Forrester Research,said Internet security is simply a red herring, and that publicnetworks can be just as secure as private networks.William Callahan, a senior manager of broadband data marketingat MCI, told RATT Internet security issues are on the verge ofbeing resolved.  He predicted that with the continuation offirewall activity, the Internet will be as secure as frame relaynetworks by the end of next year."But right now, [security] is why many businesses don't feelcomfortable with the Internet.  Thye are more comfortable withframe relay," Callahan said.Secure, yes, but perhaps not yet as efficient.  And thatefficiency problem could keep the IP networks at bay while thelong-distance carriers plot their next move, Pincince told RATT."Business users must be assured that mail sent is mail receivedand that the multibillion dollar funds transfer does not getpushed aside by the teenager downloading sports scores fromESPN's Web site," he said.That next move for interexchange carriers, Pincince advised,should be to offer frame relay and Internet access in unison,and perhaps eventually to wean customers off of frame relay.  Atleast for the next few years, businesses should use both privateand public networks for data communications.That challenge opens the door for a cohesive strategy of framerelay and IP offerings.  Companies can send the bulk of theirdata over the IP network and use the private, frame relaynetwork for sensitive information."Afterall, people use both the Postal Service and FederalExpress," Pincince told RATT.AT&T now offers an Internet-connectivity option with Interspanservice.  It also provides its customers access to AT&TWorldNet, which is a more comprehensive Internet offering thanthat offered with Interspan.  Tommie said including Internetaccess in conjunction with frame relay is vital because itcreates synergy between the two protocols."The Internet also has bursty use.  Someone may use the Internetto pull down a large file.  Then another person in the companymay use it later for e-mail, but there never is a steady streamof Internet use for the same function," Tommie said.Sprint also is tying Internet backbone into its frame relayoffering."The underlying technology of the Internet is PCIC.  You have tohave a network to access the Internet.  ATM could be thatbackbone [and we would try to provide it.]  It all depends onhow you position your service to meet your customers' demands.It is not really a direct cannibalization of your business,"Westberg told RATT.Perhaps the company best suited for the evolution of framerelay, and to challenge AT&T in data, is MCI, according toForrester's Pincince.  He said MCI has agility and a goodnetwork backbone, and is not bogged down by a huge customerbase.  As a result, MCI will be able to get all of its customerup to speed on new services faster than big fat AT&T, Pincincesaid.MCI's Callahan said that company has packaged Internet gatewayservices together with frame relay since April."That gives our customers the ability to go back and forthbetween the two. The two can peacefully co-exist," Callahan toldRATT.Still, even as the Internet threatens frame relay today,tomorrow could be a very different story and the two could stillplay very well together."What will be the Internet of five years from now?  Five yearsfrom now, corporations may rely on the Internet more for e-mailthan anything else," Mike Grubb, group manager of data servicesat Sprint told RATT.  "And new applications and customerrequirements will drive frame relay service.  One type ofservice is more suitable to the Internet and others to framerelay."Another way the carriers can slow the industry's progression isto expand their customer base.  The market for frame relayservices doesn't have to end with Fortune 500 companies.Although Sprint's main marketing thrust is aimed at mid- toupper-tier companies, smaller companies also can be anattractive customer."Anytime you've got multiple sites that you need to connect,frame relay is a viable alternative.  Smaller companies aregetting into connectivity and pulling [Sprint's] focus downsomewhat," Westberg told RATT.AT&T's Tommie said that company's customer breadth also isacross the board. Interspan has customers with as few as twoports and as many as 1,000."Don't assume that [frame relay] should be targeted at largecompanies only," Tommie said.But carriers have to keep their eye on the ball to keep thiscustomer base happy than the average voice customer, Sprint'sGrubb told RATT."Voice technology is understood [by the customer] and notevolving that much.  But data technology is a fast moving targetwith ATM and ISDN and other technologies coming along.  Thedemand for the technology is growing at least as fast as thetechnology," Grubb said.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON AT&T via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996POOR BUYOUT RESPONSE WON'T HURT AT&T'S STRATEGY, ANALYSTS SAYAt first glance, the response to AT&T's management-buyout offerseems weak - only 2,600 of the estimated 78,000 managers haveaccepted to date.  But shed no tears for AT&T.  Analysts say thecompany still will look good when it becomes a pure serviceorganization and begins to plot its invasion of the Bellcompanies' local territory."Things are going as planned.  There are no surprises here.AT&T likes to do things in a way that doesn't disrupt the systemthat much," Brian Adamik, an analyst with the Yankee Group inBoston, told The Report On AT&T.Adamik said AT&T still will need to downsize in order totransform itself into a purely service organization, but he isunsure how deep the cutbacks will go.He suggested that perhaps instead of layoffs AT&T will undergo aredeployment of management from its headquarters out "into thefield," especially in light of its recent announcement toaggressively pursue local markets."[AT&T will have to] de-centralize the business and put thedecisions out in the field.  Especially in product development,"Adamik said.An AT&T spokesman told RATT the company originally projectedabout 4 percent of employees would take the offering.  Thenumber of people who had accepted by press time was just abouton target for AT&T, the spokesman said."It's not as attractive an offer as some would have liked,"Yankee Group analyst Rob Rich told RATT.  Rich said he expectsthe number to increase slightly before the end of the month.The buyout will not eliminate the need for layoffs, however.AT&T spokesman Burke Stinson told RATT it was meant only to easethe company into telling some managers, beginning this month,that they no longer have an assignment.Rich said AT&T wasn't wiping as many costs off the books as itwould like, and that factor will cost the company some money.But by the time the new company starts, the balance sheetsshould look good so AT&T should be able to get low-interestfinancing as a result, he said.The deadline for accepting the buyout package was Friday; AT&Tshould have the final numbers Tuesday.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON AT&T via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996COMMISSION GIVES GO AHEAD TO $4 BILLION INVESTMENT IN SPRINTAfter much ado, Sprint finally got the nod from the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) for its 20 percent sale toFrance Telecom (FT) and Deutsche Telekom (DT).   Analysts saythis green light finally will put Sprint on equal footing withAT&T and MCI on an international playing field - a field whereit currently lacks a presence."Sprint has been the weak sister among the big three [as far asthe international markets].  It had less facilities andoperations than AT&T and MCI," David Yedwab, an analyst withParsippany, N.J.-based consultancy Eastern Management told TheReport On AT&T last week.Yedwab said MCI's partnership with British Telecom gave it astrong international presence and AT&T's various partnershipsaround the globe position it well on an international basisalso.  Sprint had been lacking such a strategic position, hesaid, but not any more."This will put Sprint directly in the contest," Yedwab added.The next step for Sprint and MCI is to see which can establish aPacific Rim presence to rival AT&T's, Yedwab said.But let's not forget about the $4 billion plus change Sprintstands to receive as part of this deal.  Yedwab said that cashwill go a long way toward Sprint's PCS investment - perhapsgiving the company a big boost over AT&T in the personalcommunications field.  It also will help Sprint's investment ina broadband network, an area in which Yedwab said Sprint isfalling behind AT&T and MCI.Although the French and German telecom markets failed the FCC'snew test of market openness, the commission approved the $4.2billion investment.The FCC said that, in this case, it would give greater weight toother factors, particularly how the cash infusion would enhancethe number-three long distance company's competitive position inthe United States.  Sprint has made major investments in theStates in personal communications service (PCS), a service seenas a strong competitor to cellular.The other factor is that French and German leaders havecommitted to the FCC in writing that they will open theirtelecom markets to competition in 1998.  If they fail to do so,the FCC stands ready to revoke its approval of the deal, severalcommissioners warned.But the FCC also imposed several caveats, including banningSprint from increasing its capacity on its routes between theUnited States and France and Germany.  That restriction is oneof several that exceed those imposed by a consent decree Sprinthas signed with the Department of Justice (DoJ).  It will goaway when switched voice resale and an alternative telecominfrastructure are available in France and Germany.A Sprint spokesman told The Report On AT&T it would have toreview the language in the FCC order with its partners beforecommenting on the conditions.  Unfortunately, the recentgovernment shutdown has stalled the release of the language, andthe spokesman didn't expect to see anything from the FCC untilafter the New Year.The deal still must be cleared by the European Community aswell.Back to Headline List CopyrightREPORT ON AT&T via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996AN INSIDERS LOOK: NETWORKMCI SEEKS TO BROADEN HORIZON'S PASTLONG-DISTANCEThis special report - the first in a new Report On AT&T seriesof insider looks at key MCI operations - gives you the valuablestrategic information on the telecom company's plans in suchareas as network services, long-distance, electronic commerceand wireless strategies.

Beyond that, networkMCI is more than a strategicvision; it also is a developmental plan that features theintroduction of services in incremental steps to gain a leadingposition as an overall provider of communications andinformation services.* MCI on the Internet *The Internet is central to MCI's plan.  In 1995 there were anestimated 25 million active Internet e-mail users, between 7million and 10 million users with full Internet access and 4million people who use the World Wide Web, an Internetnavigational tool.  The Wall Street Journal estimated thatcommerce on the Internet, actually a supernetwork comprising40,000 independent but connected networks, could reach the $100million level as early as late 1995.MCI has long been involved with the development of the Internet,the network aspects of which are addressed in Chapter Six ofthis report.  In terms of providing access to and service viathe Internet, MCI has introduced two service offerings sincemid-1994 which enhance Internet connectivity, as well as PC-based applications:  the internetMCI software package andmarketplaceMCI.  In turn, both of these are wrapped withinnetworkMCI Business, a composite information and communicationspackage.  In addition, in 1994 MCI introduced internetMCI AccessService which targets the larger education, government, andbusiness communities with a range of Internet access services,as well as expanded e-mail service which allows Internet usersto utilize MCI Mail.* networkMCI Business *networkMCI Business is a Windows-based communications andinformation software package targeted to the small and medium-sized business community.  Originally introduced in October1994, the latest version 3.0 was debuted at the COMDEX tradeshow in Atlanta in April 1995.  In conjunction with the 1994launch of the product, MCI reported incremental expenses of $70million that contributed to an increase in operating expenses in1994.  Although the software package is touted as an integratedinformation and communications package, it is in reality a groupof separate applications linked only by Windows.Introduced commercially in late September 1995, the packagefeatures infoMCI, conferenceMCI, marketplaceMCI, faxMCI, e-mailMCI, networkMCI paging and internetMCI.  The package is theresult of collaboration with numerous firms:  internetMCI wasdeveloped in cooperation with Netscape Communications, FTPSoftware and RSA Data Security; e-mailMCI is a licensedapplication from ConnectSoft; networkMCI Paging is provided viaa reselling agreement with SkyTel; and faxMCI is a licensedversion of Delrina's WinFax PRO.  Other collaborators includePictureTel Corp., Databeam Corp, FYI Online and Image TechnologyInc.MCI indicated that the latest version of the package would beprovided free of charge to existing customers and run at theprice of $100 for new customers.  Further, the company indicatedthe new offering would be accompanied by a drop in the monthlysubscription rate of $65 ($50 for Vnet, Vision or Preferredcustomers) to $45 ($35 for Vnet, Vision and Preferredcustomers).  Some of the standard components of the networkMCIBusiness software package are also offered independently.internetMCI - a "load and go" Internet access and navigationsoftware package which is also offered independently for $39.95plus monthly access charges.  The offering provides local andtoll-free dial-up and graphical user interface (GUI) point-and-click navigation.marketplaceMCI - a multimedia on-line catalog and businesspurchasing service providing businesses a new way to distributeproduct information and facilitate on-line sales.  Broughtonline in March 1995, marketplaceMCI opened with 14"storefronts" to comprise an electronic mall:  Dun & BradstreetInformation Services, Hammacher Schlemmer & Co., Office MaxInc.; Intercontinental Florists, Danmark International, PC Zoneand Mac Zone, Reiter's Scientific & Professional Books, QUALCOMMInc., Reveal Computer Products, Covey, Proxima Inc., Doneckers,FTP Software Inc. and National Wildlife Galleries Inc.  MCIindicated that several more companies will open shops in theelectronic mall including: Aetna Life and Casualty, Amtrak,Borders Inc., Dell Computers, Healthrider, Sara Lee, TigerDirect and Timberland.  The site is made possible by RSA DataSecurity Inc.'s public-key cryptography which encrypts alltransactions involving sensitive information such as credit-cardnumbers.  MCI has also taken measures to ensure the security ofthe merchant web-site contents.infoMCI - delivers to the customer news stories twice a day, aswell as instant news flashes on breaking stories.  Theinformation delivered is based upon a customer-defined profile.The customer can select one industry category from a list of 25,and specify key terms within an industry or company.

Satellite broadcasting equipment has become the fastest-sellingproduct in consumer electronics history and shows no signs of slowingas deep-pocketed companies attempt to launch such services throughoutthe world in '96, sources said.  And, the rush for others to provideglobal, mobile services by 2000 will intensify as those systemsprepare to launch their first satellites on rockets that suffered somefailures in '95.     Chuck Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting andCommunications Association (SBCA), said, "We think 1996 will seecontinued expansion of thedirect-to-home industry with the introduction of several new players. That expansion includes the successful launch of the EchoStarCommunications Corp. system [see related story on p. 1] and the soon-to-be introduced AlphaStar DTH system.  These new systems willcontinue to expand the level of choice available to the consumer. And, we'll see the introduction of additional, niche marketprogramming services which will be unique to the satellitemarketplace.  Many of those programs will not be available on cable."     A similar bullish view about DTH was offered by Bruce Crockett,president and CEO of Comsat Corp..     "Comsat's recent $100 million contract with News Corp. to providedirect-to-home broadcasting in Latin America demonstrates that DTHcontinues to expand in every region of the world," Crockett said. "News Corp. is repeating the success it has enjoyed in Europe andAsia.  At the same time, DirecTv created the market in the U.S. andnow is being joined by other operators like PrimeStar and Echostar.     "All of these pioneers have set the stage for a boominginternational business in the second half of the '90s.  EasternEurope, India, the Middle East, and Africa are hot markets to watch,"Crockett said.     DirecTv, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., reached 1 millionsubscribers for its direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service in theUnited States this year, said Donald Cromer, president of Hughes Spaceand Communications Co.  For '96, the big story will be progress indeveloping satellite systems, such as Hughes' Spaceway project, tooffer interactive bandwidth applications, he said.  ...Money, Money, Money Will Decide Winners in '96     "For 1996, the story is going to be money, money, money--DBSauctions, fundraising for the Big LEOs and other satellite ventures,and whether Constellation Communications, American Mobile SatelliteCorp. and Ellipsat make their financial showing to obtain Big LEOlicenses by the end of January 1996," said Tim Logue, a space andtelecommunications analyst with the law firm Reid & Priest, ofWashington, D.C.     Logue continued, "I believe the financial markets areincreasingly sophisticated about satellite communications.  Thatmeans, however, that they are much less likely to be bowled over by'gee whiz' types of presentations.  They understand the business andunderstand full well the high risks involved.     "Therefore, satellite companies have to do a better job ofpresenting their business cases and offerings to the financialcommunity.  Anything that would reduce risk would be helpful, as well,like improving launch vehicle reliability," Logue added.     Hewitt said, "We believe that Wall Street's understanding of therole that satellite communication plays in the InformationSuperhighway has increased substantially in the past 12-18 months.  Inparticular, SBCA has developed Wall Street's understanding of the direct-to-home marketplace through ourassociation's SkyForum conference that is held twice a year in NewYork."     The financial community is starting to recognize the growthpotential of satellite systems, Cromer said.     ICO Global Communications Inc., a for-profit, spin-off of theworld's mobile satellite consortium Inmarsat, raised $1.4 billion fromits Signatories.  and was forced to turn away hundreds of millions ofdollars from some 40 investors interested in backing theorganization's planned 12-satellite, $2.6 billion system to provideglobal, mobile communications (SN, Jan. 23, 1995, pp. 1-3).  Hughesbecame an ICO investor late last year.     "The $5.7 billion backlog in satellite orders for Hughes--doublelast year's backlog--is some indication that new ventures are findingthe capital needed for satellite communications systems," Cromer said.  ...Financing Generally Is Tight, Tight, Tight     "Some, however, such as Iridium [Inc.] and Globalstar pulledtheir [debt] offerings soon after they were released," Cromer said. "I believe financial backing will continue to become available in thefuture as more satellite programs are proven and business cases aredemonstrated."     Bruce Gerding, managing director of Odyssey TelecommunicationsInternational Inc., said, "As more satellite financing deals arebrought to market, investors are beginning to understand them betterand deals are getting done, as evidenced by the completion in 1995 ofthe PanAmSat, Orion and Globalstar initial public offerings and thePanAmSat high-yield offering, among others.  Although some satellitefinancing attempts failed this year, I believe that financial backingwill become more available in the future as risks are betterunderstood and more properly structured satellite deals are brought tomarket."     A less-optimistic view was offered by Ahmad Ghais, a satelliteindustry consultant and the former director of engineering andoperations at Inmarsat.  Ghais warned financial markets may not becomemore generous in the future.     "Financial markets will recognize that not all contenders havestaying power, so they will be very selective in backing them," Ghaissaid.  "That will lead to a shake out, beginning visibly in '96.  Whowill survive?  That is the question financing sources will need themost expert help on."        Another consultant, Ed Martin, a former executive with ComsatCorp., said, "Only a few, at most, of the new systems will achievefinancial success."   ...WRC 95 Spurs Optimism     Many prospective global, mobile communications systems gainedimmensely from the allocation of substantial spectrum for theirservices at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95) thatended Nov. 12.     Russell Daggatt, president of Teledesic Corp., said, "WRC hasleft us very optimistic about the future.  We now are prepared to moveforward with the project.  I would expect us to bring on a few keypartners in '96.  The objective in '96 is not so much money, becausewe are adequately capitalized for the time being, but we need to beginputting our global partnership into shape."     Odyssey's Gerding added: "WRC-95 showed terrific cooperationbetween the satellite industry and the U.S. government delegation.  Asa result of their successful efforts, Odyssey has obtained itsfrequencies, as planned; that accomplishment has been well received byour backers."     Scott Harris, chief of the FCC's International Bureau, said, "Thesuccess of the U.S. delegation at WRC-95, which built upon andexpanded past successes, was another giant step forward for globalsatellite systems.  This success was evidenced not only by thespectrum allocated, but also in the commitment to such systemsdemonstrated by the vast majority of ITU member states."     Ghais countered, however, the allocations do not precludedisputes erupting between satellite and terrestrial users that mustshare the spectrum.     Joseph Krabacher, managing director of Informcosmosconsult LLC,agreed.     "We are concerned about the broadband MSS frequency allocationdue to anticipated technical coordination problems and the potentialfor a company such as Teledesic to obtain monopolistic advantages,"Krabacher said.     Informcosmosconsult is a U.S.-based marketing and legalconsulting firm that represents a number of Russian government andindustry clients.     The SBCA's Hewitt said, "With the Satellite Industry Associationoperating as an independent arm of the SBCA, and havingrepresentatives on the SBCA board of directors, we're very pleased tosee the satellite-related spectrum allocations that were granted byWRC-95."  ...Launch Reliability Remains in Question     Many observers thought one of the biggest stories of the past 12to 18 months was the partial or total failure of at least one launcheach by Arianespace, Lockheed Martin Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp.,Orbital Sciences Corp., EER Systems Inc. and China Great Wall Corp. New rockets intended to carry small- and mid-sized commercial payloadsperformed the worst with three consecutive failures (SN, Oct. 30,1995, pp. 1-3).     Irving Goldstein, director general and CEO of Intelsat, saidlaunchers needed to become far more reliable in the future.  And thoselaunchers also must provide their services at a reasonable cost, headded.  Some launchers are charging upward of $100 million for eachlaunch.     "Even though satellite communications is a relatively matureindustry, there still is a fair amount of risk associated with gettingspacecraft into orbit and in service for their entire lifetime,"Goldstein said.  "Over the past year, the industry has experienced itsshare of launch vehicle failures and delays, complicating an alreadytight overall industry launch manifest.  While there have been somepositive trends, such as [Lockheed's] expanding launch capabilitiesand progress on the Ariane 5, there still is considerable room toimprove the range of launch vehicle choices, scheduling options andcosts."     He Xing, vice general manager of the space division at ChinaGreat Wall, said 1996 will be an important year for new rockets thatlaunch big payloads.     "The more powerful major launch vehicles, such as Ariane 5, LongMarch 3B and 3C, will all experience their maiden flights, andsomething new will also be brought about with Delta 3, Zenit andProton," Xing said.  "The world will suddenly receive such a largenumber of new launch vehicles.  Fortunately or unfortunately, thesatellite operators will find it very difficult to distinguish and tochoose their favorite launch services package."  ...Orbital Slot Disputes Will Spark Litigation in '96     One negative development that will emerge this year is theproblem of orbital congestion between satellites, said Delbert Smith,a partner with the Washington, D.C., law firm Reed Smith Shaw &McClay.     "I'm predicting the first, formal litigation or arbitration willtake place in 1996 dealing with disputed orbital arc locations," Smithsaid.  "We've come very close in the recent past with four or fiveinstances of orbital arc disputes.  Each of these times the disputeshave been settled at the 11th hour through negotiation andcoordination.  Now, the stakes are much larger.     "The companies are much bigger and their markets are much larger,particularly for broadcasters.  These are major corporate entities. They have much to lose, and therefore the protection of theircorporate assets will become a prime motivating factor in theirability to continue to raise financing."     Past disputes about orbital positions largely have been limitedto technical issues, not commercial ones, Smith said.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996U.S. DELEGATION WINS WRC-95 BATTLES WITH LOBBYING CAMPAIGN     The U.S. delegation to the World Radiocommunication Conference(WRC 95) last fall gained critical new spectrum allocations for someproposed, global mobile telephony services, but used someunconventional lobbying activities previously not seen at any of thepast conferences, some satellite industry insiders said.     In one instance, the U.S. pressured other delegations to supportan allocation for Teledesic Corp., the U.S.-based company that plansto offer broadband communication services via 840 low-Earth-orbitsatellites by 2001.     Teledesic aided its cause by serving members of the variousdelegations an assortment of goodies that included pizza, beer, icecream, tote bags, hats and notebooks, said Leslie Taylor, who headsthe Bethesda, Md.-based satellite consulting firm Leslie TaylorAssociates Inc.  ...Promising Free Service Usually Works, Too!     The strategy worked because the WRC allocated 400 MHz in Ka-bandfor non-geostationary fixed services, such as Teledesic.  And, theallocation of an additional 100 MHz for such services was placed onthe agenda for WRC-97.     Teledesic won another victory when the conference adopted aprecedent-setting "freeze" on the filing of new geostationary or non-geostationary fixed satellite services (FSS) before the end of WRC-97,Taylor said.  That gives Teledesic extra time to win votes for theadditional 100 MHz allocation.     To curry further backing, Teledesic promised two years of freeservice in certain parts of the world, Taylor added.  TeledesicPresident Russell Daggatt said his system won broad support on itsmerits.     The U.S. negotiators pressed their counterparts from othercountries for quick action on a number of key mobile satellitespectrum allocations, said Taylor, who accompanied the U.S. delegationin Geneva.     Although the lobbying was cranked up at this WRC, FCCCommissioner Susan Ness said the U.S. achieved some important gainsfor Teledesic and others.  Ness praised delegation head Amb. BrianFontes for winning support on several key issues for U.S. mobilesatellite ventures.  Ness was part of the delegation.

Commissioners also voted to restrict current DBS operators fromparticipating in the auction.  A "single spectrum cap" will limitcompanies from controlling more than one full-continental U.S. orbitalslot.  As a result, DirecTv Inc., EchoStar Corp. and United StatesSatellite Broadcasting Co. Inc. (USSB), as well as other DBSpermittees, will not be allowed to bid on the frequencies unless theydivest their other licenses.     The commission, however, did not prevent cable TV companies andmultiple system operators (MSOs) from bidding on the valuablespectrum.     A host of communications giants are thought to be interested inbidding on the frequencies including, MCI Corp., backed by RupertMurdoch, Bell Atlantic Corp., Nynex Corp., U S West, BellSouth Corp.and, of course, TeleCommunications Inc., the nation's largest cableMSO.     Indeed, MCI already has announced it will open the auctions, thefirst in the history of the satellite industry, with an initial bid of$175 million.  ...How Will the Auctions Be Conducted?     The electronic auctions will be held in sequential, multiplerounds that will grant two permits, one for 28 channels at 110 degreesW and the other for 24 frequencies at 148 degrees W--the spectrumformerly licensed to Advanced Communications Corp., of Little Rock,Ark., and Tempo Satellite Corp.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SATELLITE SPOTLIGHT: NEW SAT-BASED TRACKING SYSTEM INTRODUCED     Fairfax, Va.-based Arrowhead Space & Telecommunications Inc.(Arrowhead) has introduced a new vehicle monitoring and securitysystem (VMSS).  The new product will be available through ArrowheadTechnologies Inc., a division of Arrowhead Space & Telecommunications,located in Newport News, Va.     The VMSS is designed to solve two short- and long-haul truckingproblems: trailer hijacking and cargo theft.  It also functions as adynamic location device providing real time automatic updatesdisplayed on high-resolution maps.     Arrowhead said the benefits of VMSS include reduced cargoinsurance premiums, improved loss control and less pass-through ofcosts resulting from theft.  The VMSS is incident-driven and can beinterfaced with a wide variety of nationwide communications networks. The entire system is battery operated and completely independent of atrailer's electrical system.     "VMSS is an extension of our automated vehicle location product,"said Mary Ann Elliott, president and CEO of Arrowhead.  "With VMSS, afirm can determine a vehicle's exact location, status of the engine,accumulated mileage, intrusion and security status.  It's thedifference between a home burgler alarm and a full-home monitoring andsecurity system."     VMSS combines a computer processor, a global positioning system(GPS) receiver, up to 24 sensor alarms, eight analog and six digitalinputs.  The entire system occupies a space approximately five inchessquare and two inches deep.  The system also provides all weatherpositions, heading and time information.

The Teledesic system, which Gates and telecommunications mogulCraig McCaw are backing with seed money, is intended to provideglobal, broadband communications services via a constellation of 840low-Earth-orbit satellites beginning in 2001.  Gates envisions the"wallet PCs" becoming one of many products that would use his proposedsystem.     Those wallet PCs would contain people's credit cards, tickets,phone numbers, keys and additional information, said Gates, thefounder and chairman of Microsoft Corp. , of Redmond, Wash.     "All of that literally will be available when you have a wirelessnetwork in place," Gates said during a recent Smithsonian Institutionspeech here.     Craig Mundie, senior vice president of the consumer systemsdivision at Microsoft Corp., told SATELLITE NEWS Editor Paul Dykewicz,"The advantage of Teledesic is it has the prospect of becoming abroadband equivalent to cellular. I think there are other advantages,particularly in lesser-developed countries.  But, there still is notenough capacity in the satellite system to see that as an alternativefor the fiber optic network that we would have on the ground.     Wallet PCs clearly would need to use some form of a broadbanddelivery system, said Mundie, who added Teledesic could be one of theanswers.     "Today, it doesn't exist," Mundie said.  "It might take Teledesicor something akin to that to produce that kind of capability.  Ourgoal is to write software for these families of products.  We're realadvocates of any communications technology that produces moreconnectivity between communications and computers.  It gives us anopportunity to write more software."  ...Wallet PCs Are a Futuristic Concept     Jon Magill, group product manager of Microsoft's personal systemsdivision, said wallet PCs are a "futuristic concept, not a product orproject announcement."     "Coverage provided by satellite networks certainly would enablepeople to go anywhere in the world," Magill said.  "But, more cost-effective local wireless solutions would probably be the kind ofthings you would see sooner rather than later."     The wallet PCs could take various forms.  The PCs may include avideo screen and easily fit into a person's pocket, Magill said. Microsoft likely would not manufacture the PCs, since its specialty issoftware.     The applications of a wallet PC could include electronic commerceor interacting with ATMs at local banks, Magill said.  The wallet alsocould carry digitized photographs of family members, he added.  Awallet PC could be the size of a pager or a personal organizer, Magillsaid.     "It also could be an extension of the watch that we worked onwith Timex not too long ago," Magill said.  "You could imagine ittaking on a form factor not too dissimilar from a checkbook."     Magill said the device would need to be small enough for peopleto carry it with them all the time.  The PC also would serve as anelectronic badge that provide identification for people, he added.     "It could also have some interactions with a house," Magill said. "When a person approaches his or her home, the device could signal forthe garage door to open and the house lights to turn on."     Magill added, "It can take away many of the mundane things thatwe need to do day-to-day."Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996U.S. PLANS TO UPDATE LAUNCH PACT WITH RUSSIA TO CREATE PARITY     U.S. government officials are expected to offer Russia anopportunity to launch up to 20 U.S. commercial payloads intogeostationary orbit by the end of 2001.     Indeed, negotiators from the two countries likely will meet inthe coming months, well-placed sources said.     Such an offer would give Russia a similar deal to the one reachedlast month with the Ukraine and another deal struck last year betweenChina and the United States, the sources said.  However, the U.S.position has yet to be finalized and no firm dates have been set tobegin talks with the Russians, the sources added.     The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has not issued aformal U.S.  position about what Russia will be offered in any suchtalks.  However, some senior officials in the Clinton administrationsupport giving the Russians parity with the Ukraine and China, whichhave received permission to launch up to 20 U.S. commercial payloadseach into geostationary orbit by the end of 2001.     Russia currently has a deal that limits it to nine launches ofU.S. commercial satellites by the end of 2001.  The gap has caused theRussians to call for a review of their deal.  Such a request likelywill be honored early this year.     On the other hand, McDonnell Douglas Corp. officials havecomplained their company's plans to develop a Delta 3 rocket have beenundermined by the U.S. policy of rapidly increasing the number offoreign launches of U.S. commercial satellites during the last twoyears.  Launchers from non-market countries receive subsidies fromtheir governments that give them an unfair pricing advantage, thoseMcDonnell Douglas officials charge.  ...U.S. Official Defends Deal     Frank Weaver, associate administrator for the TransportationDepartment's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), saidthe agreement includes a variety of pricing factors to ensure an evenplaying field.     "The purpose of that [language] is just to ensure that ourproviders have been given fair consideration," Weaver said.  "Thatwill not necessarily stop a satellite service provider from goingforward [and using a foreign launcher].  But we do want to make surethat the U.S. launch industry has an opportunity to be fairlyconsidered in the deployment of anything."     The latest U.S. launch pact allows the Ukraine to win up to fivecontracts for geostationary launches.  An additional 11 GEO launchesalso could be won by an international partnership with Ukrainianparticipation.     Those 11 sea-based launches would be conducted by a joint venturethat includes a subsidiary of the Boeing Co. [BA] (SN, Dec. 18, 1995,p. 10).  Up to four other launches--three involving the Boeingventure--may be permitted if the demand for launches grows during thelife of the agreement.     Boeing, which will manage the joint venture, must obtain alicense to conduct launches on behalf of the partnership, Weaver saidin a recent news briefing about the deal.  Boeing's joint ventureincludes Russia's RSC Energia, the Ukraine's NPO Yuzhnoye and Norway'sKvaerner a.s.     The partnership is intended to build a launch infrastructure onan ocean-going platform and conduct launches from international watersin the Pacific Ocean.  The U.S. government had refused to allow thepartnership to launch any U.S. commercial payloads until the tradedeal with the Ukraine had been reached.     In contrast, Lockheed Martin Corp. is not required to obtain alicense for its role as the marketing agent for launches provided byRussia's Khrunichev Enterprise and NPO Energia.Commercial Satellites Play Role in Bosnia Space-based assets, many ofthem owned and operated by commercial entities, will play a vital rolein the U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, a U.S. Air Forceofficial said recently.  A mixed fleet of commercial and militarysatellites are being used for a variety of applications, includingcommunications and reconnaissance, said Maj. Gen. David Vesely,commander of the 14th Air Force.  Heavy demands on the military's owncommunications system--the Defense Satellite Communications System(DSCS)--during Operation Desert Storm demonstrated the need for morebandwidth during large-scale operations, reports our sisterpublication DEFENSE DAILY.  Since then, the Pentagon has begun toexploit the capabilities of commercial satellites for some of itscommunications needs, especially for high data-rate transmissions,Pentagon officials said.  DSCS is being augmented by commercialcommunications satellites and those owned by NATO for Bosnian mission. These satellites recently have undergone "minor repositioning" tooptimize their use in the Bosnian theater, Vesely said.  The militaryalso is using commercial remote sensing systems, in addition to itsown reconnaissance satellites, in support of the Bosnia mission. Multispectral imagery provided by the Spot satellite system, owned bySpot Image Corp., already is being fed directly into the Europeantheater from Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and plans are currently inthe works to set up a similar feed from U.S. Landsat satellites. Other space-based assets at use in the Bosnian theater includemilitary and commercial weather satellites, and the Pentagon's GlobalPositioning Satellite (GPS) system.Back to Headline List CopyrightSATELLITE NEWS via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SATELLITE BRIEFSMcDonnell Douglas Conducts Tests on Potential EELV Engine     McDonnell Douglas Corp. successfully completed tests for a liquidhydrogen, liquid oxygen rocket engine that the company hopes to use inits Delta 4 family of boosters being developed for the U.S. AirForce's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, the companysaid recently.

Every other week, THE SPECTRUM REPORT will provide themost in-depth coverage of issues critical to the globalallocation of frequency including regulatory actions, WARC '92,new technologies and international coverage.  Now here's thenews:Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SPECTRUM REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1991BROADCASTERS MAY BE HIT WITH SPECTRUM TAX; NAB READY TO FIGHT           The Treasury Department is rumored to be draftingspectrum tax legislation to combat the growing deficit; theNational Association of Broadcasters (NAB) said it is prepared tofight.  The federal government is "desperate for money" and onthe surface this is an attractive idea, NAB spokesman Walt Wurfeltold THE SPECTRUM REPORT.  The Congressional Budget Officeestimated the deficit for fiscal year 1991 at $253 billion and$262 billion the following year.           Administration officials had drafted similarlegislation last year in an effort to cut the budget deficit by$50 billion.  Under the previous plan, most stations would berequired to pay 5% of their annual revenue for use of thespectrum.  Smaller broadcasters--television stations generatingless than $2 million in annual revenues and radio stations makingless than $100,000 per year--would be required to pay 2.5% oftheir revenues.           "It's pretty clear that once on the table, you neverget off the table," Wurfel said.  We feel it will be part of thebudget plan in some way, he added.           The NAB is opposed to a spectrum tax, said Wurfel.  "Wedon't believe it would be fair to tax broadcasters becausebroadcasters provide a lot of community service," he told us.           Wurfel said he wanted to make it clear that NAB isopposed to a tax--a fee assessed annually on all broadcasters.  Atax is not the same as a spectrum fee such as a one time chargeon newly unallocated spectrum, he said.           "That's not to say we are for fees of any kind or [for]spectrum auctions--we've never really been enthusiastic aboutanything that represents fees on spectrum," Wurfel told us.           Wurfel said there will be hearings in the spring."Some believe we need to pay more than simply providing publicservice.  We'll be preparing for these hearings and discussionson the Hill to point out what broadcasters do for the communityand the responsibilities we take--which is the way we pay forspectrum," he said.           The bill is said to be drafted so that it would fallunder the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance and House Ways andMeans Committees rather than the Commerce Committees.Broadcasters also are against this set-up of the bill because theCommerce Committee handles broadcast issues and thus, has abetter understanding of the industry.           NAB said the first place it expects to see spectrumfees is when President Bush sends his budget to Congress--thefirst Monday in February.  It has been rumored that the presidentwill mention it in his State of the Union address but, Wurfelsaid that "it's an outside chance."The Dingell Bill Will Come to Life Again This Year           Although broadcasters may be hit by a spectrum tax,some good news still may come for other spectrum users in thelegislative process.  Dennis Fitzgibbons, spokesman for House andEnergy Commerce Committee, told THE SPECTRUM REPORT that the billintroduced by House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) will, indeed, be introduced again early this session.  "Itwill be much the same bill as before," Fitzgibbons told us.           The Dingell bill, if passed, will free up some 200 MHzof government-owned spectrum.  The bill passed the House lastyear but not the Senate.  "Essentially the bill sets up amechanism in which commercial users could use the spectrum," saidFitzgibbons.           "For 20 years or more there has been talk of some typeof transfer of federal spectrum to the private sector.  This isthe first concrete move in that direction.  We have to recognizeJohn Dingell for his foresight," E.B. Kitchen, president of theNational Association of Business & Educational Radio told us.Kitchen: Auctions May Have Held the Dingell Bill Up Last Year           Kitchen said he believed the bill faired well bypassing the House but not the Senate, and that he was"optimistic" that it will pass the next time.  "The hangup wasthe whole issue of auctions.  The bill had language thatprohibited the auction of the 200 MHz of government spectrum andthe Republicans did not want that limitation--they wanted thatoption," said Kitchen.           The bill probably will be reintroduced without thatlanguage, Kitchen speculated.  If the bill does not include theauction clause, Kitchen said he believed the bill will pass.           "I would rather have the Dingell bill pass even withoutthe auction exclusion.  We'll fight the auction battle anotherday," added Kitchen.           Hearings and mark-ups for the Dingell bill probablywill occur in February, Fitzgibbons told us.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SPECTRUM REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1991FCC RADIO CHIEF SAYS TECHNOLOGYGREATEST HOPE IN SPECTRUM FIGHT           Emphasizing the need for improved technologies and moreefficient use of existing radio spectrum, Ralph Haller, chief ofthe FCC's Private Radio Bureau said, "the current lack ofspectrum has troublesome competitive implications for ourcountry."     Speaking at the recent general membership session of theSpecial Industrial Radio Service Association Inc. (SIRSA) in SanDiego, Calif., Haller stressed the importance of radio.  "Wheneconomic times are tough, radio's ability to save time and moneyassumes ever greater importance," he said.     Haller pointed to several time saving devices of the radioincluding radio controlled traffic lights that enable traffic toflow more quickly, security devices that call the police whensomeone steals your car and vast pipeline networks across theUnited States which are controlled remotely via radio links.Haller said radio also offers new technologies for the future.For instance, up-to-date maps displayed on the dashboard of carsand personal communication devices.  But, he said the downside to"all of these nifty new uses" is that they require spectrum.           "For those of you out there who are accustomed tothinking about radio frequencies in proprietary terms, I think itis going to be harder and harder to maintain high walls around`your' frequencies," said Haller.  As spectrum becomes morevaluable, those who don't use their frequencies will findthemselves under pressure from those who have an immediate andpressing need for them," he added.What are the Answers?           Haller said there probably will be a need for channelpools to serve the radio users with similar interests.  TheNational Telecommunications and Information Administration(NTIA), a unit of the Commerce Department, is encouraging federalagencies to pool their channels to operate trunked systems.  NTIAhas released a request for proposals that might result in trunkedmulti-user systems that are managed by private companies.           "I also think that more spectrum sharing will be oneresponse to try to accommodate these needs," said Haller, "and Idon't necessarily mean sharing in the traditional sense."  Byusing digital packet radio to fill pockets of otherwise dead airtime (the pauses between the words of natural speech),individuals can increase the amount of frequency sharing withouta perceptible increase in channel congestion, said Haller.           "Technology, of course, is the greatest hope forspectrum salvation," he said.  Haller said the FCC is examiningtime division multiple access (TDMA) digital modulation and codedivision multiple access (CDMA) technologies to "create" morespectrum.           The new transmission schemes, CDMA and TDMA, areassociated most often with personal communication services."There is pressure for the U.S. to do even more in this fastmoving area lest we fall behind Europe and Japan," he said.The FCC Supports New Technologies Through Pioneer Preference           Haller said the FCC is faced with the task of "tryingto find new ways to do more with less."  The FCC is trying toaccommodate new services through pioneer preference--givingpioneers of new communication services a preference in thespectrum allocation process.           The private radio version of this pioneer's preferencerecently was adopted by the FCC.  The commission proposed thatpeople who find an idle private radio channel that is subject toFCC takeback be rewarded for their efforts by getting "firstcrack" at being licensed on that channel, said Haller.  "Ineffect, valuable unused radio spectrum could be recycled," heexplained.           Another way the Private Radio Bureau is trying to domore with less is through conditional licensing processing.Applicants on certain shared private radio frequencies may, ifthey certify to having met specific criteria, can begin operationunder temporary authority immediately upon sending their licensedocuments to the FCC, said Haller.           In order to "create" more spectrum, said Haller, theFCC is looking at the possibility of refarming the spectrum below450 MHz.  "This spectrum is almost always shared and oftencrowded--with new technology, we should be able to bring reliefto users," he said.           Additionally, Haller said the FCC recently concluded anagreement with the Department of Communications of Canada to usefrequencies in the 821-824/866-869 MHz (public safety) and the896-901/935-940 MHz (business and industrial land transportation)bands within 87 miles of the United States and Canadian border.           "Licensing in the bands can begin immediately whichshould result in improved mobile communications service to thepublic," said Haller.What Can Spectrum Users Do?           The FCC is not the only party with a role to play infostering technological advances, innovation, better regulationand wiser use of the spectrum, said Haller.  As the demand forspectrum increases, Haller said the FCC will be forced toencourage spectrum efficiency, even to demand it.           "I encourage you to start thinking in terms of radio asa scarce resource than as a box with an antenna that is a minoradjunct to your main business."Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SPECTRUM REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1991PUBLIC SAFETY LEANING TOWARD FDMA DIGITAL STANDARD           NEW YORK CITY--Project 25, the brainchild of AssociatedPublic-Safety Communications Officers (APCO), together with theNational Association of State Telecommunications Directors(NASTD) and various governmental agencies, is leaning heavilytoward choosing frequency division multiple access (FDMA) in itsquest for a digital standard for public safety radio.           "[Project 25] made a decision that the future [digital]public safety systems will use FDMA [frequency division multipleaccess], providing an immediate improvement of 2-1," StuartMeyer, Project 25 committee member, told an audience recently atthe Technical Symposium at the Radio Club of America's 81stAnniversary Dinner, held at the New York Athletic Club.           J. Sharpe Smith, editor of our sister publicationINDUSTRIAL COMMUNICATIONS, was at the dinner and reports that assoon as better voice coding is developed, a 4-1 spectrumimprovement will be achieved.           The technical committee of Project 25 has recommendedFDMA, and the steering committee has given its blessing but itwants more information about which modulation scheme will bechosen.  The modulation scheme choices include c/4 BPQSK and 4-Level FSK [frequency shift key].  c/4 requires linear amplifiers,while the other method does not.Spectrum Shortage Spurred Digital Standards Development           In 1988, Congress mandated 6 MHz more spectrum in the800 MHz band.  Since then, Public Safety has run low of spectrum,and in some metropolitan areas, has run out.  The FCC hascountered calls for more spectrum allocation with a challenge toimprove spectrum efficiency.  Project 25 was Public Safety'sanswer to the FCC.  It probably will go back to the FCC withsuggestions in the next 12-18 months, which may lead to a Noticeof Proposed Rule Making.           "The FCC has come out with a Notice of Inquiry and saidto Public Safety, `you folks made out pretty good with thisfederally mandated spectrum, but what are you going to do abouttomorrow?'" Meyer said.  "The commission went on to suggest thatPublic Safety look at more spectrally efficient modulationtechniques in the future."  National Public Safety PlanningAdvisory Committee (NPSPAC) developed a channel splitting plan,from 25-12.5 KHz, which provided an easily implementable plan inthe past.  Meyer, a member of NPSPAC, described the formulationof digital standards as the next step.           The committee considered 3 access schemes: codedivision multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access(TDMA) and FDMA.  Project 25's major concerns include spectrumefficiency, encryption and quality of signal.  The committeedecided that CDMA would not fill the needs of Public Safety andgovernment radio.  "We cannot use CDMA because it requires largecontiguous blocks of spectrum, which we don't have," said ArtMcDole, project steering board member and technical advisor.           TDMA, while popular with the cellular industry, hassome special requirements that hurt it in the Public Safetyarena.  TDMA requires a central controller to select the timeslot.  "When we are looking at a dozen independent policestations, with a few mobiles each, that don't want to work into acommon system, we start to get problems with TDMA," McDole said.Another problem of TDMA is its need for linear amplifiers, whichare not as efficient as Class C amplifiers or non-linearamplifiers, McDole added.           "We've done a tremendous amount of work with themanufacturers, weighing the merits of FDMA versus TDMA," McDolesaid.  "We have not taken a positive and final action...but weare leaning heavily toward FDMA, because of the problems ofadapting TDMA to [Public Safety]."FDMA is Good for Starters           "FDMA fits into our current time constraints.  It isn'tthe step forward that we hoped for.  It is a short-term answer.What we are looking for is a clear migration to advancedtechnology to improve spectrum efficiency," said Craig Jorgensen,NASTD immediate past president.  "Theoretically, TDMA helps uswith spectrum efficiency, but the linear amplifiers are acritical issue to power consumption."  There is some questionabout a non-ionizing radiation problem with TDMA, which couldcause cell tissue damage to the user, but it hasn't been provenyet, Jorgensen added.           "We want to find a migration path to new technology, 4-5 years down the line, to be more spectrally efficient,"Jorgensen said.  "We also want flexibility within the standard toallow for enhanced features."           Why have standards?  "First, we must intercommunicate.We must be able to talk with each other during a disaster," saidMcDole.           "There are a thousand reasons that we can't have onesystem that can't talk to another."  Standards also allow a userto have multiple sources and possibly lower prices.Group Will Study How Digital Modulation Affects SpectrumRequirements           Project 25, which has been in existence for one year,has a steering committee, currently co-chaired by John Powell,APCO vice president, and Jorgensen.  The steering committee,which will make the final decision, consists of 3 members of eachorganization and 3 members from the federal government.  Twosubcommittees were established under the steering committee: atechnical group and a spectrum group.           "I think that we've gotten into a huge, huge arena,"said McDole.  "Recognizing the scope of what we have to do, Ithink that we've made excellent progress."           The technical group is responsible for working out allof the details of the standard relating to access and modulationmethods.  The spectrum group is concentrating on the logistics ofmigrating from analog to digital technology and how it willaffect the spectrum requirements.  Each subcommittee is open toindustry participation.           "All of the manufacturers are represented on both ofthe committees, and we have input from all of the branches of thefederal government," McDole said.  "A number of manufacturers,including GE and Motorola, have made presentations to the Project25 committee."TIA Will Help to Formulate Standards           In an FCC filing, Project 25 said it looked forward toworking with the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA),but it officially has not begun its relationship with theassociation.  TIA is a trade organization that makes it possiblefor competing manufacturers to meet in the same room and helpformulate standards and avoid antitrust problems.       Once thestandard is written, project principals are hoping for industryacceptance, not a mandated standard.           "[TIA has] offered help to assist them, but it is stillwaiting for their response," Meyer said.  Jorgensen anticipatesthat TIA will be brought in as early as mid-February, and hecalled the participation of the association "critical" to thesuccess of the venture.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE SPECTRUM REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1991WARC CHALLENGE--FINDING SPECTRUM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES           The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC)challenge in 1992, said Bob Raish with the law firm Fletcher,Heald and Hildreth, is to decide how to superimpose all the newcommunications technology upon a spectrum that is totallyallocated.           Raish, speaking at the recent forum, "WARC '92:Allocations for the Year 2000 and Beyond," sponsored by theWashington Annenburg Program, said the most critical focus willbe on the 1-3 GHz band where new technology requirements alreadyexist for a substantial portionand where the "have or have not" confrontation is the greatestdue to industry interests.           "There must be a balance between spectrum accommodationand technological advancement," said Raish.  Raish also said theUnited States faces a dilemma: whether it should keep up withcompetition or remain entrenched.           Travis Marshall, senior vice president and director ofgovernment relations at Motorola, said the market should driveallocations, not technology.           "The mobile radio is an explosive growth area doublingspectrum needs every 5 years," said Marshall.           However, Michael Rau of the National Association forBroadcasters (NAB) did not seem as optimistic about the effectsof WARC '92.  Rau said U.S. broadcasters do not need the WARC."The WARC issue concerns satellite-delivered high-definitiontelevision (HDTV)," said Rau.  NAB does not believe HDTV isneeded in the United States.           Rau also said that he did not feel the United Statesshould adopt a position that favors entrepreneurial technology,especially if that technology duplicates existing services thatare meeting consumers needs.  "The U.S. should focus on pragmaticpolicy rather than idealistic or theoretical frameworks," addedRau.

(IMM).           HNS will create a nationwide cellular services network,offering customers one-stop shopping for cellular phones atGeneral Motors dealers.  The company, owned by GM HughesElectronics, will offer dual-mode phones, switches and cell siteequipment on a turnkey basis to carriers.  HNS will supply theswitches through a long-term agreement with France-based Alcatel.           "Everyone is vigorously trying to update the technologyand increase  spectrum efficiency," said Robert Wysor,consultant, Economic & Management Consultants Inc. (EMCI).  "Inthe long run, that is very good for the industry."A `Voice Activated Channel' Will Employ Unused Channel Capacity           E-TDMA achieves 15 times analog capacity versus 3 timesanalog, which is the current TDMA expectation, by using digitalspeech interpolation (DSI).  This technique assigns the channelonly when the person is speaking.  In other words, time slots areonly assigned during actual talk time.  In any 2-waycommunication, 65% of the channel capacity goes unused, becausewhile one person speaks the other channel remains silent.  IMM'sanswer to the dilemma of accessing that unused capacity could becalled a "voice-activated channel."           "The Hughes proposal will only assign a channel tosomeone when they are speaking," said George Calhoun, IMM seniorvice president.  "So when they are not speaking, they don't takeup any part of [the] channel."           In the existing TDMA technology, a user receives aperiodic time slot whether he is speaking or not, and silence isbroadcast to the one who is talking.  E-TDMA takes advantage ofthe silent time slots.Hughes' Phones Will be Compatible with Current Standard           The Hughes dual-mode phones will be compatible with theindustry standard.  "It uses the same slot structure [6-slots],same channel structure, same 30 KHz bandwidth, as in IS-54.  Itfits within that framework without any modification.  It uses theslots for different purposes, and some of the control informationis different but it is allowed by the standard," Calhoun said.           "IS-54 provides the framework in which other things canbe implemented, but it's certainly not the end of the line.  Thebelief that CDMA was 20 times and TDMA was 3 times was simplywrong," said Calhoun.Back to Headline List WT03-B13-23IA086-000622-B040-271http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te141.html 205.156.212.5 19970122052050 text/html 65654HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:18:35 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:29 GMTContent-length: 65467Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te141.html Sample Issue Copyright STATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNet January 12, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Universal Service, Federal Preemption Are Focus Of NCSL Meeting (795 words) MCI Asks N.Y.

Speakers also discussed whether definitions ofuniversal service should embrace "advanced" telecom services,including Internet access.     In a hearing held by NCSL's Agriculture and Trade Committee,Clayton Parker, Director-intergovernmental affairs in the Office ofU.S. Trade Representative, said the U.S. is prepared to "freeze"state-level telecom regulations at their current level as part ofthe GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations overbasic telecom services.       The offer to freeze state regulation is contingent on U.S.trading partners' agreeing to liberalize their own markets. Meanwhile, the federal government would have to obtain consensus onthe proposal from the states, Mr. Parker said.  He noted thatpassage of federal telecom legislation would render the offer moot.     At a Commerce and Communications Committee hearing, DebraBerlyn, Executive Director of the National Association of StateUtility Consumer Advocates, told state legislators that "effectivecompetition will protect ratepayers and offer them more benefitsthan regulation" will.  But deregulation without effectivecompetition is "the worst of all possible worlds" for ratepayers,she added.       State legislators should "look in their own backyards" to findthe "most interesting, innovative" developments in telecom markets,said Jamie Cooper, Associate Director of the Center for PolicyAlternatives in Washington.  In conjunction with the BentonFoundation, the center this month is issuing a progress reportdetailing what states are doing to develop telecom infrastructure,promote uses of new technology, and encourage innovation, Ms.Cooper said.     Jeffrey A. Chester, Executive Director of the Washington-basedCenter for Media Education, said universal service should includeaccess to personal computers and online services, he said.       "Electronic redlining"--the exclusion of low-income areas whendeploying advanced services--is a real concern for CME.  Privacy isanother concern, and it is an issue "that the feds are not going todeal with," Mr. Chester added.  Scott Cooper,Manager-telecommunications policy for Intel Corp., said, "Peopleneed more bandwidth than they can get over analog copper wire."     But Mary Rouleau, Director-state legislation for the AmericanAssociation of Retired Persons, urged legislators to look at claimsthat investment in network upgrades are "demand-driven."  Shesuggested that such upgrades are being made "on spec" and thatratepayers--who may not want advanced services--will have to payfor them.  Richard L. Cimerman, Director-state telecommunicationsassociation affairs for the National Cable Television Association,echoed that concern.  He said proposals to include broadbandofferings in the definition of universal service will amount to a$78 million "tax" on ratepayers.     The National Governors' Association wants Congress to ensurethat federal legislation will not affect any state rules onintraLATA (local access and transport area) toll presubscriptionthat already are in effect, said Tim Masanz, NGA's GroupDirector-economic development and commerce.  He noted that fourstates--Arizona, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania--either recently have acted, or are about to act, on this issue.     Kevin McCarty, Assistant Executive Director-energy,transportation, and communications for the U.S. Conference ofMayors, said the federal legislative debate "has created the ideathat there is something special" about telecom service providers asoccupants of public rights-of-way.  Under the competitive marketmodel, "we will be retrofitting public thoroughfares" to an extentnever before seen, allowing new market entrants use of thoserights-of-way, he said.  Companies are going to Congress and askingfor the same free use of public rights-of-way that was given totelcos "a hundred years ago," he added.     Mary McDermott, Vice President-regulatory affairs for the U.S.Telephone Association, argued that while competition should replaceregulation as the "paradigm" for the industry, it is important toensure universal service.  "In many places competition can ensureaffordable service, but not everywhere," she added.       Language in the pending federal legislation should beclarified to ensure that states retain jurisdiction over intrastateuniversal service funds, said Lee Palagyi, an Ohio Public UtilitiesCommission staff member representing the views of the NationalAssociation of State Utility Regulators.     Bob Fogel, Assistant Legislative Director of the NationalAssociation of Counties, said local government representatives are"pretty close" to an agreement with the wireless industry on zoningauthority for cellular and personal communications service (PCS)towers.       Nicholas W. Allard, Counsel to the Wireless Cable AssociationInternational, suggested that state and local governmentsincreasingly are viewing telecom service providers as a source ofrevenue.  He warned that new taxes can be "duplicative" of existingones, saying, "Whenever you hear the phrase 'level the playingfield,' you should hold on to something, because you're about to betilted over."Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996MCI Asks N.Y. PSC for 'Neutral' USF, Wants NYNEX Price Plan SetAside     Attacking NYNEX-New York on two fronts, MCI TelecommunicationsCorp. has asked the New York Public Service Commission toreconsider whether the telephone company needs a universal servicesubsidy and has requested that a state court overturn the PSC'sapproval of NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan.  MCIsubmitted to the PSC data from a universal service cost study itsaid showed that NYNEX's residential local exchange revenues aremore than two times the economic costs it incurs to provide basiclocal exchange service.     NYNEX's annual revenues from residential services amount to$1.6 billion, but its total costs to provide those services equal$640 million, MCI said.  The study indicated that a "limited"universal service fund of about $10 million per year "is needed toallow local competition to develop in the high-cost areas" ofNYNEX's service territory.  MCI asked the PSC to develop a"competitively neutral mechanism to collect and distributeuniversal service subsidies where they are truly needed."     The universal service cost study "confirms what MCI has longmaintained:  NYNEX overcharges its own customers and long distancecompanies, does not need a subsidy to deliver basic local serviceat affordable rates, and uses those excessive revenues, in part, tosupport its other competitive ventures as well as to realizeexcessive profit," said Donna Sorgi, Director-state regulatory andgovernment affairs for MCI's Eastern Region.     The study found the average cost of service in New York Cityto be $7 per residential customer, while NYNEX receives an averageof $26.85 in revenues per customer, MCI said.  Meanwhile, in somerural areas--particularly in upstate New York--the cost of servicemay be as high as $40 per month, while revenues "may only be around$16 per month."  Those are areas that "actually need" a universalservice subsidy, MCI said.     MCI's research undercuts NYNEX's reasoning that "enormousovercharges for access fees" are needed to provide subsidies foruniversal service, MCI argued.  According to a chart released byMCI, NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan allows it to charge5.6 cents per minute for intrastate access to its network, whileits "economic cost" to provide that service is 1 cent per minute(see chart).       In its Dec. 18 filing with the commission, MCI also submittedthe "Benchmark Cost Model" it developed in conjunction with NYNEX,Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc.  That model was filed in an FCCproceeding on revising universal service support programs (SLCR,Oct. 20, 1995).  The model "produces 'benchmark' costs for theprovision of basic telephone service in each census block groupwithin a state," MCI told the PSC.     Applying the model to New York yields a statewide average costfor basic universal service of $12.02 per month, compared with anationwide average of $16.71 per month, MCI reported.     MCI also sought a suspension of "the 'play or pay'intercarrier compensation rates currently in effect in [NYNEX's]Tariff No. 914."  It added, "There is no factual basis to supportthe commission's arbitrary classification of local exchangecompetitors as either 'players' or 'payers,' based upon theuntested and unproven assumption that residential service requiresa subsidy from other services."  MCI asked the commission to reopenan earlier stage of its proceeding on universal service and thetransition to competitive local exchange markets.MCI Asks Court To Reject NYNEX Regulatory Plan     On Dec. 18 MCI asked the New York State Supreme Court (Countyof Albany) to set aside portions of the PSC's order in "Track 2" ofits incentive regulation proceeding (case no. 92-C-0665), in whichthe PSC had approved NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan. MCI alleged that the commissioners had reached their decision onthe plan "in private session in violation of the Open MeetingsLaw."     MCI also asked the court to set aside those portions of thecommission's "Track 1" order in the same proceeding that allowedNYNEX to "continue to collect $153.3 million in revenues in excessof its annual revenue requirement"--the revenue required to recoupits costs and provide a "reasonable return" to investors.  The PSChad ordered NYNEX to "set aside" those funds "to be used inaccordance with commission determinations to be made in the futureto fund incentives for [NYNEX] to improve its performance," MCItold the court.  All but $27 million of the set-aside funds havebeen released to NYNEX as service-quality incentive awards, itadded.  The price targets the PSC set for certain services were"based on a wholly untested and unproven assumption that localresidential service requires a subsidy from those services," MCIsaid.     A NYNEX spokesman said MCI is making "the same tired, old,muddled argument that is as inaccurate today as it was" two yearsago, when work on NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan began. "MCI is simply looking for an access rate reduction that is deeperthan it got under the plan," which took effect in September, hesaid.  The plan "strikes a good balance" between competitors,NYNEX, the state, and consumers, who will see about $2 billion inlocal exchange and toll rate reductions over seven years, he added.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996Utilities Share Problems of State, Local Agencies in Relocatingfrom 2 GHz BandBy M.J. Richter     Like many state and local government agencies, numerous membercompanies of UTC (formerly known as the UtilitiesTelecommunications Council) are incumbent licensees in the 2gigahertz microwave band.  Also like state and local governmententities, these investor-owned and publicly owned utilities,electric cooperatives, municipal utility departments, and naturalgas pipeline companies traditionally have used their 2 GHzmicrowave radio systems for their internal operations, rather thanfor revenue-producing services.  In a recent interview with SLCR,UTC staff attorney Thomas Goode explained how the FCC's decision toreallocate the 2 GHz spectrum to personal communications service(PCS) operators is affecting many of the association's nearly 2,000member companies.      SLCR:  What does the FCC's decision mean for the day-to-dayoperations of UTC member companies, which rely heavily on their 2GHz microwave radio systems for internal communications?     Goode:  The microwave systems that they now operate in the 2GHz bands have not been replaced for some period of time, becauseUTC member companies have been waiting for resolution of the statusof this particular band, to see whether it would be reclassifiedfor use by the PCS licensees.  There's been a lot of uncertaintyabout what the rules would be, how long they would have to moveout, whether they'd have to bear the cost themselves.  So therehasn't been as much activity as there probably normally would havebeen concerning the replacement of analog systems with digitalsystems.     There has been some movement from the band, simply to get outof that [uncertain] situation and get to another band--the 6 GHzband, for instance.     There are some that have waited, and now they're in a positionwhere they are co-primary in the bands, which means they can staythere forever, at least according to current FCC rules.  But theyhave to deal with the issue of involuntary relocation at the handsof PCS licensees.     SLCR:  If they're co-primary and therefore can stay forever ifthey want to, what if a PCS licensee wants the bands they're on?     Goode:  Essentially, the way the rules work now, the PCSlicensee can operate on the band to the extent that he does notinterfere with an incumbent licensee.  And they are co-primary withthe incumbent licensee.  Now, if the PCS licensees are unable tooperate without causing interference to an incumbent licensee, ordo not want to deal with the hassle of having to work around theincumbent system, they can enter into mandatory negotiations--forcethe incumbent to come to the table and discuss the relocationterms.     If they cannot come to a mutually agreeable resolution orrelocation agreement, the PCS licensees can force the incumbentout.  They can go to the FCC and request an involuntary relocationof an incumbent system.       If they do that, they have to pay all costs associated withthe relocation; they have to move the incumbent to another band;they have to make sure that the facilities they give them arecomparable to what the incumbent had in the 2 GHz bands; they haveto guarantee that the replacement is seamless, that this wholetransition process out of the 2 GHz band does not disrupt theincumbent's. . .communications.     SLCR:  To date, have any UTC members that are incumbentlicensees of that spectrum successfully negotiated their relocationwith PCS providers?     Goode:  Yes, a number have.  [The negotiated terms andconditions] are subject in most cases to a nondisclosure agreement. I could definitely say, however, that a number of successfulnegotiations have occurred--and are occurring right now.  Not onlyhave they done it but, from what we've heard from the industry,both sides have been very happy with what they've gotten out ofsome of these agreements.     SLCR:  Are they attempting to negotiate whole-systemchangeouts, or are UTC members making piecemeal arrangements withmultiple PCS licensees?     Goode:  Both.  The answer to that question depends on theincumbents, what their systems are like and what they're lookingfor out of this whole transition process.  Some incumbent systemsare structured such that they cannot tolerate a piecemealrelocation.  Every time you relocate a single link, you have apotential for disrupting the entire system.  Some of these systemsare providing such vital communications under. . .such uniquetechnical constraints that they need to be relocated entirely atone time, a whole-system changeout.     Others are looking simply to relocate certain links, and theirsystems either are more robust or they're able to somehow engineeraround [any problems].  I know that both [types of relocation] arehappening.     SLCR:  What do UTC members think of the FCC's proposed$400,000 cap on the recovery by PCS licensees of the costs theyincur in relocating incumbent users, e.g., UTC members?     Goode:  Our members are very concerned about this $400,000 capbecause the incumbent microwave systems are unique.  There is noeasy way to quantify how much it would take to move a [given]system.   Without analyzing each individual system, the costs aregoing to vary greatly from one system to another. . .     When you put a cap on reimbursement costs, even though itdoesn't directly affect how much money can be paid to an incumbent--because the cap is only on what the PCS provider can seek fromother PCS providers--there is going to be a fairly direct causalrelationship between that cap and how much a licensee will pay torelocate a link.  [PCS licensees] will be cognizant of the factthat they only get reimbursed up to a certain amount, and they'regoing to be pushing to keep the amount of money that they pay underthat.     SLCR:  How are incumbent UTC licensees determining themarket-based value of their microwave operations?     Goode:  I think the main focus has not been on the fair-marketvalue, as much as on the replacement value.  Basically, whenincumbents are in negotiations with a PCS provider, they're lookingat two different elements of the costs--or the value--of thereplacement.  One, they're looking at the replacement facilities: Where do they need to go?  What will that facility look like?  Whatare the costs associated with moving, for instance, from a 2 GHzsystem to a 6 GHz system--hardware, software, labor charges, allthe elements that are built into the replacement?  The otherelement is the value [or price] that a PCS licensee is willing topay to get up and running more quickly than it otherwise might. And that is something that requires an analysis of what the valueof time is to a PCS licensee.     SLCR:  At this point in the negotiation/relocation process, doUTC members believe the FCC's two-year transition period for"voluntary negotiations" is long enough?     Goode:  I would guess that most members are happy with thatperiod, because they are guaranteed a one-year mandatory period, sothey can negotiate after that.  This voluntary negotiation periodgives them a time to prepare for this negotiation, to do thestudies and whatnot, to be in a position that when they arerequired--if they ever are required to negotiate during themandatory period--they will have the necessary information.     This two-year voluntary period is fixed, and the mandatoryperiod is not.  The mandatory period is a one-year period, but itdoesn't start until the incumbent receives a written notificationfrom the PCS licensee that they want to negotiate.       SLCR:  Do UTC members believe that voluntary negotiationsbetween the PCS industry and incumbent 2 GHz users will besuccessful, or do they think the FCC will have "to impose" somerelocation agreements?     Goode:  I think most members have very positive feelings thatthey will be successful in negotiating a relocation agreement andthat they will reach a voluntary agreement without having to beforced out of the band.       There's a lot of optimism that if a reasonable offer is made,they can and will try not only to meet the needs/wishes of the PCSlicensee in relocating from the band, but also to offer otherservices, such as certain infrastructure--dark fiber, cell sites,other types of services that will further the PCS deployment.  Ithink there's a lot of optimism among our members that it will endup being a win-win situation for both parties.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996APC, Maryland Agency Face PCS Interference Questions     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that itspersonal communications service (PCS) system is interfering withthe operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recentletter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) statedthat the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" tothe communications operations of light rail and bus servicesoperating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.       The letter was made public by UTC, the TelecommunicationsAssociation, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representingincumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertzspectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it haddistributed the letter without the MTA's consent.     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressedconcern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" theeffort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. The FCC recently clarified rules governing relocation efforts,further defining "good faith" negotiations between licensees.     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions lastfall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transitcommunications systems.  "These communications interruptions haveposed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred asa result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Browndeclined to comment further on the interference problems, notingthat it involves "a possible issue of litigation."     Ms. Schelle told SLCR that interference problems with the masstransit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported nopublic-safety problems resulting from interference between the tworadio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility torespond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, theattorney added.  The MTA received at least six such lettersindicating that APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, butMTA officials failed to respond to a single one.     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordinationnotices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCSlicensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informedof the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APCfully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license andcould not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA isoperating at a variance from those parameters."Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996Cable TV Interests Sue Chicago Over 7% 'Amusement Tax'     The cable TV industry has followed through on threats to sueChicago over a 7% "amusement tax" to be applied to the grossreceipts of companies offering video services and certain forms oflive entertainment (SLCR, Dec. 1, 1995).  As previously reported,the Chicago City Council adopted an ordinance imposing the taxeffective Jan. 1.  Cable TV companies oppose the amusement taxbecause they already pay local franchise fees, and satellite TVoperators oppose it because they have no "local" facilities. Companies in both industries fear that other cities may imposesimilar taxes.     Communications and Cable of Chicago, Inc., LaSalleTelecommunications, Inc., and South Chicago Cable, Inc.(collectively Chicago Cable TV) and the Cable Television andCommunications Association of Illinois have filed a joint lawsuit(case no. 95CH0011919) against the city of Chicago in the CircuitCourt of Cook County, Ill.  In a memorandum supporting their"motion for preliminary injunction," the plaintiffs argued that thenewly adopted amusement tax "singles out" cable TV operators andother providers of electronically delivered programming.  But theynoted that it does not tax "the broadcast television industry andother members of the press and print media that deliver" similarprogramming to Chicago residents.     Seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, theysaid application of the amusement tax "upon selected modes ofspeech violates the equal protection clauses of the United Statesand Illinois constitutions, as well as the First Amendment rightsof [the] plaintiffs and their subscribers."  In a statement, theyexpressed concern that imposing a tax on the estimated 33% ofChicago residents who subscribe to cable TV service "places adisproportionate and unfair burden on them to fund services thatbenefit the city's entire population."  They recommended thatChicago undertake further research on the issue before establishingtax precedents "that potentially could cover everything from onlinecomputer services to home shopping to hotel movie systems."Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996Pennsylvania Cable TV-Led Coalition's FiberSpan Concept Hasn't BeenRealizedBy Judith Freeman Mills     A year after a communications industry coalition--dominated bycable TV concerns--acquired the rights to the FiberSpanPennsylvania broadband infrastructure concept from the PennsylvaniaCable TV Association, the project seems all but dead.  The plan tooffer an array of  21st century telecom services in Pennsylvania byinterconnecting the state's cable TV systems "is not going forwardas originally planned," said Hal Estelle, FiberSpan's former ChiefOperating Officer and now a consultant to the project.  Althoughthe concept is changing, it "still exists," he emphasized.     The FiberSpan project was created by the state cable TVassociation in response to proposals--including legislativeinitiatives--for a statewide, fiber optic distance-learning andtelemedicine network.  The proposed legislation would have mandatedtelephone company investments in such a network.  The telcosestimated it would cost them $20 billion to $30 billion to buildthe network.  [Legislation was passed in 1993 that allows thestate's telcos to adopt alternative regulation if they submit plansto the Public Utility Commission for implementing a broadbandnetwork by the year 2015.--Ed.]     The original goal for FiberSpan was to link all cable headendsin Pennsylvania using fiber optic cables, augmented as needed withmicrowave, satellite, and coaxial connections to ensure universalaccess to the infrastructure.  The network would offer broadbanddelivery of two-way video, data, and voice communications togovernment buildings, schools, businesses, medical facilities, andhomes.  But the idea, seemingly simple in concept and technology,proved more complicated when it came to economics and politics.     After conducting research and development for the FiberSpanconcept, the state cable TV association sold its idea on Jan. 3,1995, to the industry coalition, which includes a few phonecompanies and energy utilities, as well as cable TV companies. FiberSpan Pennsylvania was transformed into a for-profitcorporation.  Jones Lightwave, a competitive access provider andsubsidiary of multiple system operator (MSO) Jones InternationalLtd., was one of about 20 major equity investors.  LightwavePresident Wallace Griffen served as Chairman of the FiberSpanboard.     Earlier this year a contract was drafted--but never signed--for Jones Lightwave to build and manage the FiberSpan project.  Forthe past several months FiberSpan officials have said a finalcontract would be issued soon.  But last week they made no suchpronouncement.  While Mr. Estelle said the parties were discussinga modified version of the FiberSpan Pennsylvania idea, otherproject officials were more blunt, saying the idea would neverbecome a reality.     "We are looking toward a possibility [that] FiberSpan willplay a role" in the infrastructure of Pennsylvania, Mr. Estellesaid.  "There is still an interest in developinglarger-than-regional infrastructures" and also in serving theentire state "in some form or fashion."  Talks are continuing"within the general framework" of the original idea, he continued.     But he explained that there have been problems gettingFiberSpan's investors to agree on "how to set up the corporationand the management structure."  In addition, he said, there havebeen questions about "the changing nature of competition, changingattitudes" and, significantly, "individual company plans for theirown regional networks."     Asked if too many companies are involved in FiberSpan, Mr.Estelle said, "You can't discount that."  But the number ofparticipants was not the core problem, he said, adding:  "It wouldbe more helpful if there was a more defined policy" from the stategovernment regarding statewide video, telephony, and datacommunications.     William Cologie, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Cable TVAssociation, suggested that smaller independent cable operatorsfelt "a reluctance to relinquish control."  But despite the failureof FiberSpan's participants to agree on the details of the plannedbroadband infrastructure, the idea is still valid, he maintained. The idea "makes sense for companies such as Lenfest Communicationsand Tele-Communications, Inc., that are rapidly consolidating" andinterconnecting their Pennsylvania operations, he added.  "Whywouldn't it make sense for the independent operators to jump on,too, he asked?"     In the race to wire the state with two-way multimedia-capablefiber optic lines, the FiberSpan participants still have "a coupleyears' head start in terms of infrastructure" compared to BellAtlantic-Pennsylvania, the Bell operating company that serves muchof the state, Mr. Cologie said.  The cable TV association is notconsidering taking on the FiberSpan effort again, he noted.     Mr. Griffen said he remains on FiberSpan's board and is "stillhopeful" that an infrastructure based on the FiberSpan concept willbecome a reality.  But he noted that cable TV companies, includingJones, are finding their timetables for launching high-speed data,telephony, and interactive video services to be more protractedthan originally expected.  The time spent on FiberSpan was notwasted, because it benefited related projects being undertaken atJones, he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996Regulators, Communications Industry Concerned about TransitionAheadBy Victoria Mason, Editor of  SLCR's sister publication,Telecommunications Reports     Attempts to craft federal legislation reforming the 1934Communications Act are having dramatic effects on all segments ofthe communications industry, even before a bill is signed into law. The transition to a new industry structure already is in fullswing, and while the legislation will codify new competitiveprinciples and regulatory roles, in many respects it may beoutdated from the beginning.     Instead of driving the current changes shaking thecommunications world, activities on Capitol Hill are onlyresponding to the unique combination of technological, economic,social, and political forces that have been shaping the industry'sfuture for some time.  But now, the pace has quickened.     Participants at a recent conference sponsored by the KMB VideoJournal kept repeating the views of one panelist:  "The currentexercise may be irrelevant--a little bit like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic."  The communications markets are in theprocess of reorganizing themselves in fundamental ways.  WhatCongress, a regulatory agency, or any company or industry segmentdoes at this point is likely to influence only the details.     The legislative developments, however, are focusing greaterpublic attention on an industry that accounts for a major portionof the nation's economy and that will have profound effects on howAmericans work and play, become educated, and receive health carein the 21st century.  And for regulators and business executives,the congressional debates have served as a "wake-up call":  There'slittle time left for the perennial arguments about what theindustry should look like in the future, whether one businesses'"level playing field" gives it advantages, and how to carve up amarket that is growing exponentially.     Some regulators and industry executives are acknowledging thatthe telecom world is moving in an irreversible direction--with orwithout their blessings.  This is creating uneasiness in allquarters.  Regulators are trying to redefine their roles for theshort term, and many wonder whether they'll have a long-term role. Business people are dreading the difficult decisions that come withcorporate reorganizing and downsizing, the never-ending demands forgreater efficiencies, and the industry's push into unchartedterritory.     In discussions between industry officials and regulators, ashift is occurring:  The focus is on the stark realities of change--the opportunities and problems it brings.  Quickly emerging is acompetitive industry structure in which carrier classificationswill be blurred or eliminated, and market entry and exit barrierswill fall.  Companies that historically have been defined by anarrow set of products or services--and that have honoredfranchises and carefully delineated service territories--are beingturned loose to move in any direction their managers choose.  Bellcompanies and independent telcos will compete against each other;interexchange carriers, competitive access providers, wirelessservice providers, and global competitors also will be thrown intothe mix.     What is being called "regulatory schizophrenia"--having anannounced U.S. policy favoring competition and open market entry,while simultaneously favoring the preservation of universal serviceat all cost--will have to be corrected.  But how?  It's clear thata new blueprint is urgently needed, but government and businessleaders first must decide what they want the outcome to be.The Legislation:  What It Does, What It Doesn't Do     While most observers expect President Clinton to signlegislation developed by the House-Senate conference committee,they note that repeated attempts to revise the Communications Acthave failed over the years, often at the last minute.  Each time,surprised industry lobbyists and Capitol Hill staffers have wailed,"We were so close, and so much effort went into the process thistime around."     History proves the Washington adage that it's always easier tokill a piece of legislation than to get one signed into law.  Thecurrent House and Senate bills, HR 1555 and S 652, are among themost complex, far-reaching measures to be debated on Capitol Hillin recent times.  In addition to updating the telephone andbroadcasting sections of the 1934 statute, they address industriesand economic sectors that didn't exist until relatively recently. Because the bills tackle so many issues--they "try to do everythingto and for everybody," one lobbyist says--the opportunities for"mischief-making" are great.     The direction of the broadly defined "communications industry"is clear, however, and a massive industry restructuring willcontinue to proceed with or without this specific legislation.  Ifthe current legislative attempt fails, all participants in theprocess will be back later--as they have year after year for thepast two decades.     U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who has had theunenviable task of overseeing the 1982 antitrust consent decreethat bans the Bell companies from interLATA (local access andtransport area) markets and manufacturing, has been awaiting theoutcome of the legislative debate.       Several important requests for decree waivers are pendingbefore him--waivers that would allow local exchange/interexchangecompetition experiments.  If communications legislation is notsigned into law, Judge Greene will move on those motions.     Another "wild card" concerns the Bell companies' 1994 requestthat the decree be vacated.  Judge Greene gave the JusticeDepartment one year to investigate the request, and itsrecommendation was expected to be submitted early last September. The department's views still are awaited.  Its response is expectedto focus on the current state of competition in communicationsmarkets, possibly fueling the fires on Capitol Hill.     The current legislative debate, which has been more visible inthe national and local press than have past attempts to rewritenational telecom policies, has highlighted the trend toward acompetitive model in all segments of communications.  It also haseradicated age-old concepts about business segmentation and linesof demarcation (i.e., company X is in the "telephone business,"company Y is in the "entertainment business," and so on).     How to define the markets of tomorrow is troublesome for theClinton administration, federal legislators, and state regulators. Because the bills outline an incremental approach to change thatalready is occurring in many jurisdictions, they may be considered"evolutionary" instead of "revolutionary."  The result will begreater reliance on market forces and new types of involvement byregulators.     Regulators and the financial community have become aware thateven minor tinkering with this industry can have enormous rippleeffects throughout the nation's economy and social structure. Indeed, global effects are of concern.  The bills, which spell outa national policy framework, seek to open communications markets tomore participants and to encourage the deployment of newtechnologies and services.     People involved in all sides of the debate believe that arewrite of the nation's communications statute must ensure that allAmericans have access to "new technologies" in addition to basictelephony.  By the year 2000, 60% of new jobs will require skillsthat only 20% of Americans have today.  The Clinton administrationsays that, to ensure an adequately trained workforce, educationalinstitutions and libraries must have adequate access to thenational information infrastructure.Technology:  Another Complicating Factor     Overlaid on the political disputes is a shifting technologyscene that promises both solutions and more problems.  Thefollowing technology trends point to major societal changes overthe next 10 years:     *    Mobility:  People want the flexibility offered by mobilecommunications.  This market demand eventually will allow wirelessand wireline services to achieve price and service-quality parity. Integrated networks offering seamless services and numberportability will circle the globe.  Separate voice and data lines,fax lines, mobile phone equipment, and the like will becomeunnecessary as single devices provide "integrated messaging."     *    The Internet:  An increasing number of people pay $15 to$20 per month for access to the Internet; some of them stayconnected for hours on end, while others have access for shortperiods.  As the Internet becomes more popular, traffic congestionand network crowding will become problems for network planners. And capabilities for voice telephony over the Internet will allow"free" long distance calling, a situation interexchange carrierscan't do anything about.     The rapid growth of Internet usage raises security issues andhas implications for a variety of transaction services targeted toboth consumers and businesses.  The Internet also will spawn new"cottage industries," as in-home provision of information and otherservices becomes lucrative.  Meanwhile, electronic commerce overthe Internet will lead to "disintermediation"--the elimination ofarbitrage or middlemen--in major segments of the economy.  On asocial level, Internet "chat groups" will allow the real-timesharing of experiences without regard to geography (i.e., "virtualparties" while a football game is in progress).     *    Home Entertainment/Video:  This will develop asasymmetric digital subscriber line technology evolves and broadbandnetworks are upgraded.  Predictions are that by the year 2005, twofully robust networks--cable TV and telephony--will be capable ofdelivering all types of services to the home.       "Intelligent agents" will find the information a consumerwants, sorting and filtering massive amounts of data available onnumerous networks.  And "virtual reality" technologies will besimplified for general consumer uses (for real estate shopping,home decorating, or product testing, for example).  Telcos,meanwhile, are expected to integrate vertically into the "content"business.     *    Deployment Speed:  Faster product life cycles will meanfaster changes in industry structures, business relationships, andcorporate leadership.     These changes mean that policy-makers cannot continue drawingthose "bright red lines" around services and industry segments. Attempts to delineate which companies can get involved in whichservices, and whether services are basic/enhanced orregulated/unregulated will fail.  As LATA boundaries, franchiseareas, and other types of artificial geographic segmentation becomeobsolete, rules will be applied to companies irrespective of thespecific technologies they employ.How Regulators View the Transition     Communications markets of tomorrow will be cost-driven,market-driven, technology-driven, and customer-driven.  Althoughaspects of the current regulatory system will remain during thetransition, there's a growing acknowledgment that regulation andcompetition cannot coexist indefinitely.     Meanwhile, the "Internet revolution" is causing many observersto question the relevance of regulation at all, in any form.  Whatthe Internet and online services enable massive numbers of peopleto do on a global basis also has serious implications for state andnational laws and borders.  These developments are external to thenarrowly focused U.S. debate about reorganizing portions of thedomestic communications industry.     Regulatory agencies have existed for more than 100 years,however.  During that time policy-makers have observed greatchanges in technology and the business environment, emerging eachtime with an updated list of responsibilities and a renewed missionstatement.  The changes ahead will be just as profound forregulators as for the business community.       Nevertheless, some regulation is likely to continue as complexnew issues emerge (carrier and network interconnection is surfacingas the next battlefield).  And states will retain an important roleas laboratories for regulatory and marketplace experiments.     But regulators are worried.  They fear the political andsocial problems that would result if the current disparities inwealth and education are extended to communications, creating asociety of information "haves" and "have nots."       They wonder what is being done for--or to--consumers who don'tcare about competitive models and only want affordable basictelephone service.  Regulators are hoping for creative solutions.     State regulators disagree about the effects of CommunicationsAct revision and the role of regulation in the future.  Some viewfederal developments positively, believing that consumers, theeconomy, and the nation's global competitiveness will benefit iflegislation is enacted.  They note that local exchange competitioninitiatives already are forcing states to review how industries areregulated.  Events in Washington, they say, are only formalizing aprocess that's well under way.     Others, however, worry that authority is being taken fromthem, that their relationships with consumers and industryofficials and their understanding of local needs are being ignored,and that federal preemption will disrupt activities progressing inthe states.  They want flexibility to address competition issues inways that reflect local conditions.  And, believing that rateincreases are inevitable, they want safeguards against "rate shock"in areas that currently have extremely low rates.     While national communications policy reforms definitely areneeded, the pendulum has swung too far toward an "inside theBeltway" approach, some state representatives say.  Economicdevelopment programs may be at stake:  A state needs the freedom toadopt policies encouraging businesses to locate within its borders. If a state makes the right decisions, it will prosper economically. If it makes the wrong decisions, it will suffer the consequences. Regulators fear that detailed federal mandates will have a"leveling" effect, making it difficult for individual stateeconomic development policies to be carried out.     In some states, many consumer complaints involve interstatematters over which the states have no jurisdiction.  Becauseconsumers generally believe federal authorities are inaccessibleand slow to act, they sometimes feel there has been no resolutionto their problems.       This situation has led to a suggestion that state publicservice commissions become FCC "field offices" after federallegislation is enacted.  Under this scenario, states would remainclosely involved at the local level, functioning as the federalgovernment's eyes and ears and having power to act on the federalgovernment's behalf.     Also under review is whether the old common law concept of"common carriage" can be sustained in a competitive environment. Public utilities historically have been viewed as "naturalmonopolies," with economies of scope and scale that allowed onecompany to serve the public interest more efficiently (cheaper)than several could.  They provided "essential" services in anondiscriminatory fashion, and regulators protected the monopolystatus.       Regulators now are wondering if, in a competitive market, itmakes sense to characterize any communications company as a commoncarrier.  The obligations imposed on public utilities can beproblematic when new market entrants don't appear to be "essential"and all market players demand equitable treatment.     Others believe common carriage concepts will remain because ofthe public benefits flowing from them and the privileges enjoyed bysuch carriers:  Carrier-customer contracts can be establishedcheaply and easily through generic tariffs; common carriers haveeasy access to public rights-of-way; and they have advantages whenlegal liabilities are concerned.     Regulatory roles and tools already are being revised toaddress new demands, and further changes are ahead.  Regulators andlegislators must ensure that "quick fixes" so common duringtransitions aren't relied upon long term.  "Sunset" provisions,therefore, may be necessary to signal to all parties that thesearch for permanent solutions should continue.     Regulation historically has been "vertical," concentrating onthe relationship between carriers and their customers.  In thefuture it will become more "horizontal," focusing on relationshipsbetween carriers.       Instead of overseeing carrier rate bases or prices oraccounting practices, state regulators will be in charge ofcertifying carriers and defining their obligations; addressinglocal market entry/exit barriers; developing criteria for"effective competition" in discrete markets; guaranteeing servicequality; making sure carriers adhere to certain technicalstandards; guarding against discrimination between customers andagainst competitors; protecting proprietary information aboutcustomers; mediating in carrier-carrier and carrier-customerdisputes, which are expected to increase; and addressing consumerprotection issues and complaints.     Consumer education and protection raise special concerns forregulators, who are divided on questions concerning their futurerole in these areas.  But everyone seems to agree that (1) consumereducation about communications issues has been handled very poorlyin the past, and (2) customer confusion will increase with theadvent of local exchange competition.  Regulators now wonder howconsumers will react if competition causes residential rates to goup and business rates to drop.  How will the situation be explainedto them?  Who should take the lead in educating consumers about thenew industry structure?  And how are consumers to distinguishbetween one company and another, between one service package andanother?     Along with the choices available in competitive markets comesconsumer responsibility for the outcome.  Some regulators,therefore, believe consumers should rely on government interventiononly in cases of fraud or other criminal conduct.  But in thecommunications industry, shifting to a "let the buyer beware"mindset may be slow in coming:  The industry structure is complex,and many consumers are uncomfortable with technology. Nevertheless, in the future they may have to sendcommunications-related complaints to state attorneys general or thecourts.  Regulators, meanwhile, may target more resources tocollecting data that consumers need to make informed decisionsabout communications services.     Negotiated rulemaking and alternative dispute resolutionprocedures are being explored widely, and their use in otherindustries can be instructive for communications policy-makers. Crucial to successful use of these techniques are incentives forindustry participants to resolve differences themselves and firmsignals about the consequences if negotiations fail.  If regulatorycommissions become facilitators and arbitrators, they will needemployees trained in dispute-resolution procedures.     The highly charged subject of staffing will be difficult forcommissions that in the future seek new types of employees--thosewith backgrounds that are new to regulatory agencies (marketing,for example).  Meanwhile, uncertainties about future regulatoryroles and the staff cutbacks currently being discussed in somestates are creating a serious management problem:  how to keep goodstaff members now, and how to attract a new, highly adaptable typeof professional in the future.Industry's Concerns: Reorganizations and Equities     Communications industry officials share many of theregulators' concerns and have several additional ones:     *    Networks:  Networks must be modernized, and depreciationrules must be changed to reflect faster write-offs.  Carriers favoran evolutionary approach to modernization efforts, hoping to getthe maximum benefits from past investments.  And they want toensure that new and older networks, portions of which will existlong into the future, are interoperable.  Telcos are concerned thatif they offer only a transmission pipe in the future, networkrobustness and innovation will be lost.  They say that if thepublic switched network (PSN) is unbundled and opened to allservice providers, proprietary network "intelligence" eventuallywill be moved out of the PSN.  The value-added intelligence thatmakes one network superior to another will reside elsewhere.     *    Speed:  In the computer industry, extremely rapid productcycles are the norm, and the telecom industry wants to move in thatdirection.  The world won't wait for big, ponderous telecomcompanies to make systematic decisions as in the past.  A fasterapproach will be necessary to keep pace with entrepreneurs, and achange in the telecom industry's public image also will be needed(the public doesn't look to the telecom industry for innovation).     *    Regulation:  Regulators don't allow the "trial and error"necessary for development of new products and services, and somecompanies currently are barred from offering certain services.  Thesituation is further complicated by regulatory requirements that aninnovation be ubiquitous throughout a telco's service area.       Regulatory rules often handicap incumbents, making theirresponse to marketplace demands slow, cumbersome, and expensive. And regulators haven't been willing to address certain politicallycharged issues--e.g., geographic rate deaveraging--that arise in acompetitive environment.     *    If We Build It, Will They Come?  It's hard to justify two(or three, if electric utilities are included) networks to the hometoday, and consumer demand for new services remains speculative. No one knows whether consumers will spend their discretionaryincome on communications/entertainment services, or if they'll havethe spare time to use many of the services envisioned.     *    Convergence:  An extremely complex transition is takingplace.  Instead of the much-ballyhooed industry convergencepredicted earlier, partnerships will develop for the bundling andbranding of services.  Companies (or industry segments) are likelyto have an identity crisis, being unable to define who they are orwhat business they're in.  Whoever is first to offer one-stopshopping in a new market will have tremendous advantages.  But thenthere will be a market shakeout and a bloody field of would-becompetitors.     *    Wall Street:  Explaining the current changes to WallStreet analysts, institutional investors, and individualshareholders is difficult, especially when the communicationsindustry itself has no clear sense of what the future holds. Meanwhile, vast amounts of capital are flowing into and out of anindustry that's in transition, and stock values and riskassessments are being determined by new criteria.  Dislocations andconfusion are heightened when not only companies but also entireindustries are being reorganized.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE & LOCAL COMMUNICATIONS REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 12, 1996IDAHO STAFF, U S WEST AGREE ON SERVICE QUALITY SETTLEMENT     Under a settlement agreement reached by the Idaho PublicUtilities Commission staff and U S WEST Communications, Inc., thetelephone company could be liable for civil penalties of $7,500 amonth until it reaches and maintains a specified standard forservice quality.

BEATS FEDERAL PREEMPTION DEADLINE WITH INTRALATA ORDERPennsylvania has become the 17th state to order establishment ofintraLATA toll dialing parity, making it the last state likelyto beat a preemption deadline contained in the pending federaltelecom bill.The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) has ordered alltelcos to implement intraLATA dialing parity during 1997.By acting late last month, the PUC made it likely Pennsylvaniawill be among the states escaping preemption under the intraLATAtoll dialing provisions of the pending federal telecom reformlegislation.In its current form, the federal legislation would preempt anymultiLATA state that voted to order intraLATA toll dialingparity after December 1995, until such time as the resident Bellregional entered the interLATA long-distance market.  Single-LATA states would be exempt from the preemption.  States thatacted prior to the cutoff date would be "grandfathered" andtheir programs would be allowed to run to completion.Under the PUC order, Bell Atlantic and other Pennsylvania telcoswith more than 250,000 lines must complete implementation byJuly 1997, while smaller telcos have until the end of 1997.The PUC went along with the November recommendations of anadministrative law judge (ALJ) for intraLATA parity, except onthe issue of timing.   The ALJ had wanted to give large telcosjust six months to comply, but Bell Atlantic successfully arguedfor a longer implementation period, citing the need to makenetwork modifications that require relatively long lead times.AT&T and MCI had opposed stretching the implementation period,saying any extension would shield Bell Atlantic's near monopolyin intraLATA toll from serious competition for the additionaltime.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996FIVE MORE STATES MAKE MOVES ON INTRALATA TOLL DIALING PARITYIn addition to Pennsylvania, the states of Michigan, Wisconsin,Arizona, New Jersey and Indiana also got in under the federalwire with various requests for intraLATA toll dialing parity.In Michigan, regulators have asked federal authorities to grantAmeritech the interLATA long-distance waivers required for thetelco to comply with inter- and intraLATA toll competitionmandates contained in a 1995 state telecom law.The Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) has petitioned fora waiver of the federal interLATA service restrictions so thatAmeritech can comply with Michigan legislative toll competitionrequirements that link provision of interLATA long-distance tointraLATA toll dialing parity.In a letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice to petitionU.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene for interLATA relief,the Michigan PSC said the requested waiver will enable AmeritechMichigan to fulfill a directive in Michigan's 1995 state telecomreform act that the company should begin providing intrastateinterLATA long-distance services as soon as possible, and beoffering such services to at least 50 percent of its customersin competitive local markets by May of 1996.Michigan Gov. John Engler Nov. 30, 1995, signed into law thestate telecom reform act (SB-722, Act 216) that, among otherthings, prohibits mandatory implementation of full intraLATA"1+" toll dialing parity in any market area where the servingtelco is not providing interLATA long-distance service.In Ameritech's case, however, once that company receives federalpermission to begin interLATA service in Michigan, the 1995state law makes intraLATA dialing parity mandatory immediatelyin Ameritech market areas where interLATA service is legal and alocal exchange competitor has been certified.Competitive local Ameritech markets include Grand Rapids andDetroit.The PSC implemented dialing parity for intraLATA WATS servicesin 1991, and in August 1994 issued an order requiring Ameritechto implement full dialing parity for all intraLATA interexchangeservices by Jan. 1, 1996, an order that the telco still wasfighting to modify when the new state law was enacted.The Michigan law also contains a directive to the Engleradministration and the PSC that they collectively pursue thefederal relief necessary to allow Ameritech to fulfill the statelaw's toll competition provisions.An Ameritech Michigan spokesman said the company fully supportsthe state's efforts, but added that Ameritech will not beproviding any interLATA long-distance service in Michigan untilfederal authorities issue a waiver or grant other relief fromthe interLATA service ban.The PSC is awaiting a reply from Justice before deciding itsnext step.In addition to the new waiver request submitted to the JusticeDepartment by the Michigan PSC, Ameritech has pending beforeJudge Greene its own request for an interLATA service trial inthe Grand Rapids and Chicago LATAs, which Justice supports.The big complicating factor in all this is what Congress will doregarding interLATA relief for Ameritech and the other Bellregionals when, or if, a final federal telecom bill emerges fromthe House-Senate conference committee.In Wisconsin, a state court has refused to stay a Public ServiceCommission (PSC) order requiring Ameritech Wisconsin to beginimplementation of intraLATA dialing parity this month, withcompletion of the process by July.Dane County Circuit Court Judge Mori Krueger ruled thatAmeritech had not shown that it was incapable of fulfilling theorder or that it would suffer great harm if the PSC order wereimplemented.In Arizona, the Corporation Commission has given U S West andother large telcos until April 20 to implement full intraLATAtoll dialing parity, as part of an order authorizing intraLATAcompetitors to begin operations.That deadline is about 10 weeks earlier than the original July1, 1996, implementation deadline specified in the January 1995order opening the intraLATA toll market to competition.While the order did not detail the reasons behind the move, thenew date may have been a compromise to settle a pending disputebetween U S West and interexchange carriers over the validity ofintraLATA equal access requests filed by interexchange carrierslast summer when they applied for intraLATA certification.The order authorizes AT&T and MCI to begin intraLATA tollservice; Sprint has a request for intraLATA authorization stillpending.In the order authorizing the intraLATA competitors, thecommission also further streamlined regulation of interexchangecarrier services.  The new rules eliminate the 14-day noticeperiod for changes to toll discounts, allowing carriers tomodify or introduce toll discount plans the same day as noticeis given to the commission and the public.  However, no discountcan take the price below total service long run incrementalcost.Changing the tariffed ceiling rates from which discounts arefigured still requires a commission review.The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is scheduled to releasea proposed order for intraLATA toll presubscription Jan. 16.Comments on that order will be taken until Feb. 15, after whichthe board will decide whether to adopt or modify its proposal.A final decision could come as early as mid-March.In Indiana, the Utility Regulatory Commission has scheduledevidentiary hearings Feb. 7-9 on a joint petition by fourinterexchange carriers seeking establishment of full intraLATAtoll dialing parity.The petition by AT&T, Sprint, LDDS Worldcom and LCIInternational demands establishment of intraLATA parity as soonas technically feasible.Final prefiled material must be submitted by Jan. 17.  Finalpost-hearing briefs are due March 8 with final reply briefs dueApril 1.  Under its procedural rules, the commission must reacha decision before July.However, by acting in 1996, Indiana may find itself preempted bythe pending federal act.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996STATES REGAIN SOME GROUND AS TELECOM BILL ENTERS HOME STRETCHState utility commissions have retained some important areas ofauthority over local telecom competition in a newly compromisedfederal telecom act now getting the finishing touches in aHouse-Senate conference committee in Congress.But the federal act also will allow parties to seek FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) preemption of a state's actionson grounds that they conflict with the federal law.And the act gives the states no significant role in determiningwhether a Bell company can enter the interLATA long-distancemarket.The final compromise between the differing House and Senateversions of the act looks like it largely will hew to the Houseversion but with Senate language on some key issues such asuniversal service, according to a 281-page draft obtained byState Telephone Regulation Report.Right now, the federal bill appears to be a compromise thatnobody really loves, but which the major interest groups thinkthey can live with.The deal appears to be jelling as key factions releasestatements endorsing the draft measure, including theTelecommunications Industry Association, the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters and the Alliance for CompetitiveTelecommunications (which represents the Bell companies'interests).There's also been a lack of strenuous objection to the draftfrom the United States Telephone Association (USTA) or theCompetitive Telecommunications Association (CompTel),  whichrepresents interexchange carrier interests.Of course, there is always the possibility that furtherjockeying among congressional leaders could upset the developingaccord or add to the time before the conference bill is put to afloor vote in both chambers.The draft conference bill requires states to remove all barriersto competitive entry in telecom markets.  It also establishesthe checklist of services that all major telcos must makeavailable to competitors.The bill allows states to set their own rules governingcompetition, provided the state rules do not conflict withfederal rules and policies regarding competition.The FCC must issue a set of national rules defining theframework for interconnection, unbundling, resale and othercompetition requirements within six months of the bill'seffective date.Within the framework established by the FCC, states canpromulgate rules on interim number portability, access torights-of-way, reciprocal compensation and other issues.But the bill allows the FCC to preempt a state rule if itviolates the federal bill's local competition requirements.The bill makes physical on-site collocation the national defaultoption for network interconnection, but allows states the optionof letting a telco provide virtual, or offsite, collocation.States also can exempt small telcos from competitionrequirements where compliance with a particular provision wouldbe "unduly economically burdensome" or not technically feasible."Small" telcos are defined as those with fewer than than 2percent of the nation's access lines.The states retain jurisdiction over interconnection agreementsnegotiated between local competitors and incumbents, and canreject an agreement if it violates the public interest, amongother grounds.  If a state does not reject a proposed agreementwithin 90 days, the pact automatically goes into effect.If interconnection negotiations don't produce an agreement after135 days of trying, a competitor can call on state regulatorsfor binding arbitration, where the state sets the rates andimplementation schedule.If a state must set the rates for interconnection, transport andtermination, it must allow each carrier to recover its costs.Although states "may include a reasonable profit" when settingthe rates, they cannot impose a rate-of-return ceiling oninterconnection services or penalize a provider that generates agreater actual profit margin from such services.However, the federal bill again allows the FCC to step in andtake charge of any interconnection proceeding upon a complaintor other indication that a state is not regulatinginterconnection services in a manner consistent with the federallaw.Provisions barring states from imposing rate-of-returnregulation on noncompetitive services have been deleted from thecompromise measure.On local resale, the legislation requires that all services atelco retails also must be offered to resellers at wholesale.The bill settles the wholesale discount squabbles by definingwholesale rates as the retail rate minus costs such as billing,collection and marketing that the telco avoids by selling to acompetitor.States are allowed to bar local resellers from resellingresidential local service to business customers.The legislation also mandates sharing of network facilitieswhere one telco, typically a smaller one, wants to rely onspecialized facilities of a larger telco in order to provideservices the small telco cannot afford to provide on its own.But the bill says the small telco cannot force a large telco toshare facilities if the small company will use the sharedresources in the large telco's service territory.The states retain jurisdiction over public safety requirements,such as "911" emergency dialing systems, in a competitive localmarketplace.State and local governments also retain their authority tomanage access to public rights-of-way, provided they don'tdiscriminate among carriers.On universal service, the federal legislation allows stateregulators to determine which carriers will be eligible toreceive universal service subsidies from a fund, but requiresthat all telecom providers contribute to the universal servicesupport system.States can impose their own universal service requirements anddefinitions of the universal service entitlement.  But thoserequirements and definitions must be consistent with a nationalpolicy framework to be established by a federal-state jointboard, acting under a set of principles embodied in the federallegislation.Such principles include a requirement that comparable rates andservices must be available in rural and urban areas.Another principle to be embodied in universal service policy isthat public schools and libraries are entitled to a discount, tobe set by the FCC, on all telecom services.This means providers will be able to seek compensation for theirlosses on discounted school/library service through theuniversal service fund.While the states kept important areas of authority in the localexchange, they did not fare so well in the federal bill'ssections on interexchange services.The final bill does not give states a major role in the processof approving interLATA long distance entry by the Bellcompanies, and restricts the states' ability to requireintraLATA toll dialing parity.The bill immediately lets a Bell company provide long distanceservice between points outside its region, as well as"incidental" interLATA long-distance connections used for itsother services such as cellular or video.No FCC or state approval is required.For authorizing Bell interLATA long- distance within the region,the bill places the decision in the hands of the FCC, which mustfind that Bell entry is in the public interest.A Bell company can apply for in-region authority immediately;the FCC has 90 days to decide.  The FCC can grant permission ona state-by-state basis or region wide.For each state, the applicant Bell company must show that atleast one facilities-based local exchange competitor isoperating in at least one city in the state.The applicant must also show that it has made interconnectionavailable to competitors, offers nondiscriminatory access topoles and conduits, and has unbundled local loops, interofficelocal transport and local switching.The Bell also must demonstrate its willingness to offer servicesfor resale, provide reciprocal compensation and offercompetitors access to "911" services, directory assistance,local operator call completion services, and white pagesdirectory listings.Also, the Bell must offer number portability either by a state-approved interim system or through full portability once the FCChas issuesd the rules.If after 10 months the Bell company has seen no local competitorexpress serious interest in taking service under the state-approved local interconnection provisions for a particularstate, or had only a taker that negotiated in bad faith, theBell can self-certify compliance with the competitive checklistfor that state.The FCC must consult with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on aBell company's in-region interLATA application and must give"substantial weight" to the DOJ's view, but the final FCCdecision does not have to conform to the DOJ opinion.The bill does not permit a state to impose mandatory intraLATAdialing parity on a Bell company until the telco enters theinterLATA long-distance business.Single-LATA states, however, are exempt from this provision, asare states that acted during or before December 1995.Dialing parity, already in place in interLATA long-distance,means the ability to place a call on a competing carrier'snetwork by dialing the same number of digits as needed to usethe incumbent carrier's network.In other provisions, the bill also repeals a federal restrictionon the nation's 14 largest multistate electric utilitycompanies, which are regulated by a 1935 federal holding companyact that kept them from entering the telecom business.These companies must establish a separate telecom subsidiarythat must obtain market entry permission from the FCC.The parent electric utility cannot sell facilities or otherassets to the telecom unit without state approval.All affiliate transactions between the parent and the subsidiaryare subject to audit by the state commissions, which can inspectthe books of parent and subsidiary alike.  The utility's telecomsubsidiary cannot issue its own stock or debt.  Nor can theparent utility mortgage its operations to finance its telecomoperation.The parent utility must also file reports with the FCC regardingcapitalization of the telecom venture.The final federal bill allows a Bell company into manufacturing,by means of a separate subsidiary, as soon as it is allowed toprovide interLATA long-distance.  A Bell operating companycannot discriminate in any way in favor of the manufacturingaffiliate or its products.For four years after enactment, the bill requires Bellelectronic publishing to be through a fully separate subsidiarywith its own marketplace identity.The bill also bans all Bell companies other than Ameritech fromentering the alarm monitoring business for five years.Ameritech already owns an alarm monitoring company, but would beprohibited from acquiring any additional alarm companies forfive years.The bill's sections on cable TV aim to give cable theflexibility and profitability to compete against local telcos.It deregulates cable rates for "upper tier" services at theearlier of March 1999 or the date when "effective competition"exists in a market, such as from a telco's video programmingservices.Small cable operators, those with fewer than 1 percent of allU.S. cable subscribers, are rate deregulated immediately.Until rates are deregulated, cable rate complaints to the FCCcan be made only by the local franchising authority.  And thatauthority can't complain unless it has received subscribercomplaints within the first 90 days after a rate increase.While retaining current federal regulations for wireless cable,pure common carrier video systems and telco-owned cable TVsystems, the bill creates a new category called "open videosystems" where the transmission provider can own some of theprogramming content.Such open systems must leave one-third of the transmissioncapacity open to other content providers.Such systems are exempt from local franchise fees, but may beassessed a local tax in lieu of the franchise fee.The FCC has six months to write the rules governing this newcategory of open video systems, and will decide telcoapplications seeking this type of regulation.Telcos under the bill cannot have more than a 10 percentinterest in a cable system in their service areas unless the FCCissues a waiver.Exceptions from this rule are made if the cable system serves arural area of under 35,000 population, or the telco itself hasbelow $100 million in annual revenues and the cable system hasless than 20,000 subscribers, or the cable system serves fewerthan 10 percent of the households in the telco's service area.The bill also allows TV broadcasters to buy cable TV systems andnarrows sharply the grounds for the FCC to turn down renewal ofa broadcaster's license.  It also loosens current limits on howmany radio and TV stations one entity can own in the nation's 50largest markets.The bill also prohibits transmission of indecent as well asobscene material over electronic networks under penalty of a$100,000 fine and up to 10 years in jail.And it requires TV manufacturers to include a special chip insets so that parents can program the TV to block display ofshows that carry high violence content ratings.As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expeditedjudicial review of these provisions, meaning any appeals will godirectly from the federal district court to the U.S. SupremeCourt.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996CALIF. PUC KICKS OFF LOCAL COMPETITION IN $7 BILLION MARKETThe California Public Utility Commission (PUC) last week kickedoff local exchange competition in the nation's largest localtelecom marketplace as it implemented rules for the 31 companiesauthorized late last month to compete for    $7 billion in localexchange revenues from 15 million access lines.The PUC rules for open competition are similar to rules proposedin July 1995 when the PUC began accepting certificationapplications.Although competition is now legal for all switched and non-switched local services, it will be at least a few months beforethe new entrants can actually begin advertising for customersand delivering competitive service.During the interim, new competitors will be negotiatinginterconnection terms with incumbent telcos Pacific Bell and GTECalifornia, as well as preparing tariffs or price lists fortheir services.For the first year, terminating compensation will be addressedthrough the bill-and-keep method, where the originating networkkeeps all the charges for a local call.The rules also protect consumers against unfair businesspractices, for disclosure of rates and terms of service, and forresolving complaints.The PUC rules require all local providers to interconnect with"911" answering points, and to the state telephone relay systemfor the handicapped.New providers also must offer a lifeline rate, and must providecustomers with a written confirmation of each sale in the samelanguage as the original sale was made.The companies certified as local exchange competitors includeGTE California and Pacific Bell, which now are authorized tocompete for local exchange customers in each others' serviceareas.The others authorized to provide competitive local phoneservices include:  Advantage Communications, Associated GroupInc., AT&T, five local units of Brooks Fiber Inc., Cable PlusCompany, Century Telecom, Continental Telecom, ElectricLightwave Inc., Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST PacificLightwave, GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG AccessServices, Info-Tech Communications.Also, Linkatel Pacific, MCImetro, MFS Intellenet, NewTelco,Nextlink, Pac-West Telecom, three local units of TeleportCommunications Group, Viacom Communications and WinstarWireless.The rules also protect consumers against unfair businesspractices, for disclosure of rates and terms of service, and forresolving complaints.In addition to its interconnection, unbundling and public safetyrequirements, the PUC also has expanded its bans against theunlawful practice of "slamming" (unauthorized changes to thepresubscribed carrier) to include unauthorized changes in localexchange provider.Also, all local providers are prohibited from "redlining," ordesignating certain neighborhoods as low priority for serviceinstallations or repairs.In a related action, the PUC says it will seek a bill in the1996 California state legislature to allow implementation of astate universal service fund that will subsidize companiesserving high-cost areas.The PUC's proposed universal service support system calls forgiving customers in high-cost areas a phone bill credit for thedifference between what they pay and what it costs their localprovider to serve them.The local telecom provider will be compensated from theuniversal service fund.  Any local provider would be able toreceive payments from the fund, provided it is willing to serveall the customers in an area.Instead of traditional cost studies, the PUC proposesdetermining the costs of local service through a proxy formulabased on population, terrain, climate, technology and looplengths.If enabling legislation is passed, the PUC in June plans todefine the universal service entitlement, establish the revenuesource for the universal service fund, identify the high-costareas eligible for subsidy, designate the reference rates, andprescribe a standard format for notifying customers aboutservices and rates.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996SEVEN OTHER STATES TAKE STEPS ON THE ROAD TO LOCAL COMPETITIONCalifornia is not the only state with action in localcompetition.  Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, Nebraska, Maryland,Virgina and Illinois have seen movement on local competitionissues.The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) last week began aseries of evidentiary hearings, that will last until March, onproposed rules for local exchange telephone competition.Hearings will continue Jan. 12, 25 and 26; on each Thursday andFriday in February, and March 7 and 8.  A proposed order isexpected around the first week in April.  The PUC must issue afinal order by May 31 in order for the rules to take effect July1, as required under the state's 1995 local competition law.A working group convened last June to find consensus on localcompetition came to agreements on numbering portability and mostaspects of "911" provisioning, but on other local competitionissues was able only to outline alternative positions of themajor interest groups, which will be addressed during thehearings.Also figuring in the hearings will be public concern aired in aseries of public forums held around the state last fall.Some issues raised in all 16 public sessions included concernsthat effective statewide local competition is an unrealisticgoal, and that less-wealthy or thinly populated areas willsuffer from diminished investment and attention in a competitivemarket.Rural residents were concerned that advanced telecom serviceswon't reach smaller communities, impairing their economicdevelopment.Many state residents recognized that the current definitions ofbasic telephone service are 10 years behind technology, but mostdon't want to pay for advanced capabilities until they are readyto make  use of such services.The forums showed most people recognize the need for a stronggovernment watchdog agency to police a competitive telecommarkeplace.The forums also showed most people support the idea of a statefund to preserve universal service, but that a sizeable minorityoppose any subsidized phone service rates.Cincinnati Bell has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to void thelocal exchange competition decisions of the Ohio PublicUtilities Commission, on grounds that the PUC exceeded itsstatutory authority in approving local competition.The telco contends that current law did not give the PUC theright to issue the competitive local exchange certificategranted to Time Warner Communicationsin October for the 37 Ohio counties where Time Warner cablesystems operate, nor to certify any of the other localcompetitors approved since then.Under Cincinnati Bell's interpretation, the state legislaturemust first pass enabling legislation giving the PUC the explicitright to approve local competition.Cincinnati Bell and other telcos previously asked the PUC toreverse itself on authorizing local competition, but wererefused; Cincinnati Bell said its court appeal is the next stepprovided by law.In Virginia, MFS Communications became the first company to seekswitched basic exchange authority from the CorporationCommission under a 1995 state law that allowed full localcompetition as of Jan. 1.MFS said it plans to offer one-stop-shopping for local and tollservices to smaller businesses in local exchanges of BellAtlantic and GTE.  MFS already provides non-switched services inRichmond and Northern Virginia.The commission has 180 days to rule on certificationapplications.  The commission also is continuing to work onlocal competition rules, with comments on resale issues dueMarch 1 and comments on universal service support due April 1.AT&T has asked the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) forauthority to provide residential and business local servicestatewide.AT&T initially plans to resell local services of Bell Atlanticbut eventually wants to operate its own local exchangefacilities.Before AT&T begins business operations, however, the companysaid Maryland regulators must establish unrestricted resale andcost-based wholesale prices, and implement interconnectionprinciples that guarantee access to other providers' networks onfair and reasonable terms.The Maryland PSC last week adopted some important rules forimplementing local competition in that state.The commission established one of the lowest interconnectionrates in the country - a half-cent per minute.  This is farbelow the 2.1 cents interim rate established more than a yearago.The commission rules also require interim numbering portability,and require all providers to offer access to "911" services.Under the rules, local competitors will be able to define theirown local calling areas.  They will not have to use the callingareas established by Bell Atlantic.Meanwhile, AT&T in Illinois has asked the Commerce Commission torequire Ameritech Illinois to offer deeper local resalediscounts comparable to the resale discounts that exist in thelong-distance business.AT&T, which has been authorized in Illinois as a local exchangeprovider, has been unable to negotiate a  satisfactory resaleagreement with Ameritech and wants the commission to impose morefavorable resale terms.AT&T contends the 6 percent to 8 percent discounts offered inAmeritech's wholesale local tariffs are insufficient to allowAT&T to make money.  AT&T contended local wholesale rates forresale should run closer to the 33 percent to 50 percent resalediscounts that AT&T says prevail in the long-distance business.Also in Illinois, the Commerce Commission has approved apetition by an affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems(SBMS) to sell wireline local services under the Cellular Onebrand name that is used for cellular service.The authority granted to SBMS Illinois Services Inc., allows itto offer wireline local services alongside existing cellu-lar services in the Chicago LATA.  The company will be filingits wireline local exchange tariffs soon.SBMS also is authorized as a wireline provider in New York,where it operates in Buffalo and Rochester under the CellularOne name.  The company is eying Massachusetts, Maryland andWashington, D.C., where it already operates cellular systems.Under the FCC waiver that allows SBMS to bundle cellular andwireline services outside the Southwestern Bell region, thewireline local services are handled through a separate corporateentity that shares facilties, systems, personnel and managementwith the cellular operation.In Michigan, an Ameritech business unit, formed to provide localexchange services and interexchange services once the federalinterLATA restrictions are lifted, has withdrawn its applicationbefore the Michigan PSC for authority to provide local servicesin Grand Rapids and Detroit (STRR Sept. 21, 1995).Ameritech Communications Inc. (ACI) asked the commission todismiss its application without prejudice, saying it did notwant to pursue the matter at this time.ACI had anticipated providing services either under terms of atrial interLATA waiver pending before Judge Harold Greene, orunder the federal telecom legislation.  ACI planned to targetcustomers who prefer one-stop shopping for an integrated packageof local and long-distance services.The ACI certification application had raised difficult questionsabout what kinds of state regulatory safeguards are required fora traditional telephone company who is both a local competitorand the local incumbent in the same city.The Nebraska PSC has opened a rulemaking with the goal ofimplementing full local exchange competition in 1997.The PSC's goals are to begin certification of switched basicexchange competitors by the start of 1997, with competitors tobegin operation in switched services by July 1997.The PSC has proposed several conditions that must be met beforelocal markets become fully competitive.Those include reasonable local rates, provision of fullintraLATA toll dialing parity, provision of local numberingportability, and a support system to preserve universal servicein a competitive environment.  A procedural schedule will bedeveloped soon.Nebraska allows partial local competition in private lines andother non-switched local services, but up to now has not openedthe switched local services.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996CARRIER TO BE INVESTIGATEDThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has decided totake a more aggressive approach against slamming by keepingcarriers out of the state's markets who appear unfit to operateor likely to operate illegally.Accordingly, the PUC's safety and enforcement division hasrecommended that the PUC reject a petitition by EqualNetCommunications for authority to provide intrastate interexchangeservice in California.According to the division, EqualNet should not be allowed intoCalifornia because it appears to be using deceptive andmisleading marketing practices, including slamming, which is theunauthorized switching of a customer's presubscribed longdistance carrier.In addition, said the division, EqualNet misrepresents itself asbeing affiliated with AT&T in order to induce customers tochange.During 1995, the PUC received 110 complaints against EqualNetand, added the enforcement division, the company has been thesubject of slamming complaints in Illinois, Kansas and NorthCarolina.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996PRICE REGULATION REVAMPEDThe California PUC has decided to freeze the rates of PacificBell and GTE California through 1998.For Pac Bell, the freeze takes effect immediately, but GTE willhave to make one final price adjustment under the old indexingformula in 1996.  GTE rates will then be frozen for 1997 and1998.The two telcos had petitioned the PUC to eliminate the price-capindexing formula used to regulate rates under California'shybrid system of price and earnings regulation for its bigtelcos.The formula pegs annual price adjustments to the gross domesticproduct price index minus a 5 percent productivity factor.  Withthe low inflation of recent years, the telcos have had to makesubstantial rate cuts each year.Rather than setting a productivity offset that is less thaninflation, which would have resulted in rate increases, the PUCmade the productivity offset equal to inflation.  This in effectfreezes rates.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996TOLL PLAN WON'T BE DELAYEDThe Florida Public Service Commission has denied motions frominterexchange carriers to delay implementation of a BellSouthmessage-rate plan for intraLATA toll pricing.The plan, to go into effect Jan. 15, sets a flat price of 25cents for a residential intraLATA toll call, regardless ofdistance, duration or time of day.  Business customers will pay10 cents the first minute and  6 cents per additional minute.The plan, said BellSouth, will reduce its intraLATA tollrevenues by around $25 million.AT&T, MCI and other interexchange carriers wanted the startingdate delayed so the competitive implications of the plan couldbe more fully explored.Back to Headline List CopyrightSTATE TELEPHONE REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 11, 1996VIDEO INTERESTS FIGHT TAXCable and satellite video providers have filed a suit in theIllinois courts to overturn a Chicago city amusement tax appliedto video gross receipts.The video companies say the 7 percent tax on gross revenues isunconstitutional because it taxes a selected mode of electronicspeech while exempting other equivalent electronic channels ofexpression such as TV broadcasting.The tax also allegedly discriminates against cable subscribersby assessing them extra to fund city services that benefit theentire population.The plaintiffs also contend the city tax, if upheld, would set adangerous precedent for local taxation of online informationservices, home shopping networks and other electronicinformation media.Further, the cable companies argue the tax is double taxation ofcable by the city, since there is no credit given for the localfranchise taxes cable companies already pay.Back to Headline List WT03-B13-25IA086-000622-B041-24http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/te49.html 205.156.212.5 19970122052218 text/html 38915HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:20:24 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:37:59 GMTContent-length: 38728Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/te49.html Sample Issue Copyright TELCO BUSINESS REPORT via NewsNet JANUARY 1, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES COMPETITION, CRIME, PSC PRACTICES DOMINATE '95 STATE PHONE LAWS (2211 words) DEMOCRATS, BELLS SCORE ON TELECOM BILL - WHICH DEBUTS THIS WEEK (1665 words) AVOID PROFIT LOSS BY CREATING A SAFETY NET FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE (723 words) IBM ALLIANCE ADVANCES AMERITECH'S DESKTOP SERVICES REACH (239 words) TIME WARNER ASKS PUCO TO INTERVENE WITH AMERITECH INTERCONNECTION TALKS (75 words) BOARD OF DIRECTORS RAISES TELCO'S LARGEST DIVIDEND IN FIVE YEARS (56 words) BELL ATLANTIC 'ONE STEP CLOSER' TO COMMERCIAL VDT IN TOMS RIVER (157 words) CWA PICKETS IN PROTEST OF PHILLY TV STATION'S REFUSAL TO AIR UNION ADS (43 words) PACTEL SIGNS SEACHANGE FOR DIGITAL WIRELESS INSERTION EQUIPMENT (71 words) TELCO PLANS GROWTH VIA NEW RETAIL BUSINESS ALIGNMENT (114 words) U S WEST, AMERITECH SHARE NAME, NUMBER FOR LONG-DISTANCE CALLER ID (56 words) CopyrightTELCO BUSINESS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996COMPETITION, CRIME, PSC PRACTICES DOMINATE '95 STATE PHONE LAWSLegislation addressing telephone competition, telephone crime,and state regulatory practices and structures dominated statelawmaking in 1995.Of the 49 states that met in session in 1995 to consider closeto 1,000 proposed telecom-related bills, 38 states produced newtelecom laws, with legislation on competition, crime andcommission structures and practices accounting for 53 of the 92measures that made it onto state lawbooks this year.State legislatures in 1995 produced an unprecedented outpouringof legislation relating to telephone competition andderegulation; these closely related topics together accountedfor 26 of the 92 state laws passed.But telephone crime and state regulatory structures also were afocus for strong legislative activity in 1995.  These two areastogether accounted for another 27 new telecom laws in 1995.Other areas that got significant legislative attention in the1995 legislatures included "911" emergency dialing (eight laws),physical telecom facilities and infrastructures (eight laws) andtelecom taxation (seven laws).There also was a scattering of state legislation passed onconsumer protection, extended area service, privacy, specialneeds of the handicapped, universal service and abuses bytelemarketers.  Although in past years each of these topicswould account for a significant number of state laws, in 1995these areas collectively accounted for just 17 laws passed.In the area of competition and deregulation, 13 states passedmajor new laws that effectively abolished their telephonecompanies' legal local exchange monopolies, threw all localservices open to competition, and allowed more lenientregulation of competitors.Another 10 states enacted lesser measures affecting the scopeand direction of ongoing competition and deregulation activity.Many observers attribute the flood of major state competitionlaws in 1995 to the highly preemptive federal telecomlegislation that almost made it through the 103d Congress in thefall of 1994.That 1994 legislation would have forced open all closed telecommarkets while preempting outright many aspects of stateauthority in the local exchange, and would have made theremainder of the state jurisdiction into a creature dominated bythe FCC.  That legislation passed the House and likely wouldhave passed the Senate if not for a last-minute lobbying logjamthrown up by local exchange and interexchange carriers as theyfought over the issue of Bell company entry into the interLATAlong-distance market.The strong support for telecom reform and competition in the103d Congress foreshadowed the drive to pass a telecom bill inthe 104th Congress.  State interests hoped that a strong statemovement to accommodate competition would head off thepreemption "hawks" in Congress.  The rush of successful statecompetition bills did help the states' cause, but perhaps not tothe extent the states had expected.Although they vary greatly in their details, the majorcompetition laws en-acted in 1995 by Colorado, Florida, Georgia,Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming have severalgeneral attributes in common.All specify explicit dates in 1995 or in 1996 for the start ofwide open local exchange competition, require certification oflocal competitors, permit lenient regulation of new localentrants, direct state regulators to develop local competitionand interconnection rules, and require universal servicesupport.The laws of Florida, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina,Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming shield their smallertelephone companies from local competition for time periodsranging from three to 10 years.These major state competition laws generally permit immediatelocal service resale, except in Texas and Florida where localresale is restricted while federal interLATA restrictions onBell and GTE remain in effect.Except for Hawaii, these major laws generally allow regulatorsflexibility to adopt price-based alternatives to rate-of-returnregulation for incumbent telephone companies.  Hawaii's law barstelco price regulation until effective local competition isestablished.However, the laws in Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,Minnesota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming prescribe explicitstructures for price-based regulation of incumbent telcos thatstate regulators must follow.In addition to the sweeping laws described above, other 1995laws related to competition and deregulation include aConnecticut law that sets definite procedural deadlines for thelocal competition rulemakings required by the 1994 law thatlegalized local competition.A California law allows regulators the option to controlcompetitive market entry through registration instead ofcertification.  Another California law requires regulators tofind that mergers and acquisitions won't impair competition andthat benefits of the deal will be split evenly betweenshareholders and ratepayers.Michigan enacted a law that simplifies competitive market entry,mandates local interconnection, deregulates competitive servicesand all rate reductions, and requires arbitration of minordisputes, among other provisions.  This law replaces an expiring1991 telecom regulation act.Bucking the pro-competition trend, an Idaho law and a provisionwithin the 1995 Michigan law prohibit state imposition ofmandatory intraLATA toll dialing parity  requirements on a telcothat is prohibited by federal edict from intraLATA long-distanceservice.But in a direct challenge to federal authorities, the Michiganlaw also requires Ameritech and GTE to begin intrastateinterLATA service in 1996.Idaho deregulated telecom resellers, while North Dakotaderegulated payphones and terminal equipment.  Wisconsin andNorth Dakota increased the maximum line size of small telcoseligible for deregulation.State commissions in Washington and Oregon gained legalauthority to adopt price-based alternative regulation systemsfor telephone companies.Bucking the pro-competition trend, an Idaho law and a provisionwithin the 1995 Michigan law prohibit state imposition ofmandatory intraLATA toll dialing parity requirements on a telcothat is prohibited by federal edict from providing interLATAlong-distance service.After competition, a major area of state legislative activity in1995 was phone crime, either where the phone service provider isthe victim of crime, or where telephone service is an instrumentfor commission of other crimes.State legislatures in 1995 took aim at theft of telecom servicesin response to industry complaints that up to 40 percent ofcellular airtime is being stolen, that some 5 percent of thehouseholds in a typical urban cable market are stealing cableprogramming, and that present penalties are too weak to beeffective in deterring theft of phone, cellular and cableservices.Phone crime laws in Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington expanded previous law onservice theft to cover thefts of cellular and cable TV services.These laws also increased penalties for all thefts of telecomservices and for enabling others to steal service, in many casesupgrading the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony.For example, Arizona's new theft-of-service law not only makesphone service theft a felony.  It also denies parole or otherearly release from confinement to any persons convicted ofstealing or enabling a theft where the crime involved more than$100,000 worth of stolen telecom or utility service; they mustserve every day of the prescribed sentence.A Massachusetts law sets the maximum penalty for theft oftelecom service at a $30,000 fine or 15 years in prison, whilean Oregon law sets the maximum penalty for stealing cellularservice, or enabling a cellular service theft, by means of anunlawful "cloned" cellular phone at a $200,000 fine and 10 yearsin prison.Many of these new state phone crime laws also allow victims ofservice theft to sue convicted perpetrators for civil damages.In Washington state, a repeat offender now can be sued fortreble damages under the state's Criminal Profiteering Act.Other new state laws addressing criminal uses of phones includea Maine law allowing prosecutors to subpoena telephonecompanies' customer call detail records where phone usage ismaterially related to a criminal investigation.A New Mexico law makes it a crime to use the telephone toperpetrate telemarketing frauds, while Oregon and Virginia makeit a crime to call a "911" center for any purpose other thanreporting an actual emergency.Georgia expands the crime of telephone harassment to include"silent" harassing calls and phone calls intended to inciteminors to violence.Legislation affecting the ways state commissions conduct theirbusiness included laws in Tennessee and Texas that restructuredthe state utility regulatory system.Tennessee abolished the elected Public Service Commission,effective July 1, 1996, and created a new appointed body, theTennessee Regulatory Authority, to take over regulation oftelecommunications and electric utilities; jurisdiction overother regulated industries goes to other state agencies.The new regulatory body is nonpartisan, and its members areforbidden to engage in partisan politics while in office.Texas passed a law recodifying the state utility regulatory actinto separate sections for telecommunications and otherutilities, so as to permit a reorganization of the PublicUtility Commission that structurally separates regulation oftelecommunications from regulation of electric companies andother utilities.The purpose is to separate telephone policy-making from that forelectric utilities as these respective industries become morecompetitive.  Passage of the recodification law was requiredbefore the legislature could pass the 1995 telephone competitionlaw.Laws in Kansas and Oregon allow regulators to protect theconfidentiality of sensitive utility data that otherwise wouldhave to be disclosed under open records laws.A New Mexico law allows regulators to levy administrative fineson telecom providers for regulatory violations, while a RhodeIsland law requires establishment of regulatory fees for telecomfilings made by new types of provider.Another Rhode Island law allows regulators to assess cable TVcompanies for the costs of reviewing mergers, acquisitions andother transfers of control, while a South Dakota law requiresall telephone exchange sales to be approved by the statecommission.State lawmaking on infrastructure and phone facilities includeslaws in California and Connecticut, and provisions in thetelecom competition laws of Florida and Texas, all intended toencourage the spread of advanced telecom facilities for distancelearning and/or telemedicine applications.Laws in California and Nevada assert localities' rights toassess fees on facilities-based telecom service providers foruse of public rights-of-way, although the Nevada law puts a capon the fees or annual fee increases localities can impose.A Maryland law establishes a three-year pilot program toencourage use of telecommuting by government agencies, while aMassachusetts law authorizes a $75 million state bond issue tofinance a 12-year program to link all trial courts, police andpublic safety agencies, and prosecution and defense attorneys toa statewide computer network for judicial information, caseprocessing and trial management.In legislation affecting "911" emergency dialing services, aWashington state law requires shared tenant service systems andschool phone systems to provide "911" location identification by1997 for each phone connected to the system.An Oregon law requires "911' districts with multiple answeringcenters to consolidate them into a single location by 2001,while another Oregon "911" law allows "911" districts to sellbonds to finance system improvements, with voter approval, andlevy a tax to cover debt service.In telecom taxation, Virginia and Pennsylvania passed lawsallowing local governments to levy a 5 percent video grossreceipts tax in lieu of a local franchise fee on new videoservice suppliers, such as telco video dial-tone services, thatwould compete against the incumbent cable TV company.As introduced, these bills would have permitted local grossreceipts taxation of providers who sell TV programming throughhome satellite dishes and other forms of wireless videoprogramming distribution that do not use terrestrial rights-of-way.But in the face of lobbying by the direct-to-home satelliteindustry, the tax bills were amended to exempt program supplierswho use satellites and other wireless distribution systems.Other noteworthy state telecom laws passed in 1995 includeGeorgia and Arizona measures that extend wiretap protections toinclude cellular and/or cordless phones.Nebraska established a program to distribute adaptive telephoneequipment to qualifying low-income handicapped persons.Oregon capped the phone bill surcharge that supports subsidizedlifeline phone services at an amount sufficient to cover sixmonths of demand, while raising by a dime the cap on thesurcharge that supports the state telecom relay service for thedeaf.A Tennessee law requires telephone companies to provide county-wide toll free calling by 1996, while a Virginia law permitscounty-wide toll free calling for counties where the municipalgovernments and a majority of affected subscribers support it.California and Connecticut enacted consumer protection laws tocombat the unlawful practice of "slamming" - switching apresubscribed interexchange carrier without the customer'sauthorization.Another California law prohibits telephone companies frombilling for calls placed to 800-number information services thatdo not comply with FCC subscription regulations.A Georgia law requires that printed solicitations for inclusionin classified telephone advertising directories must clearlystate that the notice is not a bill.One 1995 bill still hanging in there is a measure in Oklahoma toauthorize all forms of local exchange competition and permitalternative price regulation.It was introduced late in Oklahoma's 1995 session.  Whileintroduced too late to win passage in 1995, the bill managed togarner enough support to be carried over to the 1996 session.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO BUSINESS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996DEMOCRATS, BELLS SCORE ON TELECOM BILL - WHICH DEBUTS THIS WEEKCasey Stengel would be proud.  Turns out Stengel's axiom "itain't over 'til it's over" applies as aptly to telecom reformlegislation as it does to baseball games.Late last month, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., chairman of theHouse-Senate conference committee on the bill, thought he andkey committee members had struck a compromise that gaveconcessions to the Clinton administration in order to avert athreatened veto.  But when conservative Republicans heard aboutthe terms, they rebelled, forcing Pressler to call his deal justa "framework agreement" and scuttling plans to bring the bill toa pre-Christmas vote.The new uncertainty left the bill vulnerable to more changes.The latest draft of the bill is not public but a copy obtainedby Telco Business Report sister publication FCC Report showschanges already have been made to Pressler's framework deal.One of them is the removal of language that would have kept theBell companies from joint-marketing long-distance and localservice until a year after their local competitors were doingso.But, this time, it looks the deal will stick.  The SenateRepublican leadership is tacitly endorsing the new draft billand a key House Republican, Rep. Thomas Bliley of Virginia, iscalling on colleagues to vote for the revised measure.Recognizing this, key sides in the yearlong battle havecurtailed their lobbying.  Jim Smith, president of theCompetitive Telecommunications Association, said his group oflocal competitors doubts it will get the conference committee toreverse itself and toughen a condition on Bell long-distanceentry.At the United States Telephone Association, chief lobbyist LarryClinton said his group has given up hope of getting theconference to undo a change to the bill that lets states userate of return regulation for competitive services.  Theprovision was excised early last month by the conferencecommittee, which is producing a compromise version of thetelecom bills passed this summer by the House and Senate.Another measure of how the deal is jelling:  Key factions arereleasing statements endorsing the new draft bill, even thoughit has not been released.  Supporters include theTelecommunications Industry Association, the Alliance forCompetitive Communications - the Bell's lobbying group - and theNational Association of Broadcasters.The USTA and Comptel haven't issued statements, but Clinton saidhe expects the USTA "will be OK" on the bill and Smith said hisgroup will find the bill "minimally acceptable" as long as it'snot changed more.The heavy-hitters are checking their swings because they'vechalked up plenty of runs in this the last inning of bill's ballgame.  In recent days, the Bells have won the right to keep oneof their brethren, Ameritech, from expanding its alarm-monitoring operations (TBR Dec. 18. 1995) beyond the company'scurrent holdings.  Ameritech, the only Bell the bill lets intoalarm monitoring - by "grandfathering" the company's currentholdings - now cannot expand its alarm monitoring presence untilafter the five-year wait the bill imposes on all of the Bellsseeking to get into that line of business.Ameritech's next alarm monitoring move was expected to beoutside of its territory.The nation's 14 largest utility companies also scored byconvincing the conferees to let these federally regulatedutilities offer telecom services.But the latest draft of the conference report - in effect, thenew telecom bill - shows that the biggest runs were scored bythe Democrats.  These include addition of a role for theDepartment of Justice (DOJ) in assessing the long-distance entryapplications of the Bell companies.  Although the role is onlyadvisory, as the Senate bill originally offered, the change wasone of three called for by the White House when theadministration was threatening a veto.Another recent change is adoption of the House bill's 35-percentcap on the size of national audience that any one TV stationchain may accumulate.  The 35-percent cap, a part of the Housetelecom bill added by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., addresses the"media concentration" aspect of the bill, another prime WhiteHouse worry.Those and other changes were added to the bill after a meetingDec. 13 between Pressler and Bliley and the two top Democrats onthe conference committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and Sen.Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.For his part, sources say Hollings was able to convince Presslerto remove from the bill entirely all language that would havelifted the current 25-percent cap on foreign investment in FCClicensees.The next day, Pressler and Bliley were set to sell their deal toHouse and Senate Republicans.  But that morning's newspapersreported that Vice President Al Gore had endorsed the bill onbehalf of the Clinton administration, the entity mostconservative Republicans despise.That error cost Pressler his run.  He was forced to call hisdeal a "framework" - not an agreement - when key conferees,including Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, the chairman of the Housetelecom subcommittee and a key drafter of the House bill,rebelled.  Fields released a statement saying, "There was nodeal" with the White House and then left to spend the holidayswith his family in Texas.Fields likely will have to back down and vote for the conferencereport, but at the moment all eyes are on House Speaker NewtGingrich, R-Ga.  Rather than endorse the new bill, Gingrich hascalled "time out," advising House Republicans to hold off onvoting on the conference report until after Congress returns tosession.  His staff said the speaker had not yet reviewed thenew language to see if it was sufficiently deregulatory.Besides the new role for the DoJ in deciding Bell entry intolong-distance, other key aspects of the draft version of thereport are:*  "Grandfathering" states that, as of Dec. 1995, require theBells to offer dialing parity,*  Expedited judicial review of the bill's "cyberporn"restrictions, and*  Inclusion of the Senate bill's requirement that discountedtelecom service be offered to schools and libraries.  Now,however, that requirement is part of the definition of universalservice itself, meaning that providers can seek compensation fortheir loss via the universal service subsidy.The DoJ's role on Bell long-distance entry will come as part ofthe FCC's imposition of a public-interest test on Bell long-distance applications, a concept taken from the Senate telecombill.  The FCC must give "substantial weight" to the DOJ'sassessment, but that assessment will not be decisive in itself,the new version of the bill states.The Pressler compromise also requires a Bell first to have afacilities-based competitor in place - as the House wanted -andgive the FCC the power to test whether there is "actual anddemonstrable" local competition in the Bell's local market.  Butthe Pressler framework agreement eliminates language adopted bythe conferees just days before that would have required Belllong-distance entry to be predicated on the Bell facingcompetition throughout each of its states, not just in one cityin each state.The bill adopts the House bill's requirement that a Bell firstseek long-distance entry by applying to its state commissions.  To becertified by a state, a Bell must have met the bill's checklistof unbundling and open access requirements and have afacilities-based competitor in place in at least one location.Gone is the language requiring a state to determine whetherlocal competition is prevalent "to an extent that demonstratesthat the telephone exchange market is competitive."The bill does not require the Bells to provide dialing parityuntil they enter the long-distance business, unless they operatein a state that has only one LATA or which required the serviceas of December 1995.  Dialing parity, already available in long-distance, means the ability to place a local call on a competingcarrier's network by dialing the same number of digits as neededby the local carrier's network.The bill bans making indecent material available over electronicnetworks, a hewing to the Senate bill's approach.  The bill'spenalties for sending "cyberporn" - a fine up to $100,000 and upto 10 years in jail - are also the same as the Senate bill's,but the draft bill uses the test of whether such material isindecent, not the "harmful to minors" standard that has beenupheld by federal courts.As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expeditedjudicial review of this provision, meaning that legal challengesto the law will, if appealed, go directly from the federaldistrict court to the U.S. Supreme Court.Contrary to the House version of the telecom bill, the draftagreement has no language banning the FCC from regulating theInternet or letting the FCC selectively lift the 25-percent capon foreign ownership of FCC licensees.  But these changes may besubject to change.  The Senate appears willing to acceptPressler's view that the latter matter should be dealt with viaseparate legislation - he says a bill will be introduced thisspring - but some in the House are still pressing their fight toreturn their foreign ownership language to the bill.In the Senate, Pressler believes he has "a good majority" buthis compromise has won an ardent foe, fellow conferee Sen. JohnMcCain, R-Ariz.  A source with McCain's office told FCC Report,"My boss and others were beside themselves" when they heardabout the framework agreement.  The deal, he said, was workedout behind closed doors, with the Hollings, the rankingDemocratic Senator on the conference committee, carrying waterfor the White House.McCain voted against the Senate bill when it came to the floorand now his staff hints he will use his considerable power as asenator to slow the conference report's progress in the Senateuntil he wins his revisions.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO BUSINESS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996AVOID PROFIT LOSS BY CREATING A SAFETY NET FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLETelcos can avoid millions of dollars in profit loss bymonitoring errors in their accounts payable.A new trend is developing whereby telcos and othertelecommunications companies are hiring auditing services todouble-check their books against overpayments, double paymentsand missed sales.  Industrywide, telecom companies are estimatedto lose approximately $10 million to $20 million in profits dueto such accounting problems."In this industry, frequent corporate acquisitions anddivestitures, expanding geographic territories, numerous localvendor relationships and multiple payables offices increase thelikelihood of profit loss," Ronald Loder, president and CEO ofLoder, Drew & Associates inIrvine, Calif., recently told Telco Business Report.  Loder'scompany handles such audits for roughly a dozen telcos, severalRBOCs and various telecom firms.According to Loder, about 35 percent of the nation's Fortune1,000 companies audit their accounts payable, item by item, torecover overpaid funds and to establish systems and practices tohelp reduce future profit loss."Absolutely every single company in the country is going througha change right now," Loder said.  "And because everything is ina state of flux, there are lots of accounts payable problems."BellSouth Telecommunications, for example, had done what itcalls a "billing reconciliation" in which its central officeaccounting procedures were reviewed for discrepancies.  Theprocess is similar to an audit, telco spokesman David Rogerssaid, and was done to make sure the company wasn't losing moneythrough its accounting practices."There are no pending plans right now to have the process doneagain," Rogers told TBR last week.  "But that doesn't mean therearen't potential problems.  It's something that always has to belooked at."Loder, Drew & Associates provides its auditing services on acontingency basis.  "We get paid 50 percent of what'srecovered," Loder said."And it's not unusual for us to recover $1 million in over-payments for a telco," he added.  "That equates to $500,000 inprofit, which is tantamount to about $10 million in sales.  Forlarge or small companies, that's a lot of money."Loder offers these five tips to ensure accurate accountspayables:*     Avoid manual check requests.  These are non-valuedtransactions that require repeated attention from your payablesstaff and often lead to errors.  "We've conducted more than2,000 accounts payable audits and have uncovered numerouspayments that never appeared in the client's database becausethey were written or logged by hand," Loder said.*     Never pay from a copy of an invoice.  Loder said this isthe most common cause of double payments.  Vendors - localequipment companies, network providers, computer programmers -traditionally mail invoices directly to the central accountspayable department.  In many cases, they send a copy of theinvoice by fax if they have not received payment after 10 days.For telco companies that operate in several geographic regionswith multiple local vendors, these double invoices can amount tohundreds of thousands of overpaid dollars, he said.*     Be consistent when entering invoice numbers into theaccounts payable system.  Increasing use of advanced accountingsoftware has left gaping holes in telecom companies' payablesprocess, Loder explained.  His company's proprietary software,for example, called Scansearch, cross-references invoices andpayments by vendor, category, product group and geographicregion and identifies errors that would otherwise be missedwithout accurate invoice number tracking.  Inconsistent use ofinvoice numbers leads to payment lapses, double payments andover payments.  Be sure, Loder said, that every vendor paymentis directly tied to a specific invoice.*     Avoid use of blanket purchase orders.  Every payment musthave a corresponding p.o. number and every p.o. number must havea corresponding payment.  The key to error-free payment,according to Loder, is careful tracking.  Numbered purchaseorders are essential to an orderly, traceable payables system.*     Reconcile large vendor accounts frequently.  Loder saidhis company's audits and subsequent reports indicate thatfrequently reconciled vendor accounts allow for more efficientcash management, improved vendor relations and accurate invoice-to-payment tracking.Accounts payable processing errors are one of the most commonsources of profit leaks within a company, and while "telcos arevery large corporations," Loder said, "they're less likely toair their dirty laundry.  However, many now realize there arereal savings to be found out there."Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO BUSINESS REPORT via NewsNetJANUARY 1, 1996IBM ALLIANCE ADVANCES AMERITECH'S DESKTOP SERVICES REACHAmeritech and IBM have formed an alliance to give both companiesa stronger foothold in the swelling $30 billion desktopcomputing market.

When granting anSPCOA to MFS Communications Co., Inc., late last year, the PUCsaid it was authorizing MFS to provide service both as a resellerand as a facilities-based provider (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).     At its meeting last week, however, the PUC delayed action onTeleport Communications Group, Inc.'s application for an SPCOA. The commissioners needed time to reconsider whether SPCOA holdersshould be allowed to combine resold and facilities-based service,a PUC spokeswoman said.     The Texas Legislature last year passed a telecom competitionlaw (TCR, May 25, 1995) allowing two types of local exchangeauthorization:(1) SPCOAs, which allow companies to resell services and(2) "Certificates of operating authority" (COAs), which includenetwork build-out requirements.     At last week's meeting two commissioners questioned whetherSPCOA holders should be able to provide services over their ownfacilities, the spokeswoman said.  The PUC now will review thelegislative history to determine whether lawmakers meant forSPCOA holders to provide facilities-based service, and it maylisten to tapes of the legislature discussing the issue, shesaid.     The concerns were triggered, in part, by a letter sent tocommissioners last October by two state legislators, who said thelaw was not intended to allow SPCOA holders to providefacilities-based service, the spokeswoman continued.  "At thetime, the commission didn't agree with the letter," she said. "But now [the commissioners] want to review that key piece tothis [issue]."     The commission will address Teleport's application and theSPCOA issue at a Jan. 24 meeting.       It could approve Teleport's application and allow MFS tomove forward, it could remand the issues to an administrative lawjudge, or it could decide to study the matter further itself, thespokeswoman said.     J. Manning Lee, Senior Regulatory Counsel for Teleport, saidhe was "hopeful" that the commission would stick to its initialdecision, which he said would allow end users to reap thebenefits of competition more quickly.  When MFS was granted anSPCOA and the PUC said the company could combine resold andfacilities-based services, Teleport abandoned its plan to obtaina COA and applied for an SPCOA instead.     The SPCOA already granted to MFS "was not disturbed" by thePUC's action, said Andrew Lipman, Senior Vice President-legal andregulatory affairs at MFS.       "The PUC held unanimously that we could offerfacilities-based service [when it approved MFS' application]" Mr.Lipman said.  "We've briefed this issue now eight separatetimes."  He said the legislation clearly allows SPCOA holders toresell services and provide facilities-based services and thatthe legislative history will support this view.       In any event, legislative intentions "are not supposed tosupersede the actual legislation," Mr. Lipman said.  Thelegislation was intended to prevent the largest interexchangecarriers from "taking advantage" of the SPCOA, he added.  "Theentire thrust of the legislation is to encourage infrastructuredevelopment."     The commission spokeswoman said reconsideration of thematter is related partially to the PUC's rushed schedule forconsidering applications.  The law requires the PUC to makedecisions regarding applications within 60 days of receivingthem, and the PUC had to consider several applications that weresubmitted soon after the law passed.       Meanwhile, the commission has approved LCI International,Inc.'s application for an SPCOA.  After it files tariffs andnegotiates pricing arrangements with Southwestern Bell TelephoneCo., LCI wants to bundle interexchange services and resold localexchange services.  LCI has been authorized to provide localexchange service to business customers in New York and hasapplications pending in Illinois, Michigan (TCR, June 22, 1995),and California (TCR, Sept. 14, 1995).Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996CLECs Applaud Arizona Agency Staff's Proposed Rules for Interconnection     The staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission has proposedrules covering interconnection arrangements between localexchange carriers (LECs) and competitors, bringing enthusiasticendorsements from competitive local exchange carriers.  The staffproposal addresses service unbundling, points of interconnection,mutual compensation arrangements, and number portability.  Itfollows the commission's adoption of guidelines for opening localexchange and intraLATA markets to competition (TCR, Jan. 5, 1995.p. 9; and July 6, 1995).     Public hearings on the staff proposal are expected to beginin March.  The staff would require incumbent LECs to unbundlenetwork components "considered essential to the provision oflocal exchange service."  A LEC would be required to provideessential services "on the same terms and conditions that itprovides these facilities and services to itself."  Under theproposal, essential services and features would include, but notbe limited to, the following:     *    Termination of local and long distance calls;     *    Interconnection with "911" services; and     *    Access to numbering resources, dedicated channelnetwork access connections, and unbundled loops.     The staff also would require incumbent LECs to providenondiscriminatory access to databases, and a mechanism would beestablished for competitors to request that additional networkservices or facilities be unbundled.  Incumbents would berequired to file tariffs for those services within 30 days of theeffective date of the rules.     The prices for interconnection services, including access todatabases and other network functions, would be set at thetotal-service long-run incremental cost (TSLRIC).  Incumbentswould be required to provide "floor" calculations for theservices "to ensure the avoidance of anticompetitive pricingpractices," the staff said.  In its retail price for eachservice, the incumbent would be required to recover "the TSLRICof all nonessential--and the imputed prices of all essential--services, facilities, components, functions or capabilitiesprovided, whether offered under a tariff or on a private-contractbasis."     Local and extended area service traffic would be terminatedon a "mutual traffic exchange" or "bill-and-keep" basis for aninterim period of 36 months, allowing carriers to terminate eachothers' traffic at no charge.  Other compensation arrangementscould be negotiated between carriers.  If carriers do not agreeon compensation for terminating calls, each carrier would berequired to file a tariff proposing a permanent compensation planwithin 24 months of the rules' effectiveness.  The staff saidcharges outlined in such tariffs should not be usage-sensitive.     Incumbent LECs and competitive carriers would be directed tonegotiate mutually agreeable interconnection points.  Eachcarrier would be responsible for its own facilities to the pointof interconnection.  If an agreement cannot be reached, the partyresponding to the request would have to notify the commission andexplain why interconnection at the requested point is impossible.     The staff also proposed that incumbent LECs make numberportability available on an interim basis using existing servicessuch as call forwarding.  Carriers would be required to fileinterim number portability tariffs within 30 days of approval ofthe rules.  The commission staff would be required to recommend apermanent solution by Jan. 31, 1997.     U S WEST Communications Co. is challenging the state'scompetition rules in court, with cases pending in the ArizonaSuperior Court (Maricopa County) and the U.S. District Court forthe District of Arizona.  The federal court has stayed the caseuntil the state court issues a decision, a U S WEST spokesmansaid.  No action has been taken in the state court.       The legal challenge encompasses the state's competitionrules in their entirety and would include the currentinterconnection rule proposal, the spokesman said.  U S WESTobjects to the lack of evidentiary hearings on competition, andit specifically opposes the bill-and-keep compensation proposal.     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., applauded the proposal,particularly the bill-and-keep compensation mechanism. "Bill-and-keep is a fair, simple, and competitively neutralarrangement that enables new local carriers to develop theirnetworks," said Mike McHale, Teleport's Vice President andGeneral Manager in Arizona.  But he emphasized that the proposalrequires U S WEST's cooperation in reaching technicalinterconnection arrangements.  "We hope U S WEST will becooperative in these negotiations," he said.       "However, its commitment to competition is questionablegiven that it has filed suit against the [commission for its]pro-competitive rules. . .In that suit, U S WEST claims it hasthe right to be the exclusive provider of service for Arizonacustomers."     Meanwhile, Electric Lightwave, Inc., has asked thecommission for authorization to provide a full range of telecomservices.  It plans to provide switched local exchange,intra-state long distance, and digital point-to-point services ata variety of speeds, competing "head-to-head" with U S WESTCommunications, Inc., said Brian D. Thomas, ELI's Director-publicpolicy.     ELI currently operates a fiber optic network providingpoint-to-point, private, high-capacity service in Phoenix, Mr.Thomas noted.  It probably would offer the new services inPhoenix initially, with other parts of the state served later, headded.  Because a state law protects independent telcos fromcompetition, ELI's application seeks authority to serve onlyareas in which U S WEST operates.  The commission is expected toact on the application in the first half of 1996, ELI said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996CLECs Say 'Phase II' of Md. Competition RulesOffer 'Favorable' Rates for Interconnection     In a decision praised immediately by competitive localexchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commissionhas established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions forcarriers planning to compete in the provision of services tobusiness end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission saidthat "an essential service such as interconnection should not bepriced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commissionare "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlinedterms for offering unbundled network elements, established aninterim local number portability method, and began a separateproceeding on universal service issues.     The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the statein 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application forpermission to provide local exchange service (TCR, May 12, 1994). In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, itestablished interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensationfor call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland tointerconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem andcentral office switching facilities.     In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantichad proposed a three-part interconnection rate structure: (1) aper-minute rate mirroring intrastate, interexchange accesscharges, minus the carrier common line charge; (2) a monthlyper-line rate designed to capture the difference between therevenues received from the per-minute rate and Bell Atlantic'scosts for building a "ubiquitous network" in the state; and (3) auniversal service component to be determined in the universalservice proceeding.     Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on theco-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnectionrates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitousnetwork" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier oflast resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all localexchange service providers be required to charge each other thesame cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued thatestablishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient andwould promote fair competition.     Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," thecommission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection ratespaid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not fullrecovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedentcertainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recoverjoint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples inexcess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," thePSC said.       It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data ontraffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specificinterconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.     The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnectionprovided at tandem switching offices, saying that suchinterconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted arate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection atBell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU forinterconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay thesame 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on theCLEC's networks.     Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previousinterim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companieshave in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnectionbut have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating callsthat originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it hadproposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would haveallowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on BellAtlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  Theflat-rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' truecost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport'sproposal, however, noting that most parties preferred anMOU-based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-ratearrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commissionsaid it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based ratesystem before reconsidering other rate schemes.     The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of BellAtlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFSand Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundledvoice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on thosetrials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business linksand services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  Thecommission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directingthe telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a ratestructure proposed by the PSC's staff.     Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be setat levels that would be less than or equal to the price ofequivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, thecommission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the pricesfor unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios betweenthe direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That willallow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of theamount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone servicerates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs tocompete, the PSC reasoned.     To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlanticoperates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATAservices bundled with local exchange services.  CLECs hadcontended that new entrants should be able to offer such servicepackages because Bell Atlantic retains significant competitiveadvantages over them.  The PSC said new market entrants mayprovide interLATA services but cannot package them with localexchange service until the interLATA line-of-business restrictionon Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were allowed to delayproviding equal access for intraLATA toll calls until BellAtlantic is required to do so.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Calif. PUC Proceeds with Local Competition Plans,Approves Applications for Operating Authority     The California Public Utilities Commission has taken severalsteps toward implementing local exchange competition in thestate.  Late last year the PUC proposed an outline for universalservice support programs that would include a fund accessible tocompetitive local exchange carriers serving high-cost areas.  Thecommission also approved 31 applications for competitive localexchange service authority and issued "interim final" rulesallowing facilities-based local exchange competition to beginJan. 1.  The rules are "largely the same" as the interim rulesproposed in July, the PUC said (TCR, Aug. 3, 1995).     The PUC submitted to the state legislature its proposal tocontinue supporting universal telephone service as competitiongrows in local exchange markets.  If the legislature adopts theproposal, the commission will finalize by June a definition ofbasic service, establish a revenue source for a high-cost subsidyfund, and identify high-cost areas.       The PUC already has proposed to use a "proxy model" as thestarting point for determining the costs of providing basic localexchange service.  It would use the "Benchmark Cost Model"submitted by MCI Telecommunications Corp., the NYNEX Corp.telephone companies, Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc., incomments filed in the FCC's docket 80-286 joint board proceedingon universal service programs (TCR, July 20, 1995).     The commission also would create a "High Cost Voucher Fund"to subsidize companies serving rural areas.  Customers in thoseareas would receive credits on their monthly bills to "keep theirrates affordable no matter which company serving their area theychoose," the commission said.  The credits would equal thedifference between the rate paid by the customer and the cost toserve that customer.  Companies would have to be willing to serveall customers in a designated area to receive the subsidy, thePUC said.      The PUC adopted "interim final rules" governing localexchange competition.  Interim rules had been proposed last July,and the commission had held hearings and solicited commentsbefore developing the current rules, said Richard Smith, anadviser to Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon.  The rules will be ineffect at least through 1996 and may become permanent as of Jan.1, 1997, he said.  Parties can petition the PUC to change therules while they remain in effect on an interim basis, Mr. Smithsaid.     The rules call for interconnection terms to be establishedthrough contracts rather than tariffs.  The PUC "generally willraise no objections" to interconnection arrangements unless theyare anticompetitive or raise other such concerns, said Mr. Smith. A list of "preferred outcomes" drafted by the PUC containsguidelines for interconnection arrangements.  Those includerecommendations on the proper number of points and locations forinterconnection and the use of one-way and two-way trunking andsignaling protocols, he added.  There would be a "disputeresolution process" to resolve interconnection problems betweencompanies.  Incumbent local exchange carriers also are prohibitedfrom "unilaterally terminating" interconnection with acompetitor, Mr. Smith said.  A "bill-and-keep" scheme will beused on an interim basis for call-termination compensation, Mr.Smith added.     The PUC also approved 31 applications filed by companiesseeking to provide competitive local exchange service inCalifornia, including AT&T Corp., Brooks Fiber Properties,Electric Lightwave, Inc., ICG Access Services, Inc., MCImetro,MFS Intelenet of California, Inc., and Teleport CommunicationsGroup, Inc.  The PUC also gave GTE California and Pacific Bellauthority to provide facilities-based local exchange andintraLATA toll services in each others' service areas beginningJan. 1.  A GTE spokesman said his company plans initially toenter Pacific Bell's service area in Los Angeles and other areascontiguous to its own service areas.      Meanwhile, a PUC administrative law judge has proposed ratesfor interim number portability in the state.  Thomas ALJ Pulsifersaid Pacific Bell should be able to charge its competitors'customers $1.88 per month, plus a one-time fee, to forward callsthrough its network.  Pacific Bell had proposed chargingcustomers $3.25 per month for remote call forwarding.  Mr.Pulsifer recommended cutting that rate "to reflect a $1.37disallowance for the avoided retail costs of marketing andcustomer service."  He recommended that GTE-California be able tocharge $3.40 monthly.      The PUC last year called for incumbent local exchangecarriers to use remote call forwarding or direct inward dialingtechnologies as interim number portability solutions while anindustry task force proposes permanent solutions.  ExistingPacific Bell and GTE tariffed rates for direct inward dialing are"reasonable" and should remain in place, the ALJ said.  Under therecommendation, customers could elect to pay either a one-timefee of $31.75 for each number forwarded or $75.50 for the firstnumber and $10 for each additional number.  The PUC is expectedto consider the proposal this month, a spokesman said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Conn. Agency Rejects SNET Cost Studies,Sets Interim Local Service Resale Rates     Saying that cost studies filed by the Southern New EnglandTelephone Co. (SNET) are "faulty," the Connecticut Department ofPublic Utility Control has proposed interim rates for SNET'sunbundled network and wholesale basic local exchange serviceofferings.  The department rejected SNET's rate proposal, whichin most cases would have set wholesale rates higher than SNET'sretail rates to end users.  It issued the draft interim rates toprevent further delay of competition, it said.  The departmentasked the telco to submit "accurate and complete" cost studiesfor use in developing permanent rates.     SNET filed tariffs last year with the DPUC proposing ratesfor unbundled loops and ports and for a wholesale local exchangeservice package that competitors could resell.  SNET proposed toprovide unbundled loops and the wholesale service package atmonthly rates that would vary according to four geographicclassifications:  "metro," urban, suburban, and rural.       In support of its proposed rates, SNET submitted a series ofcost studies.       The DPUC, however, said SNET's proposed ratesand charges were "set too high and may unduly limit competitiveparticipation by some competent and capable competitors."  Itfound "substantive deficiencies" in SNET's cost studies,including a failure to provide sufficient documentation and theuse of an improper allocation methodology for hybrid fiberoptic/coaxial cable network costs.     The proposed interim rates would vary depending on thegeographic location, as SNET had proposed.  The interim wholesalelocal exchange service rates for both business and residentialservice would range from $12.08 per month in metro areas to$16.87 in rural areas.  The current monthly rate for residentiallocal exchange service ranges from $14.53 for service in metroareas to $11.53 for rural customers.  SNET had proposed wholesalerates ranging from $15 for metro service up to as high as $26 forrural service.     For service to business customers, the current retail ratesrange from $31.13 in rural areas to $39.23 for businesses inmetro areas.  SNET had proposed wholesale rates beginning at$12.50 for metro business service and reaching $23.50 for ruralbusiness service.  Those rates would not have included the $3.50subscriber line charge that SNET is seeking to levy oncompetitive local exchange carriers.     The draft decision also included proposed interim wholesalerates for unbundled loops ranging from $10.18 per month for metroservice to $15.33 for suburban service.  SNET had proposed arange of unbundled loop rates from $12.00 in metro areas to$22.50 in rural areas.  The current retail rate for unbundledloops in all four geographic classifications is $22.55, the DPUCsaid.  It directed SNET to file a volume discount plan for itsunbundled service offerings.  The interim rates will "encouragethe development of effective competition" and "provide thenecessary incentive to SNET to refile as quickly as possible anacceptable set of costs and proposals" for permanent rates, thedepartment said.  Meanwhile, the PUC also released a draft planto place SNET under price cap regulation.  SNET requested thechange last March, citing competitive market changes in thestate.  The commission said the plan would give SNET flexibilityto compete effectively with carriers seeking to "cherry-pick" themost lucrative customers and would reward the company forreducing costs.     The plan would categorize SNET services as either"noncompetitive," "emerging competitive," or "competitive." Almost all SNET services would be presumed to be noncompetitiveinitially, the PUC said.  The only offerings consideredcompetitive at the outset would be "800" service, wide-areatelephone service, and Centrex/digital Centrex services.  Thosewere deemed competitive by state telecom legislation passed in1994 (TCR, May 12, 1994).     Prices for noncompetitive services would be banded; a priceceiling would be set either at the existing price or, if theproduct already is banded, at the existing upper limit of theband.  The price floor would be based on total-service long-runincremental costs (TSLRIC).  Basic local exchange services forresidences and businesses would be capped at current rates untilJan. 1, 1998.     SNET would be allowed downward pricing flexibility for allproducts and would be able to propose service reclassifications. Once services are classified as "emerging competitive," they alsowould be banded to provide pricing flexibility, the PUC said. The price floor for such services would be based on the TSLRIC;SNET would propose price ceilings when it requests that a servicebe reclassified as emerging competitive.  Services consideredcompetitive would be subject only to a price floor.  Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996AT&T Gets Authority To Provide Local ServiceIn Chicago; Eyes Md., Conn., Wisc. Markets      AT&T Corp. has continued its move into local exchangeservice markets, receiving authorization from the IllinoisCommerce Commission to provide local exchange service in theChicago LATA late last year.  AT&T also has applied for authorityto provide local exchange service to business and residentialcustomers in Maryland and Connecticut and said it plans to beginoffering local switched services in Wisconsin later this year.     The carrier's entry into the Illinois market may be delayed,however, if Ameritech-Illinois fails to offer reasonable"wholesale" rates for the local exchange services AT&T plans toresell, AT&T said.  The company is awaiting commission action ona request that Ameritech be required to offer wholesale ratesthat are "viable for use by resellers."  Ameritech had filedproposed local exchange service resale tariffs followingagreements with U.S. Network Corp. and MFS Communications Co.,Inc., to resell its services (TCR, Nov. 9 and Dec. 7, 1995).     The tariffs feature sliding-scale discounts of 6% forresidential service and 10% for business service--with betterrates available to resellers making certain term and volumecommitments.  AT&T has claimed that Ameritech's proposed resaletariffs would not allow it to compete effectively.  AT&T isseeking wholesale rates that are 25% to 35% below the telco'sretail rates for local exchange service.     Scott Etzler, AT&T Regional Vice President, said,"Unfortunately, most potential Ameritech competitors havediscovered that being certified to offer local service andactually providing that service to customers are two verydifferent things.  Ameritech executives seem to be saying thatthey are willing to open their local exchange monopoly to smallcompetitors, but not those that could really deliver on thepromise of local service competition."  AT&T has yet to receive a"satisfactory reply" from Ameritech since asking the telco todevelop wholesale rates more than six months ago, Mr. Etzlersaid.       The delays prompted AT&T last month to ask the Illinoiscommission to require Ameritech Corp. to offer local exchangeservices to competitors for resale "at prices and terms that willallow competitors to be successful in the marketplace."  Despitethe certification of six companies as potential competitors instate, competition in Illinois for residential markets is "nearlynonexistent," AT&T said.     Meanwhile, AT&T has asked the Maryland Public ServiceCommission for authority to provide local exchange service tobusiness and residential end users in the state.  AT&T said itinitially would resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's services buteventually would build its own network, "as market conditions andopportunities develop."  It hopes to begin offering service bymid-1996.       As expected, AT&T also asked the Connecticut Department ofPublic Utility Control for authority to offer local exchangeservice in the state.  The carrier announced plans last fall toenter the state's residential and business local exchange marketsonce the PUC established "wholesale" prices for resale of localexchange service (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The agency last month setinterim rates for the resale of Southern New England TelephoneCo.'s (SNET's) unbundled network and wholesale basic localexchange offerings (see separate story).     AT&T is "not completely satisfied" with the interim rates,however.  A company spokesman said the rates for resale of localexchange service to business are "conducive to real competition,"but the residential service rates "represent a barrier tocompetitive entry."  He stated that residential resale rates wereset "significantly above [SNET's] retail rate."       When the PUC adopted the interim rates, it directed SNET toconduct new cost studies for the development of permanent resalerates.  It also told SNET to develop a volume discount plan forresellers.  Those measurers should improve the prospects forcompetition in the state, the AT&T spokesman said.     The company also announced plans this month to compete inWisconsin's local exchange markets, pending the adoption of localexchange competition rules by that state's Public ServiceCommission.  AT&T said it hopes to enter the state's markets bythe middle of this year.  AT&T also offers local exchange serviceas part of the "Open Market Plan" in Rochester, N.Y. (TCR, March16, 1995) and has won authority to provide such service inMichigan (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Telcos Fight Ohio Competition Rules;Time Warner Seeks Rate Mediation     Telephone companies in Ohio have continued their fightagainst local exchange competition rules adopted in the statelast year (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.asked the Ohio Supreme Court late last year to overturn adecision authorizing Time Warner Communications to provide localexchange service, contending that the state legislature, not thePUC, has the authority to allow such competition.  And incomments on the proposed local competition rules submitted to thePUC by staff last year, Ameritech-Ohio told the PUC that theproposal would hurt consumers and provide unfair advantages tothe telco's competitors.     The PUC last year granted Time Warner Communications acertificate to provide local exchange service in the 37 Ohiocounties where it operates cable TV systems (TCR, Aug. 31, 1995). Cincinnati Bell and other local exchange carriers unsuccessfullyhave requested that the PUC reverse its decision to give TimeWarner telephony service authority (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).       Cincinnati Bell filed the appeal with the state SupremeCourt, saying it is the "next step" following the PUC's denial ofthat request.  State law "clearly spells out the actions whichmust be taken when policy changes [occur] that will affectconsumers," said Barbara J. Stonebraker, Senior Vice President ofCincinnati Bell.     Ameritech agreed that the proposed local competition rulesare unfair to incumbent local exchange carriers. In commentsfiled with the PUC, James C. Smith, Ameritech-Ohio VicePresident-regulatory, said the proposals would "promote theinterests of competitors and make existing telephone companiesand consumers finances [the competitors'] entry into the localphone business."     The Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, however, said itsupported the staff's recommendations.  It offered additionalproposals, suggesting that the PUC develop a universal servicesupport mechanism for carriers providing service in high-cost andlow-income areas.       The office also proposed exempting small local exchangecarriers from rules allowing local exchange competition for threeyears.  Each competitive local service provider should filetariffs for "plain old telephone service," it said.      Meanwhile, Time Warner has expressed frustration overAmeritech's intransigence in talks on interconnection issues,asking the PUC to mediate negotiations.  Time Warner said"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snagover "economic" issues.  Time Warner requested PUC mediation inits second 60-day report to the commission on the status of itsinterconnection negotiations with Ameritech and other telephonecompanies.     Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for TimeWarner, said Ameritech appears "unable or unwilling to negotiate"a reasonable resolution of the remaining issues.  In its requestfor mediation, Time Warner said, "Some [Ameritech] charges forkey services, for which there are not current substitutes, areexcessive."  Ameritech also has failed to provide "costjustifications" and has proposed some one-time charges that are"not appropriate," Time Warner added.       In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriateinsistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a mannerwhich insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remainingissues, "if Time Warner is serious."     Time Warner continued its attack on the telco this week byasking the PUC to suspend Ameritech's alternative regulationplan.  It also asked the PUC to order Ameritech to publish anotice explaining that its alternative regulation has beensuspended.  The order also should compel Ameritech to enter intoan interim interconnection agreement with Time Warner and pay thePUC's and Time Warner's legal and other expenses incurred in thedispute, Time Warner said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996Ameritech-Michigan Proposes Local Exchange Resale Rates     Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposingrates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some networkservices.  Discounts would vary for different network elementsand services and would increase with volume and term commitments,an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject toPSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.     Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting therequirements of the recently passed Michigan TelecommunicationsAct (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on localusage rates for residential services and 11% discount on localusage rates for business services.  The discount rate forintraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services wouldbe 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritechspokeswoman said.  Competitors also would be able to purchase forresale such enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, aswell as advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN(integrated services digital network) offerings.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996TRA Official Heralds Resellers' Entry into LocalMarkets, Sees Potential for Alliances with CLECs     Until now, members of the Telecommunications ResellersAssociation have been identified as either facilities-based or"switchless" resellers of interexchange services.  But thosecompanies now appear poised to bring their experience to bear onlocal exchange markets, joining facilities-based competitivelocal exchange carriers (CLECs), cable TV companies, and largeinterexchange carriers (IXCs) as potential competitors toincumbent telephone companies.  TRA recently formed a committeeto help members explore local exchange market entry, and severalCLECs have joined the association.  TRA Executive Director ErnestB. Kelly III recently spoke with TCR about the effect his group'smembers may have on growing local exchange service competition.     TCR:  Until now TRA has represented companies that resellinterexchange services--the only services really available forresale, in practical terms.  What percentage of your members areinterested in entering local exchange resale markets?     Kelly:  We've done surveys on that and found that it'svirtually 100%.  Companies that are in for the long haul. . .realize that eventually, they're going to have to have a bundledset of services.  And local telephone services are the key, thelinchpin, in taking the services they already are providing tothe next level.       [They are the key] to surviving the coming [market] changes. So our panel sessions that we do at our conferences, our localresale council that we created--these are matters of tremendousinterest within TRA.  In sum, there's a lot of interest from ourmembers in knowing how and when they can offer local services.     TCR:  Is local exchange resale fundamentally the same aslong distance resale in terms of reaching agreements withunderlying carriers?  Are experienced resellers--your members--going to have an operational edge in reselling local exchangeservices?     Kelly:  Good questions.  In theory the relationship betweenthe underlying carrier and the reseller ought to be pretty muchthe same.  In terms of what's going to happen in the real world,in the world of practical experience, it's impossible to say forsure because there's so little reselling of local services goingon right now.  We don't have any real basis on which to[identify] any kind of trend, track record, or anything else. We'll just have to see.     My guess is that there are going to be differences.  For onething, you're dealing with the question of universal service, andwe're not exactly sure how that's going to play out. . .So thereare a lot of subtle differences.  But the basic relationshipought to be pretty much the same.  Hopefully there will enoughcompetition in local [exchange markets for] certain competitorsto want to utilize the resources of resellers.       Consider that resellers, which have been successful in thelong distance market, bring to the partnership an establishedtrack record and an established customer base.  And thosecustomers are used to getting service from an alternativesupplier.  So you've knocked off a couple of the big [marketing]impediments immediately because you've got a customer base that'ssophisticated in the world of resale and apparently has beensatisfied.     It all really depends on whether the underlying carriersview this as a true partnership with resellers--which is what wewould advocate--or whether they view it as a mandatory obligationunder certain rules and regulations established by thegovernment. . .In that case, you're going to have some problems.     TCR:  That gets to my next question.  Relationships betweenAT&T Corp. and some resellers have not always been cordial. There have been disputes and sometimes litigation.  Can we expectto see a similarly rocky start to local exchange service resale?     Kelly:  Let's get back to the point I just made.  If theunderlying carriers look at the relationship as a truepartnership, I think you'll see that harmonious relationshipswill develop.  If they see it as some obligation they arerequired to perform against their wishes or against their betterjudgments, then you're going to have problems, because they won'tbe working in consort with the reseller.  You know, an underlyingcarrier has to look at a reseller as a partner, not as acompetitor. . .The ones that have done that have developed verysuccessful relationships with resellers. . .     TCR:  I guess it depends on whether you view a reseller asan alternative sales force that will generate revenues or assomebody who's going to cut into your market share.     Kelly:  In the case of AT&T [Corp.], at the time [ofdivestiture], they had virtually the entire market.  For them,I'm sure that resellers and other competitors simply representedlost market share more than anything else.  That may be at theheart of some of the problems.       The concern we have, I guess, is that the Bell companies aregoing to have some of the same feelings or concerns and will notwant to work harmoniously with resellers.     They'll service resellers, but they may not want to look atthem [as partners], which is what I'm advocating, and what ourassociation is really all about. . .On the other hand, they mayhave seen that the problems that existed with some of AT&T'sresellers are problems that can be avoided if they take a truepartnership approach.     TCR:  How necessary is local exchange competition for thedevelopment of competition, overall?  How do you counterarguments that only facilities-based competition will lead to atrue breakup of local exchange carriers' monopolies?     Kelly:  Resale is going to be absolutely critical to theinitial surge of competition because it's going to take time,money, and resources to develop competitive infrastructures. What the CAPs [competitive access providers] have out there rightnow is great but it is just a scratch on the surface.  There's along, long way to go, and it's not going to happen over- night. We know that.     On the other hand, I am one of those who believe that trueresale will flourish in the future only when we have ubiquitous,competing, facilities-based companies out there.  That's when itreally will take off.  If you look at the experience gained fromthe long distance market, AT&T initially offered resale at thebehest of the government. . .But it didn't really explode until[WilTel, Inc.,] and [Sprint Communications Co. L.P.]--Sprint inparticular--laid down fiber optic cables with an abundance ofcapacity.       That really required them, as a matter of business, to lookat alternative channels for marketing and sales.  That's wherethe kick came.  And the same thing is going to happen in localexchange markets, particularly for companies who are competingagainst the entrenched former monopolists in the LEC [localexchange carrier] community.     TCR:  You've written articles on the potential for alliancesto be formed among CLECs and resellers.  Could you outline thesynergies between those companies?  How can resellers help theCLECs or CAPs gain stronger positions in local exchange markets?     Kelly:  I'm very much interested in forging a strongrelationship between our member companies and the competitivelocal exchange carriers.  We're pleased to see that a number ofthe CAPs, including some of the bigger ones, have joined TRA andhave now taken positions of leadership within our local resalecouncil.  We think it's absolutely essential that the CAPs take alook at how they can utilize resellers.       I've described in some of our discussions here the kind ofsynergies that naturally exist.  If you're a CAP with areasonably good system. . .of fiber rings around the country, youcan begin to look at resellers as a form of marketing and sales[force] that can give you a quick shot at market share.     Resellers reach into every nook and cranny in the U.S.  Theyare more ubiquitous in terms of marketing and sales forces thanany of the CAPs are right now.  It only makes sense toinvestigate thoroughly how these dynamic, entrepreneurial groupscan work together.  And that's what we're trying to do withinTRA.  We think those synergies will only increase, and I'mbeginning to see most of the CAPs recognizing that there'spotential here.  And that's very encouraging.     TCR:  There's been a widely publicized debate over what"wholesale" rate LECs should be allowed to charge for servicesoffered for resale.  AT&T is favoring something like a 30%discount while most of the LECs are trying to hold it atsomething less than 10%.  In your view, which position is moreeconomically defensible?     Kelly:  Well, I'd rather come at that in a different way. First we want to see true cost-based approaches to ascertainingwhat the cost of basic service should be.  There are a number ofdifferent wholesale approaches that then can be taken.  In thelong distance industry, as you probably know, we have discountsof up to 30% to 50%, depending on the volume and the kind of termcommitment you're willing to make.  The difficult thing here isthe question of universal service--how it will be funded and theimpact it will have on establishing some sort of true, cost-basedapproach.     I think any number of different wholesale approaches couldwork, but we first have to get to what true cost-based pricingis.  Our initial cut on that is that [the costs] probably aregoing to be less than what the Bell companies are claiming atthis point.  If we can just tear aside the underbrush and get tothe true cost of providing local service, then we can at thatpoint begin to consider different wholesale or discount packages. That's what we're trying to accomplish.  I don't know how longit's going to take; it's going to be different in every state andregion.  We'll just have to see whether that turns out to be oneof the big fights.  My guess is that it will be.     TCR:  Has TRA taken a position--or what's your opinion--onwhat costs or overhead factors should be included by LECs incalculating wholesale rates?     Kelly:  We've made any number of filings. . .in virtuallyevery state on this issue.  Obviously we've taken positions infederal government proceedings--before the Congress, theCommission, etc.  We're trying not to pick one approach overanother.  A number of the larger interexchange carriers havesuggested some good approaches to all this. . .A few key statesare going to lead the way on this--California, New York, andIllinois come to mind. . .I think it's a little too early in theprocess to say, "This is going to work and that's not going towork."  I think flexibility right now is the best approach wecould take.     TCR:  How would resale develop under terms currentlycontained in the pending federal telecom legislation?  Morespecifically, does the measure still contain a provision thatwould hinder the ability of interexchange carriers to offerbundled packages of long distance and resold local exchangeservices?      Kelly:  Bundled and unbundled [services] are addressed inthe legislation. . .Of course, since they still haven't passedit, anything could change.  It doesn't matter if somebody says,"We're only looking at certain parts of the bill affectingbroadcasting," if the bill is not put to bed, all provisions init are probably open to mischief.  So all of this has to have abig asterisk next to it because what we've seen to date may notbe the end result.     The resale language is OK.  We wanted some stronger resalelanguage in the legislation because we knew that  resale would bethe first place where competition would really take off.  I waspleased, frankly, to see that resale has now become item numberone on the "competitive checklist."       It was always in the bill, but now it's a part of thechecklist, [meaning that] there have to be resale products--andno impediments to resale--as a condition of the LECs' gettinginto the [interLATA] long distance business.  That's good. That's very positive.     TCR:  How about the joint-marketing provision?     Kelly:  From TRA's perspective, 98% of the companies in ourassociation are going to be allowed to joint market becausethey're not at the 5% threshold.  That was devised to keep AT&T,MCI [Telecommunications Corp.] and Sprint from being able to comeout and joint market before the [Bell companies] were able tojoint market.  I don't see that prohibition applying to much ofour membership, which consists of small resellers with minimaloverall market share.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FCC Price Cap Changes Improperly SetRates 'Retroactively,' LECs Tell Court     In setting "interim" price cap rules governing localexchange carriers (LECs), the FCC "gerrymandered" the availabledata on LEC earnings to support its own conclusion thatinterstate access rates should be reduced, LECs have told afederal court.  In oral arguments before the U.S. Court ofAppeals in Washington, attorneys said the Commission failed toexplain its actions last year setting new price cap "productivityfactors" and requiring LECs to "add back" the effect of previousyears' earnings "sharing" obligations (TCR, April 13, 1995).  TheFCC also erred by making its actions apply retroactively, theyadded.     Attorneys for the FCC and AT&T Corp. countered that theagency had used its authority properly to establish rate-settingmechanisms.  They said the rule changes applied only to LEC pricecap calculations for this year onward.     Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies, et al., v. FCC(consolidated cases beginning at no. 95-1217) stemmed from theCommission's first order in the docket 94-1 LEC price capperformance review proceeding.  Finding that it had made an errorin setting the original productivity factors (3.3% and 4.3%) in1990, the Commission "reinitialized" the factors and requiredLECs to make a one-time, downward correction in their price capindices for each year they had chosen the 3.3% factor.       The Commission also established, on an "interim" basis, newproductivity factors ranging from 4.0% to 5.3%.  The FCC sincehas adopted a rulemaking notice seeking comments on the propermethodology for setting "permanent" productivity factors.     In its order, the FCC also altered the price cap rules'definition of "exogenous" costs, ruling that LECs could includein price cap calculations only those exogenous costs thatrepresent true "economic costs."  That ruling excluded exogenouscosts stemming from accounting changes to implement Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards No. 106 (post-employment benefitsor "OPEBs").       And in a separate order in docket 93-179, the Commissionordered LECs to "add back" the effects of sharing obligationsincurred in previous years when they calculate current-year ratesof return.  The add-back rule also was applied to LEC "lower-endadjustments" under the price cap rules.     During the oral argument, the judges--Laurence H. Silberman,James L. Buckley, and A. Raymond Randolph--viewed the LECs'arguments with some skepticism.  Attorney Mark L. Evans,representing the LECs on productivity factor and OPEBs issues,said his clients object to the FCC's "cooking the books"--selecting only data supporting its preconceived view.     When it initiated the docket 94-1 price cap proceeding, theCommission had pledged to weigh all available data concerning theLECs' performance under the price cap rules, he said.  But inconsidering productivity factors, it ignored data submitted bythe U.S. Telephone Association concerning the LECs' economicperformance during 1991 and 1992.  "The data didn't support theconclusion it wanted," Mr. Evans said.  So "the FCC set about togerrymander the data to fit its conclusion."     Mr. Evans said it was unreasonable for the agency not toinclude in its consideration of the interim figures all relevantdata available--including the 1991-1992 data, "which theCommission pretends doesn't exist."  He added that the FCC, whiledisregarding that data, relied in part on new data to reach theconclusion that the original productivity factors had been seterroneously in 1990.       Judge Buckley recalled the FCC's conclusion that it shouldnot use the 1991-1992 data because that data had been receivedwith ex parte comments in docket 94-1.  The agency felt it couldnot use the data without obtaining additional public comment. Mr. Evans said that rationale was spelled out only in the FCC'sbrief in the case, not in its docket 94-1 order.  LECs Say Add-Back Rule Was Adopted Improperly     Representing LECs that appealed the add-back order, Paul T.Cappuccio said the FCC "must explain the necessity for theadd-back rule in light of its statutory authority."  Those LECshad argued that the new rule made revenue-sharing similar to a"refund" ordered under rate-of-return regulation, although theCommunications Act allows refunds only if rates have been found"unlawful."  Under the price cap rules, LEC rates are not held tobe unlawful even if the companies' earnings exceed the sharingthreshold, the LECs had pointed out.     Mr. Cappuccio told the court that the FCC had failed toexplain why it implemented sharing initially without an add-backmechanism and then reversed course and adopted the add-back rule. Judge Silberman asked, "Suppose the Commission interpreted theprior sharing rule to say that it already required an add-backprocess?"  In that case, the judge added, the FCC would not haveto adopt a new rule; it could merely clarify that its existingrule required the add-back methodology.      The earnings "sharing" rule requires LECs earning above acertain threshold to share part or all of their earnings withratepayers in the form of lowered price cap indices (PCIs) in thefollowing year.       The add-back rule requires that LECs reverse the effect ofthat sharing when calculating earnings for the second year.  Asimilar rule applies to the "low-end adjustment," which allowsLECs to raise their PCIs if they have earned below a certain rateof return.     The add-back rule effectively penalizes LECs twice forearning above the sharing threshold, Mr. Cappuccio said.  Notonly must LECs incur sharing obligations, he said, but thenegative effects of those obligations are perpetuated in futureyears. FCC Had Warned of Price Cap Changes, Ingle Says     Addressing the productivity factor issue, FCC attorney JohnIngle recalled that when it implemented the price cap plan in1990, the FCC had promised to review the rules after four years. It did so partly out of concern over whether the properproductivity factors had been established, he said.  JudgeSilberman asked whether the LECs could have been allowed topresent "economic earnings" data to supplement the "accounting"rate-of-return data the agency used to calculate productivityoffsets.  Mr. Ingle said such data may have been included in the1991-1992 information submitted by USTA.     He disagreed with Mr. Evans' view that the FCC simply hadignored that data.  "I think the Commission was very receptive tomuch of the data and the methodology USTA was suggesting," hesaid.  But because the data was submitted only a few weeks beforethe order was adopted, the FCC did not have time to make certainthat the data was reliable enough to be incorporated into theorder.  It did not rule out use of the data--or USTA's proposedmethodology for deriving productivity factors--in future ordersin the proceeding, Mr. Ingle said.  The FCC simply decided thatit should seek further comment on them first.     Addressing the add-back issue, Mr. Ingle explained thatearnings sharing differs from rate refunds under rate-of-returnregulation.  Judge Silberman sought to clarify that sharing doesnot directly require LECs to reduce rates, but only to lowerPCIs.       So to the extent that LEC rates are below the price capceilings, sharing would not have any real effect on them, hesaid.  "You could go for five years without any change in dollarfigures," the judge said.  "Why isn't the Commission making thisargument?" he asked.     Representing AT&T Corp., Gene C. Schaerr argued that the FCChad the right to adopt the add-back mechanism as an "accountingfunction" that corrects "distortions" caused by the sharingrules.  He termed "voodoo accounting" the LECs' argument thatthey are somehow doubly penalized under the add-back rule.  JudgeSilberman asked, "Isn't it a fact that the Commission is mixingearnings and revenues?  Isn't that the core issue?"     Mr. Schaerr compared the LECs to a hypothetical governmentemployee who finds he has not had enough income withheld during1994 for income taxes.  The employee then convinces the IRS tosimply deduct the amount due from his paycheck during 1995. Then, when it comes time to calculate his total income for thatyear, the employee claims that the amount deducted should not beincluded as income "because he didn't actually receive the cash,"Mr. Schaerr said.     He disputed the LECs' argument that the FCC had engaged inretroactive ratemaking in altering the price cap rules.  The LECsare merely attempting to expand the range of rate-setting actionsthat courts will regard as retroactive, he said.  But JudgeSilberman countered with his own hypothetical situation. "Suppose Congress passed a tax law that says, `If you sold ahouse in the past five years, your. . .income tax rate will goup,'" he said.  Mr. Schaerr said that would be improperlyretroactive.  "But I'm following exactly your framework forretroactivity," Judge Silberman said.     Speaking to reporters after the oral argument, MaryMcDermott, Vice President-legal and regulatory affairs for USTA,said the FCC's action clearly had retroactive effects.  She notedthat the decision to implement the one-time "reinitialization" ofprice caps applied only to LECs that had chosen a 3.3%productivity factor in any of the years from 1991 to 1994.  As aresult of that reinitialization, the LECs had to reduce theiraccess charges by about $400 million--purely as a result ofchoices they had made before the FCC's order, she said.  The LECscould not have known during those years that their decisionswould lead to rate reductions, she added.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELCO COMPETITION REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996TEXAS RULES     The Texas Public Utility Commission has adopted an initialset of rules implementing telecom legislation enacted in thestate last year (TCR, March 16, 1995; April 27, 1995; and May 25,1995).

The noticemust be separate from the customer's bills and by first classmail.  Wiltel must submit within 45 days a report to the CPUCdetailing numbers of customers, volume of intrastate andinterstate calls, and names of all resellers of Wiltel servicein the state.If the company is found to have violated CPUC regulations, itcould face monetary penalties.Specifically, Wiltel has been passing on billing numbers, butfor residential customers these are usually the same as thehome number, although they often differ for business lines. Ineither case, Wiltel's California subscribers, many of themwith unlisted  numbers, do not know that their numbers arebeing disclosed on the other end of a long distance call.The problem was revealed in late 1994 when two Californiacustomers complained to the Commission.

The bill was supposed to besubmitted in December but has been delayed by the dispute overregulation (Telecom Markets, 283/1).Political negotiations are continuing in an attempt to settle the issueby the deadline of January 24, to which the government is determined toadhere.  Assuming that agreement can be reached on the fundamentalissue of which ministry to which the new regulator should report, thedetails of the agreement can be worked out later during the legislativeprocess.The first parliamentary reading of the bill is due to take place onFebruary 1 and the relevant parliamentary committee will begindiscussing it on February 7.  The bill is expected to be approved inJune.The dispute has involved a cabinet battle between post andtelecommunications minister Wolfgang Botsch (who is a member of theChristian Social Union, CSU), economics minister Gunter Rexrodt (amember of the Free Democrat Party, FDP) and minister of technology andeducation Jurgen Ruttgers (a member of the Christian Democrat Party,CDU).It appears that agreement has already been reached to splitresponsibility for telecommunications regulation, with the economicministry's Federal Cartel Office taking charge of competition issues,and another higher governmental authority taking over everything else.It now seems likely that the economics ministry will gain control ofthe new authority as well -- despite the opposition of the CSU and theCDU.This outcome reflects the fact that Rexrodt is continuing to wieldconsiderable political influence, despite the weakening position of theFDP within the coalition.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996BT, AT&T AND C&W GET SET TO FIGHT FOR THE HAND OF FININVESTBT and AT&T have emerged as rivals to Cable & Wireless Europe in a raceto set up a strategic alliance with Fininvest, the Italian conglomerateowned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.Each of the suitors is anxious to do a deal with Fininvest in order togain access to the national terrestrial broadcast network run by itsaudiovisual subsidiary Mediaset.  This network could be used as aspringboard for opportunities in both fixed and wirelesscommunications.BT is pursuing an alliance with Fininvest through Albacom, its jointventure with leading Italian bank Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (TelecomMarkets, 267/3).  Albacom aims to secure a partnership by taking asmall equity stake in Mediaset.It is thought that AT&T is also interested in a stake in Mediaset.On the other hand Cable & Wireless Europe, which is equally owned byC&W of the UK and Veba of Germany, appears to be seeking an alliancethat might not involve any equity acquisition at all.This could put C&WE at a disadvantage, since it is thought thatFininvest will favour potential partners that are prepared to take astake in Mediaset.  However, there are indications that it might bidfor a stake in Mediaset if it has to.Fininvest says that the exact size of the Mediaset stake to be soldwill depend on the partner, although it is unlikely to be large.Sources suggest that it will be in the region of about five per cent.Fininvest expects to announce its telecommunications partner in thenext couple of months, and says that a separate joint venture willprobably be established for telecommunications.Fininvest's immediate interest is value added and cellular services.It intends to join with its new partner in applying for one of thepersonal communications network (PCN) licences that the government isexpected to put out to tender later this year (Mobile Communications,181/1).  Fininvest says that the identity of the partner will be a keyfactor in determining whether or not it decides to pursue opportunitiesin basic services.Fininvest is keen to reduce its stake in Mediaset, which runs Italy'sthree main national commercial television channels controlling 43 percent of the total audience.  Such a reduction is necessary in order toreduce the political pressure on Berlusconi, who is hoping to return asprime minister after the general election which is expected to becalled soon following last week's resignation of the most recentincumbent Lamberto Dini.  Berlusconi's standing has suffered from thegeneral perception that there is a serious conflict of interest betweenhis political role and his control of so many television outlets.Fininvest has already disposed of 24 per cent of Mediaset, but saysthat it will sell another 30 per cent or so in order to take its sharedown to about 45 per cent.In October, Fininvest sold 18.5 per cent of Mediaset for around $1.1billion to a group of three foreign partners: Saudi Prince al Waleedben Talal; Leo Kirch, owner of the German-based Kirch media group; andNethold, the European pay-TV group controlled by South Africanentrepreneur Johann Rupert.  Then at the end of December Fininvest solda further 5.5 per cent of Mediaset for $230 million to a group of sixleading Italian banks.After selling a stake in Mediaset to a telecommunications partner,Fininvest plans to divest itself of another 20 per cent to 30 per cent,partly through sales to banks and institutional investors, and partlythrough a public offering.* Berlusconi, who served an eight-month term as prime minister in 1994,this week went ontrial facing corruption charges.  Berlusconi, his younger brother Paoloand four other senior Fininvest executives are accused of bribing taxofficials in order to secure favourable inspections of the books ofcompanies in the Fininvest group.  Paolo Berlusconi and SalvatoreSciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, have admitted making thepayments but claim that they were blackmailed into making them.Silvio Berlusconi is also being investigated over three otherallegations of corruption as well as for the alleged blackmail ofAntonio Di Pietro, the magistrate largely responsible for this week'scharges.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996SEVEN GROUPS IN THE RUNNING FOR STAKE IN TELECOM EIREANNThe Irish government last week finally launched its long-awaitedcontest for the sale of a stake of up to 35 per cent in state-ownedtelecommunications carrier Telecom Eireann -- a contest which involvesseven consortia composed of nine separate companies.The government kicked off the process on January 12 with thepublication of an information memorandum laying out the terms of thebid.  It indicated that it hopes to choose a winner by the end of thesummer.Michael Lowry, the minister for transport, energy and communications,said at the launch that the government plans to invest I#220 million ofthe sale proceeds in Telecom Eireann and to retain the rest itself.The government has not said how much it expects the sale to realisealtogether.  Some local observers this week predicted figures rangingfrom #400 million to #500 million.  One City banker more conservativelyestimated #350 million, having valued the whole company at #1 billion.The government has not confirmed that it will sell the full 35 per centallocation in this offering (Telecom Markets, 274/21), although this iswidely understood to be its intention.  Once the full stake has beensold, the government plans to retain a stake of between 60 per cent and65 per cent, and to offer up to five per cent to company employees.The seven rival bidders are:* the grouping of BT and US carrier MCI;* Telia of Sweden and Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN) of theNetherlands;* Bell Atlantic, the US regional Bell operating company;* AirTouch, the US cellular operator;* GTE, the US local telephone operator;* Singapore Telecom; and* Tele Danmark.The first three groups are viewed as the front runners.The BT-led group is seen as the favourite.  The involvement of MCI, inwhich BT holds a 20-per-cent stake, might help to offset politicalconcerns over the possibility of a UK company taking a major stake inone of Ireland's largest companies.  One observer said a US carriermight defuse some of the political anxieties.  MCI is also a 25-per-cent shareholder in Concert, the global corporate services jointventure with BT.  If BT wins the bid then Telecom Eireann would becomethe local distributor of Concert services.Another strong candidate is the team of Telia and KPN, which arealready partners in the Unisource alliance.  Last month a grouping ofKPN and another Unisource member, Swiss PTT Telecom, was the runner-upin the contest for a stake in Belgian carrier Belgacom (TelecomMarkets, 283/5).Two of the other bidders, Singapore Telecom and Tele Danmark, coulddecide to join forces, having teamed up successfully to win theBelgacom stake ahead of the Dutch/Swiss group.The involvement of AirTouch is surprising since, as a cellularoperator, it is hardly likely to be interested in Telecom Eireann'sfixed business.  The company is thought to have offered to buy Eircell,Telecom Eireann's mobile division, separately from the rest of thecompany.  Such a sale would be opposed by the Communications WorkersUnion, which represents the majority of Telecom Eireann workers and hassome influence on the bid.  The CWU has made clear its opposition toany deals that involve the break-up of the carrier and a consequentweakening of its power.Several other potential bidders which at one time had expressedinterest had already pulled out -- including Cable & Wireless (TelecomMarkets, 277/15) and AT&T (Telecom Markets, 259/3).How to spend the money? Lowry said last week that Telecom Eireann willuse its I#220 million share of the sale proceeds to ``restructure andstrengthen'' itself in order to meet future de-regulation of the Irishtelecommunications market.  The government is to introduce fullcompetition on January 1, 2000 -- two years later than most Europeancountries.The government wants to see a reduction in the carrier's costs andprices. It is thought that management might offer voluntary redundancyto about 2,000 of the carrier's 11,000-strong workforce after the sale. A significant rebalancing of tariffs is also likely at some point.In addition, the carrier is also expected to draw on the expertise ofits new partner in order to invest in the introduction of the sorts ofadvanced services that are already available in other countries.In particular, the government would like to:* improve the standard of telecommunications services offered tomultinational companies that are interested in setting up in Ireland;* expand the household penetration rate of telephone services;* encourage an acceleration in the rate of subscriber growth atEircell;* restructure Telecom Eireann's cable television business, Cablelink,and develop its network in order to offer broadband services and tomake its capacity available to any other interested service providers;* provide key personnel and technical support for Telecom Eireann.The government admits that the introduction of a strategic partner willprobably lead to redundancies at Telecom Eireann but argues that theeconomic benefits generated by increasing the carrier's efficiency willhelp to create new jobs in the economy as a whole.New regulator: Lowry also announced the proposed creation of anindependent regulator to take over the regulatory functions that arecurrently performed by his ministry.  The government wants to set upthe new regulator next year.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FRENCH MINISTER PROPOSES INDEPENDENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORFrench telecommunications minister Francois Fillon outlined the basicsof the new telecommunications law on January 9 at a round table meetingmarking the end of the consultation process that was initiated onOctober 13 (Telecom Markets, 279/1).Fillon proposed the creation of an independent telecommunicationsregulator along the lines of the current television regulator, theConseil superieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA).  The new regulator would haveresponsibility for applying regulations and imposing sanctions.  Thegovernment would retain responsibility for handing out licences andwould establish the main rules of the game.The minister originally suggested that his ministry should retain moreof its regulatory powers (Telecom Markets, 279/1) but was swayed by thestrong support for a more independent regulatory authority that wasdemonstrated during the consultation process.The details of the split in responsibility will not become clear untilthe draft legislation is presented to parliament, probably in March.Before that stage is reached, Fillon has to present his proposals tothe prime minister for approval.  The law is due to become law by July1.The minister also proposed the creation of a separate agency chargedwith administering the distribution of radio frequencies.In addition, Fillon suggested that France Telecom continue to provideuniversal service with new operators contributing to a fund tosubsidise this.  The universal service obligation will initially applyonly to basic telephony but this will be reviewed in five years time inorder to take into account technological progress.New competitors will be able to obtain licences in 1997.No details were given of how interconnection issues would be resolved.The telecommunications minister did not give any details of thegovernment's plans for France Telecom itself, but did say that he wouldlike to see more public discussion on France Telecom's legal status.The highly sensitive political issue of France Telecom privatisationwas one of the causes of December's public sector strikes.  Fillon saidthat prime minister Alain Juppe would make a statement on the issuebefore the end of January.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996FRANCE TELECOM JOINS INTERNETFrance Telecom will from March 15 provide access to the Internet fromanywhere in France for the price of a local call.

But he added that thisdid not entail a significant alteration in strategy, beyond a certainchange of focus.So the company will continue with the approach which Ross had alreadybegun to follow in the last few months, concentrating on corebusinesses in three areas: the UK and Europe; Asia-Pacific and HongKong; and the USA and the Caribbean.  Tensions arose between Ross andYoung partly because the latter continued to gather a disparatecollection of additional investments alongside these core areas.C&W is looking at how to rationalise some of these non-core interests.According to the same analyst: ``Investors might wonder whatinvestments like C&W's `Baltic Hub' add to the company's value.  Theyare pretty small for a company like C&W to be involved with and profitsare a long way down the line.  They are more trouble than they areworth.''  The company holds stakes in a number of ventures in theBaltic region including the Latvian telecommunications carrierLattelekom and PLD, a long-distance and international carrier in St.Petersburg.But the C&W strategy could soon change again, given that the company ishoping to appoint a new chief executive in the next few months.Monday's EGM was called in order to approve a change in the company'sarticles of association in order to allow it to appoint non-UK citizensto the positions of chief executive and executive chairman (althoughany long-term appointment is likely to involve a non-executivechairman, in order to avoid a repeat of the Young/Ross dispute).However, the UK government, which holds a golden share in C&W, isinsisting that only one of the two posts can go to a foreigner, achange which was agreed by the EGM.  Since the current short-termchairman Brian Smith is a UK citizen, this leaves the way open for anoverseas appointment as chief executive.In the short term, the change allows New Zealander Rod Olsen, C&W'sfinance director, to be formally appointed as acting chief executive (atask he was already carrying out -- Telecom Markets, 283/15).  In thelonger term, the company is thought to be looking to recruit apermanent chief from the US telecommunications or computer industries.One name that has been raised is that of Richard Callahan, formerpresident of the international operations of US regional carrier USWest.  Analysts are more sceptical about suggestions that the companymight seek to recall Duncan Lewis, who resigned as chief executive ofC&W subsidiary Mercury Communications in September (Telecom Markets,276/1).There has been some surprise at the absence of any internal candidates-- particularly Olsen, who until last November's double departure hadbeen tipped as the most likely successor to Ross, but will now be amember of the appointments committee, and Linus Cheung, the chiefexecutive of Hongkong Telecom, the most successful business in the C&Wgroup, who many thought would have a chance of the top job.C&W says that both men have issued statements saying that they do notwish to be considered for the job -- a development that manycommentators have found puzzling.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996AT&T SIGNS COLT DEAL AND GEARS UP FOR UK ROLL-OUT IN 1996The deal that AT&T signed this week for interconnection with City ofLondon Telecommunications (Colt) is the first of a number ofinitiatives that the US carrier is planning this year to increase itspresence in the UK market.The deal, which will enable AT&T to enhance its coverage in London,will be followed by a publicity event in the capital next Tuesday(January 23) which is intended to raise the profile of its SoftwareDefined Network (SDN) product -- the virtual private network servicewhich was launched last autumn.AT&T is likely to use the event, which will be attended by chairmanRobert Allen, to lay out its plans for new services to be launched inthe UK during 1996.In addition to the already offered data and VPN services (TelecomMarkets, 277/8), AT&T will explain the launch dates for its 0800freephone, UK long-distance and international simple resale (ISR)-basedinternational telephone services.But the carrier's UK strategy has so far appeared rather relaxed.  Bothits long-distance and its ISR services were originally due to havelaunched in the third quarter of last year (Telecom Markets, 277/8).In addition, the company chose last month not to bid for the radiofrequencies offered by the Department of Trade and Industry forwireless local loop services (Telecom Markets, 283/5).  Nor was itamong the bidders for the sale of long-distance carrier British RailTelecommunications (Telecom Markets, 280/1).  It has also previouslypulled out of negotiations to buy UK carriers Mercury Communicationsand Energis (Telecom Markets, 242/1).The interconnection between AT&T and Colt's two networks will enablethe former to gain access to Colt's London network.  In return, AT&Twill carry Colt's traffic on its ISR-based service, mainly to the USA.When its long-distance service is available, AT&T might also carry someof Colt's UK traffic.The agreement between the two carriers is non-exclusive.  It is onlyAT&T's third interconnection deal, following previous agreements withBT and Mercury.  Colt has agreements with nine other carriers.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996C&W OFFERS LESS TO YOUNGThe board of C&W appears set to offer Lord Young rather less than hewanted in terms of severance pay.

But it has hadto hold back because it is still calculating whether certain costsshould be excluded from the charges paid by other carriers for usingBT's network.The regulator said before Christmas that it would have to gather moreinformation on the costs incurred on such elements as BT redundancies,the running of chairman Sir Iain Vallance's office and the company'sadvertising campaigns (Telecom Markets, 283/14) which BT said should bepaid for by other carriers via its interconnection charges.These costs account for 15 per cent of the total cost ofinterconnection, in addition to the 20-per-cent reduction predicted byDon Cruickshank, director general of telecommunications in October(Telecom Markets, 279/1), when the charges were originally to have beenissued (Telecom Markets, 277/1).``Oftel has to be very careful on this,'' said one observer, althoughthe regulator is still thought keen to reduce the charges by a further15 per cent to give a 35-per-cent reduction in total.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996SERVICE PROVIDERSOftel's consultation document on the role of service providers islikely to attract opposition from telecommunications network carrierswhen it is published in the next few weeks.Carriers fear that the document will seek, in line with European Unionproposals, to establish the principle of equal access for serviceproviders, such as resellers and value-added service suppliers.Service providers would then be entitled to cost-based interconnectionrates rather than the retail rates that are currently charged for usinga carrier's network.  Such a change in their regulatory status wouldmake them much more competitive as well as reducing the revenuereceived by carriers.  ``It's a contentious issue,'' said one carrier.Oftel complained in July after publication of its policy document,Effective Competition: Framework for Action (Telecom Markets, 274/15),that few service providers had bothered to respond.  But a number,including the UK Internet access provider Pipex, have since become morevocal.The service provider document was originally to have been published inDecember (Telecom Markets, 282/1) but the welter of other proposals ledto a postponement.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996OFTEL'S FAIR TRADING PROPOSALSThe regulator last month published for consultation its controversialproposed licence amendment on anti-competitive practice (TelecomMarkets, 283/14).

If it does not, Oftelwill refer the issue to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996MERCURY'S RULES RELAXEDOftel last month proposed to remove a number of conditions fromMercury's operating licence in order to put it in a stronger positionto compete against BT and smaller rivals in the UK telecommuni-cationsmarket.  In particular, Mercury will no longer have to publish tariffs28 days in advance of when they become effective.  Instead, it willhave to publish the tariffs on the same day as their commercial launch,although other telecommunications carriers, such as Colt or MFS, do nothave to publish their tariffs at all.However, Cruickshank said that Mercury should still be defined as adominant carrier in the international-calls market where it has aconsiderable market share.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996BT'S COMPLIANCEBT is to set up a new regulatory and competition compliance departmentto ensure that it abides by its operating licences and by competitionand fair trading law.

The Keidanren, the federation of Japanese business interests,published a report on the future of NTT on January 9, but was unable togive a definitive answer because opinion was split down the middle.These developments come shortly before the appearance of the long-awaited report on NTT by the Telecommunications Council, an advisorypanel of high-level industrialists and civil servants.  The Council wasset up last April and given until the end of next month to draw upplans for the future structure and management of NTT (Telecom Markets,268/1).The report will be sent to the ministry of post and telecommunications(MPT), a long-standing champion of a break-up which shows no sign ofchanging its mind.  The MPT is due to present its proposals on NTT tothe Japanese Parliament at the end of March.Increasing competition: The arguments in favour of breaking up NTT arelargely focused on competitive issues.  NTT dominates local serviceswith a 98 per cent market share, according to the Institute forJapanese-European Technology Studies at the University of Edinburgh.It is argued that reorganising NTT's local service business into anumber of regional operating companies would encourage new entrants tothe market.  It is thought that it would be easier for new entrants tocompete against regional NTT units than against a single, monolithicNTT.It is also argued, by the powerful ministry of international trade andindustry (Miti) among others, that if NTT is allowed to continue todominate the market for local services, the development of multimediaand interactive services could be stifled.Dr Martin Fransman, director of the Institute for Japanese-EuropeanTechnology Studies, believes that there are broader issues at stake andthat break-up NTT will not in itself create more competition.  In arecent report, NTT and Japan's telecommunications industry at thecrossroads, Fransman argues that one of the most important factorseffecting future competition in Japan will be the ease and cost atwhich new entrants will be able to interconnect with NTT's network.Fransman says that breaking up NTT or any other such measure will makelittle difference unless actual access charges are transparent andbased on real costs.  If this is not the case, new entrants will not beable to calculate the returns they can expect, and so providers ofcapital might be reluctant to invest.  In addition, the governmentneeds to put in place clear and explicit procedures for negotiatinginterconnection agreements, as well as a neutral body to settle anydisputes that might arise.NTT appears to be making concessions, and in October indicated that itwas prepared to give full and equal access to its local network(Telecom Markets, 278/15).  However, the move received a lukewarmreception from analysts as NTT gave no indication as to how it wouldimplement the new regime.  Critics suggested that the real reason forthe announcement was the company's desire to ease the pressure for itsbreak-up.Fransman also favours a break-down of the strict demarcation betweeninternational and domestic long-distance services.  NTT is currentlybanned from offering international services, which are the preserve ofKokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), International Digital Communications (IDC)and International Telecom Japan (ITJ).  In turn, the threeinternational operators are banned from offering domestic long-distanceservices.  These are reserved for NTT, DDI, Teleway Japan and JapanTelecom -- although NTT has by far the largest market share with about60 per cent.Fransman notes that NTT is one of the few national carriers not allowedto offer international services.  As a result, Japan is one of the fewcountries that does not have a genuine contender in the internationaltelecommunications market, given that KDD, IDC and ITJ are allrelatively small in international terms.  Fransman argues that NTT isthe only carrier in Japan with the size and resources necessary tobecome a significant player.  But he concedes that given the time ittakes to establish such a position NTT might find itself too far behindestablished players to make much impact.Hashimoto was finance minister between 1989 and 1991.  The financeministry holds the government's 65-per-cent stake in NTT.  As a resultit is one of the strongest opponents of a break-up, other than NTTitself.  Opponents of a break-up argue that this step would result in aloss of existing economies of scale, and a weakening of research anddevelopment efforts which are said to be crucial for the development ofmultimedia services (Telecom Markets, 262/4).  In addition, if NTT issplit into a number of regional companies, it will be that much harderto induce them to work together to build a national optical-fibreinformation superhighway.Sceptics note that profits from NTT feed into the national budget, andthat the finance ministry is probably reluctant to jeopardise avaluable revenue stream by splitting up the company.The MPT position: The MPT will, in drawing up its own proposals,consider not only the recommendations from the TelecommunicationsCouncil, but also the report produced last year by the AdministrativeReform Commission, part of the prime minister's office.  This reportoutlines the most radical blueprint for restructuring NTT (TelecomMarkets, 276/6).The commission recommends that NTT's local service business should bedivided into four regional operating companies covering separate areas,and that these companies should be allowed to offer cable televisionservices (which NTT is currently unable to do).  The commission alsorecommends that NTT's domestic long-distance business is spun-off intoa separate company, which would for the first time be allowed to offerinternational services.  The three international carriers would in turnbe allowed to domestic long-distance market.However, it is unclear whether the MPT will propose such radicalmeasures.  Some analysts believe a more acceptable compromise could beadopted whereby NTT is simply split into two companies: one for long-distance services and another for local services.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996PARTNERS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO PHOENIX TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALLIANCEUS long-distance carrier Sprint said last week that it would completeits Phoenix alliance with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by theend of this month, and that it expects to launch services in the firsthalf of this year.The deal involves Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom jointly taking a20-per-cent-stake in Sprint, split equally between them, at a totalcost of between $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion.The final price will be influenced by the valuation given to SprintCellular, which is to be spun off from the rest of Sprint in the firsthalf of this year.

Itpredicts that the value of the fixed market will increase by 1.76 percent from $141.5 billion in 1995 to $154.4 billion in 2000, but thatthe size of the mobile market will rise by 25 per cent from $18.9billion to $56.8 billion in 2000.According to the report -- which covers the 15 countries of the EuropeanUnion, plus Norway and Switzerland -- the best fixed-networkopportunities will arise in Austria, France and Germany.  Thesecountries all have large markets, incumbent operators that arevulnerable to some degree and the likelihood of pro-competitiveregulatory regimes.  The report excludes Italy from this group on thegrounds that its regulatory framework is likely to be rather lessfavourable to competition.The countries with the lowest level of fixed-network opportunity,partly because of the existing degree of exploitation, are Denmark,Finland, Norway and Sweden.  The report says that in these countriesthe penetration of fixed telephony is already high and cannot increasemuch further.  Fixed-network revenues are expected to decline due tothe increasing degree of substitution by mobile-network services.  Inaddition, these countries have small markets and efficient incumbentoperators which already charge low prices.The report also believes that:* The best opportunities in the long-distance market will be inAustria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.* The best opportunities in the local-loop market will be in the UK andIreland.  Tariff rebalancing and the availability of otherinfrastructures such as cable television networks are key factors inmaking the local market more attractive to new entrants.* The best opportunities for the resale of capacity will be in France,Germany, Greece, and Ireland.  The best opportunities for resellers arein countries with low leased-line prices and high trunk prices.* The best opportunities for mobile operators will be in Belgium andSwitzerland, both of which have underdeveloped mobile markets.The report argues that the chances for the success of a newtelecommunications venture will be affected by a number of factorsincluding the regulatory environment, the strength of the incumbentoperator and the size and expected growth rate of each market.  It saysthat the regulatory environment will be a key determinant of the easeof entry for new competitors.Given that the EU is leaving it up to individual countries to interpretrules on such issues as interconnection charges, significant regulatorydifferences can be expected to arise.  Even if the EU were to choose toenforce its requirements it would take around three years to completethe process -- one year to discuss an infringement with a member stateand to notify it of proceedings, and then two years to pursue thematter through the courts.  The independence of the national regulatorand the extent of its experience will be crucial factors in determiningthe opportunities available in a particular market.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996DEUTSCHE BAHN SHORTLISTDeutsche Bahn, the German federal railway operator, last week selectedthe shortlist for the 49-per-cent stake it is offering in newsubsidiary DBKom,narrowing down the number of bids to either three or four.The remaining bidders are thought to include: Communications NetworkInternational (CNI) and AT&T; Thyssen and BellSouth; Viag; and RWE.Communications Network International (CNI) is a joint venture betweenMannesmann and Deutsche Bank which also has a cooperation deal with theUniworld alliance between AT&T and Unisource (Telecom Markets, 276/2).German steel-based conglomerate Thyssen and US regionaltelecommunications operator BellSouth established a joint venture inFebruary 1995 with a view to obtaining a full operating licence afterliberalisation (Telecom Markets, 262/15).Viag is believed to be bidding along with Thyssen and BellSouth for astake in DBKom and to be considering possibly extending therelationship.However, Viag's name has also been linked with RWE -- there are reportsthat RWE may be considering joining the InterKom alliance betweenenergy utility Viag and BT.  RWE has been looking for new partnersfollowing its withdrawal from the CNI joint venture with Mannesmann andDeutsche Bank last September and its failure to strike a deal with AT&T(Telecom Markets, 276/2).Vebacom, the telecommunications subsidiary of industrial conglomerateVeba, did not make it to the shortlist.  Vebacom is particularlydisappointed as it already has an access agreement to unused capacityon the Deutsche Bahn network (Telecom Markets, 283/2), and was biddingfor a stake in Deutsche Bahn in the hope of deepening thisrelationship.However, Vebacom this week (January 16) signed a Memorandum ofUnderstanding (MoU) with Mannesmann Eurokom, the telecommunicationsdivision of Mannesmann, to form a 50:50 joint venture company.  Thiscompany, headquartered in Hanover, is intended to establish a nationaltelecommuni-cations network to carry public switched telephony from1998 as well as other telecommunications services, cable television andbroadband services.  This might give Vebacom a second chance atobtaining a stake in DBKom.The number of potential telecommunications alliances in Germany seemsto be growing by the day, but many are unlikely to come to fruition,according to Malcolm Ross of consultants Arthur D Little.  ``Many ofthese will be dirty weekends rather than marriages,'' he says.``Whether many will result in children is doubtful''.Second phase bids are expected to be submitted for evaluation aroundApril and a final decision is expected by the end of the second quarterof this year.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996RWE LINK-UPRWE last week signed contracts with energy utilities VEW and VEAG topool their networks to offer telecommunications services.

Deutsche Telekom claims thatthis will not be possible until the end of the year at the earliest,because not enough telephone lines are yet digitalised.The political temperature was also raised by a computer error on NewYear's Day which resulted in residential customers being chargedweekday rates instead of a lower holiday tariff for domestic long-distance calls.  Deutsche Telekom has run a big advertising campaignapologising for the billing mistake and has announced that it willoffer households 30 free units as compensation.  Deutsche Telekom alsointends to offer cheaper rates than normal on the last Sunday inFebruary.The January 29 meeting of the telecommuni-cations regulatory council isexpected to consider the above issues and possibly exert extra pressureon Deutsche Telekom.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996BRUSSELS CLEARS INTERKOMThe European Commission announced last week that it had cleared theInterKom joint venture between BT and Viag.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996NYNEX RESTRUCTURE IN BID TO SHAKE `LEAST-EFFICIENT' TAGThe restructuring plan unveiled last week by Nynex CableComms, whichinvolves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900-strong workforce,follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is theleast efficient of the UK's cable operators.Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs and a saving of between #7million and #10 million a year will enable it to reach operatingcashflow breakeven by the end of this year.But the company's financial problems were underlined this week by thepublication of its operating statistics for 1995, which showed totalrevenues for the year of #85 million -- up from the 1994 figure of #41million, but still #23 million short of some analysts expectations.The restructuring involves the centralisation of much management, amove which gained a mixed reception from analysts.The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts -- whichwill be effected through a mixture of sackings, voluntary redundanciesand natural wastage -- resulted from a #25 million investment ininformation-technology systems to handle areas such as subscribermanagement and tele-sales.The axe is falling most heavily in the sales and marketing areas,reflecting a move away from door-to-door sales towards tele-sales, anapproach which Nynex regards as more efficient (it accounted for aquarter of sales in 1995).Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who hasjust taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his oldrole of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, whodrew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officerNicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New Yorkoffice to undertake a similar role.  There was only one seniorcasualty: Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block offranchises.Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industryanalysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UKoperators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs througheconomies of scale.The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing andadministration represented 132 per cent of its revenues for the ninemonths to end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 percent for TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 bythe end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 toomany.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on anexpected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get thetelevision customers we expected, but the whole industry expectedmore.''In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UKcable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- theproportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in theindustry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on thebasis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be thebest, but it is close to it.  At 30 per cent, it contrasts stronglywith TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.On the other hand, Nynex's operating statistics for 1995 show thatpenetration (the number of subscribers expressed as a percentage ofthose who could take the service because the cable passes their homes)is running at 19.8 per cent -- lower than the latest TeleWest figure of21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8 per cent.  Nynex knowsthat it must increase its sales, but suggests that the churn ratherthan the penetration figures may turn out to be the biggest contributorto long-term success.Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churnlower.  Indeed, it has recently increased its spending.  According toMearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in termsof customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we needto make it more economic.''Nynex hopes by the end of this year to reduce the cost of sales,marketing and administration to 50 per cent of its revenue-base -- thelevel it expects TeleWest to achieve.Nynex's restructuring could be seen as part of a wider trend within theindustry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general panic,but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is still notselling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small restructuringin its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate cultureresulting from the UK company turning itself last June from a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephonecompany into a public company (though major policy decisions still haveto go through the slow process of gaining US approval).The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuringrepresented the opening shots of a new management style.  It said thatit was purely a coincidence that the moves were announced during theweek of Connell's departure.As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up inthe wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turnof the year.Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-upbehaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel goodabout it.''Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a goodthing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to putmanagement resources as close to the franchises being managed aspossible.''Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even withthe changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end ofthe year.Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves.  Nynex was, after all,only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement(January 8), closing at 105p.  It fell further this week to reach anall-time low of 95p on Monday before recovering to 97p on Wednesdayafternoon after the 1995 figures were released.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996TELEWEST CHIEF QUITSTeleWest's chief operating officer Danny Bryan has left the companyabruptly.

These users will be accessing services via more than 150million subscriptions, and generating annual revenues of more than #12billion.There were estimated to be about 33.4 million Internet users worldwideat the end of 1995, on 15.3 million subscriptions.The report differentiates between two main methods of connection: 1)connection via dedicated Internet service providers (ISPs); and 2)connection via full online bulletin board services (BBS) -- anenvironment where the service provider brings together a finitecollection of information and services.The report predicts that the number of subscribers to BBS services willgrow from about 13 million at the end of 1995 to over 84 million at theend of 2002.  The annual revenues generated by these subscribes willincrease from about #667 million to more than #8 billion.The number of subscribers to dedicated ISPs, on the other hand, willgrow from around 1.7 million at the end of 1995 to over 70 million bythe end of 2002.  The annual revenues will increase from around #127million to over #4 billion.The report thus predicts that there will be 154 million onlinesubscriptions by 2002. It anticipates a duplication factor of 25 percent, so that approximately 38 million subscribers will have more thanone account.  This means that there will be 116 million separatesubscribers in 2002.The value of the UK market alone will grow from #35 million in 1995 tomore than #900 million by the turn of the century.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM MARKETS via NewsNetJanuary 18, 1996LOOT CHALLENGES BTThe London advertising daily, Loot, says it is seeking ``tens ofthousands of pounds'' compensation from BT for a fault on its lineswhich prevented potential advertisers from getting through to thepublication for 11 hours.

Unfortunately, E-mail is also easy to manipulate, and the same individuals and companies that are relying heavily on it to conduct business could be subject to a range of problems, including disruption of communications, violations of privacy or tampering with networks.     A case in point occurred on a New Jersey campus last month.     A Monmouth University junior faces federal charges after an "E-mail bomb" that crashed the school's message system was sent to the school's system on Nov. 20.     The FBI has charged Dominick LaScala, 21, with flooding the accounts of two administrators with  24,000 electronic messages and causing the uni-versity's E-mail system to go down for about five hours, Grey Dimenna, university general counsel, confirmed.      "It basically overloaded our system," said Dimenna, adding that computer messages were only delayed, not lost.      Investigators say the "bombing" may have been a simple act of retribution. Lascala's computer privileges were revoked by the two administrators on Nov. 17 after they received complaints that he was sending multiple commercial messages to inappropriate areas on the Internet, Dimenna said. He added that some of the messages sought investors in a restaurant, while others advertised a "900" pay-per-call service.     Joe LaGaipa, director of the university's computer services, who was one of the targeted administrators, said Monmouth computer specialists traced what they believe was an E-mail bomb revenge to a site in Atlanta and a remote site in Redbank, N.J., which is near the university. The computer account from which the random-text messages originated was a shared account with another student who was unaware of the bomb.     "[The trace] was basically systems operators comparing systems and notes," LaGaipa told Telecom & Network Security Review.     The FBI didn't actually take part in the initial investigation. Rather, Dimenna said, FBI officials became interested in the case after the trace when LaGaipa called the agency to ask if any crimes had been committed based on what had been discovered.     An FBI official verified that LaScala did not enter a plea at his first court hearing and was released on $10,000 bail.      His charges include a felony for using a computer used in interstate commerce to send data that would deliberately crash a system, and a misdemeanor for using a computer with reckless disregard. If convicted, LaScala could be sent to prison for a maximum of six years and receive a maximum $350,000 fine.     Dimenna said LaScala will also be disciplined under the school's conduct rules, which could result in suspension or dismissal. LaScala will first have the opportunity for a hearing at the university.     LaGaipa said the university can't really protect itself from another E-mail bomb crashing its system, even with what it learned from the November attack.     "There's no real protection ... it can happen again anywhere," he said. He added that the only protection is the knowledge by potential bombers that their E-mail bombs usually leave plenty of footprints that can lead back to them.**Ease of use means tough problems     The New Jersey case may have turned out to be rather benign; no more than an inconvenience for users of the Monmouth University E-mail system. But this and other incidents should send up a warning flag to those who rely on E-mail for important and confidential communications.     And there are a lot in that category. The Electronic Messaging Assn. estimates that there will be 70 million corporate E-mail users in the United States. The same group estimates the electronic messaging business will grow from $3.5 billion in the United States in 1994 to $62 billion in 2000.     E-mail is easy and inexpensive to use. And it can improve worker productivity by cutting down on the trips to a colleague's desk to conduct a brief exchange or eliminating the need to print out and photocopy multiple copies of memos.      But this medium creates new risks, too. Because information is so easily disseminated to a large audience, the risk of misdirecting confidential information is increased. And once you've sent an E-mail message to the wrong party, there's no chance of retrieving it.     This is exacerbated by the fact that people tend to assume files on a computer are private and are more likely to communicate a sensitive issue through E-mail than they would be over the telephone or in a memo or letter.      It is also not possible to verify the source or recipient of an E-mail message -- unless of course it is encrypted or some other security feature is added to it. It is extremely easy for hackers to gain access to networks, or for colleagues to learn each other's passwords and send or receive information under different names, or alter messages sent by others. **E-mail lingers     In addition, the law is unsettled concerning whether an employer can be held liable for illegal activities by an employee using a company-owned network. The major telecommunications bill that could be passed by Congress by the end of the year may resolve the issue. In some jurisdictions it is possible now that an employer would be held responsible if a worker downloaded pornography or other illegal material. Civil suits would be another possibility.     On a related point, E-mail can be used as evidence in a court of law, just as other documents can. Many people don't realize that, but even of those who do, few recognize that even if a file is deleted from your E-mail, it is likely still lingering on a computer backup tape somewhere else. There is even a cottage industry of sorts popping up of specialists in locating electronic mail to be used as evidence. Two of them, both located in the Seattle, Wash., area are Computer Forensics Inc. and Electronic Evidence Discovery Inc.     Another E-mail related issue that is generating a lot of attention is the expectation of privacy of the correspondents. According to Michael Corby of M Corby & Associates Inc., in most cases, "If the electronic mail ... system is used at a company, the employer owns it and is allowed to review its contents. Messages sent within the company as well as those that are sent from your terminal to another company or from another company to you can be subject to monitoring by your employer."     The 1986 Electronics Communications Privacy Act protects the privacy of messages sent over public telephone lines and online systems such as CompuServe or American Online but does not cover private, employer-owned E-mail systems.     But many people feel that absent a company statement to the contrary, the communications they make through their E-mail systems are private. And there are cases pending, particularly in California that could help clarify the law on this point.**E-mail security checklist     There are a number of key steps employers must take to secure electronic mail and protect the company or organization. These recommendations elaborate on information contained in "Manager's Guide to E-Mail Security," by San Francisco-based Computer Security Institute.     * Write a strong, enforceable policy, like the proposed policy provided elsewhere in this issue. The policy should outline the appropriate uses of E-mail, the penalties for misusing the system, the organization's intention to enforce the policy, procedures for purging E-mail files and the legal consequences of destroying E-mail evidence.     * Reserve the right to monitor. Employers generally are protected against privacy lawsuits if employees are clearly informed that the information conveyed in company-owned E-mail systems is not private.     * Implement security controls. Make sure audit trails, password controls and other security options in your E-mail software are activated.     * Investigate using encryption. Pretty Good Privacy is one popular encryption method that was discussed in detail in the August 1995 issue of Telecom & Network Security Review.     * Ensure the post office server is physically secure. The E-mail post office server should have the same level of security other network servers have. The servers should be kept where unauthorized personnel cannot get to them.     * Promote security awareness by employees. This can be done through seminars or training courses, as well as through statements in the company employee manual.     * Set up procedures for destruction and retention of archives. E-mail messages can be permanently destroyed, but generally are not. That's why every company should see that its policy for maintaining, storing and disposing of key documentation crosses over into the electronic mail arena.**E-mail users fight police intrusion     Privacy with regard to E-mail is unsettled law and, consequently, is the subject of litigation throughout the country. One related issue that is being fleshed out in the courts involves illegal or allegedly illegal material transmitted through E-mail and how law enforcement officials go about investigating such cases.      Last month Telecom & Network Security Review discussed the use of electronic mail, and in this case a bulletin board service, to set up a sting operation through which participants in an illegal cellular phone operation were arrested. Another pending case raises issues about privacy rights relating to investigations by police of electronic mail or bulletin boards.     The case concerns a small computer bulletin board in Ohio. The Cincinnati Computer Connection has operated since 1982 and has several thousand subscribers, who pay a set fee for access to the board. Subscribers have the ability to send and receive E-mail, participate in on-line discussions, use and download software, play computer games and receive periodicals. Some subscribers -- about 3% of the users, say attorneys for the BBS owner -- also use adult-oriented information and "service options."      As part of an investigation to determine whether the adult-oriented material was pornographic, the Hamilton County (Ohio) Regional Computer Crimes Task Force obtained search warrants and seized computer equipment including computer hardware, video display units, printers, software, data drives and internal or external information storage units from the BBS operator, Bob Emerson.     Now Emerson has filed a federal suit against the task force, and a separate federal suit has been filed by a group of the BBS users. The user group claims that only the 45 allegedly obscene images should have been seized.      The group's attorney, Peter Kennedy of Austin, Texas, said the police knew what they were looking for and should have seized only those files. The group wants the return of their electronic files and is alleging various monetary damage claims relating to loss of business or other correspondence because the files were confiscated. Kennedy successfully represented E-mail users in another case of seizure of communications for evidence purposes, but in that instance the defendant was the Secret Service (Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service).     Emerson, in his separate suit before the same U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Div., is seeking damages of $250,000 for the loss of subscriber revenue and the loss of computer equipment confiscated in the search. He also says in the complaint that the law enforcement officials violated his 1st and 4th Amendment rights.      The complaint says the officials conducted an over-broad search "purposefully, in bad faith, in conscious and reckless disregard of [Emerson's] federal and constitutional rights to privacy, to free speech, and to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and with the intention to intimidate [Emerson] from his continued exercise of free expression and to impose prior restraint on the transmission of presumptively protected forms of expression ... by permanently removing from circulation non-obscene adult oriented and other forms of expression."     Emerson's attorney, Laura Abrams, of the firm of Sirkin, Pinales, Mezibov & Schwartz, expects months of discovery before the case goes to trial. The user group and Emerson cases have been consolidated for purposes of discovery.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995E-mail security, privacy resources     For more information on E-mail security or privacy, readers should contact the following groups:     * Computer Security Institute, 600 Harrison St., San Francisco, Calif., 94107, 415-905-2626.     * Electronic Messaging Assn., Suite 850, 1655 North Fort Myer Dr., Arlington, Va., 22209.     * High Tech Crime Investigations Assn., P.O.

Pay-per-call or audiotex operators have been moving overseas at an increasing rate, just as pay-per-call traffic, usually of the X-rated variety, has been increasing. Favorable deals with less developed nations and evasion of U.S. pornography laws are the lures.     Robert Spangler, deputy chief of the FCC's common carrier branch, said along with the movement overseas has been the frequent advertising of pay-per-call services using a dial-around code (10XXX) of a long distance carrier. This suggests that the carriers are paying the information providers to advertise their dial-around numbers.     More recently, foreign pay-per-call services are being routed through "500" follow-me numbers or "700" conference-calling numbers.     Under the 1992 Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act, all pay-per-call services must be provided on the "900" service access code. Any carrier involved in either transmitting or billing subscribers for pay-per-call services is subject to several statutory requirements meant to ensure that consumers can prevent access to or charges for unwanted information services. Specifically, the TDDRA:     * Requires carriers to offer telephone subscribers the option of blocking access to pay-per-call services.     * Prohibits the disconnection of basic telecommunications services for failure to pay pay-per-call charges.      The statute also specifically exempts from pay-per-call status "any service the charge for which is tariffed," and services offered pursuant to a "presubscription or comparable arrangement."     Ronald Marlowe, an attorney with the Miami law firm of Cohen, Berke, Bernstein, Brodie, Kondell & Laszio, recently sought an FCC advisory opinion concerning the legality of interexchange carriers providing telecommunications services to foreign audiotex operations. The services would be transmitted using the 10XXX + international number, 1-500-NXX-XXXX or 1-700-NXX-XXXX dialing sequences. Calls would be billed to telephone subscribers at the tariffed rate as standard toll charges.      But Marlowe went further. He asked if the legality of the arrangement would be affected if:     1) the carrier remits a portion of the transport charge to the party advertising the destination number; or     2) the carrier remits a portion of the transport charge to the destination entity for providing the information.     Finally, Marlowe asked whether the circumstances described would be legal if the other IXCs were blocked from providing access to the information provider.     The FCC responded in a four-page advisory letter by John Muleta, chief of the enforcement division. But Spangler summed it up by saying the FCC thinks that "there is such a close tie between the carrier and information provider ...  that in this situation it appears the carriers were not acting as common carriers but were using an enhanced service."     Spangler added that the "payment of commissions appeared to be an attempt to evade the definition of pay-per-call service under our rules." But it would not be successful, and the information services would be required to be accessed through a "900" number. One criteria for evaluating whether a service is a pay-per-call service is whether the consumer pays the provider more than what is required to transmit the call. The fact that the IXCs would be paying a commission to the information provider for the calls would suggest the consumer was paying more, said Spangler.**No common carrier with blocking     In the letter, Muleta said that by making payments to an information provider or destination entity, the carrier would "abandon objectivity and acquire a direct interest in promoting the delivery of calls to a particular number for the provision of a particular communication." This would be true, said Muleta, regardless of the dialing sequence used to place the call. Further, Muleta said any carrier "that is involved, either directly or indirectly, in blocking access to the called number by other carriers or in determining or influencing the content of the communications delivered through its network is not, we believe, offering a common carrier service."     The letter also stated that the fact that the consumer does not directly pay the information provider does not exclude the service from the definition of pay-per-call if the payment is simply paid to the information provider by the carrier and then recovered from the consumer through the transport charge. The situation is not comparable to payments to pay telephone or other aggregators, said Muleta. "Those commissions simply compensate aggregators for their costs of making services and facilities available to the transient public for its communications needs."     The transport charge discussed in the Marlowe letter is "a sham; the consumer has, in fact, paid the carrier for transport, and the provider, albeit indirectly, for the information," Muleta wrote.**WKP seeks rehearing     At least one company interested in providing the kind of service described in Marlowe's letter -- WKP Communications Inc. -- didn't like Muleta's response and has filed with the commission a request for review. That request must be approved or denied by the five FCC commissioners.     Meanwhile, the commission has yet to issue a final rule concerning "800"/"900" fraud.      Back in August 1994 the commission proposed to curb the "800"/"900" problem by requiring that a written agreement be executed before pay-for-call services can be provided through "800" numbers.      Spangler said the commission is not likely to rule on reconsideration of the Marlowe letter as part of the "800" rulemaking. He also predicted that the "800" docket would be concluded first.**International centers come on board     Meanwhile, the FCC is making some progress in dealing with the international audiotex problem, particularly when it concerns adult services.      International audiotex operations have become a source of revenue in some undeveloped countries. When a call goes overseas the U.S. carrier pays a portion of that call to the foreign carrier.      And since the telecommunications industry in some of these poorer nations is government-owned, a dozen or so nations have been willing to pay a fee to overseas providers to get them to relocate (see box).     To address this problem the FCC in April held a roundtable discussion with industry. And, in the summer four major IXCs agreed to a "verbal arrangement"  to forgive bills for foreign pay-for-service calls where the calls are disputed by customers in the first billing cycle, said John Copes of the FCC's international division. The carriers that have verbally agreed to this are: GTE, MCI, Sprint and AT&T.     Copes said the commission also is trying to get nations involved in incoming pay-per-call services to agree not to require U.S. carriers to collect for calls that are unauthorized or are made by minors. Two of the most active countries -- the Dominican Republic and Guyana -- have agreed to comply. Copes said that discussions are continuing with other nations.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Sample E-Mail Security Policy Statement     The best way for a company to protect itself from abuse of its E-mail system by employees is to set out clear, detailed standards and make sure all workers who use the system are informed of those standards. The sample plan below is an excellent model for organizations to follow in setting out standards for employees.

The company's E-mail system has given us the ability to communicate with one another more easily and effectively. With this technology come some practices and policies concerning the use of E-mail that all company employees need to understand and follow:**Appropriate Usage:     It is expected that all company associates will use E-mail primarily for business reasons and will conduct themselves in a fashion that is consistent with the company's philosophy of treating others with respect and dignity. E-mail communication, both within the company or with other companies' E-mail systems should follow the same standards that are expected in written business communications.* Messages that are defamatory, abusive, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, or racially offensive are prohibited.* Messages that serve as advertising or solicitation are prohibited.* Chain letters (a mailing with a request to recipients to continue distribution to others) are prohibited.* The collection and/or transmission of material in violation of any federal, state or local law is prohibited.     The inappropriate use of E-mail is a violation of company policy and may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.**Ownership:     All information stored, transmitted, received, or contained in the company's E-mail system is the property of the company. It is not company policy to intentionally inspect E-mail usage. However, there may be business or legal situations that necessitate company review of E-mail messages and documents.**Privacy:     Employees should not attempt to gain access to another employee's E-mail messages without that person's express permission. However, company management reserves the right to access all E-mail files.**Confidentiality:     If there is a need for sensitive or confidential material to be sent via the E-mail system, care should be taken to route it only to those with a legitimate need to know. Any E-mail users has the capability to forward any message they receive, or to print and circulate a paper copy. In formulating and addressing sensitive E-mail messages, you should exercise the same discretion you would with any written document.If you have any questions concerning this policy, please consult your manager, or contact Corporate Information Services, or the Law Department.General DirectorDistributed Technology ServicesBack to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Data security problems touch more businesses, lead to greater awareness by top management     More than half of the 1,300 information specialists responding to a new Ernst & Young/Information Week survey reported security-related financial losses over the past 12 months.     The average security losses were in the $250,000 range. Twenty of those respondents reported their companies suffered losses exceeding $1 million.     The annual survey found that the increased use of the Internet and tools for remote access, combined with the problems of hackers, former employees and overzealous competitors, are putting network security at the center of concerns by network managers.     Inadvertent errors were the largest source of financial losses, followed by a lack of system availability. Virus attacks were experienced by 67% of the respondents, up from 59% in the 1994 survey. But just 8% of the viruses caused financial losses. And 78% of those who experienced virus attacks said the viruses were disruptive, but caused no financial loss.     The Internet appeared to be a particular concern to the 1,300 responders from a cross-section of business and industry, and for good reason. Of those using the Internet for exchanging information externally, 20% said they were the target of successful or attempted break-ins in the past year.     Forty percent of the Internet business users who responded to the survey said they are dissatisfied with Internet security. But a full 87% of them said they would use the Internet more frequently to conduct business if security were enhanced.     As the charts on this page suggest, there is an increase in how seriously top management takes data security when compared with earlier Ernst & Young/Information Week surveys. Daniel White, an Ernst & Young partner who specializes in information security, said companies seem increasingly willing to devote more resources to finding security solutions. For example, 79% of the respondents said they have at least one full-time information security person on staff, up from 75% in 1994.     But most companies surveyed admit that they don't have adequate tools or properly trained personnel to defend against information security losses, White said. Management awareness and budget constraints weren't quite the problem in 1995 that they were in 1994, according to respondents.      But frustration with a lack of tools or security solutions increased in 1995 over 1994.     White advises that "information security should be decentralized." He said that there is an increase in data exchanges among remote locations -- plants, warehouses, home or branch offices --  and the people in charge locally need to take on effective security systems.      "To assist in this effort, common guidelines for security must be developed centrally and uniformly enforced in all locations," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Former law enforcement official arrested in computer, phone fraud case     The Los Angeles Police Department's reputation has been tarnished in a number of high-profile cases recently.     Now a retired member of the LAPD is under fire for computer crimes. The retired officer and two private detectives were charged with accessing confidential information from government, private utility and private industry computer data banks and then selling the information.      Retired LAPD detective Robert Muldrew, 48, and private investigators Steven Kudler, 35, and David Westland, 28, were charged with unauthorized computer access, fraudulent telecommunications access and conspiracy. A fourth suspect, Joan Jayasinghe, an employee of GTE, was out of town when warrants were served but voluntarily surrendered to authorities upon her return to Los Angeles. She was charged with one count of computer fraud.     Muldrew allegedly accessed Department of Motor Vehicles data bases and law enforcement data bases through a detective's computer terminal at the Devonshire Division police station, although the detective has not been implicated. Kudler and Westland allegedly broke into telephone company data bases and stole billing records. They also allegedly stole credit reports and customer account records from a local bank.      L.A. County Deputy District Attorney Efrem Grail, after expressing relief that he was receiving inquiries about something other than the O.J. Simpson verdict, said the defendants were in court on Nov. 6 and that the matter, which has been continued several times, could be considered on Dec. 19, while a pre-plea report is being prepared for the defendants by the probation board. The defendants and the state are in "serious negotiations" and felony pleas are expected based on offers made by the state.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Staff Abuse of the Net/Web: A Growing Problem     When we published our two volume bookset on telephone fraud nearly two years ago, we coined the phrase "Telabuse" to describe the generally overlooked problem of insider abuse of telecom systems.      Telabuse remains a significant factor, adding well over $8 billion to user bills yearly through wasteful and inappropriate telephone use by staff. Examples include employees dialing "900" and "976" numbers on office phones, personal long distance calls from work and friends/family interacting with staff through the employer's "800" service.     The explosive growth of Internet and World Wide Web use, now easily accessed from most workplaces, is leading to a growing problem of employer abuse of the Internet/Web, akin to Telabuse. I dub the problem "Netabuse." It has rapidly become a subject of extreme concern to management and security directors.      Some recent examples reported in just the last two months:     * A diversified manufacturing concern in the Midwest announced the testing of a highly secret new product internally to its managers through E-mail. One manager then posted the message through a technical news group on the World Wide Web, accessed by all the company's competitors. The damage was immense.     * A manager of a Georgia utility walked into a conference room to find nearly a dozen young male staffers having a brown bag lunch while viewing pornography through the Internet.      * A California software concern conducted an unannounced audit of Internet usage for one day and found 28 employees had spent an average of 3.25 hours browsing for primarily personal information and entertainment. One young employee, smitten with stock speculation on high tech IPOs, had spent seven hours of his "workday" on personal investment research.     Activities of this sort are common. The problem is growing as ease of access continuously improves and exciting  choices grow exponentially.  While direct costs are minimal, the loss of productivity and time can be staggering. A small -- but growing -- number of employees is developing  what's closely akin to an "addiction" to browsing the Web to satisfy instincts or desires involving sports information, pornography, investment opportunities and developments in technical fields of purely personal interest.      Experts in the field advise me that abuse of the Net/Web and the resulting impact on productivity has now become the number two concern, after security threats through the Net from the "outside."     User management needs to address the problem. Clear, explicit policies must be formulated, distributed and enforced. Security policies and protections, which up to recently have only been asymmetrical (guarding against intrusions from the "outsiders") now must be modified to become symmetrical (guarding against outgoing -- as well as incoming -- leaks and breaches).     Users can effectively manage against Telabuse by installing "call management" software systems available at low cost, starting at less than $1,000. These systems block access to "900," "976" and other pay-call services as well as monitor for abuse and toll fraud. Well over 80% of firms with professional telecom managers have now installed such systems, which are highly effective. **Free market responds     In our entrepreneurial society, software firms respond quickly with solutions to new problems. The twin problems of Net/Web abuse and internal security leaks through the Internet from insiders (whether inadvertent or purposeful) are a very recent phenomena. But commercial solutions are already available in the marketplace. And -- just as was the case with telecom fraud -- the best systems provide symmetrical security and management, protecting against both external and internal threats.     Security experts have particularly high praise for one such system, called "Sidewinder," available since March. Produced by Secure Computing Corp. of Roseville, Minn., Sidewinder protects against external threats through the use of a firewall approach coupled with the user's choice of any combination of authorization codes, passwords, IDs and smart cards. This is a rather typical approach.     What differentiates Sidewinder from most software security offerings is that it also provides control and flexible management tools to allow the user to protect against internal abuse and security leaks. Employees with access to the system, for example, can have limited Internet privileges (e.g. E-mail only) or full access (E-mail, news groups, Web access).      Sites to which the user doesn't want access at all (e.g. pornography) are blocked. Usage is electronically monitored to ensure that the usage and security protocols set by the user's management are being followed.      The cost of a complete system is $30,000. The software alone is less.     Secure Computing Corp. will soon launch less expensive systems for smaller users. Competitors are announcing software systems that also adopt the symmetrical approach. Prices are sure to drop in the months to come.      Internet software security systems that are mainly asymmetrical (protecting only against unauthorized access by outsiders) will soon become history. As the explosive use of the Net and Web continues to grow, so will abuse, by insiders as well as outsiders.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Pick passwords carefully     Passwords are a way of life in this fast-paced, information-based business environment, but they are not without dangers.     Most business people simply can't avoid them unless they avoid PBX features such as direct inward system access, and also don't use cellular phones, voice mail systems, computers and electronic mail.     Since passwords are so important to keeping communications secure, it's worth going to the trouble of picking the right ones and administering them properly.      A large percentage of hackers will move away from your telecom system or network if they have to work beyond some of the standard entry codes. Making codes as long as possible is an important deterrent. But long codes don't guarantee security. In fact, the longer the code, the greater the likelihood that it will be written down and placed in a spot that makes it an advertisement for a break in -- on the bulletin board at an employee's desk or on a yellow post-it note beside the telephone.      Find a happy medium. A six-digit code can be cracked in less than a half hour with software that costs just a few hundred dollars. But a 20-digit code is difficult to memorize, in addition to being unpopular. Nine-to-12 digit passwords are reasonably secure, but still manageable. Group codes -- such as one code for everyone in a particular department -- should be avoided as authorization for any communication systems. If several individuals are using the same code it makes it extremely difficult for administrators to audit the system and track suspect calls.     System administrators should also be certain that codes are changed frequently, in the computer, the voice mail system and throughout the telecom system and network. Change codes every 30 to 90 days. Some systems can be designed to alert the user on a periodic basis that passwords should be changed.     An extremely important point is for telecom managers to be certain to change any default codes in the PBX, and make certain those codes are changed regularly. Hackers are very familiar with the default codes for maintenance and other ports of major telecom equipment.     Security codes should never involve sequential digits. Other codes to be avoided include:     * Common terms, words or sayings     * Telephone extension numbers     * Employee identification numbers     * Social Security numbers     * Anniversaries     * Maiden names     * First names     * Spouses' names     If at all possible, telecom managers should assign codes to employees rather than letting them determine their own access authorization codes. Codes should be randomly generated, frequently changed, and deactivated as soon as they are no longer needed.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Have you used any of these passwords?1111     2222     3333     44441234     9876     4321     12123434     1397     If you answered "yes" to any of these items you have essentially unlocked the door of your system to hackers, because these are among the most commonly used passwords for PBXs, remote access, voice mail and other entry points.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Justice official seeks computer ethic, better interstate, international coordination     The Justice Dept.'s six-member Computer Crime Unit has its hands full, and the unit's trial attorney thinks the problem "is not going to get better anytime soon."     Prosecutor Martha Stansell-Gamm says the department is seeing the age of the criminals going up. Phreakers and hackers used to be primarily teenagers, but they increasingly are now adults in their 20s and 30s. The "size of the harm is also going up," she said when recently addressing a group of data security experts at a Computer Security Institute conference in Washington.     Stansell-Gamm cited statistics from the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh that show technological intrusions have increased by 498% and the number of affected sites has increased by 702% since 1991. But she added that there are not sufficient statistics to give a true picture of the problem. "For every report of computer crime there are nearly 500 intrusions that we don't hear about," she said.     Stansell-Gamm applauded CitiBank for being up-front concerning the diversion of $10 million in illegal fund transfers by alleged computer crook Vladimir Levin. But she noted that most companies are unwilling to admit they have been hit, either because they feel it will make them look foolish or will somehow make their systems more vulnerable.     Stansell-Gamm said that the computer crime problem is more a problem of ethics than of technology. She devotes time to visiting schools and talking with young students because she recognizes a new privacy ethic has to be developed for the computer age.      "Right now we just teach how computers work, but we don't teach how they hurt." Just as kids watch adult drivers to see how they protect themselves and others, we need to teach this self-defense and respect for other on the information highway, she said.     Ascertaining the nature and scope of the computer crime problem is just one small piece of what the Computer Crime Unit does. It's other responsibilities are to:     * Coordinate multi-district, multi-agency investigations. This is an important function since attacks on technology generally involve more than one jurisdiction. Stansell-Gamm cited the case of Kevin Mitnick as a good example of this coordination. Mitnick, one of the most notorious criminal hackers in the United States, was arrested early this year in Raleigh, N.C., after a chase that began in California. Mitnick has since been transferred to Los Angeles and is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office there, Stansell-Gamm said.     Remedies to the multi-jurisdictional problem have included creation of an infrastructure to make sure all law enforcement can work together: the Computer/Telecommunications Coordinators.     * Train agents and prosecutors. The crimes the unit deals with involve highly technical telecommunications and computer issues, which in the past meant a "steep learning curve" for prosecutors, Stansell-Gamm said. Through the efforts of the Computer Crime Unit, there is now one prosecutor in each district trained in the technology and tough legal issues in this field, Stansell-Gamm said.      The Computer Crime Unit conducts training courses for prosecutors, agents, system administrators and agency lawyers. It also has published the "Federal Guidelines for Searching and Seizing Computers" to aid law enforcement.     * Develop an international response. Just as computer crimes cross state lines, they similarly are not hampered by international or geographical barriers. But nations have different views of how computer activities should be handled and some countries do not recognize computer crime as a threat. The Computer Crime Unit is trying to streamline the methods for obtaining international assistance and evidence. The procedures need to be in place ahead of time because computer crimes occur instantly and the criminals can cover their tracks and move on. Stansell-Gamm sees some progress in this area but believes that ultimately the United States will need to negotiate treaties with other nations to deal with the security threat.Back to Headline List CopyrightTELECOM & NETWORK SECURITY REVIEW via NewsNetDECEMBER 1995Selling security to upper management takes new kind of talk     Many telecom and network professionals may understand beefing up security will make a difference to the bottom line of their companies, but top officials usually don't.     And in an age of belt-tightening and downsizing, few companies are going to be interested in investments in "technical niceties."      That means that on top of all the technical and management responsibilities they must juggle, system administrators also had better hone their powers of persuasion if they want the backing to get the security resources needed to protect telecommunications and computer investments.     Studies, such as the Ernst & Young survey outlined in this issue, show company CEOs are beginning to give information security more consideration. But resources still don't match the security risks. And security professionals still have trouble helping senior management understand the need for security in their own organizations.     "Techies" often have a tough time getting the dollars they need for security measures because they don't know how to sell themselves, says Patricia Fisher, president of JANUS Software Inc., and because technical people and upper management speak different languages.     In a presentation before Computer Security Institute's recent conference in Washington, Fisher outlined the steps information specialists should follow to get the security resources they think their organizations need.      When making a presentation to upper management, the telecom or network administrator should:     * Understand your audience. Do your homework and find out as much as you can about the goals and concerns of the person you are trying to persuade. Also, if you are dealing with upper management, it will likely be a challenge to hold the attention of a CEO who has hundreds of other concerns. Practice presentation skills to keep your audience awake and engaged.     * Outline the topic and what the presentation will attempt to accomplish.     * Provide statistics that show why a policy or monetary decision is in the best interest of the business. Statistics about the scope of the security problem can be persuasive. But they are particularly so if they are tailored to the circumstances of your specific line of business.      * Alternatively, show how the security investments could provide an opportunity for your company. For example, investments in a firewall for communications over the Internet may enable your company to feel secure enough to use the World Wide Web to increase visibility, and potentially increase business.     * The meat of the presentation should be devoted to showing what needs to be done to solve a business problem. Do not get into technical discussions with high-level officials.     * Make the presentation balanced. Show the obstacles so management can see that you are "not just a technical person who wants a technical toy" but someone who has thought through the situation and is looking out for the best interest of the company.     * Suggest some realistic alternatives. That way management knows they can trust your judgement.     And Fisher's final piece of advice to security professionals who need to make a sales pitch is: "practice, practice, practice."Back to Headline List
